But I did, which was unexpected for them, I don't throw games a lot\r\n\r\nI've duo'd with a diamond and I've carried him and beat various diamond/platinum/gold bot lanes.\r\nThe thing is I'm only silver 5, I don't know who to duo with because most of them aren't very good. \r\n\r\nBut I'm looking to join a ranked team. I know you'll think it's stupid , I'm not like that, I know a lot about league, it's just everytime I carry an adc, the rest of team feeds, I try to roam, but then they pick off my adc when I specifically say can you play safe under tower? They play aggressive under tower then die and blame me.\r\n\r\nI would just like to prove myself, thanks\r\n\r\n- Jules aka skillasaurusx\r\n\r\nNo hate :)\r\nAlso please don't spam or write you will never find a team etc. It doesn't make me happy :P","replies":[{"poster":"ThatGuyIsMiitch","date":"2015-02-12T12:35:36.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey add me on League and ill talk to you","replies":[]}]}
