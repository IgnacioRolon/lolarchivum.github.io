I'm not sure which tier emote you're hoping for, but you are on the highest one already!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"AP Trist","date":"2017-11-09T01:58:07.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, i couldn't readily find information on what each tier looked like so i wasn't sure what tier my emote was and there is no name that pops up when i look at my emotes. I'm happy to know it takes into account previous hours and that i reached the final tier, thanks again!","replies":[]}]}]}
