I think staying with the direction of using minamilist UI and larger game art such as character splashes should be present in the screen like we see on current client to make it look nicer.\r\n\r\n* Player stats should be larger - feel disjointed from rest of the elements\r\n\r\n* Chatbox under IP rewarded - its too small and covers some UI flair.\r\n\r\n*  Put back the large champ splash - makes the screen less boring\r\n\r\n* The IP rewarded icon needs more information or flair surrounding it so it doesn&#039;t feel out of place.\r\n\r\nHome screen suffers from a lack of life, it just feels a little too clean or uninteresting, using the poro example on the chat window there should be more character imagery built into the UI i know the UI is just there to house your information and most of the players time should be spent in-game which is what you want but i really feel like something is lacking in the new UI similar to a games hubworld i think this needs some character to it. \r\n\r\nHope that was ok.","replies":[{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2016-05-20T12:44:53.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree the chat should be larger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zakjag","date":"2016-05-19T06:08:54.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree about the small chat box, good idea to shift it to the under IP rewarded section","replies":[]}]}
