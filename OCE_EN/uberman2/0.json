(with water particle effects instead of roses)\nW : Deadly Flourish - Nothing too fancy just a stream of water from his cane.\nE : Captive Audience - An inflatable ring with water particle effects rather rose petals. (similar to Zigg&#039;s Satchel Charge)\nR : Curtain Call - Deadly Flourish but on a larger scale.\n\nJhin&#039;s mask could be replaced with a scuba mask.\nThe poncho could be replaced with a towel.\nAs mentioned above, Whisper could be replaced with a small water pistol.\nHis recall could include Jhin making a sand castle, staring at it for a while, then destroying it (cause he likes art...and destruction)","replies":[]}
