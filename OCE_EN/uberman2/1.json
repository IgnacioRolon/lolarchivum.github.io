My original name is &quot;UBERMAN2&quot; but i&#039;ve recently been calling myself in games &quot;Phantasm&quot;. This wouldn&#039;t be a problem usually but i discovered that not only has that name been used but the account was used last 2-3 years ago. So i was just wondering if accounts were ever removed or deleted if they haven&#039;t been used for a certain period of time.","replies":[{"poster":"Professor Chaos","date":"2016-07-06T22:46:18.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914\n\nthat name has 2 years and 6 months of protection, so it won't be available until  about may 2017 if it still stays inactive","replies":[]}]}
