Riot please fix this! I am getting punished from what I feel I do not deserve, my internet was alright for awhile and then suddenly got disconnected. Also, whenever I tried my best to reconnect, they say that there is always an error in the HTTP server. I have to keep trying to the point that its almost to the end of the game or was already over. This is not an intentionally leaving the game.

We lost, and i still lost points. I understand that it may take time to properly control the whole situation, but you can't ignore the fact that there were many games lost before you noticed the issue and applied the loss prevented feature. If we could get some confirmation that those of us who lost points will be able to get them back eventually that would be appreciated.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SacredNiglet","date":"2015-02-04T05:01:54.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will those who didn't get in the window of loss prevented get our games changed to it?
