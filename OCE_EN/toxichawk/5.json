Often during updates companies will close known ports that are abused. I have not had a problem since.\n\nOnce again pls notice me senpai.\n\nUpdate: The best way to test the most likely cause is to disable your Antivirus's firewall / Windows firewall and try again. Most people never update their routers firmware","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrFr4nk77","date":"2015-09-07T00:09:47.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the photo, i cant even get onto the lol patcher, no firewalls were running, so ave no idea why it isnt working still","replies":[]},{"poster":"Discorded Vivian","date":"2015-05-16T03:55:42.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"jOKACHU","date":"2015-05-11T01:10:05.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so frustrating, especially when people will 9x report you when you don't deserve it and you will lose LP\nlost my promo ranked game because of this.\nive uploaded my oce diagnosis so hopefully you will fix this asap, disabling firewall didnt help in my case and im not running steam nor lolreplay\n\nthanks rito {{item:3070}} {{summoner:6}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"jOKACHU","date":"2015-05-11T01:09:18.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so frustrating, especially when people will 9x report you when you don't deserve it and you will lose LP\nlost my promo ranked game because of this.\nive uploaded my oce diagnosis so hopefully you will fix this asap, disabling firewall didnt help in my case and im not running steam nor lolreplay\n\nthanks rito {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenNugets","date":"2015-05-07T15:04:34.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NICE IM IN MY PROMOTION couldn't connect firewall is maybe blocking the league of legends server i did it off still not working by series :[ and i get a bann i think :[.","replies":[{"poster":"HeadSheep","date":"2015-05-09T17:43:43.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesterday I had the exact same accident , but today it worked the whole day again , until the same time as yesterday\nHope they will fix this very soon","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitty Purry","date":"2015-05-04T22:52:48.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so... i will now get deranked because of this. i can't reconnect to this stupid ranked game. thanks a bunch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kitty Purry","date":"2015-05-04T22:38:11.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i got this right now in a ranked, can't get back in. gg wp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PiRaTeKiNg3","date":"2015-04-03T18:19:08.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No updates to this issue?
