Unfortunately you may not be aware when someone has generously gifted you an awesome skin or champion, and that's not cool.\n\nWe are aware that the congratulatory messaging that should be displaying with a gift is not showing up all the time when an End of Game Gift is sent, but please be assured we are working to get this rectified as quickly as possible.\n\nIn the mean time keep being awesome summoners and showing your fellow players appreciation and we will update this thread with new information as it becomes available.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHey Guys,\nAn update to this post. End of Game Gifting is now working as intended, which means anytime you are lucky enough to receive a gift, you will be notified via  cool pop up animation.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Nightwalker9","date":"2014-12-13T07:33:55.700+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"RIOT ADD A NEW FEMALE CHAMP WITH BIG TITS","replies":[{"poster":"Past My Bed Time","date":"2014-12-13T08:17:36.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"-_-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-23T13:48:57.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still yet to be gifted.
