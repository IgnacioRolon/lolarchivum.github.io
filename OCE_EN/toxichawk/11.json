At 04:00 AEST we will begin completing the maintenance.\n\nThis is a two part effort in our continual strive to provide a stable service to you:\n1. Help identify the underlying cause of the network interruption that occurred in the early hours of 22/04/2015 AEST.\n2. Continue and complete the network maintenance that was scheduled on 22/04/2015.\n\n**Update:**\nDue to some issues we were not able to perform the maintenance has originally scheduled on 23/04/2015, this has now been updated to occur on 24/04/2015.\n\n24/04/2015 - Maintenance has been completed and all network traffic should now be returning to normal. If you are experiencing high pings please head over to http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs and follow the instructions to run some diagnostics and submit the reports to us.\n\n24/04/2015 16:00 - Thank you to everyone that has been submitting their diagnostic results to us, we have been analyzing the data that we have been receiving and completing tests on our end to try and diagnose the issue. At this stage it appears one of our Internet Providers is routing traffic in a sub optimally way for a number of players in New Zealand. We are currently reaching out to said ISP to work with their engineers to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. Again thank you to everyone that has submitted their results.\n\n24/05/2015 19:00 - We believe we may of solved the issue with players experiencing high ping. Please complete the diagnostic tool above if you are still experiencing it.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Anthraax","date":"2015-04-24T01:17:38.497+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im with spark, and am still getting high ping.

I'm with Telstra and worked hard to see if it was them, but they switched us over to another band and did other things to our account, which didn't fix the issue, so it's, as always (even though they don't want to admit it) on RIOT's end.\n\nReally, Ever since patch 4.13 in summer of 2013-14 the server hasn't been up to scratch, as confirmed by;\n\n> _Posted by: StÃ¼dmuffin \n> I work IT, so I have a decent idea about what I'm doing when it comes to troubleshooting connectivity.\n>  The problem y'all are talking about is happening to me, too, and it absolutely started when Riot had us download 4.13 -- don't worry, it's really not a problem on your end, even if you talk to a Riot support employee via support ticket and they try to tell you that it is (this has happened to me before, and it really made me want to /facepalm when I read the support ticket's response -_- ).\n_I'm reasonably certain that it all links back to the DDoS attacks Riot was sustaining back in the early months of 2014. It's disheartening to me that I haven't been able to find any public notice about how they dealt with it. My hunch is that they started to ban certain ISPs as a way to triage the problem -- it'd be a much cheaper, resource-wise, solution than, say, upgrading their own security protocols server-side.\nIf there are any Riot employees reading this thread, please: I'd love a statement about what the server team's response was in the aftermath of the DDoS attacks, and whether or not your team considers it a closed case. I'm not afraid of computer lingo in the response, and I'd wager a bunch of RP (maybe, say, the $300 worth I bought during the sale just before I started to have major connection issues, preventing me from really enjoying my purchase -- you can check my sales record against the sharp change in my login record if you want to confirm this) that a whole host of League fans also wouldn't balk at such an explanation. Rather, we'd appreciate Riot's forthrightness in addressing what appears to be an ongoing issue.\n</3_\n\nRead the whole thread (which started about the lack of server communication between WTFast and LoL clients - which is still an issue) here:\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4747542\n\nAnd notice that the IT guy didn't get any response....\n\n> If you are experiencing high pings please head over to http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs and follow the instructions to run some diagnostics and submit the reports to us.\n> \n> -ToxicHawk\n> \n\nDon't bother doing this. You get no response about what is wrong with the connection and what might be done to fix it (because RIOT can see and is embarrassed to admit it's their end) Hey RIOT, everyone knows it~!
