Ping is the time, in milliseconds, it takes for data to get to the server and back, FPS is the frames per second shown on your screen. Secondly, do you have VSync turned on? That often causes problems with FPS and may alleviate the issue if turned off. Thirdly, it may be a good idea to check your computer specs with the current minimum/recommended specs, [link here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements).
