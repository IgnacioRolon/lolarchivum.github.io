If you are getting a black screen it could be upating in the background OR your client could be having issues connecting to the servers.\nI would suggest leaving it for a little while (5 min or so) and see if the patcher then updates and refreshes.\nIf not try rebooting your computer and modem/router then try patching again.\n\nLet me know how it goes.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-04-22T00:08:10.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to reply to this 2 months later to say - yes it worked. huehuehue trolling rito dont ban plz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KingHiiiPOWER","date":"2015-02-26T04:21:44.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I uninstalled LoL and re-install LoL. \n\nAfter constantly waiting for the game to complete installation, either my PC crashes or the LoL Patcher messages me saying \"update failure\".
