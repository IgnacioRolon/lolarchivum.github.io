To give some context of the fix, we had previously moved our game servers to new hardware to assist us with getting the most stable service to you. At that time everything appeared to be correct and working fine. However as you are aware an issue arose over the last few days causing the aforementioned lag and disconnects.\r\n\r\nDuring our investigation we discovered a misconfiguration on the game servers, that could potentially lead to the increased Lag and Disconnects we have been seeing. After testing a configuration change on one game server, we were confident this could be the needle in the hay stack we were searching for. A plan was made and the fix was rolled out. The new configuration was in place and reconnects start going back to normal. For 24+ hours following the change we have seen a much more stable service and are happy with the change made.\r\n\r\nAs always we will continue to monitor the situation as players do sporadically have lag or disconnect from the game, so if you do experience lagging or disconnects please head over to our [Network Diagnostic Tool](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs) and complete all steps so we can look into possible solutions for you.\r\n\r\nTo be clear this issue is not related to the Firewall Error that some players have been experiencing. We are continuing to investigate that [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/WlGElu7g-update-firewall-error-after-champion-select).\r\n\r\nWe thank you for your patience and support during this time.\r\n\r\nSee you on the Fields of Justice.\r\n\r\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"Ephreaym","date":"2015-05-06T20:34:21.819+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have been having issues with getting the red exclaimation point saying you have been disconnected from pvp.net,it may have been caused by a problem with our service, then it says attempting to reconnect and it does after a split second but it makes it so i cant talk in chats i get random dced  or i dont get que pop up so that i  can hit accept it it quite aggrivating i cant even play the game right now because of it. please help .......","replies":[{"poster":"EragonAP","date":"2015-05-12T16:52:08.764+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.
