The servers are rarely taken offline outside of major patches like this one. So your claim is false. \n\nErrors happen, Riot fixes them. The reason we're getting Patch 5.5 one day late is because they were fixing **your** server. They could have just said \"meh %%%% them\" and not fix your server before 5.5. They didn't now, did they?\n\nI'm pretty sure their launcher isn't always broken, I barely see any complains on EU Boards about not being able to patch successfully. \n\nI don't know where they stated they'd receive compensation so I'll not speak on that.\n\nI do play on NA btw.\n\nAnd Riot is the most player-focused game company in the World.
