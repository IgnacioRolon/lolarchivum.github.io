His win rate has been far under 50%. He deserves these buffs to get him back on the line. These buffs aren’t that crazy anyway.\n\nI’m just glad WW’s getting nerfed, but I still don’t think it’s enough xDD\n\nAlso, it says it starts patching at 6AM (NZ time, 4AM AU time) and my client is now patching while saying the server is online. It says the patch will take 6 hours (battlegrounds will be unavailable for 6 hours) and it only took 3 and a half hours? That’s a huge improvement from what I remember patches being","replies":[]}]}]}
