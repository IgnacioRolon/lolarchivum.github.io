I brought my laptop and have been experiencing firewall issues. After finally getting in game i would be quite behind and at the end of the match i ended up in Low priority queue. Its been happening so much i ended up with a 10 minute timer. In my last game my computer crashed and know i have a 20 minute timer. My personal opinion on this is that it is ridiculous. And know i ask if i could get this low priority queue taken off me\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"FrostySnowman","date":"2015-01-14T05:52:41.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I happened once to me in 4 weeks and was put in a que for 20 minute sits total bs","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T01:50:39.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leavebuster only punishes people who repeatedly offend. If you're having issues connecting, then don't go into public queues, and sort out your issues in a custom game.\n\nAdditionally, if your game \"crashes\" and you immediately reconnect, it's NOT counted as a leave.","replies":[]}]}
