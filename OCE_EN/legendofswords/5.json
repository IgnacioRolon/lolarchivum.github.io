As i said most players likely don&#039;t have all the champions so it doesn&#039;t apply to them but i do think riot should replace the capsules for something else when you own all the champions. In saying this i have no idea what u would replace them with (obviously not going to give you RP) I don&#039;t know just something that feels more rewardable. Yeah i get you don&#039;t play league for the loot but still. Any suggestions for what riot could do about this would be nice to hear.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-02T14:04:24.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically the purpose is BE from the shards.
