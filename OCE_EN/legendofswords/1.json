There is 0 chance of a comeback... every game is a complete stomp either in favor or against. I dunno every game feels like your rolling the dice, if a lane wins you win the game. But if they lose you lose the game. Anyone else seeing this or? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Tisalovelybug","date":"2017-11-10T09:55:36.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comebacks are definitely possible, you just have to have the right team mates with the right mind set who are willing to listen.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/glSys\n\nI find this less often happens in ranked because it's full of babies who afk after a few \"stolen cs\" and people who have the mindset of \"well this games over lets move on to the next one faster\"\n\nMy latest game is an example of a major comeback, we were going to surrender but then we had one person say no.

As such the only way I have found to break this (slightly) is to ensure that at least 2 of your own lanes are ahead (roaming, tp ganks and jngling) this generally makes my games feel better but I still HAVE to have a bot side bias (crit scaling is a bitch) and again sometimes they just arn't on the same level (though your teams \"even\" in an MMR sense)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MTNX","date":"2017-11-09T18:48:38.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel this but mainly in lower elo (like me), as there is usually someone in the game who gets fed in lane (smurf or something) and snowballs over all the other lanes.","replies":[]}]}
