The automated system has evolved to a point where it can pretty dang accurately determine what text is negative and what isn't, especially in the extremes so it's alot less reliant on manual reviews and manual oversight to punish, but gameplay is a little trickier.\n\nIt's easy to draw the line between someone saying \"dang I'm stupid\" and \"you're f%%%ing stupid [champion]\", but intent feeding and having a bad game, or just being a bad player in general? They can both have the same scores, same items, similar paths, but one is a result of a conscious effort to feed and the other is a player not knowing what the hell is going on, or playing like they're 10/0 when they're 0/10.\n\nDon't misunderstand, I'm not saying the case you're referencing isn't intent feeding, and I'm not saying toxic gameplay doesn't get punished, simply that it takes longer to punish to avoid punishing a whole lot of innocent players along the way. It also depends on what kind of intent feeding. If they're being sneaky about it, it's obviously going to take longer, where some people (there was a post a few days ago in fact) get punished for their first offence (though usually this only occurs when a history of negative behaviour is involved).","replies":[{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-03T07:36:35.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay that's all well in good but lets be clear i never said that negative chat shouldn't be punished, or that either all things should be punished or none at all, i'm simply saying it seems that a lot more effort has gone into the chat part of the system and little has gone into the intent feeding side..  for example pretty much all summoners know things that will warrant a ban and things that wont, that seems pretty clear across the board and you're gonna get banned for them.. end of story..\n\n with intent feeding its all over the place when it comes to consistency as you mentioned above someone got punished for their first offence yes negative behavior may of been involved also but still there are people out there who run it down mid in every 8/10 games or for another example i had a brand who said he would feed when his adc died in lane and he did just that regardless if he could get out or not.. he would just run in and die also. I'm glad you agree that the system needs to improve and i think we all know riot has the resources to have more consistency when it comes to people intent feeding.. and perhaps a quicker response time on determining a punishment, i don't think a person should be able to feed (and when i say feed i don't  mean 5/8/5 i mean 0/13/2) lets say 8 games in a row then decide oh nah i'm gonna start trying now and then not be punished for those games. \n\n\nUnfortunately i have not seen any posts or any suggestions from riot that they are even looking at improving the system.\nMaybe riot is more focused on pumping out the next line of skins rather than looking at a decent player experience.

It's just not possible. \n\nTribunal was an attempt at a human solution, but players overwhelmingly punished too harshly and required *more* manual review and oversight rather than less. It only takes a quick look at boards to see people who think losing lane early and being 1/4 means you're intentionally feeding (an extreme of course).\n\nThe scale-able solution, the automated system, can identify and punish obvious behaviours (remember that what's obvious to a computer which sees stats is going to be different from what is obvious to a human who sees actions) but under a lot of circumstances it isn't confident enough to punish off one or two offences so as to prevent punishment of players just having a bad game or who are new.\n\nIt's all well and good to say \"it should be better\" but it's a lot easier said than done. The best thing you can do is to help the automated system learn properly through detailed and accurate reporting, and in the meantime send through any reports that aren't being addressed by the system to support so they can be addressed there.\n\nAlso, the Player Behaviour teams and the Skins teams are completely separate (completely different skill sets) so more skins doesn't mean less PB work and visa versa. We don't hear much here on OCE since we're a small server, and Riot historically haven't been the best with communication (though much better than some other companies we could mention), but that doesn't mean nothing is being done/worked on.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-03T09:19:37.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's all well and good But if this is literally the best possible solution right now i'd be highly surprised...  maybe the automated system should be there for normal and the tribunal for ranked.. would give a reason for people to try in what is supposed to be a competitive environment because it seems like riot have gone actual punishments for intent feeding to really nothing at all.. in my experience anyway. \n\n\nAlso that last part is a really stupid thing to say... the way you have written that it sounds like you just think i think  that their are like 40 riot employees in a room and they all work on the same thing...  like give me some credit lol... and like what? we don't hear much on OCE?  you realize we are not china? we don't only just have to look on the oce forums for information regarding league changes and updates.. (NA forums, Reddit, twitter, Facebook, ect... like i'm not sure what your role is..  like are you riots version of Sean spicer?  (hopefully u get that reference)  fair play i think riot does more than a few other companies but hopefully this issue can be addressed again the the future as its not the best experience for a player to attempt to climb the ranked ladder, spend 15 mins in champ select, only to then pretty much sit at your base because its 5/30 by 14 mins because someone decided they wanted to make you lose or just simply int because they can get away it more or less.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-04T03:02:15.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">maybe the automated system should be there for normal and the tribunal for ranked..\n\nThe point was tribunal was ineffective, and while the automated system leaves a lot to be desired, it isn't trying to falsely ban people left and right. How would you feel if you got banned for that 2/8 Jax game? You're saying you've never gone 1/10 entirely unintentionally?\n\n>in my experience anyway.\n\nPeople *do* get punished for gameplay offences, be it by manual or automated review. There are a few recent posts here of people who have been, and that's even with the understanding that someone who has intent fed, knows exactly what they did wrong and aren't anywhere near as likely to come to boards to contest or mention it.\n\nPersonally I feel the automated system could be tuned a little harsher, and that better communication and more transparency on Riot's part would be a really good idea, but that doesn't mean I think the system does nothing. Mostly I just think it's too slow.\n\n>Also that last part is a really stupid thing to say... the way you have written that it sounds like you just think i think that their are like 40 riot employees in a room\n\nThen why say something like \"Maybe riot is more focused on pumping out the next line of skins rather than looking at a decent player experience.\"? it implies that you believe more skins = less other stuff, when that just isn't the case and apparently isn't what you believe either.\n\n>we don't hear much on OCE? you realize we are not china?\n\nMuch of the specific information is found deep in comment threads on NA or EU boards, not posted on a front page somewhere that's easy to find, so unless you are frequenting NA or EU boards, which I can guarantee you the vast majority of OCE isn't, you won't find that information. I speak from experience when I say most of it won't even come up in a google search unless you get *really* specific.\n\nSo yes, there is a lot of information we miss out on here on OCE.\n\n>but hopefully this issue can be addressed again the the future\n\nIt's always being addressed to some degree, and I'd rather what we have than nothing at all, but I do agree it isn't anywhere near as effective as anyone would like.","replies":[{"poster":"LegendOfswords","date":"2018-03-07T04:27:11.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said ban people after one game did i?
