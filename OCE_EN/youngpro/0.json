I am in the OCE region, now I know this is late, i wanna get back in the game, logged in and saw my account is permanently banned, and this sucks, I know riot doesnt care about money spent, but i hope they care about time spent and my personal care for my account, I havent been toxic for and the chat logs i see for why i'm banned, never me, i stopped playing roughly 2 years ago from now, how do i know i didnt write those messages i see in the chat log? it's because it's not how i talk or text, i can tell it's a whole different person, but who? I dont know. I wish i saw this earlier, get this resolved, i hope there isnt a time frame i had to get the appeal,\r\n\r\nI'd like to also add,\r\nI know you dont owe your players anything, and there are a few cases, that are understood, but my permanent ban on my account is wrongful, yes that happened on my account, but it was not done by me, leaves me to believe i was hacked, it's been 2 years, I stopped playing just recently checked, and i'd like to try and fix this, considering it's been 2 years and most definitely a password change, i'm very positive this wont happen again, please consider a ban appeal. Thank you for your time","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-25T09:12:08.214+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So if I'm understanding the timeline correctly, 2 years ago you stopped playing the game and sometime soon after it was presumably hacked and the intruder got the account banned yes?\n\nIf the compromise occurred ~2 years ago it could complicate things, but generally speaking, accounts that are banned as a result of actions taken under compromise can be fully restored. I will say now that there are exceptions to this and I cannot make any guarantees.\n\nRegardless, you should ensure that you have changed your password, the password for the associated email address, and any accounts that share those passwords. \n\nThen, you should submit an account recovery ticket to player support: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nOnce the account is secure and ownership is verified, you can open the discussion for restoration.","replies":[{"poster":"YoungPro","date":"2020-01-25T10:10:46.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your assistance I got the blitzcrank bot response, and it tilted me, it completely ignored my entire post and said things completely unrelated to my post. it didnt help whatsoever, i said i was hacked, all that stuff, didnt matter, requested a human for it","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-25T11:34:57.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you submit specifically an account recovery ticket?
