And remember, it is ok to cry. Crying is a natural part of the grieving process and I am tearing up myself as I am typing all this out.\n\nNow let us begin...\n\nHello members of OCE Boards. It's me, The Sheriff, again. This time with some tragic heartbreaking news...\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I inform you today that yesterday evening on February the 4th of 2017, Lajneen (NA), master-tier assassin, rap enthusiast, skilled debater, was taken from us... As of yesterday they have permanently banned from posting with us on the OCE Boards.\n\nhttp://i.magaimg.net/img/1hp.gif\n\nNow I know what you're all thinking...\n> \"DEAR GOD! WHY!?!? Who dares take our beloved Lajneen (NA) from us?\"\n\nWell, it was the mods as you could have guessed. We have always had moderation problems here on the OCE Boards even after I became The Sheriff. Some rogue moderator, who clearly has a problem with Lajneen (NA) and who probably does this for free, decided that enough was enough from Lajneen (NA) and told him \"you have crossed the line for the last time\" and subsequently banned him. He had broken the \"don't be a jerk\" rule to far too many times according to the moderator even though we all know banter is a huge part of this community.\n\nLajneen (NA) was taken from us far too soon. You've all yet to see the best of what they could be, but sadly that time will only be in our memories and hearts and we pay our respects to this great poster. For not only has he been banned here on the OCE Boards, but on the NA and EU Boards as well. None of the people or mods on the other regions can handle him as well and have also struck him down with extreme prejudice. As of now. Lajneen (NA) will never be able to post on the official League of Legends forums again, and the only person to have been wrongly banned from all 3 regions, but do not cry.\n\nDown below I would like you all to share all the good memories and encounters you've all had with Lajneen (NA) for in death we should not mourn, but, instead, celebrate the lives of those taken from us. What these people said, what these people did, and what these people stood for for all of their lives despite in the face of great adversity like Lajneen (NA) has done.\n\nI have one last message from Lajneen (NA) that I have written down and will relay to you all. This will probably be the last message you ever see from Lajneen (NA) so please read carefully and pay your respects.\n\n[LISTEN TO WHILE READING]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOJ91H4mraU\n\n>My OCE underlings, I regret to inform you that I have once again been unjustly banned, this time from OCE boards. We all >new this day would come sooner or later, a player of my level of skill and sophistication is simply too much for the >incredibly corrupt, xenophobic and low elo moderators to handle. They were too weak and simply couldn't take it >anymore. I know it'll be hard to go on without me, but my guidance is no longer needed here. I truly believe that if you >guys follow my teachings, you can go from the most unskilled to the second most unskilled region in the world.\n>\n>Farewell OCE, it's been a pleasure.\n\nAmen.\nhttp://i.magaimg.net/img/1ho.png\n\nhttp://i.magaimg.net/img/1hr.png\n","replies":[]}
