Please forward this message to Keryu, Player Behavior Specialist. They're the Boards expert as well as my best friend.\n\n----\n\nHello, Keryu. The Sheriff reporting in again for some questions I need answering immediately if possible.\n\nBecause you keep me permabanned on NA Boards on the technicality that because I asked to be unbanned in the final month or two of old GD/Forum Archive, something people did in droves,  I cannot ask for my one time ban reversal that everyone is supposed to get I have been using OCE Boards, something you said was ok for me to do as the regions are different:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion\n\nSomething very mysterious has happened recently. \n\nOne day a user by the name of HeartVine received 85 notifications of post removals within a couple of hours:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/EE465v56-really-rito\n(And according to them the moderator even censored a bit of their OP.)\n\nNot only have they had a slew of their old posts removed in such a short amount of time, but it has happened to others as well like the user Niji. Though it seems HeartVine has had the most removals.\n\nLajneen, a famous poster on NA Boards and expert top tier player everyone loves, has also joined me in using OCE Boards and revealed a peculiar message they received in one of their notifications. The message heavily suggests that a moderator is using a self-made script to automate bans as well as warning messages people receive on OCE. Here is the message Lajneen received in their notifications as well as a link to their thread where they post this:\n\"Content summary is auto-generated by mod-made script. Content summary may be incomplete, broken or missing. This is not a Riot supported feature''\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/eBMvgkcs-content-summary-is-auto-generated-by-mod-made-script-content-summary-may-be-incomplete-broken-\n\nNow I'm not sure if this was just a one time test by them or not, but I know for a fact on NA Boards that this is not allowed. All reports are reviewed by actual people, all warnings are given by actual people, and all bans are given by actual people. You've told me all of this. Moderators are trained to do all of this.\n\nTo sum up my questions:\n1. Was a moderator using a script to remove posts on OCE GD?\n2. Is this automated post removal allowed by Riot?\n\nI know you work on NA and not OCE, but I feel if you, the ruler of NA Boards, and I, The Sheriff of NA GD, team-up when we can solve this mystery once and for all.\n\nThanks for reading,\nColonel J, The Sheriff\n\n----\nAlso, can you please unban Bento Box (OCE) from NA Boards? They say they were permabanned for no reason and I believe them.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/jYxFk9bk-when-you-get-permabanned-for-posting-once-on-na\n\nAs well as unban King of Mongoose (NA) from NA Boards as well. They were permabanned for asking to make Brandon, leader of JGI, to be FEK President.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion/jYxFk9bk-when-you-get-permabanned-for-posting-once-on-na\nAnd while I know no mention of JGI is allowed on NA Boards anymore, it is clear Mongoose was just joking and I know other users, like 41noob (NA), joked around about JGI, got permabanned, then got unpermabanned later. I can assure you King of Mongoose (NA) is not a member of as I know the members of JGI personally. \n\nMaybe unban me (NA) and Lajneen (EUW) too from NA Boards too if you can? We've been good boys. (Especially me.)\n","replies":[]}
