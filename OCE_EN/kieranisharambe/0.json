Lethality is a stat that ignores armor with champion physical damage based on how much you have and your champion level meaning if your ahead your gonna be blowing up squishies even faster. It recently got buffed and now champions such as {{champion:238}} and {{champion:91}} are even more broken but even champions like {{champion:21}} , {{champion:202}} , {{champion:110}} , {{champion:39}} and even {{champion:67}} are using lethality and it&#039;s sometimes more effective to put the lethality in their builds than not. You know it&#039;s broken when even {{champion:55}} buys a {{item:3147}} and succeeds. So here&#039;s the question. How does Riot balance lethality because it either feels too weak to be used or feels way too broken.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-29T02:51:44.865+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find Lethality hard to understand, and that's even after reading a bunch of stuff on it. If it's suppose to be a counter to tanky champs for fighter types then shouldn't they make it so the flat armor pen only applies against bonus armor? It just seems like a lot of it's problems stem from it being good for killing everyone not just champions who actually go tanky. And if it's base stat armor that's making tanky champs too hard to fight then that sounds like a problem with champion balance.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-07-29T05:56:45.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its meant to be so assassins can blow up squishies faster (since thats their job, its also why the 3 lethality items effects thematically suit that of an assassin) the issue is due to the order of operations with percent armor reduction and flat armor pen its possible to reduce a tanks armor to a pittance of what it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-29T09:07:40.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To help assassin's blow up squishies? That's crazy, they are the last demographic in the game that needs help to do their job. I'm typing this while waiting to respawn after a Zed erased me from existence despite being 4/13 and me using heal, flash and being under a turret and behind two team mates as an Ezreal who also threw a blink. I died before his ult even ticked off. Assassin's don't need Lethality to kill squishies, if that's why they put it in the game then yeah I hope they get around to taking it out again. Oh what am I thinking, they probably need that itemization in pro play and that's what the game revolves around..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-07-29T05:44:44.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally i dont think its lethality itself that is the issue but rather the items that use it.\n\ntake duskblade, its not broken because of the lethality on it, its broken because of the free 300 damage added to your auto, the equivalent of critting without ie at 300 ad.\n\nPeople seem to forget that armor pen was a thing before, for instance youmuus used to give 20 flat amour pen without any of the level scaling.\n\nYou would buy it and hey presto you ignore 20 armor now.\n\nDuskblade also had that effect pre lethality, giving 10 flat armor pen.\n\nin total before lethality came around you could get around 40-50 armor pen with runes and items.\n\nNow with lethality you can get around 80.\n\nBasically both before and after lethality you would be doing true damage to most champs if they didnt buy armor.\n\nNow with lethality you just have overcapped armor pen which is wasted as it doesnt go to negative pen on squishies and do more damage to tanks.\n\nInstead what makes lethality op is as i mentioned the effects on the items that grant it, duskblades free damage.\n\nEdge's banshees effect.\n\nYoumuu's speed boost.\n\nAlso the raw amount of available pen was increased with the addition of edge, which again, late/mid game against squishies doesnt change much because you were doing true damage anyway, its the damage to tanks that increased, which arguably is where the opness comes in.\n\nFor instance my typical build on kayn lately uses cleaver a last whisper item and the 3 lethality items.\n\nIt doesn't help at all for squishies but against a 300 armor target they have an effective ~70 armor after the percent reduction and lethality, which is a huge deal.\n\none way to instantly nerf lethality would just be to change the order of operations, so lethality is applied before percent reductions.\n\nTaking my cleaver whisper example\n\n300 - 24% = 228\n228 - 35% = 148.2\n148 - 80 = 68.2\n\nchange the order of operations so lethality is applied first and you get.\n\n300 - 80 = 220\n220 - 24% = 167.2\n167.2 - 35% = 108.68\n\nAn effective increase of 40 armor, almost doubling the effective armor after reductions.\n\nThis again wouldnt help squishies that much unless they are buying say ninja tabi's or achieve over 80 armor in some way, but thats supposed to be the point of lethality anyway, to be able to blow up squishies (an assassins job) but it would greatly affect the efficiency of it on tanks.\n\njust to note the math above isnt exactly accurate as it doesnt account for bonus vs base armor for the last whisper but its still very close.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-28T10:01:52.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lethality is and has always been a mess.\n\nTheir current solution is just to rework the items over and over. \nBut all that does is gives big problems more up-time, and by the time those problems are slowly nerfed, lethality is too weak again and they rinse and repeat the cycle.\n\nThe thing is, lethality is needed for bruisers to kill tanks, but unfortunately giving them access to enough lethality also gives AD assassins the ability to kill tanks, and the ability to insta-delete everyone else.\n\nI honestly can't think of a solution, I don't know if there is one.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-28T10:09:32.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove lethality completely, it was clearly a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-28T10:45:02.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
