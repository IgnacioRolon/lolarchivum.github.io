So today on the 29th of January 2015 we went to play some fun League Of Legends. We play 1 game in which a friendly League Of Legends participant fed and cried all game long. So after having a ridiculous amount of fun in that game we then waited another 20 minutes for another game. The 20 minute queue was done and we found a game so i went to click and 'accept' and i did click 'accept'. Did i get into a game? no i did not. So i waited 20 minutes for what? Well the answer is i got an extremely satisfying message that read \"Error joining game, Active game was not found.\" So now i have to wait another 20 minutes to get into a game, once again. And the previous 20 minute queue time did not count towards a strike off of the total 5 games that i have to be placed in low priority queue. Thoughts anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T11:06:54.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's blooby.\n\nI'd say to try and play games without duo-queuing to see if you don't get the same error, at least until the low priority queue is lifted.","replies":[]}]}
