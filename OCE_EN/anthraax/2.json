When you disconnect, what is happening is that your computer is no longer sending instructions to the server on what your character is doing. That is also what happens when you simply get up and leave the game, there's no specific event telling the server that you \"exited\" the game, or left it.\n\nThe only thing Riot can pick up is when the ISP contacts them and tells them that there are experiencing world-wide connection issues, though this is a bit iffy and I'm not sure that all ISPs have agreed to it/actually do it.\n\nIf you're having such severe problems concerning disconnecting then you should probably not play match-made games until it is fixed.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
