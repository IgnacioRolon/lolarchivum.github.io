Becuasse you'd expect it to only be the big ones, and I think in most peoples cases this patch they were just 'edited' to remove the changed items rather than deleted completely. If it's happening for you every patch (major or minor) then you should probably consider taking it up with support cause it shouldn't be happening. In the mean time, backing up your sets is the best bet.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-16T05:13:49.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine was the original ones and had deleted items (upgraded trinkets and such)\n\nBut yeah item sets don't get deleted by patches.","replies":[]}]}]}
