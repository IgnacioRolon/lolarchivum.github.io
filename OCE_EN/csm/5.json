And it's as much your fault if you are underage and you let your parents sign up with TPG.\n\nI could literally plug a coat-hanger in the back of my computer, wrap some aluminium foil around the tip, and get a better connection than people on a adls2+ TPG connection.\n\nIt's like going out and spending $500 on a beat up crap-box of a car, and whinging when it isn't as good as your classy friends $40,000  BMW.\n\nTL;DR, you are a cheapskate, you do not have the right to complain, please, just shut up. I bet that .gif wont even load with your third world internet.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-13T20:01:30.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have TPG and it's probably 10 times faster than yours.\n\n#KoreanUncle","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-14T03:54:04.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustTrash,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ynTdjf73,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-13T20:01:30.166+0000)\n>\n> I have TPG and it's probably 10 times faster than yours.\n> \n> #KoreanUncle\n\nNope.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-13T20:30:12.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JustTrash,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ynTdjf73,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-01-13T20:01:30.166+0000)\n>\n> I have TPG and it's probably 10 times faster than yours.\n\nyou probably live in a highly populated capital city or its outskirts too, where all the pork barreling has happened. Im lucky to get 1mb/s (1 MegaBit, not MegaByte, learn the difference if you dont know, please) of speed if no one else is on the network. Youtube automatically downgrades video quality to 144p if i dont let it buffer for 30 seconds. TPG advertises itself as a Multi-Award winner, despite lying furiously about there connection speeds outside City Centers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-14T04:02:48.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've heard dodo is the worst. i mean, it's named after a bird that was hunted to extinction because it was so dumb and easy to hunt.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-14T06:06:48.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ynTdjf73,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-14T04:02:48.429+0000)\n>\n> I've heard dodo is the worst. i mean, it's named after a bird that was hunted to extinction because it was so dumb and easy to hunt.\n\nProtip.

(in some cases less) I really don't see why anyone would go through TPG.\n\nI'll write a quick step by step guide for anyone who uses TPG, to have lag free gaming. (assuming you don't live in outback NT or WA.\n\n1) Ring TPG, break up with them, they might cry, but be a man. If for some reason you can't change ISP's skip to 3.\n2) Call another ISP, internode, dodo, nuskope are probably the best per $. bigpond is decent if you want to bundle it with other stuff like foxtel.\n3) get a decent router. and I can't stress this enough, it's important. a crappy no brand router will have compatibility issues, tp-link, d-link, netgear are fairly good brands for their price, and user friendly.\n4) Wait for it all to get set up and what not.\n5) Access your routers setting page. (it's usually on a sticker underneath, 10.1.1.1 or something similar.) check if it has it's own firewall make exceptions for lolclient.exe or find OCE servers IPs and add them.\n6) Add exceptions to your own firewall, and antivirus software.\n\nPretty simple stuff. Feel free to copy/paste this in any thread where someone complains about TPG. They do not deserve paying customers.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-13T20:25:41.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Batchy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ynTdjf73,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-13T12:03:45.057+0000)\n>\n> 2) Call another ISP, internode, dodo, nuskope are probably the best per $. bigpond is decent if you want to bundle it with other stuff like foxtel.\n\n> 2) Call another ISP, internode, dodo, nuskope are probably the best per $.\n\n>internode, dodo, nuskope \n\n>internode, dodo\n\n>dodo\n\nISHYGDDT","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-13T11:45:19.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use tpg and it works completely fine for me, i never complain. lel\n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-13T11:54:02.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are the one percent.","replies":[]}]}]}
