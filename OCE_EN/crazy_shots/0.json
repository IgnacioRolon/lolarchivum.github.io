Like dude its not like im being auto filled (support) with fun/good players that know what to do i'm quite literally auto filled into tragic insecure players to say the least.\r\n\r\nOnce again totally for autofill - Completely against autofilled every 2-3 games.","replies":[{"poster":"Arrowhead","date":"2018-11-28T22:36:39.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get how people who are leveling accounts don't realise that they are going to be playing with and against people their level, as if there are no noobs left in league of legends? Sure some people might be smurfing but if you're pre level 30 then get used to having those games where you either carry or lose horribly. Quit complaining. League isn't going to realise that you have played before on another account either, it's not like you will get any special attention when queuing either, everyone will go through it so get used to it and don't complain about bad teammates if you're pre 30 playing normal games.","replies":[{"poster":"Crazy ShOtS","date":"2019-03-09T02:42:53.569+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"imagine replying to what im asking instead of being a weirdo","replies":[]}]}]}
