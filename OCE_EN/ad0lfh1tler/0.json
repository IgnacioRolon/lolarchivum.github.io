Went to gank bot in a fairly even lane; attempted to Q behind enemy support and on top of enemy adc to catch them both out but was stopped by a Q bug that made Aatrox rise for about 5 seconds before landing the Q. This resulted in the enemy adc to AA me (was not untargetable), kill me and then give her the resets to kill both my support and adc, effectively enabling the enemy bot lane to snowball and hard carry their team to victory.\r\nAs seen by the link this bug has been noticed by other users and for me to experience it in my 1st ranked game since aatrox was changed is not a good sign. \r\nHopefully this post gets enough attention that Riot will fix this bug.
