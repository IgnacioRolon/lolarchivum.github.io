And additionally the players who suffered because one of their team mates was afk, should have half the LP loss. Like this the players who go afk to troll wont get the satisfaction of &quot;I lose and you lose too&quot;. They would be losing much more and their team mates much less.\r\n\r\nThis would be hard on people who just had to go somewhere during a game because of other commitments, or were just having a bad internet day and just DC&#039;ed. But what i do is before every game i check if i need to be some where or if someone would need me. If someone might need me then i just dont start playing. And also before i start my first game of the day i always start off with a custom game just to check if my internet is working well. Because just by being AFK i can ruin a game or even a day for 4 or even 9 other players. \r\n\r\nSo i think no matter what the reason for AFK; troll or internet, you should be punished more than your team mates, and they should be punished less. And bans might start from 3 or 4th AFK game or whatever, but greater LP loss should be there from the first game. \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n1. Double LP loss for player who is AFK\r\n2. Half LP loss/No tier demotion for other team mates of AFKer team\r\n3. If person is AFK for e.g 15 min in game then comes back, and team wins, consider it a normal win. If team loses then he/she should get double LP loss and rest of the team half\r\n4. Rest of the team unaffected\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about this","replies":[{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2015-11-11T15:50:24.717+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a horrible idea. they already have the afk/leaverbuster for people who repeatedly do this, but punishing people from the first DC just doesn't seem appropriate. not to mention sometimes things come up that can't be forseen. maybe the internet goes down, they lost power, some emergency comes up, none of these things can be predicted and being punished for this is unreasonable.\n\nIf you think (or know) someone in your game left on purpose, report them. Riot's report system is getting better all the time, and if the report is warrented it will lead to some form of punishment eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Deathscar","date":"2015-11-12T05:40:52.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wont be from first DC, like if you DC for 3minutes for 4 minutes it doesn't count.
