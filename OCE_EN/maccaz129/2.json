There is petition with a stunning amount of supporters which i have put in the links section. I would love for this skin to be re released and I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not the only one this this position. This skin was labeled &quot;Limited&quot;, meaning there is no way known it will return, but many other skins labeled &quot;Limited&quot; have come back. The skin was also available at 2014 worlds for those who attended, which means that they kind have already returned it. Not so limited huh. The next CS skins, Thresh was labeled legacy as well. Why? Now I&#039;m guessing that they&#039;re so reluctant to re release it is because of the people who already own it, especially the people who payed $500 for it on eBay. They have all ready released limited skins and given compensation, why can&#039;t they do it again, what makes this skin so special? And they&#039;ve canceled all skin codes to prevent these third party transactions. They didn&#039;t care about the people who bought them back then why should they care about them now? If you agree with me please support the petition, and if not, feel free to debate with me, just make sure you&#039;re not abusive while doing so. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nytronix","date":"2015-09-16T06:45:51.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope it comes bck","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maccaz129","date":"2015-07-14T07:59:56.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you for your help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-07-13T08:05:03.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i posted something like this about 2 years ago. a rioter (cant remember his name) said it will, if at all, be released in a bundle and not available to purchase by itself at the end of this year, 2015 or next year when they can have 5 championship skins (currently 4 if included the ahri skin for the beginning of the season).","replies":[]}]}
