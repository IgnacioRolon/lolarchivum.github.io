So if you want a huge aoe stun, it doesn&#039;t stun for as long as if you precisely catch a single champion between the two blades. This also just stops people trying to get the largest stun possible all the time.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think. :) \r\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-04-14T08:14:12.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah riot thinks too small for that","replies":[]}]}
