I know you guys care about your players, and you've actually upset me with what you've done with this event. I love your game, I've been playing it for years.\n\nBeing from OCE, I mostly play Blind Pick. Climbing the Ranked Flex or Ranked Solo ladders is too much effort, and I'm happy just playing League casually and watching pros (like my boy Carbon) decimate their enemies in the OPL or LCS. However, this new event has made Blind Pick actively unpleasant.\n\nEvery game, I have either a Riven or a Yasuo on my team, trying to complete the various missions that they've been given. Usually, they're using the new skins, as well, and even if they don't have a mission to 'win' as Riven or Yasuo, specifically, they have another mission goal that's encouraging them to put their 'carry pants' on.\n\nAs a result, you have players who play a lot of Riven and Yasuo insisting that they get to play top no matter what, flaming anyone who feeds, and continuously being aggressive and refusing to work with their team. They do this to try and complete the mission and unlock whatever content they want, but this is in a queue that's usually pretty casual. Side-note: I'm pretty happy with my Bronze status, but I also have to deal with players smurfing or getting into the lower ELO queues to try and complete these missions more easily, and there's nothing more unsatisfying than playing against a Yas who's obviously Diamond+ and has tanked his ELO to play against us.\n\nI don't know about other regions, but Blind Pick in OCE is pretty chill and relaxed; people like to meme and shit, joke around, and don't really get angry. Sure, you'll get the occasional ass, but it's nothing pervasive. Now, it's horrendous.\n\nBy releasing skins for two champions whose players are already notorious for being toxic and behaving poorly, Riot's encouraged them to play more But by adding a set of 'achievements' that they need to accomplish, on top of that, they've encouraged those players to put themselves ahead of their teammates.\n\nThe end result leaves me frustrated, upset, and not wanting to play League at all. I know League has a reputation for being toxic (it's not as bad as they say) and that there's a report function, but this is continuous. Muting my entire team to avoid the shit that'll be slung in chat doesn't help, either, because you'll still see a Riven feed due to losing lane, or another player go AFK because nobody wanted to play ADC. I can report them, but that doesn't help me when I have to deal with this every game.\n\nSo, all in all - I'm not expecting Riot to stop or cancel this event, but I'd like to see them learn from some of the mistakes they've made with it and not repeat them. You've really made playing League a negative experience. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-06-21T10:45:47.286+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me, i see this as a great opportunity to report verbal abuse players and to clear out the toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2017-06-21T05:38:30.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i just think its legit filthy that they made the event pay to play","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2017-06-22T11:16:54.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WandererYoshinon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=7M0oX8Nw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-06-21T05:38:30.693+0000)\n>\n> i just think its legit filthy that they made the event pay to play\n\nYeah I feel that.
