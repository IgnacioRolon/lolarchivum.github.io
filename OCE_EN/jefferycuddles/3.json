They have buffed Veigar in terms of damage so to compensate they made his stun more 'healthy'  for the game. Its not fun not being instantly stunned without counter play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cripplekill","date":"2015-02-15T08:46:00.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly love the new changes, more ap from the q, more sustain damage... I feel like this has made room to drop a couple of ap items and build him slightly tankier, which gives you more time to plan when to drop that e, and more rotations on q.. and you can land w in teamfights pretty easily without e so I am over hearing people say they will never land a w again...  the way i see it, you should only need {{item:3089}}, build some situational tank items and stack that q. no more uber squishy assasin veigar, hello tanky ap bruiser with half decent sustain dmg.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-02-15T07:33:58.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I think it sucks for newer players. Veigar was very much a champion more experienced players could recommend because\n- He required little skill when using his abilities\n- His Q encouraged them to learn how to last hit.\n- Could still feel meaningful late game because of surprise E and R scaling off opposing player's AP.\n\nVeigar can still do these things but it is harder now. Good for players who have been playing for a while but it just adds more complexity for new players.","replies":[]}]}
