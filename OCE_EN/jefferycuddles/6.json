She knew that fungi was unable to survive in the sun but these fungi she had never seen or heard about before so she questioned herself that maybe they would be fine in the sun? Standing before the forest waiting for the sun to rise she watched the moon finally disappear behind the horizon, turning around to view the sun she was horrified to only a gigantic moon rising only providing a small amount of light that was comparable to a rainy day. Her dread peaked when she realised where she now was no long on earth but a place her father warned her about where no man should tread or ever have to experience she had entered the void. Upon her realization a low hiss came from within the Fungus foliage, she started to withdraw from the edge of the forest backing slowly to the path back towards the cave from where she into this cursed dimension. What emerged from the foliage was a voidborn creature she had seen many times in traveling with her father a xer'sai crawling towards Kassadin's daughter she felt helpless as her speed was slower to the xer'sai approaching her, abandoning her original plan of retreating back to the cave she ran avoiding the xer'sai sprinting off in the direction of the Fungus forest.\r\n\r\nAs she ran through the foliage she didn't know how far she ran she just ran until the moment her legs were unable to carry her any longer as she ran through the foliage she tripped falling face first into the dirt curling up in a ball near a stem of a fungi waiting for death to greet her to end her suffering, death never greeted the girl only silence left in silence her thoughts and emotions whizzed through her mind for she knew under this fungus she would die, she would never be able to see her father again or any of her friends she started to cry feeling her tears mix with the sweat that draped her face, crawling up in a ball trying to keep warm. What felt like an hour she drifted of too sleep it was a dead sleep only a voice that chilled men to the bone \"not many survive the void for even a day, even fewer women enter the void, if you wish to return come to the Icathia portal and you shall return my other voidborn shall not be so kind, so a weapon would benefit you greatly.\" Snapping awake Kassadin's Daughter awoke to a familiar wall and stone slab only as Kassadin's daughter emerged from the cave something was different on the ledge the body not really a body more a skeleton what was once his clothing was now simply rags it might of once been a military uniform the only difference was almost no armor only a shoulder plate and a helmet possibly a scout unit grabbing his torn cloak, armor and helm. It fit quite well on her slender figure, moving the soldiers corpse she found a melted blade and a rucksack full of military rations. The blade still sharp to the touch offering a silent prayer to the dead she grabbed the sword and set off with steel in her heart that could not be broken she set back into the Fungus forest and for whatever awaited her.","replies":[]}
