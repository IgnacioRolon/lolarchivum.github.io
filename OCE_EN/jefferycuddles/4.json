Leaping at Katy brought one it's claws in a vertical swipe Katy trying to dodge the swipe only rip the torso of her clothing the voidreaver continues it's relentless assault trying to kill it's prey only did it finally get a upper hand as it claw found it's mark in Katy shoulder knocking her to the ground, Katy holding her shoulder her clothing now in shreds fear crept into her mind as the fear of death was upon her trying to resist her fate letting her shoulder go griping the melted blade with her injured hand if only that creature had hit her shoulder guard, resolved to no longer dodge and run from this voidreaver, lunging at the voidreaver she managed to plunged her blade square into the monster chest the voidreaver crying out in pain brought one of his piercing Katy's leg in the upper thigh shrieking in pain both combatants predator and prey falling to the ground Katy now glad to be alive trying now not bleed out using pieces of her own clothing as bandages. Katy's vision now blurred to darkness the only thought \"was this the end.\" her thoughts where once again occupied by the voice that greeted her first time sleeping in the void \"tsk tsk, at least you can defeat a child I can only wish you good luck against the adult and elder voidborn feel free to use every part of that voidreaver to your advantage do any thing you wish feast upon his flesh use his hide any thing to help you survive.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again a black marble wall touching at her wound on her shoulder only yielding slight scars jumping up looking at her exposed theigh that had been pierced by the voidreaver's claw the same only yielding a slight scar. her clothing still torn she need new clothing her blade laying next to her resting the black sand still yielded purple blood from the voidreaver picking up  the blade looking at the blood that painted the blade her eyes looked at it in shock at the fact she killed something with her own hands shocked her. Now leaving the cave the body of the solider remained where she had left it only now with the rucksack laying next to his corpse she was unable to find the helm that she had with her so it was out there in the Fungus forest only a new corpse laid on the ground now the voidreaver's lifeless body laid before Katy remembering the voice she started to tear the voidreaver's body apart it's armored hide and shell was before her and it's skin and hair remained infront of her she decided to trust the voice she had been hearing twice lick her lips her next meal would be the body of the voidreaver.\r\n\r\n(Ok so this voidreaver is not Kha'Zix it is a member of his species ok just to clarify)","replies":[]}
