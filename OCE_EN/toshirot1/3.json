You know how items can counter other items such as if someone is wearing Thornail you get a Mortal reminder can you even counter jungle items?  (it sounds dumb but i just wanted to know)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T05:15:19.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't really want to be countering the jungle item more the champion and their overall build. Like an Amumu might take Runic Echoes but then build tank, at which point you'd want to build something like Liandry's or Last Whisper rather than MR to counter the Echo.\n\nPast that I'm not exactly sure what you mean. The items themselves don't have a direct counter (Mortal Reminder into Thornmail isn't really a direct counter either) just the usual Cold Steel > Attack Speed, MR > AP, Grievous Wounds > healing and so on and so forth.","replies":[{"poster":"ToshiroT1","date":"2018-01-27T05:19:50.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah okay i get ya i knew it was a dumb question to ask ahaha but thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T12:00:26.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really, when it comes to Gameplay I don't think there's really any dumb questions, it's just a matter of how thought out they are, I was just finding your question a little difficult to follow.
