But if you pick a champ that synergises well with your team, then rather than making 1 enemy player weaker, you're making 4 allied players stronger.\n\nOne of your problems might be that most of your champs there all fulfil the same role\nEkko/Zed/Fizz/Kat (within reason) do the same thing, jump in, eliminate someone, and jump out. Usually (not all the time), if you can pick Fizz into a matchup, you'll be pretty safe picking either Kat or Ekko too.  And the reverse is also true, if you can't pick Ekko into a matchup, chances are Fizz and Kat will also meet the same disadvantages. \n_***~~So before trying to pick the right champ for the situation, i'd start with expanding the range of champs at your disposal.~~***_\n\nIll use myself as an example, I'm a mid laner too, I prioritise who I pick, from this level of importance (keep in mind that this is just what I do (or try to)):\n\n_***~~1st: Complement our own team's champions. (if my Jungle picks Malphite, then obviously picking Yasuo is a good idea) 2nd: Fill out any holes in our team (e.g. if we don't have CC, I won't be picking Karthus) 3rd: Bring my own flair to the table. 4th: Counter one of more of the enemy champs (i.e. Teemo into Nasus).~~***_\n\nThis order changes a little with situations. Sometimes some things just cant be done. And assassins throw in a new situation entirely (ill bet getting to that later).\n\n**To give examples:**\n\nWhen I pick Roaming specialists.\n>### *If our team has a hyper carry in bot lane, like Draven or Kai'Sa, I'll be tempted to pick someone like Aurelion Sol, so I can maintain a relatively consistent presence in bot to give Draven etc the early/mid game cushion they need to get rolling.*\n\nWhen I pick bruisers:\n>### *If my team is lacking in frontline strength, I have Swain or Vlad to fall back on, which sacrifices some long range poke and nuke potential, but alleviates the pressure off our more fragile backline players while still keeping up some decent AP damage.*\n\nWhen I pick damage/utility mages:\n>### *If our team is well rounded then i'll pick the class that provides what (I think) mid lane should bring to the game, I.e. ranged poke and CC, so I'll pick someone like Zoe or Azir etc. Seeming I don't have to pick up the slack for anyone else, I can focus on bringing out mid lane's individual strength.*\n\nThats the basic principle, but then you can go deeper and get more champion specific.  I.e. if we have a hyper carry bot, but she is Vayne, then I won't go Sol, i'll go Taliyah instead, because then not only can I roam bot often, but i'm playing a champ that makes the most of Vayne's kit, bringing out the potential of both champs.\n\nYou can tailor how much of something you think you need as well, if we need a bigger front line player than Swain, then I'll pick Galio, and focus more on being a true tank rather than a mage hybrid.  Likewise if we don't need quite as much, I'll pick someone like Malz or Ryze, who can still take a few hits, but aren't as squishy as normal mages.\n\nThen comes countering the enemy.  Once I've looked at the type of champ my team needs, (Artillery, bruiser, roaming etc), and Ive considered what champs synergise (or don't synergise) with my own team, then ill look at the enemy.  \nFor example, if we need a poke mage, but the enemy has a Heimerdinger, then I'll narrow the pics to Syndra or Azir who can both fulfil the poke mage role, as well as countering Heimerdinger in particular.\n\n\n\n_______________________\n\n#**_~~Assassins~~_**\n\n\nAssassins like always, are the class that throws a spanner in the works. They win and lose games drastically.\nUnless they are poorly designed, assassins fulfil a very specific role in league. Their main and arguably _only_ purpose, is to remove one _(or two if they're strong_) enemy champs from the game, and then get the fuck out _(essentially making the game a 4v4)_.\nSo rather than focusing on helping your own team, you're focusing on breaking up the enemy's.\n\nIn other words, assassins should be picked when your team's combined combo/teamfight isn't lacking any specific aspects.  If your team can pull off a good strategy as a 4 man (i.e. without you), then your job as an assassin is to make the enemy team also a 4 man. With one important difference, you get to choose which 4 enemies are in the fight.  Essentially removing a key player from _their_ combo.\n\nIf they pick Yasuo/Ori/Amumu, their team synergises amazingly (almost certainly better than your team).  So you job as an assassin is to select and remove the key player from that combo.\n\n_***~~In this situation you should be picking to kill Orianna.~~***_\nOri and Amumu's ults work as a good combo.\nYasuo and Ori's ults work as a good combo.\nBut Yasuo and Amumu together don't really help each other all that much.\nSo you need to quickly make that decision and take out the key player to minimise the enemy's combo, allowing your team to have the upper hand.\n\nIn this situation I would pick Kassadin _(my favourite assassin)_, over more rounded mid lane champs, in order to deal with the pressing threat of a team wide Amumu + Ori + Yasuo ult _(which obviously is more important to get rid of, than filling out holes in your own team)_.\n\nIf you see a situation like this in champ select, then picking an assassin playstyle is very justifiable.  But if your team is lacking certain things (like lacking in poke, or is looking a little squishy), AND the enemy team doesn't have some crazy wombo level shit, then you should be filling in the gaps on your own team, rather than playing the hero and going for the assassin pick.\n\nAssassins are _(in theory)_, a high risk high reward pick.  If you do it right, it's devastating, if you do it wrong, you might as well not even be in the game.\nSo unless there is someone in the enemy team who HAS TO DIE (like Ori in that example). You shouldn't really be picking an assassin unless you're relatively confident your team can hold its own without your contribution.  If your team has holes, and theres no desperate need for you to be an assassin, pick one is a little irresponsible and selfish.\n\nYes, if you're really good (like most classes), you can carry yourself a fair bit as an assassin-only player. But only to a point.  Once real teamwork and synergy comes into play, you have to have a wider variety of options to pick from.\n\nWith the exception of Zoe, all the champs you mentioned fulfil relatively the same role (within reason, obviously they each have their own unique flair). So if you're faced with a situation that doesn't call for an assassin, then you could potentially be robing your team of other needed stats. _(likewise if you play only poke mages, or only tanky champs etc. Its just more obvious with assassins because of the high risk high reward playstyle.)_\n\n\n__________________________\n\n#**_~~Where to from here?~~_**\n\nI've mentioned a lot of things. \nBut don't just jump straight into playing all new champs and trying to consider all these things all at once.\n\nStart just by keeping up playing the champs you already are.\nBut during the game, start to think _\"What are we lacking, as a team?\"_, and \"_why?\"_.\nAs consistent themes start to crop up, _(maybe you're always short on poke?)_, start to investigate what poke champs you might be interested in, and give them a go.  Once you've sorted out a poke champ, try to sort out a bruiser, or a roaming specialist.  Once you've got a variety of champs to fall back on. Then start to focus more intently on filling the holes in your team.\n\nWe all have favourites, and let that guide you.\nI like mages, so i'm always going to favour them.  If I have a choice between a tanker champ, and a poke mage, I'll probably opt for the poke mage.\nLikewise with you and assassins, if you have the choice between an assassin and a roaming specialist, you'll probably pick the assassin. and thats okay! Don't be afraid of that, thats just your unique flair, and in such situations _***~~you should play what you are comfortable with.~~***_\n\nI've won more games by playing my main into an unfavourable situation than picking a specific counter that I don't have much experience with.\n\nSo like I said, take it slow, build up a pool of champs you're comfortable with that can plug different holes, and go from there. Don't jump straight in and think _\"Im vsing Zed, so I NEED to play Lissandra, even though I've never player her!\"_, thats not going to work.\n\nGood luck ^^ I hope this wall helped.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-02-07T09:55:33.108+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=cQE2qPcr,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-02-07T09:34:57.078+0000)\n\nYour formatting is \n\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-02-07T13:09:38.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^_^\nOnly thanks to Wuks' effort though:\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/AHREUGPW-boards-usage-guide-part-1-boards-markup","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ToshiroT1","date":"2019-02-08T03:43:48.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much i'm legit going to print this off cause this info is really helpful and now i know what to pick thank you :))","replies":[]}]}]}
