The regrettable result being that the sneaky inters take much longer than anyone would like (except them I suppose) to see punishment. I agree, it isn't up to scratch, though I can respect the reality there.\n\nAs for tribunal, it was removed because punishments were almost always too harsh, and the system required almost universal Riot oversight anyway, which kind of defeated the purpose of player driven review. \n\nIt's just not practically possible to get enough people to bother creating such a system to both agree on guidelines and therefore punishments and have motivation to review games without the rewards corrupting the objectivity. The automated system has it's flaws, but it's much fairer and can punish much faster (which is a plus for reform and not just those affected by the behaviour) than tribunal ever could.","replies":[{"poster":"ToshiroT1","date":"2018-10-26T06:17:19.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't care about rewards my reward would be suspending the players/ banning cause i want this game to feel right and punish those players that give REALLY good players the chance to get to they ranks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-26T07:58:55.266+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wasn't the only reason tribunal failed. Many of the players who would have (and likely still would) participate with no rewards at all tend to be rather vengeful, myself included, and would punish too harshly without considering things like punishment and behavioural history.\n\nThe population of players who can be consistently objective, would be willing to participate for no personal gain, and understand the policies in place to punish appropriately is miniscule.

It offered IP for participation (bribery), and encouraged a _certain group_ of people to participate. Mostly, those who like to spite others.\nAll you did was have to make a judgement to recieve IP rewards, and the more you can get through in an hour, the more IP you received. Why read a report when you can just ctrl-f for a few words and click punish if they come up, regardless of context.\nThat's how tribunal worked.\nYou'd see incredibly harsh punishments for very minor offenses.\nI say this as a player who had an account permabanned via tribunal back on NA server in season 2.\nI have never been banned since.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-26T01:48:49.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say it was good, I was simply saying it existed.

How many reports would Riot get a day? No system is perfect, you just go with the best on offer.\n\nTo be honest, the current system may be flawed, but is more just than the old tribunal.\nI believe the appropriate quote is \"it's better to let 10 guilty men go free than to imprison a single innocent man\" or something like that. It may have been death penalty related originally, which kind of relates to perma-bans.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
