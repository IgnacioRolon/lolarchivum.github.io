From what I understand of the system, you would need to play consistently for several weeks (not necessarily each day) in order to keep a \"steady pace\" in Honour level progress. Another factor to consider is that the \"boosted\" progress from being Honour is still only a slight boost, meaning it will take *a lot* of Honours to add up to a significant increase. Yet another factor to consider is that consistent negative behaviour (and, of course, punishments as a result of negative behaviour) will reduce your progress through the Honour levels, perhaps even reduce you to Honour level 1 (or 0).\n\nAs [Marauder has mentioned previously](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/JxiotXoA-is-there-a-counter-for-honor-like-can-i-track-my-process?comment=0001) (by pointing to a post made by RiotSimurgh on Reddit), the Honour system \"holistically evaluates behaviour over time behind the scenes using some pretty crazy algorithms to determine when a player levels up\", so there's not really a viable way to \"quantify\" Honour level progress (thus, making it hard to predict).\n\nFrom what I've seen about how the Honour system is working recently, it seems it may also be the case that Honour progress was \"restricted\" while Riot was introducing the system to live servers, which can (to an extent) be supported by the \"sudden, rapid\" increases many players have been experiencing over the past month or so, as opposed to the month or so prior. Looking at your recent games via OP.GG, it seems that it *may* just be a case where you haven't played consistently/often enough to reach level 3. If you keep at it, you may find yourself reaching level 3 quite soon.\n\nAlternatively, if you're think that there is (or may be) something wrong with how Honour is working for you, you can submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) and see what they come up with. They should be happy to help, and it will help determine whether there is a problem preventing you from progressing or whether you just need to spend more time playing (within the rules, mind you).\n\nHope this helps, though if you have any questions you can feel free to ask and I'll see what I can find. You can also feel free to check out the [Honour FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148) for more info.","replies":[]}]}
