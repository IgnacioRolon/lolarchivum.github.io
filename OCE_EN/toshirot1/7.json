There's a lot of \"crazy algorithms used to determine when a player levels up\", but don't let that discourage you. One thing to consider is that getting Honoured isn't necessarily going to \"speed up\" your progress by a whole lot, they only \"boost\" you forward slightly. Another thing to consider is that negative behaviour will hamper your progress, so it may be worth it to reflect on how you behave in-game and see if there's something you can do differently. Just keep playing to win, don't be a jerk and you'll get there soon enough.\n\nBest of luck!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-08-13T04:57:05.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=UuPtrsRE,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-13T04:45:07.105+0000)\n>\n> , don&#x27;t be a jerk and you&#x27;ll \n> \n> Best of luck!\n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nBut i am a jerk, and still managed to get honor 3...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-08-13T04:20:19.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had multiple chat bans in the last 6 months, and im honor 3 XD, maybe be toxic a bit then get banned, then get honored","replies":[]}]}
