I open the file location of league of legends \"file:///C:/Riot%20Games/League%20of%20Legends/\", then i went to the search bar located somewhere near the top right corner (This should show all the league of legends applications). open properties of league then go to compatibility, when you find \"disable fullscreen optimizations\" make sure it is not selected. I did this to all the league of legends appilcations\n\nHope this helps\nIf you didn't understand i will make a Youtube video of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2018-08-05T06:12:24.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya,\n\nYou mentioned this started last week but the symptoms of your issue are similar to what players are experiencing with the recent update, they could be related but they may not be.\n\n[âš™Run through this crash guideðŸ’»](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) and let me know if it works for you.
