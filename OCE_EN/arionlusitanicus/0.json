Here&#039;s why:\r\n\r\nSo I went from Germany to Australia for a year and therefore tranferred my account from EUW to OCE for the time being. Now that I&#039;m back home, I&#039;d like to finance my transfer back so I bought a paysafecard at a local (German) supermarket, which I spent 25&euro; for. Now, when I try to buy any amount of RP with my paysafecard (with the prices in AUD of course), when I type in the 16 digit PIN it tells me that this paysafecard is unavailable in this webshop. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with this? Is there any possibility to buy the RP for my still-OCE account from a German paysafecard? Thanks in advance for your response.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-22T01:07:49.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's likely that the paysafecard does not allow you to convert to different currencies. Items in the OCE store can only be purchased in the OCE currencies, so likely you will have to pay via paypal or credit card or really anything that will let you pay in a different currency.\n\nEDIT: Wrenchman Seph tells me that if you [contact support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) they might have a workaround they can use, and regardless will be bale to help you out.","replies":[]}]}
