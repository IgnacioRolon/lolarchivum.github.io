I BELIEVE THE  ACTIONS AND INTENT OF ALL PLAYERS NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BEFORE ISSUING PENALTIES, \r\nbecause, before my unwarrented bans, you will find i was (and still am) an honourable player, \r\n\r\nbut if stuff like this continues i will cease to play this game, and also cease to promote this game to others via my respective social media accounts, i&#039;ve already lost one account i put hundreds of dollars into by defending myself against people actively trolling and ruining gameplay for others, \r\n\r\nI WILL NOT LOSE ANOTHER\r\n\r\n\r\nBELOW ARE THE CHAT LOGS.\r\n\r\n(in this game, caitlyn had banned teemo when i was first on my team to declare intent (which was teemo)\r\n\r\nSide note, the TF i was facing was one of the most toxic players ive ever come across, and the report i lodged for him did nothing.. again, wtf riot\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nFillet o Fitz: when you declare intent, then ADC bans them\r\nFillet o Fitz: gg\r\nFillet o Fitz: oh i

end\r\nFillet o Fitz: need a team that doesnt fk their teammates\r\nFillet o Fitz: ggwp\r\n\r\n\r\n(in this game, if they post the whole chat logs, akali was wasting time, then exected us to leave lane for first and second wave, got abusive when i told her she wasted my time) \r\nAGAIN, they were toxic af, i was defending myself, I GET BANNED they get no punishment\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 2\r\nFillet o
