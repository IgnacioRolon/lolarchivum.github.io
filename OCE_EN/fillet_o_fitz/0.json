Drive failure comes to mind as a potential cause.\n\nPerhaps it's time to consider an upgrade?","replies":[{"poster":"Fillet o Fitz","date":"2017-10-11T23:16:36.411+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"ot only happens when eague needs to update, and league is the only game/program that causes it, everything else runs smoothly, and it seems to happen when it loads into game (post champ slect) happened again this new patch, updated patch, then crashed when trying to load game fter champ select... its to the point where im just going to uninstall, which is a shame considering the hundreds of dollars i have put into this game thus far","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fillet o Fitz","date":"2017-10-12T13:48:12.802+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so, this is now happening again, have expended over 20GB today trying to fix this same problem, when EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF MY PC IS RUNNING PERECTLY.\n\nAs a result,i have decided to uninstall league, this constant crashing every timea new patch is released, coupled with my being banned for dfending myself, when other players (with lvl 5 honour mind you) have been abusive as f*ck to me, the only soloution is to uninstall the game, as no help (or blame) has been offered or accepted by riot other than telling me to buy a new pc, which, why would i when mine still runs perfectly.\n\nso thanks for all the \"help and support\" riot, and thank you for finally driving me to uninstall this game, just a shame i cant get the hundreds of dollars wasted, notto mention the countless fees i have incurred by going over data cap trying to fix something that works a minute before then fails.\n\nP.S. I know its not system problems, becuse its the same 3 files that cause it to crash while \"repairing\" and as stated, every other aspect/program/game work flawlessly... time to go back to Blizzard, at least they have better customer service\n\n\nDisappointed to say the least,\nAnother Lost Summoner","replies":[]}]}
