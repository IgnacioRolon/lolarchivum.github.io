I have the full replay of the game using LOL Summoner Info, but does anyone know what I actually do with the replay itself? Do I take screenshots of parts where the scripting is obvious, or upload the whole clip to youtube or something completely different? I&#039;m not entirely sure but I wanna do this properly as I&#039;ve noticed a rise in the amount of scripters lately and it disgusts me. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nLuigi Bot","replies":[{"poster":"TBL Leukemia","date":"2015-08-08T08:20:25.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Record the games you play and send tickets is usually the best thing to do","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fusion Luigi","date":"2015-08-07T10:18:58.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roger that, I spose its just a matter of what subcategory to send the ticket under :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-08-07T10:06:22.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a ticket to Riot support at support.riotgames.com they won't be able to tell you if any action is taken on the account but that's the best place to do it, ask them how they'd like the evidence.","replies":[]}]}
