Once it took an entire day to update the patcher and another time I had to do overnight. I'm not an internet/technology expert so I have no idea what happens, my internet's never been bad, but it's always been LoL that's so hard to update. But now I can't even open it without the LoL logo appearing for a few seconds, and then \"Unspecified Error Occurred. Please check the logs for more information\" appearing. I've repeatedly tried to open it again and again and once in a while it says \"Another instance of the program is running. Do you want to terminate it?\" but the same result happens every time. I've researched everywhere but nOthing helps.\n\nA few things about my laptop/wi-fi (idk if it's relevant but it might be):\n- It's a MacBook Air.\n- My wi-fi recently turned off for like a week, but yesterday it turned on again :)\n- Some friends recently played LoL on my laptop and maybe they did something to the program or something idk.\n- **IT'S SO ANNOYING.**\n\nPlease answer and help.\n\nEDIT: yay I just waited and it worked :)\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"izaryn","date":"2015-01-09T10:43:31.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"MAC FIX: (worked for me), go to league of legends app files, go to RADS folder and delete solutions folder within.
