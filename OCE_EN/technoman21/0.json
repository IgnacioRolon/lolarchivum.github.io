You are obviously spamming something LOL maybe too many sentinals? maybe too many Q's? maybe a combination?\n\nYour E gives you back like half the cost on a kill so that doesnt use that much mana and gives you back the full mana cost if you kill 2 things... GG\n\nProbuilds are: Vamp scepter - Berseker greaves - hurricance - Bloodthirster - IE - situational - situational\n\npersonally I think Hurricanes is crap your already like stomping lane.\n\nI personally prefer  Berseker Greaves - Bork - IE - Shiv - situational - situational","replies":[]}]}
