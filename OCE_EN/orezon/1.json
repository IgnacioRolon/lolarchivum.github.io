I&#039;ve been looking for three weeks and yet Ranked isn&#039;t up each time I&#039;ve looked. Is it cause it&#039;s not available on the new client? I&#039;m not too sure because I&#039;ve played one TT ranked game. I&#039;ve been looking at the right time for me (7 pm NZT) and it still isn&#039;t showing up. Whether this is intended or not I kinda want to play with some mates as something to kill time with along with having some sort of competitive fun. Thanks for any answers.","replies":[{"poster":"Guns and Posers","date":"2017-03-08T01:04:24.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Tele suggested \nIts only available for 1-2 days at a certain time\n\nFrom memory it does the normal twisted treeline queue and then the next day is the ranked one","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-03-03T10:47:31.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's quite strange. It's definitely available on the new client. \n\nAre you checking exactly at 7 pm? Or a few minutes after to give it time to update? You're also checking on Thursday and Friday right?","replies":[{"poster":"Orezon","date":"2017-03-05T05:58:26.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's 7 pm NZT which is the same as 5 pm AEDT. I was hyped to play it with some friends but since my first game it hasn't shown up at all. I haven't heard of any updates about the TT ranked on OCE. Every time I went on there is the normal TT but only normal TT.  No idea but thanks for the suggestion.","replies":[]}]}]}
