It&#039;s been occurring for multiple patches  (although it&#039;s been dealable as I just have to wait for 5 mins or so) and I don&#039;t know how to fix it. It seems to only occur when I start up my computer (as my computer then runs smoothly). Is there anyone else out there with the same problem or have something to suggest that would fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-25T03:11:25.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like it's probably connection related, are you on a wifi connection?
