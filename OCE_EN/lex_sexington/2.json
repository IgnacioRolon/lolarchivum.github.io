I don't know if this is happening on all champions but it happens with shaco and master yi for me.\r\n\r\nThis one has been mentioned before by another mac user - whenever I die, regardless of the champion, I get a brief bit of fps lag that makes it really hard to effectively use passives that have an affect after death like karthus, kog-maw, zyra etc.\r\n\r\nCheers Rito, plz read n do your best","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-09T02:01:11.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I just tested Krugg bug (hehe) out and you're totally right! Nice find! I'll be passing this bug on, thanks very much for the report.\n\nRegarding the FPS issue, it's been a fairly common problem that I'm also experiencing across multiple machines. I'll be chasing up if this is something we're still actively working on as we've already deployed a couple of fixes over the last few weeks. The new Mac OS (Yosemite) has raised its own set of issues as well that our player support tech team is tracking. Are you currently on Yosemite as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2014-12-09T02:35:10.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add, you might want to try deleting your game.cfg file which should be located here:\n\n/Applications/League of Legends.app/Contents/LoL/Config/game.cfg\n\nThis will reset all of your in game settings except for your keybindings. Some players have found this to fix the FPS issues so if it works please let me know!","replies":[{"poster":"Lex Sexington","date":"2016-01-16T06:03:51.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Gehirn,\n\nTurns out I forgot to check my account and missed your reply (noob alert)... Thanks for getting back to me, and glad to hear I wasn't imagining the Krugg issue.  I am running Mavericks (10.9.5) and have a very old mac now (mid 2010).  I've just deleted the game.cfg file and found no change to the fps issue upon death.\n\nRegarding this issue it is actually just before death that the fps drop occurs. Maybe at around 1-5% hp, i get 0 frames for a good 0.5-1 seconds. Regardless of whether I live or die (usually die) at that amount of health, I still get the fps drop.\n\nIt's really satisfying when I've used all my spells and win the slap-fest through this fps drop, but very rare.\n\nCheers man, and if upgrading OS has been reported to fix fps issues please let me know and I'll update","replies":[]}]}]}]}
