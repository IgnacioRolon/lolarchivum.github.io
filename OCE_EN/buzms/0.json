You are Bronze. Don't take it personally but you aren't good enough to have such a large champion pool. Bronze, Silver and even Golds should only have like 1 or 2 main champions they play in order to master them. This helps you climb immensely.\nMy friend got to Plat 3 playing ONLY Jinx. He knew her good matchups, her bad ones and how to play the game in almost every situation he comes up against. IF he didn't get ADC he would 90% of the time dodge. Dodging isn't a bad thing and neither is being a one-trick pony if you're good enough.\n\n2. Having a 20cs lead and being 0-0-0 is pointless. An ADC needs to be Fed. If you are a Farm heavy fight later kind of player, then I suggest playing Jinx, Tristana or Kogmaw. They don't need to \"win\" lane phase in order to carry later since they are hyper carries.\nThe good thing about Jinx and Tristana is, all you need to do is ACE the enemy team once and you can take 2 towers since they are amazing turret killers.\n\n3. You say you are \"farm heavy\" kind of player, but your CS is quite frankly terrible. You average 5 cs per minute when the aim is to average 10. With 7-8 being \"acceptable\". There's something you can focus on.\n\n4. If your team isn't warding well enough, feel free to keep your warding trinket instead of swapping to a scrying orb and even upgrading it to a regular ward dropper {{item:3361}}  I see you seem to buy atleast 1 pink every game which is really good.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nI will say your builds are surprisingly good for a Bronze 5 person. You're not a complete idiot like most people down there. Even your runes and masteries are good. You just need to work on your CS and probably your objectives.\nIF you get a kill or 2. DO NOT CHASE THE SUPPORT FOR A TRIPLE KILL. GET A TOWER OR DRAGON\n\nI have to say on paper the only thing wrong is your CS so it must be a MAJOR lack of objective focus.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Buzms\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA1/51428028","replies":[{"poster":"Buzms","date":"2015-07-15T11:49:19.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you you're advice actually helps alot yea i know im bronze which makes me bad at the game i understand and i don't take it to heart you are right i am bad but yea with my cs im working on it on an average my support takes alot of farm in games or hits it so i cant take the cs or miss it and its my bad on parts but it dose get annoying i usually keep my lane frozen so i can wait for ganks or if the enemy miss plays so i can do something but yea my very best champ is Trist but the other champs are in my pool just so if something gets baned out i can pick something up admittedly they are not my best champs but my top 3 adc's are trist, siver kali im working on corkie luc but it is the struggle but yea thnx for the advice man i would appreciate any more if you are willing to give","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GooweyandCo","date":"2015-07-23T04:42:40.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are still interested in playing, add me and be on over the weekend.
