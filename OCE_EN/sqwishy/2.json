I don&#039;t blame them because it&#039;s true that I am somewhere I do no belong and they&#039;re the ones suffering + I&#039;m not happy cause it&#039;s boring af.. Is Riot working on something to help people in this position? 0-30 is hundreds of games... That&#039;s 1000+ players who will experience a shitty game thanks to a smurf\r\n\r\nIdeally I&#039;d love it if I could just switch my client to the new server and my rank is saved to server not account, this way there would be no issue with trying to balance ranking across servers.\r\n\r\nIf you have no plan on doing something like that (which would make me sad) would it be possible to &quot;verify&quot; another account to get a lvl 30 on a new server? (I understand this may cause issue with account sellers but really... that stuff is already all over the web, if someone wants to do that now it&#039;s already no issue)\r\n\r\nIf neither of those are an option... Could I just pay for a lvl 30? I&#039;d be pretty shitty with Riot tbh but in the end I&#039;d avoid playing boring games where I crush new people...\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSholva","replies":[]}
