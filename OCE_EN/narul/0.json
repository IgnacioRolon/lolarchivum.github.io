You would have to play someone with dashes. And when you attacking him with his w up he can just turn around and q you till you die. \n\nHis e is pretty much useless because there's no armour reduction and all you get is 15% less damage. Whoop de doo. Would it be useful in team fights? Idk and in lane it the mana cost is high so you'll win one or two trades but soon you'll be oom with the spamming of q \n\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the ult one of the reasons why riot wanted to rework him? I thought it was because it was a weird mechanic. \n\nIn other words, I don't think this is a good rework.
