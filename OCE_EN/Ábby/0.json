I also have a few other characters i use some times ( Pyke, MordeKaiser and Ahri ). \r\n\r\nThis game is fun and enjoyable but it can be pretty tough in some games when i play against champions like teemo or Udyr. Its tough to get close to teemo or any ranged champion cause they use ranged attacks, to hit them or force them out of a lane is hard because of that. Just like this, overall i have a tough time winning lanes. I usually just q on minions until my counter goes up or use a combo like E -&gt; E -&gt; Q -&gt; W -&gt; AA -&gt; Q and burn to finish. I always go to mid lane or bot lone when someone is ganking to help them avoid it or counter it.\r\n\r\nMy average kill count is around 4 - 6 or higher / and 3+ deaths.\r\n\r\nA huge problem is knowing when to engage or not, i usually die first in team fights because i engage to early or i think i can win if i use my ult.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help me with my problem, i would gladly appreciate it! {{sticker:galio-happy}} \r\n\r\n( Items in order : {{item:3340}} / {{item:2033}} &gt; {{item:3101}} &gt;{{item:3044}} &gt;\r\n{{item:3057}} &gt; {{item:3078}} &gt; {{item:3047}} &gt;{{item:3053}} &gt;{{item:3143}} )","replies":[{"poster":"MasochistSupMain","date":"2018-12-22T04:11:21.015+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> A huge problem is knowing when to engage or not\n\nHere's a video that I think explains this well:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwE9wPwHCuU\n\nThere's so many things that you can take into account. I think for starters you could just think on:\n1- Number of close allies >= enemies (starting a fight outnumbered is usually a bad idea)\n2- (If you have a strong crowd control) landing it on 2+ of the enemy team damage dealers\n3- If the enemy team has used all their big cooldowns then you can go all-in and try to do as much dmg as possible\n\n^ I would think on them in that same order matters","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-12-20T21:53:16.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't be afraid to tank up a bit as a non-tank character, you deal zero damage while dead.\n\nIf anyone trolls you, just mute them instantly and add to block list in post-game screen.\n\nI only ARAM since season 3, so I'm a bit out of touch... lmao.","replies":[{"poster":"Ábby","date":"2018-12-20T23:07:51.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the kind reply! i should be tankier as you said, perhaps that will give me some consistent games :)\n\nIve been doing that, muting people who do but you know. You cant mute what already has been done, if someone says im playing bad or im a noob or something like that. I cant tend to be the same back, just be nice back and be friends but yeah. \n\nThank you!","replies":[]}]}]}
