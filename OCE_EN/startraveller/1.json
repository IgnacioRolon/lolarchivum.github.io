That means free to play champions will not work.\n\n+ You also can only get one chest per champion each season, as **JasonWazza** said earlier. If you've already obtained a chest from a champion, any further S class games on that champion will not generate a chest. Keys will still be obtainable on that champion though.\n\n+ Lastly, if you have been chat restricted, ranked restricted or banned before, then this feature has been temporarily disabled for you. You can get it back by making progress towards reforming your behavior. \n\nYou can find more info on all the above [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/hextech-crafting-now-live-oceania).","replies":[{"poster":"jimuskin","date":"2016-03-27T13:18:27.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've just recovered from a 2 week ban (about a month ago or less), and I have access to this feature.

But it if you check out the link I sent, down below in the FAQ section it reads:\n\n_\"Players who are chat or ranked restricted or currently banned from play cannot earn or unlock chests through Champion Mastery. We want to be sure players punished by our systems are making genuine efforts to reform, so the period of ineligibility can extend beyond the duration of the chat restrictions or suspensions received.
