As a result, gameplay punishments are typically slower than chat ones, but the false positive rate is tiny. That's not to say it's impossible, but without watching the replays I'm not going to say anything with any degree of certainty as match history alone can often be misleading.\n\nIf you feel you were unduly punished, I'd recommend you submit a ticket to player support to appeal the restriction: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThere is a high volume of tickets at the moment, so you'll have to be a bit patient.","replies":[{"poster":"MercuryHatter","date":"2019-07-17T09:04:25.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers, but if your busy atm i probbaly wont be unbaned util maybe aday before anyways XD ty tho and good luck","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-17T11:48:50.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but if it's a false punishment then you don't want it to affect things like your honour and your history going forward.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
