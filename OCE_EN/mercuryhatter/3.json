I.E. does get get +5% movement speed towards enemies missing 10% of their health?\n\nPassive feels like Warwick's E but it's linear and doesn't have a cut-off point, also is too strong early game (Warwick's is only 20% movement speed at level 1 and goes up to 40%, and he is meant to be a chaser; when enemies are almost dead, this passive will give 50% movement speed at all levels, could at least make it +1% movement speed per 4/3/2% missing health.)\n\nQ feels original, but without a place (now that I think about it, it feels like a Pantheon E that has an execute)\n\nW feels like discounted Fiora W\n\nE feels like discounted Renekton W mixed with Malphite W/E\n\nR feels like discounted Pantheon R mixed with Malzahar Q.\n\n\nAlso, how is this meant to be an anti-assassin? It just feels like a lost dog.\n\nP.S. if you wrote this up, don't put in exact numbers, you will never get it balanced and it throws off the whole idea, just say \"moderate base damage with high scaling\" or something along those lines, don't put in actual stats for the champion but instead say something like \"rather tanky, moderate ad at all levels, moderate movement speed\", if anything at all.\n\nP.P.S. I have just read the jokes, made me smile, lol.","replies":[{"poster":"MercuryHatter","date":"2016-07-07T14:03:58.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like i said this is just the base people could do whatever they wanted with it like they could make the passive max at 5% at lvl 1 then get better as the game goes on, also the r is more likea  amumu q and ult if you look at the range. XD and also i have never played {{champion:58}}  so that is interesting nor {{champion:114}} but thank you for looking at this :)","replies":[]}]}]}
