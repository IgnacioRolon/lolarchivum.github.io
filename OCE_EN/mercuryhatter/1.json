This is generally because you have an unbalanced ratio with your W/L and it won't change until you bring your win ratio up.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=ShroudedAngel\n\nOn the left you have 122W and 148L so until you balanced this you will see these significant LP losses. When you bring your win ratio higher then your losses you will begin to climb. \n\nUnderstand this game is not about personal score or how well you think you do in the game but how well your team does. \n\nIf you want to climb you should stay away from playing support since  you can't carry from that role unless you have a fantastic ADC duo partner. Play easy champions and play champions who you consistently do well with and have high win rate with. If you continue to play your highest win rate champions you will eventually get out of Bronze. Jhin and Vi for example seem to be doing well for you at the moment. I'd also give Amumu a try because even though he is simple and borderline boring he will get you out of bronze.\n\nHappy climbing\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"MercuryHatter","date":"2016-07-07T15:02:58.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you but i have no idea of how to get my wins up cause im constantly getting paired with trash people XD","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-07-08T01:06:02.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely had that feeling a few days ago and changed my outlook on the game. I understand it's not my team and it's not the match making system but it is my attitude. I stopped blaming my team and started encouraging them and where no encouragement was accepted I just /mute all so I don't get tilted myself. I only type to give positive affirmation (wow yasuo nice kill) and to say when objectives are up.\n\nThese things helped me a lot and I was at a 45% win rate and now I'm at 70%. As soon as you stop blaming your team it's like the game actually becomes fun. Play people who are fun for you and w ho  you do well with and you will win games.  You will play better and end up carrying your team. Champions who are broken and you don't want to play should be banned and all others you should find the one you have fun on. But try not to be too crazy and go Annie jungle for example cause dat shit just don't work.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
