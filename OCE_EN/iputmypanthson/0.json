I then received a lower priority punishment of 20 minutes for 5 games. I did use to A.F.K/leave in the past, but I have not done anything against the rules in well over a month. I play over 10 matches a day, I&#039;m wondering how long it takes to get back in the good books and not being punished harshly and immediately, or if this is normal? I don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair. I really don&#039;t want to have to spend almost 2 hours waiting for games, I don&#039;t have time for that. Any way to be given a chance or get this reversed? Any tips?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-09T05:55:09.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To answer your question, there is no way to get a Leaverbuster reversed/removed from your account. The punishment you received is standard, as it's generally set for 20 minute buffers for five consecutive matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kao Atlantis","date":"2015-12-07T17:15:37.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello iputmypanthson,\n\nIt is unfortunate when you get a lower priority queue at the time that something beyond your control happens. Riot builds in a leeway for cases exactly like what you experienced (I hope your father is okay). However, they don't know what caused you to leave. The system doesn't discriminate and it takes quite a few AFKs before it triggers. The best bet is to ensure that you have enough time to play at least 45 minutes before joining the queue. That way you never leave unless it really is something unexpected.","replies":[{"poster":"iputmypanthson","date":"2015-12-08T03:09:38.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI received a response for my ticket which in short told me \"Bad luck.\" It also didn't answer any of my questions or give any considerations whatsoever, you didn't answer my questions either but at least you gave me a human response.","replies":[]}]}]}
