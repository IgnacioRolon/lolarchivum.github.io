My favorite thing about super galaxy rumble(the 1st super galaxy?) was the monologue changes the speech lines were so fun, xeraths are getting not well stale after 1000 games but id sure love some variation!  \n3 equivalent skin of pre void kassadin/ pre ascension xerath, human xerath, id just love a running animation xD i know things were tight when xerath 1st came out and floating is like a power thing but im jelly of ryzes beautiful run.\n4 im running out of ideas now but what about an unchained xerath? like pure energy i know he would need some kind of contrast but kennan in electric form looks great and im picturing plasma globe tendrils chaining underneath him to the ground that would look siiick and be even cooler than a running animation :)","replies":[]}
