In a world of outspoken pessimism i have developed an optimistic attitude, not about myself, not about others or humanity, but about the meta. things get better. that is the way of things. its hard to observe because we only live a short time so trying to watch the world get better would be like trying to see movement on a sundial. Riot has succeeded because they gave us quality/quantity for free with superficial rewards for donations. its a business model that should be copied by any1 who can. the fact that the goods riot offer are not physical helps but isnt necessary. i look forward to a future when business men and woman know that cooperation and generosity are the keys to success not only of themselves but all of us.\r\n\r\nAbout the title. i wanted to generate controversy, and i hope communication between riot and the community stays firmly open however i want to offer words of support not just to Riot but any1 who believes they must open themselves to public critique. Remember the people who are most motivated to speak are those who are unhappy dissatisfied and angry. if you cater to 1000 participants and you get 100 negative comments you have done well. 90% of participants appreciated what you have created so much they ddnt complain! if you think about your real world experiences you may realise that is wp! so take your game, your business, your movie or sound and show the world! give it to them freely and accept and expect criticism! but for pitys sake dont let it affect your original direction! How many bands do you listen to and how often do you hear &ldquo;its good but i prefer the early stuff&rdquo;  or &ldquo;i prefer the 1st album&rdquo;. To me one (of many) reasons why is because fans kill their favorite bands by giving them bad feedback that has to pass through the universal communication  barrier but that is another tangent. \r\n\r\nThe whole point of this article is to say i trust riot with this game. and ill take the liberty of speaking for everyone who hasnt given u any feedback at all. ur doing damn fine work. dont let the toxic 10% influence creativity. thank you for reading","replies":[]}
