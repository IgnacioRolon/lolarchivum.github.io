There could be general ones, like &quot;Get a quadra/penta&quot;, &quot;Ace the other team&quot;, &quot;Get the 5th dragon buff&quot;, or &quot;Kill an enemy while dead&quot;.\r\nYou could also have more specific ones, like &quot;As a champion with a sibling, kill your sibling&quot;, &quot;Place over 15 wards in a single game&quot;, or &quot;Play in a team where every champion is from Noxus&quot;.\r\nTime based ones, or rewards for playing lots of games, like &quot;Play a game as every yordle&quot; or &quot;Play in a game that lasts longer than an hour&quot;.\r\nAnd finally, there could be extremely specific ones, like &quot;Kill a yordle with a yordle snap trap&quot; or &quot;As Tahm Kench, start and finish your ult in the river&quot; or even &quot;Fire a blitz hook at an enemy blitz, landing them at the same time so you switch places&quot;.\r\n\r\nObviously, achievements would only be unlockable in games that were not premade. There should be general achievements, plus special ones for ranked, the different normals maps, aram and so on. They wouldn&#039;t even need rewards, but if riot wanted to reward us for them, they could come with summoner icons, or ip, or something similar to what you get for champion mastery.\r\n\r\nPlease can we have achievements riot? It would give league even more replayability than it already has, and might encourage people to try other roles, champions or playstyles, rather than getting locked into one style.\r\n\r\nAs a closing note, there could be commiseration achievements, that you get for failing. Things like &quot;Don&#039;t hit anything with a global ult&quot;, &quot;Get killed without dealing any damage to the player who killed you&quot;, or &quot;Flash without moving more than 50 units (flash fail)&quot;. I do get that commiseration achievements might be a bad idea, as they sort of encourage players to do badly, but they might be fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-06T04:18:43.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it got cancelled half way through because the cost to benefit ratio really wasn't that great. \n\nStuff like \"Flash without moving more than 50 units\" and \"Fire a blitz hook at an enemy blitz, landing them at the same time so you switch places\", is quite hard to program since it needs to pick-up information from in-game.","replies":[]}]}
