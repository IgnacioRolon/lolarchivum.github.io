I also tried my promos again the other day and after 2 wins and 1 loss I also &quot;did not complete my series&quot;.\r\nAlso, every time I lose in my promos to Silver I&#039;m also losing LP for it. \r\nAnyone else experienced this?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-09T13:05:03.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it possible that you are dodging one of your matches? Dodging during your promos counts as a loss.\n\nAs for losing LP, this is normal. You win and lose LP as usual while in your promos; if you win you can get over 100 LP but it will never show more than 100, which can be confusing when afterwards you lose a match and still have 100.","replies":[]}]}
