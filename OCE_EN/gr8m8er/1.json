(this isn&#039;t my main account)\r\nNow, before you say I&#039;m the classic bronzie blaming his team, i&#039;m not (silver in my main) Honestly, 95% of the time, I win my lane (mid) and usually crush my enemy mid laner. I roam and help other lanes as well but they keep dying/feeding/complaining to the point where i can&#039;t do anything about it. From having a very good kda in laning phase, it deteriorates as the game progresses and we end up losing because of shitty bot/top. Ev For some reason between 0-15 mins of the game during laning phase before I can start roaming all my other lanes somehow get crushed so hard that the enemy team is so fed and we lose. I understand kda doesn&#039;t help u win games (objectives,etc.) but we can&#039;t contest them just cos the enemy is so far ahead. Now, in normals this is kinda an on and off situation but literally every ranked game after placements no matter how hard i win my lane other lanes just fuck up and we get crushed, which leads to me getting a bad kda, lower mmr and a never ending cycle. So how do I fix this? I want to play ranked but im afraid my next game same thing will happen and ill get demoted.","replies":[{"poster":"PenguinGives","date":"2016-07-28T06:01:02.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats going on anyone wanna play??\n****","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-19T23:38:51.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate,\n\nI'm happy to give you some more specific feedback if you want, but a search on \"gr8m8er\" didn't show any ranked history (just some bot games).\n\nHowever if you are looking to improve (and off the back of that climb MMR) there are some great resources out there;\n\nFirst up check out these 2 great posts by our Instructor;\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/E5KPW5Qx-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-1\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/xeKp58HJ-playing-like-a-god-but-still-cant-climb-part-2\n\nAlso I always highly suggest checking out these videos. Its great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own game play, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-07-20T02:16:51.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biggest Lie:\n\nTeamwork - In Bronze it's actually a one man team carry, so it's not really Teamwork.\n\nIf you're Bronze, you will know this very well.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-07-20T03:56:16.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"regardless being sportsmanlike can only help your chances.

As long as you go into it with the right mind set (self improvement etc) then you will have overall a good time.\n\nI've been playing ranked for years now and there are always times where I hate this game and love this game at the same time. Playing ranked games is one of the most rewarding experiences for me, its taught me a tonne about not only the game but the kind of mindset and attitude you need to have for life in general.\n\nOnly one other experience has been more enjoyable for me (as a super competitive player) and that is when you play on a semi serious Ranked 5s teams.
