The vessel that had captured and brought it in was now anchored further out, the cheers of celebration from the crew were drowned out by the squall. The moonlight that shone through the storm clouds barely lit the pier, leaving many shadows and areas for the watching figures to hide. The eyes watched the workers as they pulled the baby monster's body onto the racks where they prepared to harvest it.\n\nAs they cut the flesh to drain the creature’s blood, bits of flesh poured out of the beast, signalling the figures to act. Bare feet scurried across the docks, arms grabbing at falling pieces of flesh, the scavengers ran with their rewards, some being grabbed by the workers. A strong hand grabbed a young scavenger boy, who was no more than fourteen. A flintlock pistol pressed into the back of his head as the rough hand pushed him to his knees.\n\nTwelve others had been caught, and were slowly being tied up as the Dock Manager walked into the nearby warehouse, before quickly emerging with another figure. The daunting man’s face was mostly hidden beneath his leather hat revealing only his thin, scarred mouth as he talked with the Dock Manager.\n\n“Half the Serpents and the twelve of them?” The unknown man said as he bent down to the young boy, looking over his body through his drenched clothes. “What’s yer name?”\n\n“Probably can’t talk, most of them are pure dumb, good for ship work though.” The Dock Manager replied.\n\n“I wasn’t talking to you, I was talking to the boy.” The Captain spat.\n\n“Lynch sir, Davil Lynch.” The young boy said cautiously, as he tried to peek under the hats rim.\n\nThe Captain looked at the other scavengers who cowered on the ground, before pointing at four other older men, who were pulled up by the workers and lined up by Lynch.\n\n“Three quarters of the Serpents and these five, these five will barely do.” The Captain looked the Dock Manager in the eyes, while placing his hand on the bump under his coat. The Dock Manager’s jaw tightened as he nodded stiffly, before gesturing for the Captain to enter the Warehouse again.\n\nLynch waited with the other four men, facing the warehouse where their new Captain awaited them. Quiet thuds and squelching noises came from behind them as warm blood splashed against their backs while they waited in the rain, unable to free themselves from the bonds.\n\nLynch watched as the Captain reemerged with another man from the warehouse, quickly placing an envelope under his coat before stepping into the storm. The other man was bony, his gaunt face inspected them, before his eyes landed squarely on Lynch.\n\nThe Captain nodded towards the four others as he grabbed Lynch, and began dragging him away from the docks. Lynch turned around, trying to see the others who were being escorted by the other man. The workers had gone back to harvesting, leaving only two workers to clean up and throw the remains into the churning water where sharks waited below.\n\nLynch gagged at the sight of the red blood that had been mixed with the green blood of the krakens. He turned back around and followed the Captain silently, as they passed through the streets, where shadows watched, fearful of the pistol at his side. \n\nThe Captain’s pace quickened, and as Lynch looked behind them to see why he saw a flick of red hair turning a corner, vanishing from view. The Captain suddenly pulled Lynch into a blocked off side street, covering Lynch’s mouth with his calloused hand.\n\n“We’re being followed boy, one of the workers must have realized, give it to me now.” The Captain said.\n\nLynch hesitated before reaching into his hidden pants pocket and revealing the baby kraken’s second heart, which oozed with thick green blood. The Captain snatched it, placing it underneath his coat.\n\n“No bigger than a human heart and worth half the entire beast.” he whispered to himself.\n\nLynch tried to free himself while the Captain was busy, but the Captain once again placed his hand over Lynch’s mouth, covering his face with the green kraken blood. His hand tightened around Lynch’s mouth, using his strength to push Lynch into the wall and stop his squirming. The Captain’s mouth turned downwards, pulling out his dagger and pressing it against Lynch’s neck.\n\nA piece of paper fell between them suspending time as it slowly descended onto the wet stones. The stained paper showed a scarred man listed as Craggs, glaring fiercely with his thin lips, the text recorded his various crimes and charges.\n\nThe Captain stood up looking towards the rooftops, forgetting his recent scuffle with Lynch. While Lynch pressed his back firmly into the wall, his eyes looked wildly around the alleyway before noticing red hair behind the Captain’s back. The Captain seemed to turn in slow motion, turning to face the red headed figure of a woman, who sat on the barrels opposite them.\n\nThe crackling of gunfire filled the air as the Captain sunk to his knees, revealing the well known bounty hunter in front of Lynch. She let off a brief shrill laugh, before sliding off the barrels and opening his coat. Lynch sat still, his skin covered in scarlet droplets and goosebumps. She pocketed Cragg's locket and his heavy purse, before standing up and gently passing the green ooze covered heart to Lynch. Before turning around and walking out of the alley.\n\n“Don’t get cocky kid, you aren’t worth anything to me, and hope you never are.” She added as she disappeared from his sight.","replies":[{"poster":"MemoryStickGuy","date":"2016-06-26T13:23:18.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a very honest copyright from pirates of the Carry-game...{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"StarzAU","date":"2016-06-27T01:09:18.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What? ._.","replies":[]}]}]}
