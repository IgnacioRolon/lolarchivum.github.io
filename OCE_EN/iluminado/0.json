Thankfully the one person who wasn't in promos dodged for us, however I was not so lucky in the second lobby so i took a hit for them team and dodged queue, instantly forfeiting one of my 3 promo matches.\n\nAll I ask is that Riot looks into this matter and either gives them a warning or temp ban them from ranked solo/duo queue...\n\nIt would also be fantastic if at all possible to create a system which analyses chat before a game starts and forgives a dodge if the words \"i will feed\" appear...\n\nThanks....","replies":[{"poster":"FoxFireAhriTNTF","date":"2015-06-25T13:12:13.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a GOD","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-25T00:29:31.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">\"Everybody take Clairvoyance and Revive \"\n\nThat is a valid tactic. This action alone is not trolling; he/she is merely suggesting a possible technique that the team can use.\n\n>i took a hit for them team and dodged queue\n\nDon't ever think that queue dodging is \"taking one for the team\".\n\nIf a system was implemented that recognised whenever someone said \"I will feed\", and instantly forgave any queue dodgers afterward, then people would just say \"I will feed\" right before they dodge.\n\nNaming names for them to be reported is against the universal board rules.","replies":[]}]}
