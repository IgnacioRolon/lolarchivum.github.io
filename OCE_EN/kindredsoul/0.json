In that game I had a kogmaw adc who raged at our support then left lane to purposely ruining mid (my lane) for no other reason to spite karma, i politely asked him to leave lane but he refused, after several times asking him, he got toxic with me and so did the jungler, i then got frustrated after only getting one game back on the account and i get trolls that purposely ruin the game and then be abusive to the people they ruin it for. I know i was toxic but they were the ones that made me into that mindset due to them purposely ruining the game. So i ask to have the footage of the game reviewed not just the chat but the whole game along side the chat to see why I became toxic towards the members of my team ruining the game and abusing me in the first place. \n\nI am sure many other players experience this as well, where other people troll and intentional ruin the game, so we get pissed off and swear at them to go away after 15min of them not listening, only for us to be the ones banned for their behaviour of purposely ruining the game. It has happened to me on several occasions where people troll, i tell them to stop and im the one reported for it. Fix tribunal to look at the games not the chat, actions speak louder than words remember riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-08-26T03:46:45.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"This community and riot believe you are not to stand up for your self.

At least wait a few weeks if you really feel the need to be a dick in game. No one is forcing you to be toxic. You chose to do it yourself, got reported, and now you face the consequences. Don't blame your teammates. If you are getting frustrated with someone, the best thing to do is just mute them and move on.
