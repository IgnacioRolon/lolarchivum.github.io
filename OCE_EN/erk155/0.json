I'm going to be real upset if they don't ban her/his profile permanently. People need to understand that just cause it's online it doesn't affect people. In reality yes it does affect other gamers. What if you told someone to kys and they actually did, or what if you don't know that their only escape of pain is video games and you tell them to kys and they do it. So with this meme of kys I honestly think people should take consideration and stop the kys stuff cause it's really not cool and it's really immature especially if you say you have common sense but you still use it. I've thrown out my ten-cents. But back to your situation, use common sense about things like this. Not saying you don't have any, but do be aware of what you say cause I know there's been too many times people kill themselves cause of talks like this. Do research and you will know, so I do advice you that you learn from this as well as you might have to email RIOT to see if they will consider unbanning you. No garentees but there's a chance.{{champion:11}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"erk155","date":"2017-12-12T14:14:43.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you're right the random kys in the team chat with no real context other than a little stupid messing around joke was going to make my four friends kill themselves i should've known better","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-12-13T07:31:10.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why dont you say that word outside of your computer screen?
