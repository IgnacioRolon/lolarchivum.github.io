Why then, when I played a game that started when the very last Project mission was active, but finished 4 minutes after the mission was removed, was I not credited as having completed the mission? I met the requirements (I needed to do 38k damage, I did 61k). That seems highly inconsistent and frankly a waste of my time. Either make it so missions are counted as of the time when you complete it, or when you start it, not have these things ruled inconsistently in a way that is beneficial to Riot (you, riot, indirectly save money by me not getting those last 16 tokens, and you gain a larger, more consistent player base by making me play 2 games to complete my daily where I should only have to play one, which also indirectly gains you money. Total scam).","replies":[]}
