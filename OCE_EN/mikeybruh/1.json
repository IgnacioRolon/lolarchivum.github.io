He was a Master Tier EUNE player, with experience coaching in the NACS.\r\nThis speaks to the sort of quality we are looking for in a Head Coach. Our team consists of Diamond/Masters/Challengers and\r\nwe currently have a manager and analyst.\r\n\r\nThe team has a very strong and well organised internal infrastructure, everything is done in a professional manner. For more details apply to the email address provided below, if you have the requisite experience and quality we are looking for, an interview will be arranged.\r\n\r\nRemunerations and rewards are available and generally given out fortnightly. \r\n\r\nPlease send your applications to elysiumesportsoce@gmail.com.","replies":[]}
