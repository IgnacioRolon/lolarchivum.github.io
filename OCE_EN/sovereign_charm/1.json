Bristle was sitting on the ground, next to the bed where Sejuani sat, her head in her hands. Sejuani was happy, for once, after something that wasn&rsquo;t a conquest, but she felt the fight in her veins. She was taught by her mother and father when she was young, to always be on edge, to never stop fighting, and never let up. She laid down on her bed, like Bristle on his carpet, to contemplate, something she had plenty of time for during the less dangerous times of her progression.\r\nThey were different to the others, having completed an arduous journey from the north to the south, the climate being a struggle for the both of them. They prayed for rain, for snow, but the heat didn&rsquo;t let up until they found the seas of the east. They were the latest to test the Gods&rsquo; power, coming across many, but for once not fighting for the sake of it. Something was awry, endangering the Gods, and Sejuani had been given the flail The Warmonger carried. It was not as simple as the legend going around, but the point rang true; that there was something corrupt. The stories she heard of others sounded outlandish, but had the rogue pupil Yi finally found immortality in the sword of jade? \r\n\tAt the moment of her thought, Bristle perks up. Sejuani stands, opening the door and looks up. The seas were in the skies, the movement reflected on the hills. A dragon, one to which both Sejuani and Bristle were ants. Many figures were in the skies, not attempting to stop the calamity.\r\n\t&ldquo;Can you comprehend this, Bristle?&rdquo; Sejuani asked of her only friend. He exerted a jocular squeal. She smiled, only briefly, as his answer, and the fight above made her blood rush. Ichor dripped into the temple of water above the pair, slowly, at first. It began pooling as the girl was bitten and swiped at, and pooled quickly as the dragon was struck through with six blades, and were pulled back to the girl. The dragon was sliced through, defeated. A man fell from it&rsquo;s position, lashing out at the young girl. \r\n\tAnswering Sejuani and her companion&rsquo;s prayers, it began to rain. Initially, it seemed pleasant to be reminded of the cold. Soon, the droplets turned to sheets, and the sheets into the sea. She had already mounted him, as they rode to higher ground. She had no close possessions aside from those on her, so seeing their small home washed away left her feeling nothing for it. Bristle was used to the snow of the north, so the mud was climbed with ease. They reached the highest ground they could as the water arose rapidly. If they were to drown, so be it. \r\n\tThe Warmonger&rsquo;s flail begins to glow on Sejuani&rsquo;s back, and she pulls it out, examining it. It glows a light orange hue, a tone emits from it as she holds it. The water is at Bristle&rsquo;s knees, and he holds his head above the water, looking upwards and back at Sejuani, who begins to rightly panic. The water is still torrenting down, and is splashing around them in large pillars. They look up, and brace for what will surely knock them off their perch. But it never lands. \r\n\tThe flail rings out, and Sejuani and Bristle feel a familiar cold above them. The water has frozen above them, creating large, perilous icicles the size of a greatsword. Sejuani laughs as the ice spreads as far as they can see. The Warmonger&rsquo;s flail harnessed their strength. Maniacal laughter bellows from the woman as the boar follows suit. \r\n\tPerhaps they weren&rsquo;t finished in their conquest.","replies":[]}
