There are two characters that come to mind the First is Erika from Fire Emblem Sacred Stones and Lucina from Fire Emblem Awakening. These two use Rapiers as weapons and are perfect candidates for Fiora i will leave some images to show you.. they do have capes yes but I&#039;m sure there is some exception Riot can do if this becomes an actual thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-28T13:39:00.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could also imagine a fire emblem yasuo skin","replies":[{"poster":"Vegekuson","date":"2015-03-28T15:35:52.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that could work make him be one of the Myrmidon Characters.. take your pick from more than 10 Fire Emblems","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T09:59:42.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fiora has like 4+ skins, but this would be pretty awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-03-28T11:55:15.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=OOFA8HpF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-28T09:59:42.267+0000)\n>\n> Fiora has like 4+ skins, but this would be pretty awesome.\n\nFiora only has 3 skins. 2 that she was released with and a Harrowing one.
