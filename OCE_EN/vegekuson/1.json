We weren't looking forward to them as we started to think of some. My personal Favourite would be Vladimir as we can see a Summer or pool party theme for him.\r\n\r\nHe holds a Water Ballon like he does with the blood  in his default skin. He is Shirtless and wears board shorts and a towel wrapped around his waist. He wears a massive Sun Hat and a pair of sunglasses. I know he isn't a vampire but it would be a nice and fun mix to add. \r\n\r\nParticle Effects:\r\n\r\nQ can be a towel whip lash as he damages and flings his towel back healing him\r\n\r\nW can form a Kid's Wadding pool like those inflatable pools. Can have maybe a Rubber duck or floaters inside the pool.\r\n\r\nE can end up being the Water Balloons thrown at the surrounding enemies that get in range of him.\r\n\r\nR Finally his ult was tricky to think of but maybe massive splash of water where he casts. \r\n\r\nRecall would be him jumping in the pool but he falls in like its deeper than it looks from the summoner's point of view. it was tricky to think of but some comedic act would be something fun within this skin. i am no artist but hopefully later on i may add a concept idea for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI love Vlad as a champion and i like his legendary and his Soul Stealer skin. But if this skin was made it would be my top favourite.","replies":[{"poster":"life for life ","date":"2015-02-26T13:34:22.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i was looking forward to buy the soul steal skin to lol i have 5k RP i wanna spend on champions and skin \ni was thinking i should some what buy at least like 2 lengendary skin","replies":[{"poster":"Vegekuson","date":"2015-02-28T06:40:30.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bloodlord and another legendary of a champ you like to play.. like for me its Aether Wing Kayle","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T23:55:24.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is great, he could fall into the pool and drown as a recall.\nand his W could just be him morphing into water but idk if that's too bland or not","replies":[{"poster":"Vegekuson","date":"2015-02-28T06:38:23.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no all ideas are welcome... i do like the pool though and drowning part what of thats his death animation. his others have him drowning in blood until its a pool so maybe that idea can be moved to death animation","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-27T04:15:56.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Q can be a towel whip lash as he damages and flings his towel back healing him\n\nThe problem with this is that it originates at the enemy not at Vlad, if you Q someone past a Yas wind wall, you will hit your Q, but you won't get the health back (as it's a projectile)","replies":[{"poster":"Vegekuson","date":"2015-02-28T06:36:55.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point about that.. i was hoping for something to mix with his Q then again water particles arent bad at all its not a Legendary maybe a 975 or 1350 skin","replies":[]}]}]}
