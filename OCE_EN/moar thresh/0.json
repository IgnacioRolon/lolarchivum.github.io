That sure would limit the burst potential, both by lessening their damage output, and reducing the incoming damage also.\nI could be completely wrong, but I have a feeling in my loins that GA may become a staple in basically every build over the course of the next few months.\nThen again, I'm a filthy bronzie so what do I know.","replies":[]}]}
