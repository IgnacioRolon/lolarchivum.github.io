That try and not be salty, try and work together as a team but the majority of the people on this server make that very very difficult. There is only so many times someone can take the crap from other people until the snap back and then it seems that it is the people that have been trying to do the right thing get banned and punished rather than the people that have been abusing people for far longer.

Your point?\n\n> **the majority of the people on this server** make that very very difficult...\n> In nearly** 650 games**\n\nYes, because there are less than 11700 people on the OCE server, not only that but the majority of people in all the games you've played have made it very difficult, meaning your win rate should be something like 25%...\n\nI could go on but I think I've made my point.","replies":[{"poster":"Ethandabom1","date":"2014-12-11T07:20:36.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually pandas right, Nothing happens when you report people.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-11T07:32:54.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ethandabom1,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KHZrbRVk,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2014-12-11T07:20:36.421+0000)\n> *Actually pandas right*, Nothing happens when you report people.\n\nIf nothing happens when you report people then this statement (from panda): \"it seems that it is the people that have been trying to do the right thing get banned and punished \" is false but oh, wait, panda is right!

OCE became a thing in mid 2013, the tribunal was taken down by Riot earlier this year, in 2014, to be made more efficient. That's half a years difference minimum.\n\n> **reporting obviously does nothing.** I will be physically in the same room as half my team when doing premades and we all report people that are causing problems yet **nothing happens to them.**\n\nI'd really love to see some evidence supporting that statement.

The underlying problem is that there are still a large number of people that are ruining games for others. Now, this clearly means that our current options aren't working.\nRiot clearly needs to take a different approach in tackling these behaviors.\n\nI'm not even sure whether or not it's possible for riot to really change the way people behave over the internet, yet alone in their game.  Maybe the best way to deal with this kind of thing is to develop some form of ingame monitoring system that might bring more threat to those with abusive behaviour in-game -well, it would certainly be a lot more effective than your average customer support rep from Riot ..
