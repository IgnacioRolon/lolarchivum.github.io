Poor management of him caused him to be bug-ridden and almost unplayable. However recently Azir was in a really good spot with changes to his e allowing him to follow his q acquiring extra distance for chase and disengaging. The several rather toxic buffs were the ratio changes to his q and w, it allowed him to poke down and be a lane bully while being a little too safe and not having other weaknesses other then assassins or ranged mages. In my opinion Azir needs an entire change to his kit. This is just my idea of some of the changes...\r\n\r\nPassive: Shurima's Legacy \r\nSun Disc: This ability is key to his character and his lore it is perfect as it is.\r\n\r\nCool down reduction to attacks speed: This will be changed to 2% attack speed for every 1% of cool down reduction he has. \r\n\r\nHis passive is pretty self explanatory the more cool down reduction he has the more attack speed although this ratio has increased it is still strong and will require Azir to purchase cool down reduction to achieve the most from his passive.\r\n\r\nQ changes do not change his live gameplay:\r\n\r\nHis q will start off with a base cd of 18 sec\r\nbut go down 3 secs every level put into it\r\n18/15/12/9/6\r\nbase damage is 80/90/100/120/140\r\n0.6 ap scaling\r\nmana cost: 50/60/70/80/90\r\nhowever his slow stacks 45%\r\n\r\nThis change will allow the enemy some breathing room between getting bombarded early by q's and Auto Attacks. While this is more rewarding to hit for Azir then current Live q it is on a longer cool down and the mana is significantly lowered early as well but steadily grows. This makes Azir think about his early game and when he should poke or engage. Azir should be weak to mobile people who can reposition as he controls parts of the lane.\r\n\r\nW changes affect live gameplay:\r\n\r\nw changes are simple he gains distance by level\r\n350 units level 1\r\n375 units level 6\r\n400 units level 11\r\n425 units level 16\r\n\r\nMana cost: 30/30/30/30/30\r\n0.6 ap scaling\r\nAzir will be able to store 2 soldiers maximum and they will last for a total of 10 seconds and last only 2 at turret range. \r\n\r\nBut instead of dealing flat nukes to turrets consuming a stack of ARISE will cause azir to gain a burst of attack speed lasting 1.5/2.5/3.5/4.5/5.5 seconds depending on level of the skill.\r\n\r\nThese changes will cause Azir to have a healthy range during landing while scaling into late game to the monster he should be. Azir should not be picked as a champion that can be picked into any team comp while he needs to fit into it, match ups for him are more important then most champions. This change will also allow to help Azir siege healthily while also gaining bursts of attack speed which could be used for interesting dives.\r\n\r\nE changes are not changing his live gameplay\r\nCurrently his shield scales with maximum health and it is really not effective as dashing to an opponent is usually a last effort to win. \r\nSo as a result maximum health scaling is replaced with 0.2 ap scaling.\r\nDamage on Collision:\r\n60/90/120/150/180\r\nScaling with 0.4 ap\r\nShield received from collision:\r\n100/140/180/220/260\r\nScaling with 0.2 ap\r\nCurrently on live Azir's e is on a 19/18/17/16/15 cool down but this should be changed to 20 at all ranks to strengthen and stress Azir's play style to fight from afar and not head on.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change to him however will be to his ult...\r\nHis ult will be in a sense very tactical and not very functional in one on one confrontations, however it will be a great tool in team fights and allow Azir to distance himself and his squishy allies from the enemy frontline.\r\n\r\nHis ult will slowly travel with him while there still will be the initial charge of the ult the knock back the ult will encircle him to form a half a circle formation.\r\nAs Azir walks he will have his ms reduced but will have a defensive wall following him for 10 secs. \r\nDue to this massive buff of utility on this moving wall it will do no damage just create CC and impassable terrain for the enemy team. The main thing remaining will be the speed boost from the wall to allies however it will scale with level of the ability:\r\n20%/30%/40% movement speed boost will decay over 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any enquiries or anything to add to this change please comment below and tell me what could be better.","replies":[]}
