The first bug is when his soldiers miss an attack they will continually attack mid air nothing, however this resets the attack timer resulting in missed auto attacks (basically azirs damage is canceled) The second bug is rare however i still have found it when placing a turret it will try to keep spawning for a very long time when this happened for me it took an odd 15 seconds to spawn. thirdly this bug is more annoying then a real game breaking bug, nevertheless it is bad. When using your weq combo through certain walls the new wall collision system usually shoves you to fail or glitch into the wall. Also when using the combo sometimes your e does not register meaning you do not receive a shield even though clearly hitting the opponent. The fourth major bug is following on through 5.7 that auto attacks still make sound effects but do not do damage to the opponent. Bug number 1 and number 4 happens the most and affects gameplay the most. on a side note his ult is still buggy even though i noted it in a message to riot that some dashes are now going through his ult most notably yasuo dash this was not fixed in 5.8 although this is extremely rare it does happen.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-30T14:30:35.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">patch 4.8\n\nJust saying.","replies":[]}]}
