Just finished SR and for more detailed stats i had to go and open internet browser, which is annoying as it was a good feature on old client. And chat window could have been a bit bigger so i wouldn't need to look for it with magnifying glass. Other than that, looks really cool.\n\nEdit: Also there is no \"quit\" button at champion select screen and for what ever reason i need to abandon the game, i  need to shut down the client itself. It would be nice to have a \"quit\" button like on custom games, so i wont need to restart the LoL client and relog back to the game. Also also on champion select when you arrange champions by their class (marksmen, tank and etc.) there is no option to go back to have ALL champions back on selection screen. So once you pressed a class group, no going back to see all champs or did i miss something there.","replies":[]}]}
