But I started climbing and earlier in this week got into silver and am now climbing that again.\n\nAnd overall in Bronze the people aren't that bad attitude wise and as for those that were I would just ignore them and focus on my own game. I played vayne and was farming and pushing most of the time. Times that my team got mad at me for that was completely over shadowed by the end of the game when I carried, even if my team was all negative in score and attitude earlier in the game.\n\nThe point is to not let it effect you. Don't tell anyone they are bad, just focus on your own game. Learn how the champion you are playing should be played and then do it. You'll see that every champion is meant to be played in a certain way. Learn when the champ is the strongest and weakest then play around that.\nYou'll see that as soon as you start improving your own game and carrying or making big plays as support then your team will become less aggressive to you. Because remember - Everyone just wants to have a good time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-03-11T13:21:57.418+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"age>iq in this game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-12T00:44:45.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-12T03:34:43.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ahNkWY6Z,comment-id=0008,timestamp=2015-03-12T00:44:45.065+0000)\n>\n> Go write a book then.
