So i think its normal. \nBe thankful your computer is nice metal that can take some heat, and not cheap crappy plastic like windows are.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-02T04:06:40.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or.

As long as the computer is able to withstand the heat that is being generated (consult the owners manual or contact the manufacturer) it's not an issue.
