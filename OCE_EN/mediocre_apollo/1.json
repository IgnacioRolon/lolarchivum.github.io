(endlessly playing against the same champs, Mirror matchups etc..)\r\nIsn&#039;t it time we have an option other than Ranked or blind pick? The playerbase for OCE is pretty stable. when we had normal draft before it was removed (which was a mistake in my opinion) i would get a match regularly under 5 minutes. That means there was plenty of people playing it.\r\n\r\nWhen Ranked queue was down earlier today we only had one option, Blind pick.\r\nTHAT is a problem.\r\nWe have to play in blind pick against champions that are Known problems. that haven&#039;t been nerfed yet.\r\nTHAT is a problem.","replies":[]}
