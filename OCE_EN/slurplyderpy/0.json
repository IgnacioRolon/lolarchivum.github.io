I found that there was a surprising amount of posts on the subject. None of them were anything special or shocking given the time of the posts, but considering all the changes to the game from then to now. I believe the topic is up for discussion. While I don&#039;t think he is going to show up in the LCS anytime soon, I do believe at this stage of the season, he can be a very strong pick. FTR I do play this in ranked. I don&#039;t think im god but currently at 55% win rate I am climbing, so there&#039;s that.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-21T06:42:48.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never understand these posts, its always the same answer: \"yes he can jungle, most champions can, I'm sure soraka could jungle if you really tried, But like most off-meta junglers, they just aren't as good as the regular junglers.\"\n\nGalio's entire function is to counter mages, now I'm not sure about you, but i don't seem to run into many mages in the jungle, so your extraordinary passive isn't doing much. In the mid lane however, where you encounter lots of mages, it is doing an awful lot more, its like taking Kindred ADC, yes her auto attacks do damage like all other ADC's and yes she is ranged like all other ADC's but unlike al other ADC's her passive requires her to roam into the enemy jungle, and that is a significant disadvantage becasue either \n1. you dont use your passive, or\n2. you leave lane and wander all the way up to top lane to kill the krugs (hoping like hell that the nocturne that has it out for you, hasn't got them already) and miss 2 lvls worth of experience\nneither option puts you in a favourable position.\n\nGalio's abilites have fairly lengthy cooldowns, so most of the time you'll just be auto attacking the monster camps (which doesn't do an awful lot when you're an AP/tank) you are also a MR tank not an armour tank like rammus, and MR doesn't help you at all in the jungle. So 2 of the things you build (AP and MR) arent helping you that much in the jungle.\nyour ganks are also very lackluster without your ult. \n\nyoull probbaly find that whatever Jungle Galio can do, Jungle Zac does 20% better. Therefore you are putting your team at a disadvantage by taking galio instead of Zac.\n\nalso with the increasing number of AD teams (taking Yas/Zed/etc etc mid and only having a singed or swain for AP) Galio has less and less of a job and starts to be a waste pick.\n\nSure if you got jungle, your team has no AD or tanks, and the enemy team is a Singed/Fiddle/Syndra/Corki/Lux then by all means go jungle Galio, but if your team already has a mage, and the enemy team only has 1 AP champion, then you are wasting pick by going an inefficient champion. \n\nThat kind of inefficiency doesnt happen anywhere near as often with normal junglers, Lee-Sin is going to be a strong pick pretty much against any team comp, so is Udyr and Xin. \n\nso yes, galio can jungle, and in specific situations I'm sure it does okay, but just not as good (for as much of the time) as the proper junglers.\n\nim not saying don't play him jungle, its always fun playing off-meta champions, I'm just saying don't play him jungle in my ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"SlurplyDerpy","date":"2016-06-23T04:21:05.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experince with Galio I find his passive doesn't synergise with the rest of his kit. The only reason it works on rammus is because armor stats are versitile almost no matter what. While I can see your main gripe with these posts, the intent of this discussion isn't if he can jungle. Like you said almost anyone can with various success rates. It was to shed some light and an old champion and perhaps a new interesting way to play him. \n\nBut back to the points you made.\n\nI have found to Galio to be a weak early game champion who hyper-scales into late game, with a high mana sink, semi low cooldowns, sustain, burst damage, and utility with MS buffs, slows and aoe. Almost a **discount** juggernaut if you will. However you could argue that he will just get shutdown early and will become a soak. Being in lane this is a likely possibility, under constant pressure from your laner, and the jungler even with the great new mana items due to the above point he can't farm well early, which sets him up to fail 9 times out 10. With this infomation you can see why he is underplayed.\n\nBut lets take a look at this \"extraordinary passive\" you mention. \"50% MR to AP\" Seems great against mages at first but lets go a bit deeper, if by some luck you're going Galio into a 4 or 5 man ap team you can come to expect the damage type to either be burst or sustained damage and with up 4 people with AP damage, it is likey to have both types in said team, so its look at how Galio fairs with these damage types. \n\nFirst of all lets look at sustained damage. Galio usually fairs pretty well against sustained damage with his W, the low damage ticks are an easy half or full heal, depending on your build, and unless your going up against another sustain heavy champion it's a pretty one sided fight In Galio's favor. \nNext on the list is Burst damage, champions with burst damage usually have some form of CC to back it up which leaves Galio in an awkward position where he has to build tanky to survive but get kited or do enough to damage or burst them before they burst you and likely die anyway. \nSo now we have maybe 3-4 people with a mix of burst and sustained damage and don't have to explain how Galio with get cheesed in match up with all the the amount of magic peneration in the game. So now in this game with a Galio who doesn't do enough damage to be viable as a mage and isn't tanky enough and doesn't have enough utility to be viable as a tank. But you could say and I would agree with you build utility items like Banner, Abyssel, Iceborn, etc. but then you outclassed by that full HP Volibear who shreds your team. \n\nWhat I'm saying here is that Galio's passive isn't as good as you think it is and even in a full AP match up, it is not reliable. So instead of going full blown MR builds all the time, I build tanky, utility with additonal slows to help the team stuff like Iceborn or Banner and for boots I like to pick Ninja Tabi because it synergises with Galio's ult better, with enough damage items like Runic Echos, and Deathcap, with leaves me with a bunch of damage to anyone who hasn't built full blown tank and enough aoe and utility to keep my carries alive and killing.\n\nSo I guess the main question is can Galio match up to the other top tier junglers. Within this question there is obivous downsides, its like that with any champion. If you take a look at Lee Sin, you would find he has a lot of early pressure with great ganks and clear times to carry his team through the mid game and finish at around 30-40 mins. However you would also find he doesn't scale as hard as some other junglers, like Maokai for example, of course on the other side of the spectrum Maokai doesn't have the god like early pressure like Lee Sin. but what does have is great utility and enough damage to carry his team from mid to late game finishing around 40-50 min mark.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that Galio will never (unless reworked) be a Lee Sin or Udyr, but he is a great late game champion like Zac or Maokai. So what does Galio have that can compare him to someone like Maokai. Good CC, average clear before Runic Echos, (fanstastic afterwards) and decent ganks without ultimate, depending on the situation. Your not going to see me going for tower dives without my ult like a Xin Zao would.\n\nI know this is a long read and thank you for reading this far if you did. But matter of fact is, it is alot eaiser to die in mid lane than it is in jungle giving Galio an easier time to build up for the late game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-06-21T10:34:00.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes makes a great cinderhulk tank and that w sustain dirty dirty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-20T09:51:19.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"galio has good teamfight potential, a good ult makes or brakes teamfights\n\nhe is good any role except adc","replies":[]}]}
