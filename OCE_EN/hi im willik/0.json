I started playing ranked with him and (his account that is s2). He is really decent at the game and carries/does good most games. So my question is can i actually get banned for playing with someone that carries some games. Does it count as &quot;duo boosting&quot; and if you can get banned why is this as many people who play league would not be able to play with high elo friends and stuff like that. I am very worried about getting banned as i have invested alot of time and money into this game. can someone clear things up so i dont have to be worried when duoing with people. so basically to summarise can you get banned for duoing with a smurf or someone who is good. hopefully this made sense and someone can answer.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-02-25T10:57:30.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes you can get banned for duoing with someone far exceeding your rank\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-27T05:50:49.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean hacking the system to enable it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"hi im willik","date":"2018-02-25T11:00:59.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what do you mean by \"far\" exceeding your rank. Riot has made it so bronze and silver can duo so why is it that they allow this if you can be banned for it. I also saw a post on the NA forums with a rioter confirming that you cant get banned for it? Out of curiosity how do you know this?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-02-25T11:35:20.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont get ban for it. But consider this. Once the boosting friend stop and you are playing on your own, it wont be long untill you fall back down. If you were to join a flex team, the rank that you got not with skills, players will know you are boosted.\n\nOnce people who played with you found out the hard way, your reputation will hit ground zero.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-25T12:30:30.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The way I understand it is that so long as you are using your own account, it's not punishable. Basically, \"account sharing for boost\" = \"ban-able\" while \"duo queue (regardless of skill/smurf)\" = \"not punishable\".\n\nI don't really agree with the sentiment, but duo boosting, by it's very nature, is something that would be extraordinarily hard to \"police\", so it may just come down to available resources (and such).","replies":[{"poster":"hi im willik","date":"2018-02-25T12:45:53.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by “available resources” and thanks for the reply !","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-26T01:20:02.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What I mean by \"available resources\" is the manpower, hardware/software, finances etc. that Riot have available. As I said, the nature of duo boosting makes it hard to \"police\", so it may just be something that Riot can't put enough resources towards for it to actually be viable to \"police\", especially considering how long, and how much effort, it currently takes for gameplay offences to be dealt with.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-02-25T11:18:56.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. Playing with friends is not bannable.
