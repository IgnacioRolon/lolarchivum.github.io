If it only happens every now and again you won't receive any punishment, but if it is a consistent problem and you continue to play knowing that then you can expect to face low priority queues. \n\nWithout knowing the whole situation, it sounds like you got done by leaver buster from your post, which would indicate this isn't the first time it has happened. If that is the case then all I can say is consider for a moment how the other 9 people felt and accept it. \n\nIf I'm mistaken and you didn't get leaver busted then don't worry about it, the warnings only exist to say \"hey, if you do this too often you're going to face a punishment\" and don't guarantee any future punishment.","replies":[]}]}
