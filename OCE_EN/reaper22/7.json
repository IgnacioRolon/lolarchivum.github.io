So i wouldn't recommend building AD on her. The best way is probably just build tank. Assuming u are asking for a support build maybe try this : {{item:3401}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3117}}{{item:2045}}   . Not sure how this build would work but it should work very well if you ever get to full build :P. Other than that max Q and E 1st for the CC because i don't think W will be very useful. Try to get 10% CDR from masteries and you will have 40% cdr with frozen heart and Face of the mountain, with 40% cdr your ult will hopefully be up everytime u need it for the teamfights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T22:40:02.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really sure how that would work or be good but you could search some builds and test it.
