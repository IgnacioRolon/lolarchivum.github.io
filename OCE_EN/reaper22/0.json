I play olaf alot ive put alot time on olaf cause i think that hes very good champion to play with. i wanna use olaf in Rank for sup or mid  but im more worry that the people i play with might not feel the same way.

Any advise will help me a lot thanks","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-04-22T10:49:46.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so here's why people might not react well to Olaf support, or Kennen support.\n\nIn your last 20 games, there is a bunch of games there which I assume are played support. In these 20 games, you have averaged 4.6/10.4/7.2.\nNow, generally kda isnt much to go on, yes. But when you play Olaf - you have very very little utility. When you are contributing little damage due to your low income, what else are you doing? All you're doing is giving free kills to the enemy.\n\nNow, as a fighter you averaged 8.3 wards per game in your last 10 games. As a support, you averaged 9.2. Does this seem like a good number to you? I feel as though you are not playing support to support. You are filling a role that is there to support the team, and turning it into a walking meat shield that can just be ignored","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-22T07:43:57.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[You can't actually be banned for not playing meta champions. ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q5) So on that front it looks like you're safe.\n\nThe big issue with not sticking to meta comes with your team being negative towards you, and sometimes this can cause fights to break out. If you get involved in these fights and start exhibiting some of the negative behaviour, you can be banned for that. To avoid this, mute people in your games at the first sight of negativity and communicate through pings. Another thing you can do is play in a 5man premade made of people that don't care what support you play.\n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-22T07:43:31.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta exists for a reason.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-05T15:11:45.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just do it with a duo partner and tell the team you are LemonNation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2016-05-05T01:05:53.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just think to yourself before choosing a champion for support. \"How does this champion help my adc do well?\"\nIf you're comfortable with that answer then go ahead. I would personally always play meta supports in ranked because it just works.\nI have played things like fiora support and it's all worked fine for me, but my adc was always so behind because they lost cs during my skrimishes and they only got assists.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-22T17:56:19.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with support Olaf is that when we are talking about picking a support, we're talking not just about the early game but also mid-game contributions. These contributions exist in several forms, high base damage, CC, potential stick, innate tankiness, and engage potential. \n\nYou may win some games, you may win lanes, hell you might even stomp your lanes in some games, but one of the most important features of being a support is being able to play from behind because that's what you will be 70% of the time. Let's assume you don't stomp your opponent outright, you don't get many kills or assists. Early game, you have a slow, you have high base damage, sustain for yourself, you have relic to sustain your adc, you can use your axes to harass your opponent and can potentially be very successful, at the mid-game, your damage will have probably dropped considerably, The enemy team will probably be able to melt you even with your ult since your life steal passive doesn't have the damage output you need and won't sustain you enough during team fights.  Olaf lacks any peel, so if the enemy team alls in with say for example a Leona, your ADC will most likely burn his/her flash or die.\n\nIf we rely on his CC he only has a ranged slow, if we rely on his damage he fell off mid-game, if we use him as engager he will soak too much damage to survive as opposed to other supports. Zyra provides huge amounts of damage and utility, trundle provides sustain, slow, a pillar to displace and scales off HP, alongside heavy chase potential, Leona has incredible engagement potential and a game changing ultimate which can win team fights, blitz and thresh can hook a target, while thresh can save an ally and disable channel type abilities with his E.\n\n\nSure Olaf might excell early on but there are better choices and picks than olaf to support especially since your enemy will also be using these picks to their advantage.
