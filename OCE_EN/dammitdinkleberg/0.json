Practically unplayable. Fiddled with the setting, followed youtubes of old and checked my own setting. The only slight change came for reticking the vertical sync under the fps cap selection.\r\n\r\nIt has happened 3 out of 3 times plus carries over into customs. \r\n\r\nOnly thing that has changed was the new client being installed. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to fix it or if its a known bug?","replies":[{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2016-11-15T12:07:18.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this problem as well, I made sure i had the current drivers but still occurring.
