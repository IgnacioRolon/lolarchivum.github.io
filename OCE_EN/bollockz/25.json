Would be great if one shoutcaster could stream aswell as shoutcast. Would also love for the 2 streamers to have prior work experience alone and/or together, if not we can set you up now so you have time to learn a few things.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n**bollockz**","replies":[{"poster":"Aircrow","date":"2015-12-04T10:55:09.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-12-05T02:10:47.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aircrow,\n\nThis is absoloutely perfect. I don't know if you know \"Smite\" in-game but I'm pretty sure he casted the same games! (Or Deakin Uni, one of them)\n\nCasting experience is kind of necessary for the role, but, in saying that if you are comfortable working with your brother that can be arranged as I understand family and how close they can be. \n\nI'll add you in-game and if you aren't on in a few days I'll e-mail you.\n\nOnce again, really appreciate the offer and the backend support from Riot.\n\nCheers,\nJesse","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VerlorenLore","date":"2015-12-01T19:23:32.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on the dates i may be able to fill in as a last resort shoutcaster, bearing in mind I have no prior experience at shoutcasting specifically (I have done a bit of public speaking though if that counts).

We may also have a new way for letting inexperienced shoutcasters get their chance! \nI really appreciate the comment.
