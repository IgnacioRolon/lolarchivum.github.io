It's awesome that you'd be so aware of the negative connotation of your summoner name, and we certainly appreciate your willingness to change it. I understand how it could be taken in a negative light, but it's not outwardly offensive and it doesn't look as though it's bothering players you're engaged with. If that were to change in the future we may be required to take action, but for now we'll be unable to provide a name change. You still have the option of purchasing one though the client store though!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or concerns!\n\nMoonsugar\nPlayer Behavior and Game Support\nLunari Justiciar\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-11-18T10:18:10.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not joining man im doing my own shit on xmas haha","replies":[]}]}
