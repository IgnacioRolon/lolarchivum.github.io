I understand it has a huge power spike for champions, but it has no utility AND what I did realise is that, Rabadon&#039;s doesn&#039;t give you any extra FLAT AP on completing the recipe. The same amount of AP is received from the Rod, Wand and Tome, on completion of the recipe all you get is 30% bonus AP. Yes 30% spike is quite substantial, but why is it like the only item to not grant recipe flat bonus and only a unique passive?","replies":[{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-10-24T21:44:21.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because it would become the first AP item everyone rushes?","replies":[{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-10-24T21:52:27.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still it makes no sense, lower the % and raise flat.","replies":[{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-10-24T23:15:36.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rabadon's is an item you buy preferably when you have AP items (you can buy it before then but scale-wise later on is better). How does it not make sense? You couldn't raise the flat AP on the completed recipe without the scaling being nerfed considerably.

Let's take a look at another example:\n\n{{champion:103}} W/35% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 120AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 648\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/30% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 130AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 637\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/25% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 140AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 625\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/20% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 150AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 612\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/15% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 160AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 598\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/10% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 170AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 583\n\n\n\n{{champion:103}} W/5% Rabadon's \n{{item:3165}} 80AP\n{{item:3020}} \n{{item:3285}} 100AP\n{{item:3089}} 180AP\n{{item:3135}} 80AP\n{{item:3157}} 100AP\n\nTotal AP: 567\n\n\n\nBear in mind that I haven't included AP runes or masteries, but as you can see the higher the flat/lower the percentage the lower the overall benefit is late game. \n\nOverall, yes the flat bonus looks very attractive but it then falls on the issue that I pointed out in that it would become *the* AP item to rush. The game already suffers a slight lack of AP itemization (looking at you Luden's) without adding to that.\n\nMaybe explain your position a little better? \n\nThank you! :3","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-25T20:24:13.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thhhhhhhhhhhis","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-25T23:59:02.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any idea how strong the pimp hat makes you once you've got a couple of items?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-25T20:40:47.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot dont want EVERY SINGLE champ that has considerable ap scalings to just get rabadons and immediately be able to stomp anyone. the considerable scaling is there to reward people who build specifically ap by giving them a larger amount of ap which they will have access to, and increase the amount of, through getting other ap items. the rabadons passive recipe cost by itself is 965, which is like 45-50 ap compared to blasting wand. you will get your moneys worth and then even more if you have like 150 ap, which is the rabadons itself and then perhaps the total ap from runes and masteries, at level 18. \n\nthe pros here are that when you buy more ap, you will be rewarded with even MORE ap. the downside is that this item takes up a spot of a potential utility/defensive/tanky/....unique....passive reward thingy......so like you couldnt buy something like rylais will of the ancients zhonyas, all of which have great effects besides raw stats. the rabadons are more for mages/assassins that specifically want to damage their enemies\n\ngetting a rabadons at 4th/5th item should be acceptable, especially in solo queue. the reason you'll see a lot more of the pros get it is because they have better mechanics in their safer play in general as well as their teammates to back them up. the problem with getting it so late is since it has 3 items for its recipe if you do end up being only able to buy the 3 recipe items, that takes up 3 items in your inventory, and at 20-25 minutes thats a really big deal, especially if you have boots and were planning on warding","replies":[]}]}
