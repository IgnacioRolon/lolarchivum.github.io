It&#039;s pretty much a risky engag that every can obtain. Give it mainly tank stats, prob armour AP and health. Kind like how Zhonyas is a uniqe tool for anyone, giving them a few seconds of immunity, this can be a unique item to give those thank lack engages a chance to get into the fight.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-25T20:21:49.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there'd be so much potential if riot just released a whole bunch of fun new items. black market brawlers items were literally the most fun thing about the mode. dead mans plate is a great appropriate item to have brought into the game permanently but now i still feel limited in the way i can play a champ in simply his build path if that makes cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-10-24T23:37:21.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds a little like Vengeful Spirit's ultimate. (Dota 2)\n\nIt does sound useful, but unfortunately you might get a troll that uses it to swap a squishy into the middle of the enemy team. I mean, if they add a check for enemy CC on the target you want to swap with (similar to how the crucible works on removing CC) then it would be a great item for the tanks to potentially make some great saves.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-25T20:19:33.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow you're right. i cant imagine how much destruction that can cause for your own team. as if bard and tahm kench werent enough as an already enormous potential for trolling","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-25T04:54:40.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"crucible does same thing - the swap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-25T02:35:12.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.....
