I think there is a lot of varied possibilities for Galio if he was to be reworked. His shield is decent, but it could push him into a more full support position if they made it transfer a bit of damage to galio when it was on an ally.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-13T10:47:01.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So like the Paladin's Shield item from Terraria, where you absorb some of the damage that is dealt to your teammates.\n\n I second this, this would make Galio a pretty damn good niche pick for support (At least it does in my head :P).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"2Kills1Cat","date":"2015-05-13T10:40:04.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shield op worse than thornmail never attack galio or u cry to death.

If it was a self cast ability, yeah sure, it may work, but if he was up against someone like Cassiopia, he would gain stacks too fast. He's good as he is atm, doesn't really need much to change","replies":[]}]}
