After checking my network and finding no obvious reason for the lag spike (was only one on network, and traffic was normal) I decide to try and restart the router. Restarted router and PC, internet working fine (im on it now), tried to reconnect and get the above message (&quot;We are unable to log you on because you may be online&quot;). Now LOL is randomly patching some ~40mb patch.\r\n\r\nThis same thing happened on the weekend (lagged out during a game, couldn&#039;t get back on and then LOL started to patch), resulting in a leaver penalty which I just got rid of. My question is  - if I get another leaver penalty  due to this latest incident, I am able to have it removed as it was due to circumstances entirely outside of my control? (random server issue then patch)","replies":[{"poster":"dyshendra","date":"2017-06-15T13:38:24.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"update: I have been able to log back on after the mystery patch, no leavers penalty (yet). My ping is still ~800ms (in a practice tool game) with not reason for this on my end (still next to no traffic on network, am able to stream HD from youtube no problems).\n\nupdate 2: d3 working fine so its not my connection","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-06-17T23:12:29.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please do the following for me;\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
