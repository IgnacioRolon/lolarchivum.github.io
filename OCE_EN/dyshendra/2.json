First match in promo ended up being a remake by the other team, lost the next then won the following. I assumed having had won one game + free win, the promo series would have been successful and I would have moved to S3. However the promo series is sitting at 1 win / 1 loss atm.\r\n\r\nIs this intended?","replies":[{"poster":"dyshendra","date":"2017-10-25T10:43:08.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Wuks. I won the match and thus the promo series none the less (but it would have been pretty crap not to considering I won a game and should have had a free win), though by if it wasn't for the vanishing free win I should be up a win LP wise.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-25T10:57:14.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, it's great to hear that you promo'd.
