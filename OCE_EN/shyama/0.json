{"poster":"Shyama","date":"2015-02-23T22:08:53.509+0000","title":"Leauge Of Legends New Arrival {Frozen Watcher}","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ok, so here is what I have compiled,  The character will be *\"the Frozen Watcher\"* So Ice damage and *\"Watcher\"* Meaning support, *\"winters herald dominates the night skies\"*, suggesting that maybe there might be a temporary change to map? *\"A horde of these strange creatures once enslaved the tribes of the freljord\"* Characters related to freljord are *\"Ashe\" \"Tryndamere\" \"Anivia\" \"Nunu\" and \"Gragas\"*. \n\nAshe's lore says *\"she pursues her goal of uniting the tribes of the Freljord and forging them into a mighty nation.\"* Suggesting that this character new character has attacked Freljord, *\"she marveled at the colossal, abandoned fortresses of her ancestors\"* These fortresses might have been taken over by the new character, Ashes lore states that she is rivals with *\"Sejuani\"* who is another *\"Dark\" winter warrior\" *\n\n\nTryndamere lore states that *\"The wrathful barbarian seeks revenge on the one who decimated his clan and strikes down all those who stand between him and his final retribution.\" Stating that he wants to get revenge on the people who took down Freljord, now this next bit is where it gets exciting, \"Raiders ambushed Tryndamere's clan in the dead of night, and though his warriors were able to push the first wave of attackers back, they weren't prepared for the dark figure that next stepped forth. He wielded a cruel, living sword, and inspired an unhinged bloodlust in the invaders with his unearthly magic.\"* I believe that the \"Dark Figure\" will be the next character. Tryndameres *\"ambusher\"* might have been *\"Aatrox\"*, but is not confirmed. Tryndamere rivals also includes \"Sejuani\"\n\nAnivia lore doesn't state much apart from, \"*Anivia began to sense a greater threat: an ancient evil growing deep within the earth. To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt\"* I believe that the new character would be part of this, corruption along with Sejuani and her allies.\n\nGragas Lore doesn't suggest anything about the new character or any facts worth mentioning, apart from the fact he likes a good brew..\n\nNunu lore also doesn't state anything new about the character aside from the fact that his yeti can draw.. *\"he found the Yetis cage shattered, with only a crude drawing inside signaling the Yeti's farewell.\"*\n\nWhat We Know so far..\n- Ashe wants to reunite Freljord, also suggesting this new character was part of the darkness that broke up Freljord.\n- The Frozen Watcher Might be meaning *\"Support\"*\n- Characters related to freljord are *\"Ashe\" \"Tryndamere\" \"Anivia\" \"Nunu\" and \"Gragas\"*, Ashe and Tryndamere have remarks in there lore which could be about the new character.\n- Tryndamere seeks revenge on *\"The dark figure that wields a cruel, living sword and has unearthly magic\"*\n-Tryndamere also rivals* \"Sejuani\"*\n-  Anivia has in her lore that \"To her horror, she felt the pure magic of the ice itself become blackened and corrupt\" could the new character be apart of this?\n\n**Lissandra**\nLissandra's lore adds a new depth to this character,*\"Centuries ago, Lissandra betrayed her tribe to evil creatures, known as the Frozen Watchers\"* So lissandra has been with the frozen watchers and is known only as *''The Ice Witch.'' *\n**- Ps Ty to @thuthzyhesaid for the input about lissandra**\n\nMoving on with the *\"wonder Above\"*\n*\"A horde of these strange creatures once enslaved the tribes of the Freljord\"\"They smothered Valoran under glaciers and cast a shadow upon all of runeterra\"*\nCould *\"They smothered Valoran under glaciers\" Also, could this be the story that the children of valorat know?be relating back to \"Anivia began to sense a greater threat: an ancient evil growing deep within the earth.\"?*\n\nRegarding *\"A cloud of smoldering destruction hangs in the night sky. This is the Fall of shurima\"* I believe it is regarding\n*\"In ancient Shurima, young emperor Azir was persuaded by Xerath, his Magus, to attempt the fabled Ascension ritual – despite ancient warnings to do so only in times of direst threat.\" \"As the Shurima's Legacy Sun Disc focused the dawn rays into a transformative beam, Xerath betrayed Azir, shoving his emperor aside and stealing its power for himself.\" \"In an instant, Azir was obliterated – and Xerath remade as a spectral being of pure, malevolent energy – as the city around them was swallowed whole by the desert.\" *\n\nI hope you guys found that helpful and might have a bit more of an idea what this **character** might be like and gave you some lore back story you might not have known..\n*\nPS:Have you ever guessed what a new character will be and guess right?*","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-24T02:07:40.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So tell me, how is this 'Frozen Watcher' a bard?
