The user /u/-Ekrah made a fix for it. However, as many of you will also know, this fix has ceased working for about 2 months due to Riot disabling custom skins however there is new method for the Particle Fix to work.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YasuoMains/comments/92t6jv/yasuo_particle_fix_guide/","image":"https://external-preview.redd.it/ZuvxMxk5wK1AtEM9j7JmdKhj4w5fR9vfmlgklr469Gc.jpg?auto=webp&s=a010e1ec2be7d2f0eda78d8e1354b18b4dd7c048"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There have previous methods of re-adding in the Yasuo particles, such as importing files into our folders but in the recent 8.20 LOL patch, these methods have not been working. With Yasuo being others and my personally favourite champion to play, it is sad to see the old particle fx's become unable to used. \r\n\r\nWill it be possible to bring back the old Yasuo effects that many Yasuo players desire as it provides much more aesthetic pleasure than the current effects, or possibly add a option to revert the new Yasuo effects to the old ones.","replies":[]}
