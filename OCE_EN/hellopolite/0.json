This is subverting a lot of normal laning patterns, so we&#039;re looking to significantly nerf the strategy. We&#039;ll be pursuing cleaner system solutions to the problem in preseason, but for now we&#039;re just trying to decrease the viability of funneling.\r\nHunter&#039;s Machete/Hunter&#039;s Talisman\r\nNEWMONSTER HUNTER If you have the most individual total gold on your team, lane minions kills will grant 10 less gold. This penalty is removed upon completion of an Enchantment on a Skirmisher&#039;s Sabre or Stalker&#039;s Blade.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-07-18T00:00:01.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the passive is added to the basic jungle items. So the Machete and Talisman and goes away upon completing your smite upgrade.\n\nit means total gold in the game, not unspent. If you are jungle and your the richest person on your team, minions will give you less gold until you upgrade your smite.\n\nBasically all its doing is making junglers do a full jungle clear and buy their smite upgrade before they can steal cs efficiently.\n\nMost junglers tend to be the richest on the team until the tank wave since jungle camps give you 100g each roughly and minion waves give you 105g.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-18T01:28:40.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so the function is attatched to a jungle item? i can run lane smite and not be afflicted by the nerf?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-17T21:57:44.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"also, does this mechanism apply to all with smite or all with a jungle item or both or something else?","replies":[]}]}
