Generating an audience is really hard in the early stages, and for any of you who have attempted to get into youtube you may also share my pain. It would mean a lot if anyone reading this might be able to go over and check it out (**THIS ISNT SPAM**), im not asking you to sub, I&#039;m not asking you to like it, but if you guys enjoy the content then I&#039;d recommend subscribing and dropping a like to show some support cause Im pretty keen to commit to this. Please leave all the feedback you want, I&#039;d love to know how I can maximise the quality of my content.** ALSO ON A SIDE NOTE**, all the good League channels have podcasts of around 4 or 5, and I dont personally plan on commentating alone forever, so if you play on OCE, you feel you&#039;re a comedic outgoing person, you have access to skype and a good quality mic, please drop a comment and Ill get in touch with you :P But thanks heaps for your time guys. Cheers &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"NZ kLutch","date":"2015-08-04T23:53:56.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bro, I have dropped you a like and subscribed to your channel because I think you have got potential but coming from a person who has a degree in Public Relations and Media Development, I have a few things which might actually help you out. On Youtube something about the squealing like a girl, unnecessary swearing seems to be dumb and just shine a bad light on the already considered toxic community that everyone thinks is LoL. If you act mature and rage at the right moments with squealing I could actually imagine it to be more enjoyable. Commentate instead of what you are doing and when you fail go for a small rage at your ADC or whoever it is you are in lane with. Average graphics also make your page look less professional and it normally means people are less inclined to visit your page or subscribe. You need to find other music rather than Batman and Mozart, this isn't because I didn't enjoy them, they suited the vid good. You just don't want to get hit up by copyright laws anytime soon. If you want anymore suggestions just ask, more than willing to help :)","replies":[]}]}
