However, if you keep control of wards on Baron by pink warding or sweeping, and are warding so you have vision on the enemy team, Baron may be a great call. Depending on who your top lane is, you can send them bot to distract the enemy team while you secure Baron. Baron is a very strong objective and gives you heaps of pressure. Make it very clear to your team mates if you don't think Baron is a good idea, but bare in mind sometimes it may be the right thing to do.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-03-13T06:50:42.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze? ...
