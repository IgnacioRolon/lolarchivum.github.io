The guide I checked reccomends a glass canon build which im enjoying\nCinderhulk\nMob boots\nGhost blade\nHydra\nLast whisper\nIe or bloodthirster\nIs there a better build? Is he better tanking?\n\nSecondly, the combo. Is it best to go in for a kill with 3 or 4 ferocity and q w q e?\nDo I go in with 5 ferocity and blow it all?\nIs it better to double q w or e\nDo I do more damage when I jump from a bush? \nIm sure I&#039;ve got more questions but that&#039;ll do for now","replies":[{"poster":"Valkrai","date":"2015-05-15T10:22:14.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play ap rengar he is no joke. if u do get q lvl 1 e lvl 2 and w lvl 3 then max w first then q. start with machetee as usual. this build works well becuz since u r building ap u will be getting rabadons so zhonyas is very worth. and mobi boots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-15T09:48:38.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R-E-Q-W-RightClick-Spend all ur monnies","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-15T01:54:55.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd definately get warrior instead of cinderhulk with a build like that, you're not really benifiting from %hp bonus and the aoe is negligible compared to all your damage items (plus it got nerfed this patch). i'd recommend getting rangers trailblazer (the purple smite item) if you dont already since the sustain/aoe when farming is a bit more forgiving if you're new to jungling and you also dont have to decide between smiting jungle monsters and saving it to use on champions. Other than that the build is fine, maybe toss in a guardian angel or other defensive item in at the end.\n\nWith the combo, you want to start at 5 and almost always use empowed e when you're ganking (you can throw it at someone as you're jumping out of your ult, making it basically impossible to dodge). The snare is generally more useful than additional damage from q since it prevents them from getting out of range and lets you and your teammate get a lot more hits in. Against people who aren't going to run away (like the enemy jungler just jumped on you and wants to fight) q is probably better, and w if you're low in a teamfight or running away and need the heal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-05-14T22:09:39.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The build I enjoy the most is:\nBlue Smite - Warrior\nHydra\nBotrk/Yommus (Doesn't matter what order you get these in but get them)\nMobi boots\nA defensive item\n\nTo answer your questions:\n1- In earlier levels you want to start e if you beleive theyll run but q if you know their going to stay and fight. You best be fighting with 5 ferocity because then you'll have more abilities and stronger abilities\n2- If your killing someone why not blow 5 ferocity?\n3- In earlier levels with allies you better do double e for the cc. Later in the game when your 1 shotting people just get double q.\n4- No","replies":[]}]}
