I pinged the hell out of mid saying Push mid hard\r\nWe pushed mid and got the inhib\r\n\r\nthen i noticed top and bot pushing.. i pinged 2 to top and 3 bot\r\nthe response was what about mid?\r\nI replied &quot; if they defend us they dont defend mid, and mid will push into base\r\nif they decide to hold mid and defend us then they will be weak\r\nWe then all grouped and just pushed bot instead they tried to hold mid and bot.. we killed at bot and then the mid guys decided to come try a 2 v 5\r\nWe killed them and took inhib.. 4 dead now.. then my team started saying Baren baren baren..\r\nI pinged no!! end game 4 dead 5 of us go go go!\r\nWe went in killed last guy took tower, they started to spawn, 3 got the respawns 2 got tower and then All went for nexus\r\n\r\now im not sure if this is classified as a carry but commanding the team as a support felt great and exhausting al at once. \r\n\r\n\r\nthats my story.. 3 wins in a row doing this.. most wins in a row ive had in a long time :)","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-14T05:21:30.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona is very deadly if build right","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rooksy","date":"2016-03-14T00:02:29.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it is actually quite common to hard carry with Supports (ie Lux + Mejais).

Communication is key for a support, and you're dead right in saying that you can carry a game from just commanding a team!\n\nAs a support you don't have the ability to *hard carry* a game in regards to damage output, and you also do not have to typically focus on a lot of the mechanical aspects such as csing/kiting etc. This allows you more time to observe the state of the game and communicate it to your team. Keep watching the minimap and pinging out objectives in advance. Time all of the summoners and ultimates you can see within a fight and make sure to remind your team of it. \n\nYour understanding of objectives within the game was perfect, and I can see it being a good strength for you to go into shotcalling with. A skill which is very good to have at all levels of play! As a support you also will need to adapt your play style between roaming to snowball other lanes, or protecting your carry to win the lane yourself. Support's kits hold a lot of potential for great roaming if you have CC, or alternatively if you don't, getting deep vision and then using your shotcalling to make a play which can win the game.\n\nSupport is a great role to master, but don't expect people to listen or praise you all the time for your good work. Quite often what you do will be go unnoticed, but that happens. You will have people ignore your calls on occasion (even if they were great!) and you will have bad teammates which makes it feel like you can't carry. But just remember as long as you play CONSISTENTLY well and keep communicating as much of the game as you can analyze, it will always help your team win. You CAN carry from support, and its great to see you feeling so good after the last game.\n\nKeep it up!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-12T05:28:30.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember, my promos to Silver, (the first time I went from Bronze to Silver because I've done it a loooooooooooooooot). I've never carried any games so hard in my life, like, seriously, EVER. I remember, I won the first one by carrying with kills and the next two, with shotcalling and I was the ONLY one making calls and for some reason, everyone just, listened. I know how exhausting it can be, believe me, but it is definitely one of the best ways to carry as a support. Just keep at it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-03-11T12:40:06.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Carrying from support requires at least one competent carry on your team, preferably the ADC. Play a champ with lots of peel but still good at locking down opponents and dealing damage. Leona is good because she can engage really well with her blade, or just use her stun to peel. Her ult is really versatile too and getting good at those will force a few flashes in the least. Braum is good too because he can \"protect the carry\" so to speak. In earlier elos Lux is good I heard (not even bronze here) because she has solid CC in Q and a good zoning tool with E. She can also secure kills with her ult and she has a shield but don't rely on it too much.\n\nBasically, peel and CC is a priority. Tankyness is good too.","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-11T13:01:30.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"people dont seem to know her stun hits 2 enemies, they hide behind a minion alot so i just go.. uhh ok.. stun","replies":[{"poster":"TCA Beausen","date":"2016-03-11T13:08:21.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supports can carry to a degree, most of the time you need a duo partner to climb, it will take twice as many games to climb as support then any other role, as you have to rely on 3-4 other players","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-12T03:23:13.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> as you have to rely on 3-4 other players\n\nexactly this.

Also remember to build for your team's needs, such as, sight stone, locket and so on. \nI recommend playing Lulu, Leona, Janna they are very usefully and if played right will win you a lot of games.\nGood Luck.\nP.S.
