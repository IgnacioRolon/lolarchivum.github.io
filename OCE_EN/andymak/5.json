Its me coaching players through their replays and talking about the zone potential, use of cooldowns etc. Ive only got a Lucian, Nami and Thresh that are Silver, I believe the rest are gold+ analysis. Unfortunately I had to stop the series as I've got 0.7 Upload and it ruined my net back then. I'm looking to continue on with this content sometime soon if my internet gets upgraded!\n\nThe videos were a while ago, so the build paths may have changed, but these champs have stayed relatively the same regardless, and a lot of the mechanical/positional aspects will still be worth noting.\n\nI hope this helps! Give me some feedback if it helps! I may be able to do one for you in the near future.

Watching people analyse other bronze games probably won't be all that relevant to you, as you may not be playing the same champs/ making the same mistakes as the other players.
