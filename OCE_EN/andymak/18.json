For example\r\n\r\nYesterday I was lux vsing fizz\r\nI noticed every time I try to stun fizz jumped on trident\r\nI noticed his movement pattern trying to bait it out of me so .. fizz was in front waiting for the stun so instead I threw my shield. . He jumped on trident came down to my q aa r e dead\r\n\r\nAny tricks or baits used on other champs?  id love to hear about them","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-19T01:35:09.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm quite fond of missing the first couple of hooks with either Blitz or Thresh so the enemy thinks I have no idea what I'm doing. Eventually upon landing the most clutch through the minions 360 no-scope hook they're so shocked they don't have any time to react. It doesn't always work (sometimes you land and they give you respect too early), usually makes your own teammates think you have no idea what you're doing and is potentially just a solid story to explain why I miss hooks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-18T23:56:16.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh my there's far too many tactics I love to just put down a few.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-18T21:50:37.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \nNot really a bait, but a trick. Many champions can flash mid cast animation of a skill to suprise your enemies. For example, Alistar can Q then flash, and his Q appears to come out instantly which can catch many opponents unaware. You may already know this though. \n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-03-11T09:28:06.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i wouldn't call it a trick but many people in low elo don't realise that when shaco does his fade away shiv toss that should kill you, its best to turn around and face it and not let it hit you in the back other wise it will deal and extra 20% damage. many times I've seen people not turn and die where they would of lived if they did.","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-11T10:36:28.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i LOVE it when people go Oh shit!! and turn and run and im like.. cheers mate.. backstab","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-03-11T07:35:00.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lux ult can proc the passive which makes it harder and less likely to dodge, you dont need to fool around with an aa in there unless you got lich bane\n\ntheres countless possible tricks to do in league. baiting the fizz E is one of the more basic manouvres. pretty much a lot of people under diamond can be fooled or caught out by your combos, but the same can be said for you. knowing the possibilities and matchups, taking into account possible ganks, is what sets people apart in ranked\n\na more common method is playing passive for a while, and then going all out when you're sure your opponent is going to last hit a minion (usually they'll always try for a cannon) or with lux right before hes going to hit it you can throw your shield out to scare him (hopefully off the last hit) or throw your shield out followed immediately by an ability","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-11T05:49:45.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"45% cd zilean..... funny shit","replies":[]}]}
