Sustain definitely wins out over flat MR early, as the majority of magic damage in the early game will deplete mana on a majority of mages, so health sustain is a great way to win that war. Magic Resistance really does come into runes for a lot of champions too. \n\n- Flat MR is against an opponent who has high poke/kill pressure early.\n- Scaling MR will allow you free stats after Level 8 but will pose you to be weaker before this point. This is great when the enemy is a weaker laner or someone who will not be pressuring you hard in the early game.\n\nMaking sure you get the mastery point to turn hp pots into cookies is a great way to get bonus sustain in lane. Having a couple of them will grant you better sustain then pots alone!","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-09T09:44:24.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can start {{item:1033}} {{item:2003}}  if you really want to. I find that {{item:2033}} is a better start though.\n\nI see what you mean how its not \"balanced\" since you start {{item:1029}}  4x {{item:2003}}  but you only get 1 potion against AP champions. But that is usually because AP champions are spell-based whereas AD champions Autos hurt as much as their abilities.\n\nThere is always {{item:1054}} too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-09T08:07:54.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't start a match with MR. Usually the starting stats of AP are negligible compared to other stats (such as AD). \nBest bet is to start with a sustain start as the majority of champions you will need to build MR against are poke based. Those who lean more towards burst (kat, fizz, alkali), will generally allow for a bit of farming before they hit their powerspikes (so make sure you back before then and buy some MR!)\n\nIf you insist of stating with a bit of MR, I suppose you could start with null magic mantle and a pot.","replies":[]}]}
