Join a premade team.**\nBronze V is the ultimate cesspit for trolls and people who play like bots. Playing ranked is like dipping your hand into medical waste and hoping you don't get hepatitis. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff (soon™).\n\n**2. Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze v vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank).\n\n**3. Get super good at two roles.**\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand. \n\n**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n\n_Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be._\n\n**5. Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game. \n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Shrewd","date":"2016-03-11T09:49:36.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a really helpful post, thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-10T05:23:19.138+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate I've tried.

By playing at your average division skill, by definition you will win half of these games. By playing better you win more, and playing worse means you win less (this is how professionals carry so hard in low elo). \n\nAnyway, by this logic simply playing **at the same skill of your division** is enough to get you **at least** a 50% winrate - and that's enough to climb. So ultimately the key to climbing for the Average Joe is _consistency_. Play well, play often and you will rise :)\n\nNB: This logic changes for Platinum and the competitive tiers. \nBG: I've carried several accounts through Bronze/Silver/Gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLiKeTuRtLeS","date":"2016-03-11T10:52:02.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is how I got from bronze to gold. Back in season 4 I was bronze 4 as was my classmate. We were both really dominant in lane (mid mains) but looking back, the reason we lost games were that we didn't know how to carry the team and teamfights. Back then silver was like plat to us. In the s5 preseason I climbed with ap control mages (good for lategame) like syndra and kat and got to silver 2. When the s5 finally began I was placed back into bronze 4.  I climbed again to silver using syndra/ahri/kat and when the end of the season was nearing, I knew I had to get season rewards. Trinity force yasuo carried me into gold and when preseason 6 began, I went up to gold 2 with leblanc (I usually w,r,q and e to single and assassinate a target making the next teamfight 4v5 or taking objectives while they don't fight). So anyways, to get out of bronze, you gotta play easy champions that have a lategame (cause bronzies dunno how to end) and champions u are used to. In lane, try adapting to ur enemy, eg. when I was playing leblanc against galio (and galio is lb's supposedly biggest counter because of his magic resist) I auto atked him half-dead and dodged his spells getting a 2/0 before 12 minutes. In teamfights, try positioning well (as kat I w8 for the moment when they are low so I can reset and pentakill em although u have to have fast fingers and just know what to do in situations as her).\n\nNow the mindset in order to climb. Back in the day I always blamed my bad teams for me not climbing, the truth is in bronze, you cant do decent and expect to win most of the time. You have to be able to carry. If you aren't carrying and just doing decent in bronze 5, that means you aren't skilled enough and deserve to be in bronze 5. On the other hand, if you dominate the laning phase but just have a few flaws in positioning and teamfighting (like former me) you'll be sure to climb after you touch up on a few aspects (trust me, I went into bronze 4 promos 5 times before going on a winning streak and up to silver 3 and later to gold).

Ask you jungler to help you with high damage dealers and after a few tank items, he wont be doing nothing to you. You gotta know how to farm and cs doe cause that's really important as nasus. Riven takes time to get used to, countered by tanky top laners and has little mobility.

If you are making good calls, pinging effectively, warding well etc. your teammates will make mistakes less often than the enemy team and it will tip the odds in your favour. You can also tip the odds in your favour by winning your lane, roaming well, setting up plays etc. to make your teammates more fed than the enemy.

The games you should be upset about losing are the ones where could only go even in lane, and didn't manage to get any good roams off in the first 20 minutes to help your team, or you followed your teammates in on a bad engage and turned one or two kills into an ace for the enemy, or didn't try to alert your teammate that facechecking baron by himself was a terrible idea, and especially the ones where you are doing poorly yourself and actively having a negative impact on your team. These are the games that you are losing that a better player would win. Most of the time there is something more YOU could have done to improve your chances of winning. If you want to win more you need to get better at identifying what those things are so you can do them more.
