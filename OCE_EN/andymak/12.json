As of now ARAM and TT do not give you rankings and thus do not earn you chests.\n\nAs of now only Ranked and Normal SR will earn you chests.\n\nI'm not sure about keys though. Personally I haven't received any key fragments from ARAM or TT, and I'm fairly certain you also only get keys from SR, but I'm not 100% sure on that.","replies":[]}]}
