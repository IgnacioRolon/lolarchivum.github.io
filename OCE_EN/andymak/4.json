You might want to consider that while you are spending time learning all these different champions' mechanics specific to them, you could use that time in different ways such as working on mechanics that can be transferred to all champions that you play. Doing this is a term I refer to as \"auto-piloting\". Examples of mechanics such as these are CSing, Last hitting, and rotational plays. These are just a few examples are there are more.\n\nThere are advantages to having a big champion pool as well though, this includes having mid laners that can deal with almost any matchup, work in many team comps, or you couild even pick a champion to outright counter your lane opponent. With this though you may find that you won't be as confident as you like on a lot of your champions that you play which can lead to missed kills or objectives.\n\nWhat **I** would recommend personally to you since you seem like a mid laner is stick with playing Ahri and build a small champion pool around her. She's an extremely good mid laner that will teach you the mechanics you need in mid. When you play someone like Ahri, she has mechanics that are unique to her, but she also has things such as skill shots and important positioning mechanics which you can transfer onto other champions that you want to play when you get around them. If you want to extend your champion pool I say go for it, but I would recommend only sticking with around two or so more for your most commonly played. I'll give you a list of champions that I recommend you learn well and play constantly, that will teach you mechanics. \n\nWhy I pick these over others is, even if you don't like them, you will still learn a lot from the time spent playing them and can use them for your next pick for your champion pool.\n\n{{champion:1}} **Annie**\n\nAnnie out of the three champions I have here is the easiest to auto pilot on for most people but still packs just as much of a punch when played. She has the ability to farm easily with her q, stun multiple targets and set up massive plays in team fights with things such as flash Tibbers. Managing Annie's stun is considered one of the hardest mechanics on Annie to learn to use correctly. You need to learn when to use it in case you need to last hit creeps with spells that your auto attacks normally wouldn't get or keep it because you see a chance to go in if they miss step even the slightest bit. Try to learn how much damage your combo does with what items, make sure to factor in ignite as well. This will help you learn when you can flash Tibbers to try and land a kill. If you are not 100% sure sometimes it is best to do it anyway so that you learn that if you are in that situation again you will know if it will kill or not.  If you are looking for a champion that can do what Annie can but is a bit more technical and has a shield, than you would be looking at Orianna.\n\n{{champion:61}} **Orianna**\n\nOrianna depending on your play style and previous champions, can either be the same amount of difficulty as Ahri or the hardest champion on this list. Don't get discouraged though, once you learn to Orianna she is very fun and provides a lot to the team, such as multi man shock waves to kill many targets or utility in the form of her speed up W or shield from her E. Managing where you place Orianna's ball is considered the hardest thing to grasp. Multitasking is a big part of her kit, and you will find that when you come to master her you can farm at the same time as harassing with your Q>W combo. Along with the other champions on this list, really try to learn her damage values. Orianna does a surprising amount of damage with little to no items. Being able to 1-100 people in some situations with only 1-2 items. Farming is a big part of Orianna in my experience and her CSing is made easier with her passive. You may find that you end up with more cs on average on Orianna than the Ahri or Annie.\n\n{{champion:99}} **Lux**\n\nLux is for most people is the second hardest on this list. She is very skill shot reliant though with her combos making it so you have to land the Q first and then follow up with the rest of her abilities. I noticed that you have already noted that you are good with Lux so I won't go too much over here apart from saying to continue to play her :3\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nAll up, keep in mind you are still learning and are quite new to this game. If you want to extend your champion pool further than this that is up to you, and you may find it is more fun to do it that way. It really depends on what your goal is when improving in this game.\n\nI hope that you learned something from my wall of text and you have any more specific mid lane questions or need any clarification on what I have said let me know!\n\n- Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-06T15:37:32.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Azir.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-04-06T05:46:30.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Akali mid, its better to go topkali then midkali.\n\nIf you want to go mid safely, go with Annie.\nHer counters are rare now, other than Lux: Brand, Orianna, LeBlanc, Morgana","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sherk420","date":"2016-04-06T00:32:39.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}} : Easy to learn and very bursty\n{{champion:245}} : Can either go tanky or ap and will still eliminate\n{{champion:13}} :Easy, not too punishing if you fail lane","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frog King","date":"2016-04-05T19:02:13.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You honestly cant go wrong with karthus.
