For me, ADC was the hardest role to learn because of the constant 2v2 action going on, and also ADC's (I found) are the squishiest champs which I hated. By the sounds of it, you might need to practice last hitting as well as positioning. As an ADC it is the most important thing you need to learn, since failing to dodge a Nidalee spear will often result in your death.\n\nThe champs I learnt how to play _**ADC**_ with were:\n\n{{champion:22}} _**Ashe**_: She doesn't have a lot of the damage that most other ADC's have, but she is fairly easy to learn. She has poke with her Volley, and has a nice kit for beginners that easily allows you some lenience with some of the mistakes you made. However, she is getting her kit changed very soon so you may not want to get used to her current kit very much.\n\n{{champion:18}} **_Tristana_**: She is fairly easy once you learn how she combos her abilities. A nice example of a champion who has abilities that act upon each other (Her Q and E reduce one another's cooldowns). Also, her W is good for getting in position or hauling butt outta there. Once you get the hang of her she is really fun to play. There are two things though, one is that her play style is a bit more risky than some other ADCs, two her Ult and other abilities require some decent positioning to play right. However, if you play her enough I can almost guarantee that you will understand and learn the importance of positioning and how to do so. I know you have said you have trouble with her but if you hang in there or come back to her later I am sure you will like her.\n\nSome good, easier **_Junglers_** out there are:\n\n{{champion:19}} _**Warwick**_: He has awesome sustain. A couple of health potions for the start and that is basically all he needs to get going. He can stay in the jungle forever. Also, after you hit lvl6 and unlock your ult, your ganks are among the most terrifying if play it remotely right. Basically whoever you ult is designated for deletion (as long as they aren't the tank). He can also kill dragon fairly early, and also he can counter jungle and duel the enemy jungler quite well. In my opinion, Warwick is the best jungler for beginners.\n\n{{champion:154}} _**Zac**_: He is fairly easy to learn. Basically you just have to make decisions on whether it is worth picking up your blobs or not. Also, his passive is basically a second chance for the jungle if you get executed in your first run. His first clear is quite close to say the least, and you will need to back after clearing one side of the jungle to survive the next. However, he has decent ganks with his E which also knocks up whoever you land on, his Q is a decent slow, and his Ult also is a knock up. He is also pretty lenient in his building too, either tanky with a couple thousand health, or as a bruiser with a lot of damage. Not only that, if you fall behind he has enough utility to stay relevant throughout the game.\n\nYour other lanes seem fine to me by the way you have put it, so I will leave out my recommendations for the other three.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-05-11T05:53:36.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you suck at Adc you are most probably very bad at positioning. \nWell ask yourself a few questions :\n\n1) Are you tanking minions ?\n2)Playing too aggressive ?\n3) Tower Diving as Adc ? \n4)Bad at CS ?  \n5) Minion Blocked ?\n6) Harassing enemies between your minions and enemy minions ?  \n7)Missing on CS because you focus too much on harassing enemy ?\n8) Standing too close to walls and end up eating enemy skill shots ?\n\nSince you mostly play support and jungle which is pretty much roles that doesn't worry too much about CS you most probably miss out a lot of CS playing as Adc. Twitch i heard is extremely squishy and Tristana need quite a bit of skill to play (E to Q + AA) and Sivir have a weak range but high damage and utility and insane waveclear. I suggest you try playing {{champion:21}} .{{champion:21}}  is not very high up in the current meta because she have no escape but she is really easy to learn and really easy to play and her ult is extremely good for teamfights (as long as you position properly and dun get CC). For Jungle you can try {{champion:19}}  and {{champion:20}}  because this two junglers doesn't need leash at all and have really powerful sustain in jungle and can stay in jungle 24/7 and also counter jungle really well. Warwick R also easily 1 shot squishy champs if you have a blade of ruined king.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RivenSmurfs","date":"2015-05-11T00:20:35.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"For jungle, vi and shyvana \nMid: Orianna and annie\nTop: Shyvana and irelia\nAdc: Draven and Draven\nSupport: Leona","replies":[{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-05-20T02:12:58.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RivenSmurfs,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=EFA1bnHX,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-11T00:20:35.471+0000)\n>\n> For jungle, vi and shyvana \n> Mid: Orianna and annie\n> Top: Shyvana and irelia\n> Adc: Draven and Draven\n> Support: Leona\n\nId add xin voli graves and quinn","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-13T06:50:09.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some pretty awesome tips here.\n\n____\n\n**Jungle:**\nWarwick is overall the healthiest out of all the junglers right now. By that what I mean is that he really does not need health potions if you have a good leash from lvl 1. His sustain is crazy, his damage is admirable but his CC power is limited to his ultimate. Build Warwick tanky, because by mid/late game you will be teleporting to the enemy ADC/MID-carry and everyone will focus their damage to you to try and kill you off. Displacements and stuns will stop Warwick's ultimate as well. Cleansing {{summoner:1}} abilities and items {{item:3222}} also counter his only CC ability. \nYou may want to buy {{item:3022}} for the slow.\n\nOlaf isn't the greatest source of CC, great for taking but so is Jarvan IV with his heavy CC.. I'd stick with Fiddle, he's a strong ganker and can deal a lot of magic damage. Adds a good mix of damage to your team if everyone else is picking AD mids or tops.\n\n**Top:**\nIf you're trying to win lane, {{champion:92}} is much easier to do so. Her epic mobility and damage is crazy once you get one kill. She can pressure her lane really well. She's great all match but she has very limited team fight presence compared to {{champion:62}}'s ultimate and tankiness. Riven can tank for a short amount of time, but any long CC will counter her high scaling but low duration shield. Under her shield, she's not very tanky at all.\n\n{{champion:62}} shines in the late game where his ultimate will deal maximum damage as well as chunk other bruisers and squishies with her Q armor reduction. Wukong is far more teamfight oriented than Riven. His passive gives him a small (but deceptive) amount of tankiness. His E is great for engages and his W is essentially a short time shield. Your W can literally soak up all the CC and burst damage that the enemy can fire; they end up wasting ability CDs on a clone. If you are looking to carry games wether in ranked or soloQ Riven has a much easier time all game. Both can nuke towers with relative ease if you go for damage items and a splitpush strategy. I'll hate you for picking Riven though.\n\nMaokai is strong right now. His high health and defensive stats are great to stay in lane. He has a very disruptive set of abilities, and in an occasion that their bot lane swaps lane with their top, Maokai has a much easier time in 1v2 a lane phase compared to other top laners. \n\n\n**ADC:**\nI've been practicing my position and csing because those are the two most important things to do with your role. Positioning is difficult when you're on the offensive because of your relative squishiness. You'll have to learn when and/or which (abilities or autoattacks) you'll have to tank to deal your damage. Be smart, but don't be cowardly as it can be a difference between you getting a double kill and you and your support dying for nothing in return.\nThe mindset is sort of similar to that of Yasuo versing long range harassers. You have to go in to be of any threat.\n\nLast hitting minions generally provides more gold for you than kills in early lane phase, which translates to more items meaning more damage. It really depends on your gameplan. If you decide to forego some cs for a kill or two and don't get it, then you'll be behind. If you do get it, then promptly last hit as best you can to beat their creep score.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-05-11T09:44:39.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"adc perhaps try varus maybe long range is ur thing\nmid i like karma shes op as hell\ntop talon is cool cus hes like assassin-y and stuff and does a lot of dmg when fed\nsupport i like janna and zyra (zyra is good at locking down enemies for ur adc to kill and  jannas great in teamfights)\nand i dont play a lot of jg but my favs vi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-11T01:04:23.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves is a great champ to start ADC'ing with. He's got a relatively simple kit (get up in their face, blow all your CD's, auto them to death, dash away), and rewards both aggressive and passive play in the laning phase. I would also say Varus is pretty good too, as you can simply rely on Q to poke your lane opponent to death and he has a stack mechanic that's pretty easy to work around.\n\n\nWork on Ahri and Ziggs in the mid lane. They're the two most competent champs of what you can play at the moment.\n\nFocus on Riven and Wukong in top lane. Riven is your smashy face assassin/bruiser hybrid, wukong likes to build 3 tank items and two damage items.\n\nFor jungle, try Mastery Yi, Lee sin and Vi. They're all pretty good junglers at the moment, with Yi having good clear times and excellent sustain, lee sin having a bit of trouble with clears but good sustain and hilarious ganks, and Vi can beat the snot out of jungle monsters and return to gank mid with 80% hp left. Vi is a different sort of jungle where her kit is BUILT to gank a target and stick to the like superglue sticks to your fingers. She likes to be up in the guts, so a tanky Vi is a good approach. I am of the camp that Cinderhulk and a Randuins is just fine, you can go AD after that.\n\nAnd ADC play graves and Varus if you can. Try to stay away from Vayne. She's EXCELLENT, but only if you know the ADC role very well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-11T00:42:32.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My suggestions (with a little explanation)\n\nJungle - Quite a few tank junglers are easy to play and really strong at the moment. Stuff like sejuani, amumu, udyr.\nAdc - Maybe try some of the more caster type ones like ezreal or graves since they're easier to be effective with if you're not great at adc.\nMid - Probably try learn an AD one in case your team is picking alot of AP champs. Maybe talon, or you could try riven or wukong mid since you already play them\nTop - Already have a pretty good mix, just focus on getting better at the ones you already play.\nSupport - Stick with morg/blitz probably. You could try brand too if you're already decent with him mid, he's a super good support in lower divisions if you can play him well.","replies":[]}]}
