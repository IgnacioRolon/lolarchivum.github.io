It's awesome to see people actually realizing their own mistakes instead of blaming it on their teammates the whole time. Yes, teammates that feed can be such a pain, but it's important to focus on what you CAN control(your champion). :) \n\nTo answer your question it will vary between 2-4 losses depending on the people you're matched up with, you definitely won't drop on your first match though! \n\nCongratz and gl on the climb!!:D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-18T23:55:01.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats. It usually takes at least 4 losses as soon as you reach a new division to drop. You don't actually drop until your MMR meets the average of the divison below you though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-18T23:31:44.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you won't drop first match.

You've started your climbing journey!\n\nYou usually will get around 2 losses on 0 lp before you drop if you've come fresh out of a division below. This does however depend on your MMR (sometimes you may get 3 losses before dropping on the 4th. I would continue playing and avoid the ladder anxiety of falling. Play your best every game and don't be overly concerned with the LP gains. Its gonna be a long grind up, but taking it on a game by game basis and focusing your energy into focusing on the things you can control and improving on them will be a great way to continue to win. \n\nMy best tip would to be watch some informative streamers and learn from them. Ask a friend to take a look at a replay/spectate and help you out? Sometimes we cant see our own mistakes.\n\nGood Luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-18T06:12:27.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-18T06:05:57.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, usually its about 3-4 losses on 0 LP before you drop.\nThis is not a specific thing however, I have before dropped with 1 game loss, to about 6 losses.\n\nAlso gratz.","replies":[]}]}
