The end results looks like this: ******in. This is fairly frustrating and is obviously not purposeful as Riot themselves have categorised champions into an assassin style and is visible within the &quot;types of champions&quot;. Its not hurtful to the game play or anything but I just want to name my item preset &quot;assassin&quot; so when I go talon, I know what to build :/\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-18T08:12:31.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Political correctness can suck my penis.\n\nOh wait, are you going to ban 'penis' now? How about nose, arm or foot?\n\n**Offense is in context, not content.**\nRiot need a fucking education in language.\n\nBots can not determine context (unless you developed 'skynet' AI without the worlds military knowing about it).\nI've said this a thousand times before, I was banned for 256 years on my original NA account, I reformed and have never had an in-game reprimand since season 2.\nI shit-talk all the time in game, I just know where to draw the line.\n\nWith the replay function of games available, a tribunal system like we used to have before OCE existed, could actually watch a replay, see how the game plays, see what is said, and punish accordingly, or let it go, as is fit to situation. How is this an issue?\n\nJust make reports temp save that games replay until review.\n\nRocket surgery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-16T11:07:27.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how 'cancer' an actual real world illness is also censored...","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-16T11:27:52.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because people use it for everything offensive (go get cancer etc.) and a bunch of other people get triggered (But my X had cancer) too easily with regards to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-16T21:21:55.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well now those people who's X did actually have cancer, can't talk about it anymore.\n\nThe word cancer itself isn't inherently offensive, it's the context it's used in the is the problem, but that has nothing to do with the actual word. if 'cancer' isn't available, it'll be 'Aids' or 'Ebola' etc. and when those words get taken away it'll be 'Go play in traffic', and when you start banning words like 'traffic' then you might as well just remove the chat altogether.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-16T23:18:03.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wouldn't be a bad idea to just remove chat altogether tbh.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-12-16T07:03:12.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add to the poll - Name the page pewpew?","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-16T03:22:41.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ass isn't even offensive, we get \"shit\" said on primetime news here in NZ.\n\nCensorship can fuck off.
