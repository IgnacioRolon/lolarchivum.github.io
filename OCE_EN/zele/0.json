I have sent a ticket but I&#039;m still mad about me getting banned for 14 days. I mean 14 days is this serious? This olaf got mad when he got out played by yi and started raging on me when he was the one who came to top and gave him a double. Then he gave yi another kill trying to steal his red. yi was just out playing him as a jungler and he just started swore in both English and Chinese. He didn&#039;t stop until our support ZIlean stepped in and said he wasn&#039;t that influential like yi. Then he was quiet for abit then started again. After the game he started to chat in Chinese which doesn&#039;t seem like nice at all. after awhile I logged on again and I saw the message saying im banned for 2 weeks. Im just wondering if riot even look into the whole situation and ban people around otherwise they need to fix how they work.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-10T04:27:26.590+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want community feedback on a punishment I'd strongly recommend posting your reform card, or at least your chat logs.

He clearly made no effort to improve his behaviour to the standards of the community (whatever the reason for that may have been) and since he had previously received his 2 week ban, his next punishment resulted in a permanent suspension.\n\nThere isn't really anything more to be said that hasn't already. When you enter a community you accept that the community will have a certain perspective on certain behaviours. Sometimes that perspective is explicitly stated, be it in a guild or in community guidelines for games the size of League or Overwatch, and sometimes they aren't, like in a friend group, but that perspective is always there.\n\nIf you disagree with the perspective of a community on x behaviour, then there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not up to you to decide, it's up to the community. If you had a friend who had been beaten to near death because he was gay, it would be understandably poor form to use homophobic slurs in a joking manner around that person, where in another of your friend circles it might be ok. \n\nEven if you disagree with the way League handles some behaviour, that at least should be something you can understand. Being a *huge* community, League has to find the best middle ground for the most people, and *most* people don't want to play with someone who is *consistently* and *constantly*, if not severely, negative for entire games.\n\nYour belief seems to be that only severe behaviours should be punished, but the belief of a significant portion of the community is that anyone who is consistently souring the experience of players should also face consequences. There is even an argument for that behaviour being worse, depending on whether you think the number of games affected matters more than the severity of the breach of conduct.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T09:45:51.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">THAT IS BANNABLE?\n\nWith enough consistency, yes.\n\n>Your community is filled with people that dont type a word; But troll and int,\n\nNot the behaviour that was subject to discussion here, and a separate issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-06-15T03:22:51.558+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"His reports he dont swear at the people, dont have hate speech.
