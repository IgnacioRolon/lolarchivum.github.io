When im 'online' and on the dashboard page where it has chat and play option it always says 'Disconnected from Chat... Attempting to \r\nReconnect.' which normally is solved by me restarting client\r\n\r\n2. When i go into champ select i havent joined the chat so all i see is nothing and i have to guess what position i am based my allies picks.\r\n\r\n3. When  i finish a game and on the stats page it says something along the line of 'You have been disconnected from chat and this doesnt effect you joining queue'\r\n\r\nAll of these happen daily on a regular basis, I have tried repairing client numerous times and im running mac os x mavericks.
