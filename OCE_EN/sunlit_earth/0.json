I was plat in S7, unranked in S8 due to a year-long hiatus and placed in iron during the preseason. I would prefer someone around my age (mid-twenties).\r\n\r\nSomething to note: I&#039;m quite socially anxious and so you can probably expect not to see me talk much during a game.\r\n\r\nAdd me in game or leave a message here.
