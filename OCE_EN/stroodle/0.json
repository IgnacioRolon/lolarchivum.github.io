So many winnable games are lost because team members start to abuse each other and everything goes downhill from there.\r\n\r\nI was thinking the club would essentially be a list of people you could invite to your ranked games who you could trust won&#039;t just cry and moan. No other rules, quality banter is encouraged. Being the best isn&#039;t everything and playing out a losing game is a good way to learn.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Stroodle","date":"2016-05-29T01:07:49.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would be a good name for said club?","replies":[{"poster":"MaximumWifeSteal","date":"2016-05-29T01:47:41.707+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Rick Astley Squad","replies":[{"poster":"MasochistSupMain","date":"2016-05-29T08:50:31.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never gonna let you down","replies":[{"poster":"SeenByTheSea","date":"2016-05-30T01:36:48.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never gonna run around and desert you","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-28T16:39:08.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be a good club for sure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stroodle","date":"2016-05-30T02:41:37.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've gone with \"The Rick Astley Squad\" if anyone wants to join just add me.
