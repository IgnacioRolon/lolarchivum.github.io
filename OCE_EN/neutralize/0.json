Consequently I have to wait in a lower priority queue, and lost of rank game points. Can you remove the lower priority queue, and restore my rank game point? This was out of my control that caused such problem. \n\nI fixed Direct X error problem somehow after watching a video clip on Youtube.\n\nI don't know if I have posted on a right board.
