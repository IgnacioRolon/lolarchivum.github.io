I don't watch eSports, but I have seen a few final games...\nRanked is NOTHING like eSports.\n\nTips:\nPlay champs that can carry by themselves.\nFarm.\nWard.\nDon't die.\nRead guides for the champions you choose to main. Some of them are actually REALLY good.\nType \"/mute all\" when the game loads.\nPlay top/jungle.\n\nOr, just play what you're good at and have fun. {{champion:17}}\n\np.s. Your 20-min cs is good, but your 35-min cs isn't.\nAlso, 2 hours a day = 3 games. If you win 2 and lose 1 each day, you will go up quickly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-22T10:54:50.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone will give you the same advice:\n\nDont start ranked straight away.\nIts a trap. one that takes a looooong time to get out of.\n\nYou're better off to hone your skills for a few more months (or even a year), learn champions really well, and then do ranked.
