It goes into the larger tab and goes to verifying, and then fails. It says that there is an unusual error so I look up if there's a way to fix it without having to reinstall. So it says on the official support site that there is a repair function in the client, so I open up the settings and all I'm greeted with is the screen of only being able to choose language settings, the error happens when I disable firewall, allow it to pass through with exceptions, run administrator, turn off anti virus, anything.","replies":[]}
