(obviously)\r\n\r\nMost of the things I got from hextech chests are champion shards and I already own them.So if they implement this new feature,would the odds of getting a champion shard from hextech chest be lower? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not really sure about this because what&#039;s the point of getting a champion shard from a chest when you could just buy it from the shop,they function the same way yeah? Altough it only gives champion shards.\r\n\r\nNot saying that riot should completely remove getting champion shards from chests,just saying that maybe they should increase the probabilities of getting a skin instead of a champ shard.\r\n\r\n* Anyhow I&#039;m still quite confused.Just curious what you guys think and what your opinions are :)","replies":[{"poster":"IamElite25","date":"2016-05-31T09:52:39.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yes I am well aware that this helps to get that mastery Lvl 6-7 for your all-time favourite champ/s\n\nLove Leb & VN\n\n{{champion:7}} <>{{champion:67}}","replies":[]}]}
