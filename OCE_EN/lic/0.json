It often take very long to wait for the opponents. \r\nI am just wondering why can't Riot put teambuilder players to match with the normal 5v5 players?\r\nIt will make everything easier and faster! \r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Ringbear","date":"2015-01-19T06:57:52.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If by normal 5v5, you mean blind pick, then there are some problems. Firstly one is happening in real time, blind pick is not waiting for another team of 5 to also pick and then match the 2 teams up. Secondly, It's just the price you are going to pay for having the lane you want. Thirdly, It would over-complicate things if people in blind pick and matched with team builder because most people in blind pick want a fast game and aren't willing to wait 5 minutes to be matched with another team.\n\nIn the end, It seems unlikely that anything is going to be done to connect the two.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Indy Savvy","date":"2015-01-19T06:58:44.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you have the 5 people, simply add them and invite them to a normal game, simple. :)","replies":[]}]}
