[I can provide the transcript of my lengthy communication with Player Support].\r\nI have come back to open a discussion about this. I have never, under any circumstances used any form of software that could be considered to interact with League of Legends in any malicious way whatsoever. I even pleaded with player support that I could do anything within my power to prove my innocence, requested to know what piece of software I had apparently been detected using and yet was met with a brick wall at every turn.\r\n(Something tells me that red flags raised by their detection system doesn&#039;t even give them enough information to go on, they just see red flag and run with it.)\r\nWithout warning I was essentially dunked into damnation with no explanation and no hope for escape, despite being entirely innocent.\r\nRiot Games I believe your system fails you - I believe that you don&#039;t actually care about your player base as human beings and only care that you&#039;ve made your pretty penny from them and there&#039;s no more to it.\r\n\r\nI am so very disappointed that it had to come to this, and very disappointed that all of my time, effort and money has gone to waste because of a false permanent ban by none other than a piece of software. Not even so much as a human being.\r\n\r\nI hope that a Riot member can really help me shed light on this gross misjustice.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nRyan F.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2017-01-31T02:13:04.071+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi Limiter Removal,\n\nI've been following your post and the discussion that has been happening in this thread. I want to assure you and other players that while it is rare that a mistake is made in terms of a permanent ban, they do happen - and we make every effort possible to rectify the situation for the affected player as fast and openly as possible.\n\nIn saying that, we spent a good hour this morning re-investigating your case and found that there has been no mistake - your permanent ban was correct. \n\n**The Elobooster that boosted/promoted your account to Silver 5 at the end of season 2015 (hence the stripping of your rewards) was using scripts/third party software (which led to the account's permaban)**.\n\n The ban of your account happened along with the ban of other related accounts to that booster (both his and other boostee accounts) which were also found to be using scripts/third party software.\n\nHopefully that sheds enough light on the situation!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-31T02:39:06.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomblade,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=wVPOJPB5,comment-id=0007,timestamp=2017-01-31T02:13:04.071+0000)\n>\n> **The Elobooster that boosted/promoted your account to Silver 5 at the end of season 2015 (hence the stripping of your rewards) was using scripts/third party software (which led to the account&#x27;s permaban)**.\n\nWhat's the nature of this eloboosting? Was it that they were playing directly on OP's account (ie account sharing) with hacks turned on? Or was it that they duo'ed with OP with hacks on? OP should only be punishable if that former is the case right?\n\nAnd if it's indeed the former case:\n\nlol that elobooster.

Because 1) They were eloboosting and 2) Even if they used cheats on other people's account, they themselves still cheated.\n\nBut idk.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-31T02:57:32.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The elo booster jumped on the account and played games just before end of season, using cheats to quickly boost the account to Silver V.\n\nThe main IP of the booster led us to an account that was likely theirs, with many more games in which cheats were used.

Not once did they claim that the automated detection methods have no faults, they merely explained that cases are reviewed manually to help ensure accuracy.\n\n> treating me very poorly\n\nYes and no. There's not really much they can do when Riot's policies are preventing them from discussing the situation any further. It's not their fault that Riot chose to keep a (very) tight lid on anything to do with 3rd party software infringements. The support staff are just trying to do their job and they have a lot of tickets to review in any given period. So while it might seem rather rude or poor treatment, it's really the best you can expect given the circumstances.\n\nOne thing to consider when it comes to 3rd party software offences is that Riot can't always determine the difference between software that is purely aesthetic (such as custom skin mods) and software that influence game behaviour (such as scripts, bots or hacks). In fact, Riot announced near the end of last year that they were going to impose a full ban on all 3rd party software around the middle of the season, more than likely because of complains not too dissimilar from yours.\n\nYou did indicate that you used a shared computer in an internet cafe that you believe others to have used MKJogo on, which *might* be related to the ban (either because of MKJogo itself or some other software that you may have been unaware of entirely).\n\nWhen all is said and done, though, you've already appealed the ban and Riot has refused that appeal, so the account will remain banned.\n\nAs for using LoL as your \"vice\", you have a choice to make. Either you can make another account and simply accept that Riot can't always act as you would prefer and sometimes you'll have to deal with these kinds of situations, or you can try finding another game that you can get into (for example; Paragon, Heroes of the Storm or Smite [all MOBAs]) that *might* not have these kinds of problems.","replies":[{"poster":"mau5trap","date":"2017-02-13T14:22:36.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can you like go work for riot? ohh that's what you are aiming for, well hope you get noticed. lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ashfault","date":"2017-01-30T03:57:31.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I am really sorry for you man try to spread the word.
