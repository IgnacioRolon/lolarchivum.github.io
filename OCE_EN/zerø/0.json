Reguarding midlane i am trying to choose a good champion to use for the mostpart. My choices have narrowed down to between Orianna and Viktor. I was wondering if anyone could help with input on which of the two would be overall more viable to climb ranks with? (if anyone has any other champion suggestions and reasons for them im glad to here them :D)","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-16T08:11:15.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:61}}  Is typically picked for her huge amount of versatility and utility.\nEven if Ori has a terrible start or has been completely dominated she still has her utility to rely on, which comes as great CC, wave clear, initiation and disengage.\n\n{{champion:112}} Has almost just as much utility as Orianna, however he has better sustained damage while he fights.\nAnd again even if shut down hard, he has great CC usable for both engage and disengage or amazing AOE CC in the middle of a clustered team fight.\n\n\nIt really depends on your mechanical skill I find.\nOrianna has very high damage and utility but is useless if you can't work her mechanics properly. I've played her a lot because I enjoy her character and personality, but I can't send the Ball just outside Command: Attack's range like other people who are great at her can.\n\nViktor is less mechanically intensive but in someways more fun to play because of how variable his early/mid/late games can be. With the ability to choose your augments as you go through each stage Viktor's play style is rarely 100% the same everytime. I also find that his burst is more sustained burst than Ori's.\nHe is also able to take different items easily based on what you want to do at the time.\n\n\n\nIf you plan to main mid and are only just starting to play competitively I suggest Viktor, he is easy to learn and has many different ways to play, he works amazingly well against melee assassins both of the AP and AD variety.","replies":[{"poster":"Zerø","date":"2014-12-16T08:13:55.033+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps for your input! i have played both (only just tried out Viktor) I do understand how Orianna's mechanic work but have not fully mastered them.

A good ADC/Supp will be able to predict when junglers will be heading to their lane for a gank. She is one of the most item dependant mid laners, she isn't like a Fizz who can get a Sheen or an Akali which can get their revolver, and have a decent powerspike, she needs 2-3 items until she is truly has a great or good effect on the game, and this is provided you have stayed on par cs wise, I know some Oriannas which get beat out of lane by Zeds/Syndras/Ziggs/Ahris etc (Archangels/Morellos/Athenes, death cap/zhonyas, then sorcs/cdr boots)","replies":[{"poster":"Zerø","date":"2014-12-16T09:17:08.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not much for Katarina and Akali, Fizz is a so so, Xerath is somoene ive never looked at playing, and kindof dont want to.

In this scenario you basically ensure you don't get shoved into too hard (don't want to be stuck last hitting 4 or 5 minions at tower level 2-3-4) \nto stop this from happening take note of how much dmg they are dealing to your minions and whether or not they intend on shoving you in, if they aren't just farm q :) if they are constantly aa their minions till you can go for a q stack... \n\nyou need to be knowledgeable about a lot of match ups..\n\nLike Lissandra is going to shove you really hard all game making it hard to farm q or last hit under tower, so you need to prepare yourself for that if she does shove, \n\nveigar is pretty decent in team fights (e) and if you can position well you should be pretty safe, also you have the potential to force players to get a BV and mercs, this allows your team to have an easier time as they have put more emphasis on you.\n\nVeigar is highly immobile, so vi is a great counter to you, consider getting distortion if you find a constant need for flash/barrier/heal\n\nAs veigar you generally run ignite, but barrier and heal are never bad options if you are against a hard AP burster like Fizz or Le blanc\n\nQ is highly spammable so getting q stacks is very wurf.\n\nE is great tool at catching runners, or even e > flash, though I would not recommend unless it is safe. \n\nVeigar is underplayed so people are not use to vsing him too","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"meluvcookies71","date":"2015-01-26T08:58:05.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zero, did you end up picking Orianna or Viktor?
