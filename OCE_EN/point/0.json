I probably wont be watching game replays or anything that is extremely time intensive coz I still want to play the game myself unless I just wanna chill than I may be open to it. I&#039;ll mainly just be looking at your op.gg and ranked stats or just answering questions and giving my opinions on whats a good way to climb and who to climb with.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;f you think I may be able to give you some advice hit me up in game, Thanks guys.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-03-19T00:46:31.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hiya :)\n\nBronze 5 {{champion:28}}  and {{champion:61}}  two-trick. Getting decent scores, but still haven't gotten anywhere in 2 years. I have also received coaching (which has helped), but whenever I gain LP I seem to lose it just as quickly.\n\nAlso, since I can see you're a Jg main, any good jungle tips? My coach told me about learning to predict where the enemy jungler is, but have no idea how to do that if they could be anywhere.\n\nThanks :)\n\nOP.GG: https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Percival9","replies":[]}]}
