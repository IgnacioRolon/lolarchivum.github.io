I am finding when i play poppy 90% of the time when i use Keeper&#039;s Verdict my ping spikes greatly, the spike is so huge that i can&#039;t finish the ulti/cast and for a good few seconds after the channel i can&#039;t play the game (move/attack/cast). Sometimes i get the whole d/cd reconnecting box, outside of using her ult my ping is stable for hours.
