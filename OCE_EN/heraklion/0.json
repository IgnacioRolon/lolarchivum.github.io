I therefore would like to petition to remove the Pool party Ziggs skin from my account and to be gifted the new server skin.\n\nNone of us asked for this and riot has never mentioned that this is how the situation would be played out. I never wanted the ziggs skin in the first place, I only wanted what all the other serves had received.","replies":[{"poster":"Gunslinger744","date":"2015-09-29T14:12:16.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wanna remove a 1350 skin in favor of a maybe 750/975 skin that will be at half price?\nAlright, guy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anamaius","date":"2015-09-29T06:58:26.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what about those that joined the server without transfering?
