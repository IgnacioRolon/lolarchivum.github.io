I do enjoy playing the game, however, when you can&#039;t even get past 5 minutes in the game it is really discouraging.\r\n\r\nSo here is the issue. I am able to go through champ select and the loading screen. At this point I have no idea when the game will crash. Sometimes it is five minutes and other times 30 minutes into the game. \r\n\r\nI have looked on other forum posts and all i found was to make sure that you don&#039;t have lolreplay running in the background in which I don&#039;t.\r\nI have tried reinstalling from scratch and running as admin on my computer. However, I am always running into the same disconnect issues. \r\nOccasionally it does give me an error about my internet, but I know my speed is at 12 mbs and the signal is fine at max bars. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-27T06:48:45.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n>the signal is fine at max bars.\n\nHave you tried switching to a wired connection?","replies":[]}]}
