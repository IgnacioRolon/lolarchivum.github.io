And then i got the oh so lovely question of first 5 champions E V E R purchased on this account and the first RP item purchased. Now, this is absolutely mind boggling, i have had this account for 3+ years, and i am expected to remember that just off the top of my head? there is no way for you to find this information out, you just have to be lucky enough to remember. Finding out how much money you have spent on the game isn&#039;t &quot;sensitive information&quot; i don&#039;t care what they say. It&#039;s not like someone will see how much money i&#039;ve spent and have access to my account. Does anyone have a solution for this, like is riot intelligent enough to leave in a way to find out the first 5 champions i ever bought 3 years ago?","replies":[{"poster":"SammyTheDeadRat","date":"2015-12-08T10:05:35.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-08T10:25:35.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"220$, I've never heard of that currency.
