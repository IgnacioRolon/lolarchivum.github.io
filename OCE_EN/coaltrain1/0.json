Keep in mind a lot of your top champions are priority pick/ban in this meta (e.g. **Blitzcrank**, **Jihn**, **Gnar**).\n\nIf you're not first pick, you can't really blame someone for banning away one of the OP champions. Even when you've shown you want to play it.\n\nHere's what I recommend you do:\n\n+ If you're 100% sure they're trolling you, then don't use the \"selection/pick intent\" feature. Remember it's optional to use. \n\n If you were really only being trolled, then no one should ban your champions anymore once you stop using pick intent. You can also get creative and play mind games with the trolls by selecting a champion you don't actually want to play ;)\n\n\n+ Work together with your team. If you really want Blitzcrank but you're not first pick, **let your team know!**\n\n Many players do champion swaps in that kind of situation. It takes a bit of communication, but it's definitely worth it to get one of your main champions.\n\n _ e.g \n**You:** \"Hey mid laner, can you pick blitzcrank for me? then I'll pick Lux for you later and we can swap?\"\n**Mid:** \"Yeah sure\"\n**You:** \"awesome, don't ban blitzcrank guys, we'll first pick it and win bot\"_\n\nI hope that helps a little :D","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-09T08:39:46.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot on.
