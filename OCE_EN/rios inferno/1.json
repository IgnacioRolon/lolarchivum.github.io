I wonder just how fast these players can react and I&#039;m sure others are too. Do you think it would be possible to test their reactions speeds and see just how fast they truly are?  I don&#039;t know about everyone else but I&#039;d definitely watch a video about testing and finding out just how fast these pro players can react, possibly alongside clips of some of their fastest reactions in previous games (slow-mo with a milliseconds timer).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-04T19:51:24.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with League is it's just as much about Predictions as it is with actual Reaction time.\n\nEspecially in LCS sort of settings, predicting what your opponent will do means you have more time to actually react then would seem humanly possible, this is shown even just by taking into account Madlife and his hooks, which can't be Reactive as the cast is made before the flash.","replies":[{"poster":"Rios InfernO","date":"2015-07-08T06:03:51.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes but still, there are some moments where sheer reaction time is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-09T00:54:35.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes and no, a lot more of it is about predictions then actual reaction time.\n\nNot arguing that they wouldn't have a better then normal reaction time, just arguing that it's not superhuman sort of shit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
