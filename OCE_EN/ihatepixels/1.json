I&#039;m available the whole weekend to smash out many many games. I&#039;ve got all forms of voice communication, play to win and just generally chill. \r\n\r\n I&#039;m a low plat player on a new account, but don&#039;t worry about that. I&#039;m running exp/ip boosts and have got the champs/runes I need to win games (we&#039;ll probably even get matched against lower rated opponents).  Add in client-cheers.","replies":[]}
