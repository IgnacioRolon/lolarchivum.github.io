Hardware is not the issue and my internet on speedtest is over 36mb/s\r\n\r\nAny help guys? Running it on Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite laptop with 8gb/ram, 2gb/Video card etc\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve changed DNS through adapter settings to one that is apparently 41.7% faster and flushed DNS through CMD with no help at all\r\n\r\nPlease help and thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-22T20:16:39.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Saraphrim,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
