Click reconnect multiple times\r\n2. Re-login to your league of legends client\r\n3. Restart your machine\r\nand still had no fix? Then later receive a penalty for going AFK in-game?\r\nI have a suggestion which may fix part of the issue.\r\n\r\n**There needs to be some kind of point system for people who are unable to connect.**\r\nFair enough, if someone disconnects because they don&#039;t like their team or another part of the game, give them the penalty. But to players which are repeating 1-3 they should gain &quot;AFK points&quot; which accumulate the more of those they try. If by the time they reconnect or the game finishes and they have enough of these points, a leaver tag should not be added to the player.\r\nAnd yes, the team will still suffer for the player which isn&#039;t in the game but **why punish the player when they&#039;re doing the best they can...**\r\n\r\n**Additionally**, if the player goes AFK give them an option as to whether or not they wish to deny it (for genuine connection issues) - and be forced to play _and  win_ a few bot games without going AFK or something similar to ensure their connection works again before going back to PVP - or accept it (for people who forgot to take their cat for a walk that day) - and accept the current AFK punishment system.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m just saying, I&#039;ve had this happen a few times and it wasn&#039;t fair to me so it definitely isn&#039;t fair to anyone else.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-05-23T10:04:34.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly: It's the players responsibility to ensure they have a stable enough connection to play. It's also the players responsibility to ensure their computer meets the hardware/software requirements of the game. This is stated in the TOU and EULA. If you are disconnecting because of issues that arise from this it's your own fault. That simple.\nSecondly: In order to be hit with leavebuster punishments you would need to leave games *consistently*. If you are DCing often enough for that to happen, regardless why the DCs occur, it's your own fault. That simple.\nThirdly: Ultimately, it doesn't matter why a DC occurred. Whatever the reason it's disadvantaged 4 other people and ruined the game for as many as 9. Should the system be more lenient? No. Why should other people suffer in-game because *some people* don't check their computer and connection are up to scratch?\nLastly: Playing the \"it's not fair\" card doesn't work here. It's Riot's game, Riot makes and maintains it, Riot make the rules, Riot determined what's fair.
