Yes, I&#039;ve tried following every [troubleshoot option](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and yes I&#039;ve run a network analysis and tracert.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also submitted a support ticket and despite listing what I&#039;ve already done (as stated above), I still get a reply telling me to try the troubleshoot options as if it were an automated reply, completely useless. I&#039;ve even contacted my ISP and they&#039;ve checked my internet connection from top to bottom, saying everything is fine.\r\n\r\nI wouldn&#039;t have a problem with this ping spike if it went away after a few hours, like every other patch update for me but ever since 6.1. went live, I cannot play at all, getting spikes every five seconds and completely missing the action and dying. I know I&#039;m not the only one experiencing this as I&#039;ve seen numerous players from this (and other) regions having the same problems.\r\n\r\nSo please Riot, have a look and solve this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-21T23:31:57.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi mate\n\nFirstly - sucks that you are having this problem.  Hopefully there is a way to get around it for you.  It is great to see you've been following the guides and taking some steps to try and fix it.  One thing to note is that while a lot of people might experience similar problems (ping spikes etc), these problems are relatively common and can be caused by soooo many different factors (your pc, home network, your ISP, a backbone provider).  That is why you see people all over the world reporting similar issues.\n\nThat said, I looked up your ticket to get a feel for what is going on and from the traceroute provided it seems that you have a pretty decent path to the OCE League servers (5 hops).  The main thing that jumped out at me though, is that it takes 2-3ms for packets to get to your first hop - ie the router on your own network.  This can be a pretty bad sign (something a few metres away should almost always be 1ms).  This might be fine, but it certainly bears investigation.\n\nMy advice would be to continue responding to the support agent and provide the logs that were requested.  It may seem like a lot of work but remember they have to build a fairly comprehensive picture of what is going on in YOUR situation to be able to help you properly, that is why they ask for this stuff :)\n\nLet me know how it goes!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"The Melon Lord","date":"2016-01-22T03:18:54.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My router is literally less than a metre away from me, I've **never** had a lag spike this bad and lasting this long before until the patch 6.1. update.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-21T17:42:41.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you please post your Tracert here?","replies":[]}]}
