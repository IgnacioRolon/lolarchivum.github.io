It goes far beyond just champion counter picks, like passive(runes/masteries) increase into teams movement speed to be able to cross map quickly to assist team mates in fights ( SKT did this a lot I think). \n\nGoing full time hardcore is no simple task, seriously requires soooo much work and understanding, not to mention travelling to venues for matches (once again SKT a good example after MSI 2017, soo much jet lag and had to be back on stage immediately once returned home). \n\nThere is plenty to consider, those that go the hard yards are not going to let those that don't take away the win they worked for.  \n\nThere is a lot of costs in this life style, which is why they Live stream etc. \nHardcore teams have coaches, managers, dietitians, typical bills (internet etc) to pay and much more. Prize money maybe good but they have to get to it first. \nIs why I support my regions team with small donation on viewing streams etc, if i think they got what it takes to represent me and my region, i will give my support and hope they do proud! \n\nThose teams that make it to top worlds lists, all have my respect. It is a phenomenal achievement.\n\nThis is just all imo!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-09-27T02:49:51.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pros gym a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-26T15:18:37.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on the region\n\nBig teams in big regions are fulltime in a gaming house for extended periods","replies":[]},{"poster":"StarzAU","date":"2017-09-26T14:05:42.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Occasionally teams post AMAs so it would be best to ask on those. \n\nThe following is all second hand info so might not be 100% accurate!\n\nOPL teams move to Sydney Team Gaming houses during Split 1 + 2. Heading home in between each split. Each team has different practice hours, but would have requirements and expectations for the players who are being paid to be there. Anywhere between 5-10 hours practice per day depending on the team.\n\nMost of the time they have fairly stable/regular sleeping schedules. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-09-26T09:33:00.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
