Very few mid laners can escape or fight back.\n\nEven in his more traditional role (jungle) he does fine. Check out his stats, his win rate is really high this patch.

Totally!\n\nDon't be arrogant. You're only Gold, you still barely know anything about the game. Aatrox can build tanky and still deal a fuckload of damage, just like Xin (more damage, less CC). He's also strong as a bruiser-fighter, just like Xin. Is he outclassed by some other champs? Probably, yes. Is he weak? Hell no. If he got buffed he'd be permaban status in high Elo since the people who are good at Aatrox CRUSH games.
