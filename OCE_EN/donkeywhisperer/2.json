Granted i have been toxic myself im sure ive been reported multiple times due to tilt and people who i believe to have had aid to get boosted to elos they do not belong in even match history over weeks proves that im likely right about that as well.\r\n\r\nevery1 has bad games i get that im definitely not exempt from that and being toxic im sure 90% players  atleast are toxic to an extent and have been reported for it\r\n\r\nsure there are also players who are toxic who report others for telling them to shut up or making the obvious point that they are being toxic and their own fault doing poorly( espically in norms and in lower elos such as plat and below but more evident the lower it is)\r\n\r\nim really not concerned at all in norms if people troll infact i generally have laugh but its more so the fact of when they troll and completely mess over people trying to climb in rank\r\n\r\nWould putting recording as evidence of EXTREME toxicity and trolling help? I really dont want to put recordings up for case as i think i could flood forums as could quite a large number of players. \r\n\r\ni apologize but just multiple of these games happening after im trying to untilt from demoting on my main account from being diamond promos and im quite cool on trying on other elos new tactics on ways how to win","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-07-29T06:02:46.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking to get big changes to the Player Behaviour systems I'd personally recommend heading over to [r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/) and posting some stuff there. You'll have massive exposure to the community and Rioters if you hit the front page.\n\nYou're always welcome to post here (provided you don't mention names), but all the Player Behaviour systems are based in NA, so OCE Rioters might be a little bit limited when it comes to getting the actual systems changed.\n\nIf you just want to report a specific person then the in-game report system is best, but otherwise you can always get it touch with [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We don't do specific reports on the OCE boards though since \"naming and shaming\" isn't allowed.\n\nI hope that helps :D","replies":[{"poster":"DonkeyWhisperer","date":"2017-07-29T06:12:21.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i appreciate it especially that last part little over people are quite foul over the net just ruins enjoyment from home i will look more into what you said","replies":[]}]}]}
