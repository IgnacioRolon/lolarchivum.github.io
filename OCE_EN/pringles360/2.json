Ever. Buy her. Try her. If you like her learn her, otherwise no harm no foul.\n\nI recently bought a lot of champs and so far of the 5 i've bought I only actually think I will play 1 in ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2015-01-13T11:35:09.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nIn my opinion if you're going to play Ranked, then stick to the champs that you main and are confident with. If you want to buy Orianna and test her out, play with her in Normals first, then if you feel comfortable with her, take it to Ranked. It's not worth the stress of losing LP playing a champ that you aren't confident with in Ranked. But, like I said, it's just my opinion =) comes down to your decision.\n\nHope I helped a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-01-13T02:47:22.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not both?
