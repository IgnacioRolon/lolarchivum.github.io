He made a very in-depth guide about Urgot top, but he does mention other roles, such as adc, jungle and support.

If he got a bit of a mana buff and add on another, say, 25 range, he would be a much stronger ADC, with targetable secondary autos. He still is strong at the moment, but is looked down upon by the community and is often a bit too dangerous to play, despite him being a tankier ADC.\n\nI don't know anything about Urgot as a top-laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-26T06:55:06.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that people play him as an ADC.
