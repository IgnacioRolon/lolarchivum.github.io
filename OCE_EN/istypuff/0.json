Riot has dropped the ball yet again","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":5,"down_votes":6,"body":"So on my other account I was given a 10 game chat ban.\r\nI can deal with that.\r\n\r\nBut what and how I was reported is a complete farce.\r\nIn the games I was reported I was told \r\n&quot; You are a complete f wit. KYS  &quot;\r\n\r\n{ I have the video link for this chat log } \r\n\r\nThen in the other game I was reported for I was told \r\n\r\n&quot; Go neck yourself &quot; &quot; KYS It will make your mother happy &quot;\r\n\r\n{ Once again.. I have video log for this }\r\n\r\nThe players that have said this to me are still allowed to play this game without any ban in anyway. \r\nHow do I know. I have come across them a few times and they all said\r\n&quot; See. I told you I wouldn&#039;t get ban so KYS now.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe thing that really makes me want to be the most toxic player you have ever seen or ever will is the fact that I was perma ban on one of my accounts for getting up someone that was trolling.\r\nThen when I asked Riot about it. I was told I was not general possessive... \r\n\r\nYes I know he without sin and so on. But how broken is this autoban system. \r\nKYS = Kill yourself. But since this auto ban crap doesn&#039;t know this they dont get ban even after you report them.\r\n\r\nOr let&#039;s say I have a bad game and get reported. Team was toxic af { Once again another word this auto ban system does not know } but you&#039;re the one reported for having the worst game of your life you will get ban.\r\n\r\nThis happen to me after 1 GAME.. Reported for feeding. Why because of the 4 people on my team.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am sorry if you think it is working perfectly but to me.. It is far from it.\r\nPeople report people for anything and everything. But if you troll by giving FB { First blood once again another word } then go back into lane wait 3 mins then feed again and then once again wait 3 mins and feed again and so on until the game ends.\r\nThen get reported.. YOU DONT GET BAN.\r\n\r\n Why? Due to the wait time. intentionally feeding is when someone will go in over and over to die.. They won&#039;t wait.\r\n\r\nThis was proven to me by a player { Once again I cannot name.. Riot doesn&#039;t like naming and shaming.. Even though it should happen to some people } who told me he was going to do it. He did it in 10+ games and was reported and still not ban.\r\n\r\nThen you have the players that have worked out a way around the key word search. They are more toxic then I have ever been.. But yet they are still playing.\r\nBut if you say &quot; FK &quot; or &quot; FKing &quot; the autoban system will ban you.\r\n\r\nI am sorry Riot but you guys are a joke. You ban people for saying how bad someone is.. But when someone tells someone go KYS WKER your system fails.\r\n\r\nAs I said last time I was perma ban for BS reasons.. You guys told me to learn from it.\r\nWell I did. I learnt to record chat logs.. FOR THIS REASON ALONE!!!!\r\n\r\nIf you want the proof Riot.. Tell me I will post them all here. \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-02-07T06:40:01.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Commenting on this post is locked because some conversations have completely derailed from the topic at hand and I'd like to prevent them from derailing further. \n\nHeated arguments are fine on the boards, as long as they remain relatively civilized.
