Bottom line is that the automated system has difficulty with those kinds of situations, and it's *strongly* recommended that you don't \"copy\" other players statements, because it can result in situations like this. Beyond that there *is* a consistent negative attitude that would have contributed, and I'd recommend you reflect on that behaviour and focus on keeping calm and not saying anything if it's not positive and/or constructive.\n\nI'd strongly recommend you take up this case with [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) and hopefully they can help you correct this.","replies":[{"poster":"TankerInc","date":"2018-11-01T05:23:38.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=H3WtAzIH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-31T09:56:26.785+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;d strongly recommend you take up this case with [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the &quot;Account suspensions or restrictions&quot; option) and hopefully they can help you correct this.\n\nRiot did nothing.\n\nPEACEMAKER\nNovember 1st 2018, 2:10:03 pm\nHey there,\n\nPeacemaker from Player Support here to help out. I understand your frustration seeing your account with a 2 week suspension like this. I've gone ahead and looked into your account, and it looks like you were banned due to our zero-tolerance policy regarding the term KYS or telling another player to kill themselves. We find remarks like this much more severe hence why it was escalated to a 2-week ban. I can see that you were saying it to inform them but there was no reason to repeat it and it 2 different games. We need to all be held accountable for what is brought into the game. For those reasons, I cannot remove the suspension. Even if you are losing there is still not reason to add negativity to the game. :/\n\nThat being said. I want to make it very clear that any other penalties of any kind against your account will resort in a permanent ban. I always suggest that during this time you refrain from using chat and focus on the game and using pings for communication.\n\nIf you're still confused or need help with anything else, please let us know.\n\nPeacemaker\nPB&G \nRiot games player support\n\"Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree.

You could have reported them and not also added it to the game. I will look into this but we take privacy pretty seriously so I won't be able to talk about this players account directly. It is also important to let you know that you do not always receive a message saying your report got someone. Please keep reporting them though, reports are an important piece to tracking these players down.\n\nYou also added negativity to this game besides this though.\n\nIt looks like you were arguing a lot with teammates. Even if they are negative we shouldn't also contribute to it, and arguing doesn't help the situation.\n\nI have also seen you are blaming your teammates a lot for their plays/play mistakes. That is negative because it puts your teammates down and doesn't encourage them to keep trying or do better. This includes commenting their K/D/A, that is used to put players down for their game.\n\nEven if you get teamed up with a feeder or someone just being negative, retaliating does not solve the issue and only contributes to the negativity they create. I always suggest muting the player, focusing on your own game, and then reporting them through the client or directly to us. It really is the best way to deal with that kind of negativity without also adding to it.\n\nIf you feel this is what makes you quit league I understand completely and I do wish you the best in any games you play from here.\n\nPeacemaker\nPB&G \nRiot games player support\n\"Once I made a harpoon out of a mountain and a world tree.

Not me aiming it at anyone. If I said \" This jungle is boosted af. \" Then sure.\n\nAs my point \n\n\" Istypuff: I am playing to relax\nIstypuff: Not to deal with your rage\nIstypuff: As it sits\nIstypuff: PEOPLE LIKE YOU AHRI\nIstypuff: IS WHY I AM NOT PLAYING SHEN\nIstypuff: You look for people to blame for you own shit \"\n\nThat is me aiming it at someone.\nBut also lets take into account the amount of crap I had to deal with to want to play a troll champion like teemo. No one is going to be all sunshine and rainbows and lollipops when it comes to a loss.\n\nLike many others I want to rank up. This creates a need and so inturn makes that need to become a dependency. This also inturn makes the a loss have an emotional reaction. E.G Going from B5 to S5 made me feel happy. But going from S4 to S5 made me feel despressed.\n\nThe same can be applied to but not limited to. A win or a loss. \nPeople rarely report people for being toxic for a win. E.G I am reporting this player for being able to carry my team to a win. \nBut for a loss.. People want someone to blame. People will start to fight with people because they have loss 3 or 4 or even more games in a row. Come a cross a teemo top and think to them selfs \" This player went teemo. we have just loss because of them \" with no real reason other then they hate teemo as teemo is a troll champion to vs.\n\nBut then you also have the idea of self defence. \nIn a court.. No better yet before it even goes to court. We have a thing in Australia called [PROVOKED](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/provoke). This means the player is trying to make you rage. Causing the feelings of a loss to become more of a feeling of anger. This in turn will triggered the fight or flight reflex. \nSome people will need to run away from it. They might even afk or leave the game to avoid the toxic and/or emolitional feeling they are being provoked to feel.\n\nThe main issue with that.. Is the fighters. People that when  they are being actted upon. Must and will fight back. This isn't a conscious decision they making at the time of the actions used against them.\nThis why we have due process. Police talk to you first. Then courts and so on.\nMost of the time police will say \" Was it provoked? \" because if it was.. Then it comes down to fight or flight. If it was completely unprovoked. Then you are to blame.\n\nBut I am still having a emotitonal reaction to this ban right now. so I will end it here before I type 10,000 word reaction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-10-31T22:26:54.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"why the fuck would you repeat the word and/or bother trying to talk to your team? just shush and play the game you seem worse than me","replies":[]}]}
