Now this isa bug that i have noticed a lot more on the 30 minute timer. Simply the fact that it is incorrect. the timer counts down to slow. the time the &#039;30&#039; minute penalty is actually around 38-39 minutes long. i first noticed this when i was watching a stream and his ingame timer did not match up with the speed that my timer went at. the next time i had the penalty i timed it on my phone. and it was infact aroubnd 38-40 minutes long. which is a considerable amount of time longer than the &#039;30&#039; minutes it is meant to take. is this a computer bug? or a riot bug? i have had this happen on 2 different computers on multiple occasians","replies":[]}
