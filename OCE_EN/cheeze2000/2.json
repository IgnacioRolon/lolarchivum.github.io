I learnt the basics in bot games and I played a PvP match after. The midlaner in the enemy team was Vel&#039;Koz. He kept using his W so I could not go forward and farm. My outer turret was the first turret to be destroyed. They kept pushing mid and almost destroyed the inhibitor but Evelynn, my jungler, bought Rylai&#039;s and killed everyone. In the end, she got 36 kills but our team lost. I felt bad to the whole team. So, may I have some tips on Fizz early game?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-09T13:45:45.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"you want to play fizz? thats just as bad as being a filthy teemo main, advise against it, if you really need to know, getting those early auto attacks between lvs 1-3 with w is essential to being ahead, or snowballing the hell out of control","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gentleman Gnar","date":"2016-01-12T07:16:41.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guild on playing Fizz:\n1) get level 3\n2) go bot lane and get a double kill\n3) Keep on going back to bot\n4) Kill your laner\n5) Go top and get a kill\n6) repeat\n7) profit","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-01-12T07:12:47.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A quick guide on how to play Fizz:\n1. Walk into mid lane.\n2. Win lane. If you magically die for whatever reason go bot and get a double kill.\n3. Make the ADC rage quit because you just one shot him/her.\n4. Kill the enemy nexus.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-01-12T06:09:48.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go forth and stab. Fizz is an assassin so has a fairly shit laning experience that only gets better once he hits 6. You need that cs so don't be afraid to take some hits if it means getting the minion.\n\nAfter your lane imploded you should have moved on to ganking other lanes and picking off squishes in team fights. I'm not sure of your full team comp but Eve's ult is a fair tool for slowing a bunch of enemies for you to troll pole onto, not the best cc tool but it has it's uses.\n\nI have lost so many games after shutting Fizz down mid just to have other lanes feed him to fuck. Try grab some jungle kills, when your lane goes the enemy jungler might get confident and go into you team's jungle if not already there. You just need to keep picking up kills. Don't stay in your failed lane, trident wrecks buildings so you can always come back for a quick demolishion.","replies":[]}]}
