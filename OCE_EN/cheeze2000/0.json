I tried jungling with Tryndamere and decided to gank top. Everytime I went into the fight, the enemy just ran away, making my gank useless. Also, I was level 8 when my teammates are level 10+. The jungler from the enemy team spotted me and killed me. So, I guess my first jungling turned out really bad but I won the game eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-07T18:55:12.378+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buy Sweeping Lense on your first B.\n\nAlso, because you can't sweep Tribrush and Side brush of top, or it can ruin your ganks anyway, try E'ing over Baron wall.\n\nBot enter from mid right side then head behind drag pit then past your wall then check your creep wave so you know where theirs is and walk from red to krugs then head to bot tribrush from behind but run out from between the walkway between their turret and river wall.\n\nWhen on the opposite team for this lane - lane ganks work better (walking into lane when they are pushed to their turret then sitting in brush and sweeping it then waiting for the lane to push back so they are vulnerable.\n\nOnce you get 9 it's easier to get ganks but lane ganks top are good sometimes too. You should always lane gank if you can because it basically trumps warding.\n\nYou have a slow but you'll normally need red buff to gank. Chilling smite can help, it's good if they don't have a lot of assassins or carries that you benefit from the 20% damage reduc against - but having red should make ganks easier.\n\nEven if you force the enemy B or hurt them, capitalize on it and push the lane in and take turret or at the very least in doing so you have given your lane an advantage. Maybe you just need more damage or Blade of the ruined king active or something. You usually need Damage on trynd so you should really focus farming and only gank if it's an easy kill, to counter an enemy jungler ganking, to defend against an enemy jungler or laner 2v1'ing or to give your lane an advantage by basically harassing or even creating pressure in lane and/or forcing their jungler to react plus if they're losing lane hard, lending them a helping hand can be great.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-08T01:27:13.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd give you tips on ganking but since these guys below have pretty much covered it all, I'll give you another tip. Depending your ally mid laner and your jungle champion, if you can, don't be too greedy with your blue buff. If he's a good mid lanee it'll help him a lot more than you might think","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-08T01:00:56.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i did have a nice 2000 word long explanation for you, but I clicked on \"Posting as Talon12\" and not Preview (show) -.- and lost it all...

(Just an example)\n- Getting a kill(s) ~ (I'm pretty sure I don't have to explain this one cause you get gold and XP who doesn't want it) But what do you do after you get the kill while the laning enemy is down. Well I say turn it into Rift Herald/ Dragon or even the tower.\n- Giving your ally a helpful push ~ Sometimes just walking trough the allies lane can cause an enemy to back off the pressure a bit and grant your ally less farming pressure\n- Giving your blue buff to mid ~ When you have a mana hungry champion in mid lane that's always oom or actually doing well for once giving them blue buff gives them CD and huge mana regen and it helps your team a lot.\n\nThese are just some tips I learnt from good jungler but when you gank try to ward the river or a bush so when your gank goes well and your pushing tower while the enemy mid laner and jungler has gone MIA and no one calls it, (like usual half the time) you can see your enemy down coming before they have you stunned and blowing your face off and please make sure you have smite up when you go for Baron/Dragon/Herald.","replies":[]}]}
