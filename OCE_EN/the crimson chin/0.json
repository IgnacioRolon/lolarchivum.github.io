Can see the game [here](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/121106015/200035045?tab=overview) and the matchmaking at time of the game from op.gg [here\r\n](http://i.imgur.com/DKg4SKt.png)\r\n\r\n-  Currently we&#039;re seeing increased queue times (drastically at higher elos - 20+ minutes regularly, sometimes as high as 80 minutes to find a game)\r\n\r\n- Matches that feature premades versus no premades. \r\n\r\n- Incredibly imbalanced matchmaking (often in an attempt to &#039;balance&#039; for the premade status). \r\n\r\nAll of these are the result of having too small a population for this type of queue. Considering that Riot has stated an intention to introduce a second SOLO queue, it appears that it would not be feasible in any way on our server without further exasperating the problems we see currently. It seems that instead we need to go the other way: return to having ranked only available during some hours of the day.  \r\n\r\nWould love to see any rioters unofficial thoughts on the matter and whether its something we&#039;re just going to have to cope with, or if theres anyway we can have some sort of solution to our unique problem.","replies":[]}
