After Udyr's initial release in late 2009 and his first 2 skins in 2010, he was left with completely no new skins nor visual/animation updates for 3 years straight, not even some colour re-balancing. The result was that his appearance was so astonishingly outdated compared to everybody in the game at the time, someone people just couldn't take it anymore and started demanding new skins and updates for him, which came as Spirit Guard Udyr. Considering the timing of it all, and the similarities SPU shares with Classic Udyr, it's been theorised that the skin was actually intended to be the visual update for the champion originally, but the artists way-overdid themselves and Riot just up and said \"fk it, let's sell this instead\". But we won't know for sure.\n\nSo who would be the next to get a legendary skin?
