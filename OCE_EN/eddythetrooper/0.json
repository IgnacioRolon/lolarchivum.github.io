I only have two ability ideas:\n\n**E**\n* Instead of a line thing he throws a cabal toss (those massive logs that are seen in Scottish games). \n\n**R**   \n* As he activates his ult everyone hears bagpipe music, instead of a roar. Again, much more scary :p\n\n\n\nIf anyone has any more ideas on it please put in an idea. If you love it please comment/like so riot employees can notice it :)\n\nEdit: Of cause he would wear a kilt, what else would he wear :)","replies":[{"poster":"CheesyNinjas","date":"2015-03-04T02:26:13.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have him not using the bagpipes as a weapon, have him hold a Gallowglass sword and have him play the pipes for his dance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-15T08:36:35.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like the E should be with wood cutter sion but I know what you mean","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-15T05:43:52.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe, when his shield explodes, his kilt flies up a bit?","replies":[]}]}
