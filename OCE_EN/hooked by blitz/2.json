It is possible to drop back through punishment tiers by showing consistent positive/neutral behaviour, though there's no pre-defined period for how long that will take (generally 6-12 months is probably average).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-23T03:26:51.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Worth noting that there is no specific timeframe for two key reasons. \n\nThe first is that it is designed to be individual, in much the same way as some people will progress through honour tiers faster than others. \n\nThe other is to obfuscate the process for those who would intend to drop *just* below the line before offending again in order to keep their account but continue their problematic behaviour.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that 'time' also has to translate to games played. It doesn't matter how long has passed so much as the consistency of the neutral/positive behaviour. If there are no games played the system has no way of verifying that behaviour, meaning you can't just play on an alt for a few months and expect the punished account to have dripped a tier.","replies":[]}]}]}
