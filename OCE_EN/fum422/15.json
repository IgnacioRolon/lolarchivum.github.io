So she permanently has the gold advantage, and most definitely has the scalings to capitalise on that. \n\nHer kit is very simple, literally the only thing she has to actually put effort into to aim, is her ult, so why should she be rewarded for near misses?\n\nIf you truly are ranked 5th on Annie, you should have no problem at all hitting an instant ranged AoE spell. I don't see the issue?\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, she's a good champ, and i like her, but she isn't exactly rocket science. You put your cursor on the enemy and press R, and unless you just couldn't help it and veered off to the side, they should be stunned, it's not like it has a cast time.\n\nTry landing all Xerath or Karthus's crap.","replies":[{"poster":"fum422","date":"2017-08-30T03:49:18.684+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Try landing all Xerath or Karthus&#x27;s crap.\n\n\nI can land Karthus's ult every time","replies":[{"poster":"Wellperegrine02","date":"2017-08-30T06:15:18.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a hard time landing Karthus ult in Urf","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-30T05:08:57.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:105}}  \n:/","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SiuoLXLouiS","date":"2017-09-22T10:18:35.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't matter, I play Aurelion Sol, hit Annie with my W 20+ times, no kill.
