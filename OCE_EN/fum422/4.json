In an extended duel he will win with all cooldowns blown. However in short trades you come out on top early. \n\n**Wukongs Crushing Blow - Q **gives him bonus Auto Attack Range which allows him to reach further than Jax. you can use this to trade with him from distances he cant trade back and use small auto trades to poke him down. What you are ideally wanting here is an Auto-Q combo and then walk away. If he tries to commit he will then follow into your minions and have to blow either his q or E if he wants to win the trade. If you can just disengage by walking out or use your W to evade him during his dodge time, you will then be able to reengage the fight with your **E - Nimbus Strike**. This way, you exhaust Jax's only tool which he has to really fight you, which is his E. Also if you manage to get his Q out and use your clone to get away, he has no chance of reengaging on you.\n\nThings to note are, you may want to wait until Jax has dropped his Passive stacks before re-entering. This is huge for Jax's dueling, and without it stacked he has lackluster trade power. Also, note that he is a single target damage dealer, whereas you are Area of Effect. You can use your Nimbus Strike on nearby minions to help poke Jax and then Q him without him even being able to touch you. If you take this scenario, you could hold your W for if he tries to reengage. \n\nKeep it in mind that you can very easily kill him at level 6 with jungle assistance, so call out to your jungler and time his Teleport and Flash Summoner Spells in order to really punish him.\n\nOther than that I guess make sure you focus on last hitting as much as possible! (It's not worth bullying enemies off farm if you lose it yourself!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-03T03:47:45.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jax? soooo easy...\nfreelo tips here\n\nwait for your jungler to be ready to gank\nattack him, using w\njax will almost always respond with the spinning stun thing, this is the part where you lure him closer to your turret\nbefore he stuns you, cast your clone. you will be stunned, big deal since you are invisible anyway. by this time your jungler has started ganking. attack him. then jax has nothing against both of you other than jumping to safety or wasting his flash.\n\nI did this all the time when vsing jax top.
