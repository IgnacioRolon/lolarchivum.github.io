This is a tip for any lane, just try and last hit, let the renekton push up and over extend so your jungle can come for an easy gank.\nBasically, renekton is a really strong top laner at the moment, i don't lose many matchups to him apart from when i verse a quinn, or a vayne or someone like that.\nRenekton's q heals him also. His q heals him triple the amount for each champion hit and triple the amount again if its empowered so make sure you don't underestimate him when you go in. \nThats all from me. Hope i helped :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-06T00:51:40.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't really do much other than just build health and armour early on and hope for the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"normanzzz","date":"2016-11-05T13:27:00.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at the very very start of the game use ur taunt. go tell the renek to eat shit(okay soz) and then he will probs tower dive you and then u get a free kill ez.\nand its norms so dw","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-03T09:55:35.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Build tanky and dont feed. Be more useful in team fights.\n\nSometimes you get put in a bad matchup, in those games you just play safe, don't feed, and fingers crossed your team does well.\n\nIf he freezes and you can't walk up to farm, then roam. Go with your jungler into the enemy jungle and kill enemy jungler. Or gank mid. Wukong is afterall a traditional jungler and can gank really well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIy Marbo","date":"2016-11-03T09:22:15.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, I'm a fairly experienced top main and have played this match up a number of times. Renekton counters Wukong outright, don't try to fight Renekton unless you absolutely have to trade, and if you do, use your Q (extends your auto range). If you can, W when he activates his W (which is his basic-attack stun) and try to get him to stun the clone - if he does, E, auto and Q him then run (proc thunderlords).\n\nRegardless of these trades, Wukong's strength is his ultimate in large team fights. Just try to survive the lane, minimise his opportunities for trading and wait for the late game team fights. Also build Black Cleaver -> Youmuu's -> Duskblade (and perhaps Lord Dominik's and GA depending on your needs). You want to be able to pop the adc in a combo then get out basically.","replies":[]}]}
