Maybe it has super short range. Or less EXP when in a lane with another champ (forcing them to solo-lane, which means the entire team would have to work around the champ pick and be an anti-meta). Or maybe they get weaker if something happens, like they move away from towers or closer to team mates, or maybe the opposite, they only get tanky the more enemies around them.\n\nI know you were probably just trolling with your post, but I don't think the idea deserves this hate.
