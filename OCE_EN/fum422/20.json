Higher elo's regognise the fact that if someone asks for top, theyll generally have alot of experience in that role and will acknowledge that they might be able to do better in it. But i agree with sekai. Minimum amount of roles understood should be 2. But you cant expect to climb playing all 5 roles with a plethora of champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-08-21T12:50:40.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have said that the minimum benchmark is 2 or 3 roles then I would have agreed with you, but all of them?\n\nNah man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Am Robot","date":"2015-08-21T03:18:03.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uhh...I'm plat IV and I pretty much play adc exclusively.

Personally, I think at least 3 positions, with a few champions in each, is enough for ranked. After all, champion select is the place for all 5 players to sort out their strategy, which includes putting everyone in a position they can handle. Asking people to learn every position is a bit ridiculous, mainly because different positions suit different styles of play. Personally, I'm confident as Top and ADC, capable of Mid and Support, but can't, for the life of me, jungle. I've tried to learn but it's just not suited to the way I play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-20T11:24:14.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can play all roles\njust some really badly\n\nthats why i dodge if i don't get top xdd","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-20T11:12:04.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um bud I can only jg top and I all ways get one if you cant give be in 2 or 3 lanes with 2 or more champs in each lane then don't do ranked you nub you","replies":[]},{"poster":"GunflameSmurf","date":"2015-08-20T09:01:38.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with you","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-20T09:50:03.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bad troll. down boy","replies":[]}]}]}
