Since they have low CD's and quite spam able. You can either go all out and try and out dmg him, or go tank early to last into the mid / late game.\n\nYou are wukong after all, its your job to be relevant into the mid and late game, you will destroy teams, or at least set it up so your team can kill them.\nPantheon has single target, while you have AoE.\n\nIg you go ham, make sure you have a jungler or someone that can back you up, as this will solidify it.\nIf not, focus on CSing and farming (And warding you do not want to give him a lead.)\n15 CS = 1 kill, so aim for the average of 80 CS per 10 mins.\n\nIf you see him trying to use his ultimate and if you can, ult interrupt it.\nOr if you can't you have 2 decisions to make.\n\n1: Hard push your lane, screw afk farming or passively farming. Use everything to destroy those minion waves. And get that tower.\n\n2: TP gank, or walk down river, try and gank another lane or help the lane he is trying to gank.\n\nYou are the top laner too, its also your job to TP to dragon to help with it, and don't forget Rift herald, that's really good on anyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-06-05T07:41:36.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest if you can't outpower him starting clothe with 3 potions might help for early farming, use your E to last hit creeps and W to run away, always stay in range of the farm to gain exp so that you don't get underleveled and simply avoid dying because Pantheon even if he's farmed up has to actually snowball to remain really strong mid game and falls off lategame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dracuula","date":"2016-06-05T05:12:43.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should try asking this on the reddit page \"WukongMains\" try typing \"Wukong mains\" into Google and it should pop up","replies":[]}]}
