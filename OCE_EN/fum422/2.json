It isn't about fair or unfair, The map is Symmetrical (with the exclusions of certain objects) It keeps the game more interesting, while i am with the idea of adding Dominion in OCE and possible having permanent Map Skins available to play, i don't think classic Summoner's Rift should be changed. sure add another Map mode or a different looking Summoner's Rift but don't change what already works. If you have problems getting ganked in top lane, Ward where you can get ganked, assume the jungler is there if you cannot see him, do not over extend and most importantly if you are using wards keep a constant eye on the minimap. That is a mistake we all do make, getting ganked is probably going to happen when the game is getting intense. If you see someone engaging randomly assume it could be a gank.","replies":[{"poster":"EzrealAsItGets","date":"2015-07-29T11:33:07.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gravelord,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AsF9WMXg,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-07-29T06:28:38.806+0000)\n>\n> Change your Tactics per game.

It might be unusual to look at your minimap to your left however a lot of people don't like the new HUD placement and the size of information. Win-Win situation?\n\nTL;DR Customising the HUD would Be a better fix.\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-07-29T06:52:05.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well sed good sir","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-07-29T06:57:24.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks bro, add me in game if you want","replies":[]}]}]}]}
