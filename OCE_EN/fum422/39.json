Nocturne can also use his Q to catch up on Zed every time Zed tries to run away, and he can simply autoattack him, and Nocturne's Ult reduce Zed's sight, and he can cast his Ult again on Zed, dashing to him and deal physical damage on him. This way, Zed will pretty much have no way of beating Nocturne.\n\nVel'Koz may also counter Zed, due to the fact that he is more ranged than Zed, and more scary, and he deals magical damage. His ultimate will get Zed very low before Zed could even cast his Ultimate on Vel'Koz.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-17T06:06:30.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no counter...... yet stopwatch is free through runes or 600 gold\n\nAlso if you not taking barrier on xerath into an assasin then your gonna have a bad time.\n\nHonestly a good assasin has no counter imo, sure you can pick something to out do them inlane, but then they can roam and get kills that way.\n\nIn my experience kayles a good pick into zed and is pretty easy to learn. You can out poke zed in trades and negating his ult is easy with your ult, also it helps your team mates who get ulted aswell.","replies":[]},{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-16T16:06:09.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malzahar and anivia counters him well.  Rush zhonya to make zed much harder to kill you.  If rushing zhonya cripples your damage too much then at least get stopwatch (get it with runes if you have to stay in lane for a long time, or if you do not want to slow down your first item) and seekers armguard.  Pay attention dodging his Q, trade once he wastes his shadow for whatever reason, stun and combo him if he tries to approach you without shadows.  Watch out for him roaming to other lanes if you successfully make him unable to kill you.  Extend the game if you had a very hard time in lane.  Zed is much less effective in late game as long as you and your adc don't get caught.\nPlaying as xerath against a melee champ you might want to harass him with your long range.  Punish him after he uses his Q so that he cant poke back when you charge.  Take barrier if necessary.  ","replies":[]}]}
