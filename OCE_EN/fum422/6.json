Also what's not to like about a 27.5 sec huge range lazer?:D As for ahri, the way her ult works is a total life saver for me, you can reposition yourself and get out of trouble, or just use your 3 flashes to chase down an opponent(theyll never get away:P)! Ahri's q also does TRUE DAMAGE, sounds good?:P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-12T11:05:00.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's my picks for low elo people like you and me:\n\n+ **Jungle:** {{champion:32}} Amumu, {{champion:106}} Volibear and {{champion:2}} Olaf (he also works top).\n\n+ ** Top:** {{champion:98}} Shen, {{champion:86}} Garen and {{champion:54}} Malphite (be sure to take Grasp of the Undying mastery).\n\n+ **Mid:** {{champion:90}} Malzahar, {{champion:99}} Lux and {{champion:8}} Vladmir.\n\nOr just this guy {{champion:17}} for everything :D\n\nDon't get too hung up on champion picks though, honestly at below gold anything can work.
