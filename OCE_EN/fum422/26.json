In tandem with this change, however, we’re also adding a new feature in ward ‘debris’ when a ward passes on. By giving you the ability to see the dead bodies of wards who’ve moved on with their lives, you’ll be able to learn more about your opponent’s vision habits as well as your own.\n\nFor more information about the ward changes (including the Ward Debris), check out the [**2016 Pre-Season post**](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/preseason-2016-crests-horizon)!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-22T03:11:03.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dead wards","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-22T02:54:01.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i always assumed they were wards have been placed at some point?","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-01-22T02:56:49.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=WpysUYEW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-22T02:54:01.651+0000)\n>\n> i always assumed they were wards have been placed at some point?\n\npretty sure thats what they are, expired wards, red for red team wards, blue for blue team wards, so you can track where the enemy has been warding","replies":[]}]}]}
