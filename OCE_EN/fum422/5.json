Then use your trinket ward behind your second buff and delay starting it so your team can easily kill him if he tries to find you there. Using less common routes for your first clear really screws over people trying to cheese you early, and the minute or so they end up wasting runing across the map will hurt them a lot more than a slightly less optimal jungle clear will hurt you. Smiting wolves and not doing blue til after your first buy can also be effective if you started red side. This can also be useful vs other common invading champs like lee sin or evelynn, or if you see enemies trying to ward in your jungle before minions spawn.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2015-08-07T02:14:01.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As shaco can start either side, you can just counter play him and start the side he is mostly likely trying to counter you from. In saying that if you just want to not worry what so ever his Q travel from say red/over dragon/barron pit only takes him to the entrance to blue and your have a 1min ward so if you place this ward @ 3:50 mid river you will *should* always see him same goes for blue to enemy red he has to Q at the wall so placing a ward in either pit will allow you to see him. Now the risk as he may still be able to smite steal the buff but not get the FB so your other option is to ward the buff camp and move onto ravens/gromp/golems what ever you want really and see if he starts your buff. If he does then you can ping and re claim + possibly get the kill if not however if he runs off thinking you have started other side then you are free to do the camp. Shaco 9/10 will always 4/5 box a main buff and go for the quick clear and look for the smite steal and who can blame them with that kind of versatility so early on. My advise is if you think you cant claim the buff or win the trade dont bother with it, your going to give up time and gold for being greedy, so move on and continue , if you happen to be playing a champ that needs blue ( fiddlesticks) ask for a hard leash and skip the small camps first, at least that way you can continue with out any issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-08-06T22:53:07.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He seems to be a real problem atm..
