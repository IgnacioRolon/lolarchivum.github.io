Reports are certainly helpful in pointing out troublesome players and the kinds of behaviour that the community doesn't want to see in-game. That said, the report system isn't perfect either. It's possible for players to slip through the cracks, but it is far and few, so long as they are reported. False reports are, essentially, the only ones that do nothing.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws of the system is that it relies on player feedback, being reports, to function properly, which doesn't help when there's a significant number of players who never report due to misconceptions about the effectiveness of reports.\n\nOne thing to consider when talking about this particular topic is that, more often than not, players will base their \"opinion\" on whether reports actually do something on what they *see*, or what other people have said they've *seen*. Due to the lack of \"feedback systems\", what players actually see is very little, and it is mostly in relation to chat offences via the Instant Feedback system.\n\nYou have some players who will look at websites like OP.GG to determine whether another player has been punished, but that method is flawed because there are more types of punishments than just bans. Such websites will give no indication whatsoever in relation to lower tier punishments such as Low Priority Queues and Chat Restrictions.\n\nIf you see behaviour that is against the rules, or you think is simply not acceptable, it's best to submit a report. The only way something can be done is if Riot (and their systems) are informed of such behaviour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Fizz","date":"2017-08-22T08:16:35.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got falsely banned for having a laugh with the enemy Nasus just now. \n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/TosZQiim-falsely-banned-because-a-salty-teammate-reported-everyone-in-the-team","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-22T09:00:49.704+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't even need to read the full chat logs (though I still did) and I can tell you it's not a false ban. The short of it is that the term \"kys\" is taken very seriously by Riot, and the community, and should *never* be used if there *anyone* in the match who *might* not know it's a joke. The fact is, suicide encouragement is a very sensitive topic for a lot of people and should *never* be joked about in the presence of strangers (and I'm sure many would say never at all).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Surk","date":"2017-08-30T01:42:05.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reports are helpful... if u see a toxic or negative player just report them instead of getting caught up in their mess and if they keep being toxic they will get banned sooner or later... so yes they do something","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-08-22T07:39:22.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Im more confident that reports do nothing solely because im yet to see a report be successful.\nApparently trolling, flaming, intentional feeding, using scripts, boosting and all such is okay.\n\nBut god forbid you wanna climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Snow Foxy","date":"2017-08-29T01:09:26.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always report toxic players in my games and have on a couple occasions received notification that they have been punished.
