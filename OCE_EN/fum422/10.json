You have to back after the first 2-3 camps and frequently after that in the early levels. Once you have a jungle item completed its not terrible though, and the ganks are good if you manage your passive properly. You can pull it off if you really want, it's certainly not amazing though. I'd recommend AS marks, armour seals, AP glyphs/quints and 21/9/0 with the AP/AD/AS stuff in the offensive tree to help get through the early levels","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-14T21:35:58.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just found after the first few ganks I couldn't gank anymore because I had no gap closer and with all the warding that goes on it became literally useless.\n\nLike did ok with clears, got a few OP ganks early then scaled off wickedly because you lack sustain and don't get anywhere near as much Gold in the Jungle without Shyv type clears.\n\nIf you are going to do it I suggest a few early ganks then just go duo with your top laner or it becomes completely useless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-08-14T10:59:26.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"annie is one of the last champs id jungle with, outside of bots hint hint","replies":[]}]}
