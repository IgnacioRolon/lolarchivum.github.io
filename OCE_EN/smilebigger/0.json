I&#039;m scared that I&#039;ll get punished   because I simply duo&#039;d with him in the past.

Unless you offend the rules yourself in some manner (in this case, using 3rd party software), otherwise you can't get a punishment just because someone you know has gotten it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-23T06:29:55.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you have used them yourself, no.","replies":[]}]}
