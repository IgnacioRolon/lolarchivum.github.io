Do I wait to buy that part item for my last item and get a ward, or do I take the extra strength at the cost of vision control. Just as you have to make these kind of decisions so do the enemy.\n\nIt's about risk/reward. At full build end game (which most games don't make it to anyway) you have to make the choice between vision for your team or control of the enemy's vision (blue/yellow trinket or red trinket). Most teams will opt for having at least two red trinkets, one or two blues, one or two yellows and an SS at end game, but if you feel you need more vision control, a third red trinket may be something to consider. If the Jungler has Tracker's Knife then all the more reason to get a third red trinket.\n\nControl wards aren't the only means of vision control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-28T17:00:27.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"usually carrying a few control wards is better value than a little extra stats, the difference between 5 item powerspike and 6 item powerspike isn't that noticeable on most champions and control wards are very flexible. \n\nIn low elo 'aram' summoners rift (people mock this but some games I had today I just wished my team would just group and push down mid or force baron and stop chasing the 0-7-1 enemy support or trying to chase down and 1v1 the ap shaco near redbuff when he's obviously spent half an hour putting down an elaborate maze of boxes) the extra stats might be worth it, and on some champions and most adcs, the 6 items is important, and that's part of why you have a support, but in most games and cases, carrying the control wards is a decent investment.\n\nSometimes I like to just spam them out as a no cooldown sweeper alternative when trying to secure important vision for an objective and my trinket is on cooldown, sure it's 150-225 gold down the drain but it'll be worth to safely secure baron.\n\nAlso consider that instead of buying a 6th item, just use that gold to keep topping up on elixirs. The stats are almost just as good and I rarely see people using these.\n {{item:2138}} {{item:2139}} {{item:2140}}","replies":[]}]}
