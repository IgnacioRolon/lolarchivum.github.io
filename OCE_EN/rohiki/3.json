Very few champions can build this item and make use of it, but even then, Ninja Tabi or Mercury&#039;s Treads would be a just as viable option. The point I am making is that, Boots Of Swiftness as an item, doesn&#039;t really stand-out compared to the other boot items and I have rework idea to fix that problem.\n\n\nIntroducing; Tracker&#039;s Boots.\n\nStats; +45 Movement Speed (same as the other boots save for Boots of Mobility)\n\nUnique Passive; Upon stepping over a vision ward (control wards, blue trinket wards, and zombie wards do not count), the ward is revealed. Getting the final blow on the ward, adds a ward (like the one you can get from kleptomancy) to your inventory, at a maximum of 2.\n\nA few details; The range for &quot;stepping&quot; over a ward would have to be quite small, and the cooldown would have to be very high. One last thought is that also killing wards with these boots in your inventory grants double gold, and perhaps a bit more xp, to make it worth hunting for wards.\n\nWhat do you think? (stats, cooldown, price, and range of detection are all up for debate)","replies":[]}
