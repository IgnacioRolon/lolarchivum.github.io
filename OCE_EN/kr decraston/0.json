After having won the Oceania Preseason 5v5 Tournament, **North Esports is making a mark in the Esports OCE community**. However, due to unfortunate circumstances, our mid laner has resigned from the team, leaving a spot open. \r\n\r\n**If you want to join the team as our new mid laner** it is highly advised that you are at least a high diamond solo q player with plenty of team experience. The current team consists of predominantly Master/Challenger tier players so it would be good to carry through with our consistency. \r\n\r\nIf interested, please message North Chenerz in game or contact our twitter @northesportsne\r\n\r\nGood luck and North Up!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Makkam","date":"2015-12-02T08:36:11.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't take this the wrong way, but I'd look into the players in your roster a bit before you give them the position. lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bribery","date":"2015-11-20T22:50:31.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the roster","replies":[{"poster":"KR Decraston","date":"2015-11-21T03:53:15.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lost But Won - Top\nNorth Chenerz - Jg\nNorth BenXer - ADC\nEllui - Support","replies":[]}]}]}
