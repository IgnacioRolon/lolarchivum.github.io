First of all, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! Just posting my channel here because I'm wanting to grow and expand more and need your help! My channel has been up for about 6 weeks now and so far I have reached a total of 210 subscribers! But, I want to grow more! My channel does commentaries, highlights, montages, the works! Although I'm only Silver ELO, I love the game and I LOVE making videos. So if you're not too busy, come check me out and maybe even subscribe! It helps a lot :) Cheers guys.
