The in game team chat only does so much as typing is hard in the heat of getting your ass kicked by the enemy champions lol. I really want to improve as I am enjoying the game a lot when I play against other new players and bots, not so much when my team is disappointed in me from failing to run away and feeding the enemy smurf ;w;\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows a place I can find people to play with to learn how to play better please let me know! I do have a few friends with smurf accounts but they can only play so often so I&#039;d like to find others to play with to.\r\n\r\nAlso if you have any tips or information just to leave in the comments I would really appreciate that too, any advice is helpful!\r\n\r\nP.S. I am currently learning Ahri {{champion:103}}  and Ekko {{champion:245}}  playing mid, not very good at them so far but I really enjoy them so I hope to get better c:","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-01-31T01:22:30.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Order of things to do:\n1- Watch youtube videos about basic tips/guides/tricks.\n2- Play the game and get used to it.\n3- Try to read the abilities every single character has.\n4- Read the mobafire guides of the champions you want to play (p.s. this is a good one: http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/elusive-ferrets-super-in-depth-ahri-guide-409690\n5- Watch livestreams of challenger players.
