Whatever.\r\n\r\nPost game.... just look at this chat log (I changed the name so it says CAIT when the toxic person typed)\r\n\r\nI reported them so hopefully action is taken soon but damn... I just never expected to find this sort of toxicity when there&#039;s so many new players low level. I feel bad that the person I qued with, they are actually newish to the game and they had to deal with this. Just goes to show toxicity is at all levels... I just imagine if I was a new player and I failed to shield her in time and she flamed me, I think that&#039;d turn me off the game. I was lucky enough to have friends to play with so I never had to deal with strangers toxicity until higher levels but not everyone is the same. Just surprised to find its so bad at low levels where new players have to start, posting to bring awareness to it I guess idk\r\n\r\nErall0:  gg guys\r\nEveryone on your team honored a teammate!
