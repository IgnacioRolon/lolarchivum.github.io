If you're looking through team recruitment on here then most people should be around your timezone. That being said if you wanna play sometime check out our discord: discord.gg/xU22hbM","replies":[{"poster":"lizade","date":"2016-10-26T08:21:38.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jepman\nThank you for the reply,\nJust realised that thanks to your comment haha..
