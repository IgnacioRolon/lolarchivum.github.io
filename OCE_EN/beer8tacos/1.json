They would go afk in the fountain and eventually the announcer would announce they have left the game. Problem is that when this happens around the 10 min mark the remainder of the team have to play on until 20 so as to surrender. Whereas the player that quit can wait out a 5min penalty for quitting a game and move on into a new match.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the time penalty for quitting a game was reflective of the game which the player quit, with a minimum 5min. So if  a player quit at 10min they would not be able to que for another game until their original (quitted) game had atleast reached the surrender point.\r\n\r\nAt the moment if someone is loosing hard in lane and doesn&#039;t want to play anymore, and its less than 15min in, they can just quit and start afresh whilst the others on the team are plodding along until 20min.\r\n\r\nVery annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-30T00:45:13.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nGetting leavers really sucks, and I'm sorry you had to go through that experience.\n\nJust wanted to jump in and provide some information here. \n\n1) Players are not able to start another game when they leave until the game they left has finished. Until the game has finished they will be given an option to reconnect to the game but cannot start another game.\n\n2) We also have Leaver Buster in place for players who leave games you can read more about it here - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n\n\"You will be placed in the low priority queue for 5 games. If you continuously leave, the low priority queue timers increase from 5 minutes per game to 20 minutes per game.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Beer8Tacos","date":"2015-09-30T02:35:07.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much appreciate mate!! Was thinking it was a bit dodge if you quit..got a 5min ban and started a new game whilst others were still playing to 20min.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-09-30T03:35:28.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats what I meant with 1) as long as the game you quit is still happening you cant start a new game. You will just get a reconnect to game button.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
