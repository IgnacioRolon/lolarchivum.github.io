Then you report them and somehow you get reported also and YOU ARE THE ONE WHO GETS BANNED! Even though YOU weren&#039;t the one being toxic! This is pathetic, you guys are giving out perm bans to people whos trying to really play the game and ignore these folks but the moment we respond back to someone being a jerk to us WE GET BANNED..doesn&#039;t matter if i spent $10 or $1000 on my account, I get banned for the stupidest stuff. I literally just got my account back from a 14 day suspension, I PLAYED 1 GAME!!! 1 GAME! And the shaco/temo that was on my team was talking trash bc he got ganked when I was mid trying to clear a wave. He said I didn&#039;t know how to play Yasuo etc and just being real negative. And I responded to him using minimum foul language, I said like two curse words the whole game but I still get banned after reporting him and teemo. I just had enough of this community, RIOT you ruin the experience too when the player is the one being a victim but someone we still get banned. Such a joke, it&#039;s time to boycott. I never got banned from any game due to this claim of \"toxicity\" for responding back to nasty people...","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-11-23T23:52:22.521+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Provide actual evidences to your claims.
