Riot get your shit together and get a bloody tribunal happening here. Every game I enter is just toxic players who are constantly running their mouths. I play nice, I normally don't pay attention to them or mute them, but you need to do something about it. Also there are people who feed on purpose, surprised? It wouldn't surprise me if you didn't know that because these people haven't been banned yet. Like seriously, how long has OCE been out now? 2 maybe 3 years? I can't remember, but majority of the OCE community are fed up with these players, because these players know that they can get away with it. I'm going to say it again, get your shit together, stop being lazy and fix this god dam problem. You are the most played online game in the world right now, you should invest a little more time into making the community a little better rather than spending time making silly game modes such as this nemesis draft. I already know a lot of people have quit or have transferred to NA because they are fed up with this and would be willing to comeback if their was a tribunal. \r\n\r\nSorry for being angry, but sometimes you have to be to get your point across.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Kibbles","date":"2015-12-17T12:12:05.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree with you, riot needs to do something about these toxic players on OCE. I have also tried to ignore the toxic players but its a bit hard to do so when they are feeding or being abusive towards my friends, it is too hard to \"ignore these types of players\". In all honesty just today my boyfriends account got chat restricted because he was defending me in game because someone refused to give me a leash on blue buff as it is hard to kill it on your own as evelynn, waited around then stole the buff from me, was abusing me and my friends all game and then was feeding. We reported him but nothing came back from it, only that we got punished for his childish actions. If i were able to punish those who are doing wrong sign me up cause i cant be the only one that is sick of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-13T06:13:03.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">fix this god dam problem\n\nIt's not a problem. It's just not been implemented yet. OCE isn't the highest on their list in their headquarters, I've learned not to expect much from them.\n\nIf you want this to be read by a red, post it on the Misc. board. The reds don't like to hang around here.","replies":[]}]}
