My internet has been disconnecting only very recently over the past few days and I get this warning with the only option to continue past it is to say &#039; I agree&#039; ??? really???  Come on someone from Riot HELP ME OUT HERE. I understand that some people purposefully leave the game but those cases are usually obvious like people complaining and then threatening to afk in the chat, it&#039;s evident they did it on purpose.  I never left on purpose, I played 2 arams today and in both of them I unfortunately and frustratingly got disconnected for so long that the game was over by the time I was able to reconnect.  This leaver buster thing is not accurate or fair for people like myself who just disconnected. We can&#039;t control our internet disconnecting that is completely out of our control.  Please help.  Can we not get straight up banned for this???  \r\n\r\nWhat about cases where we had to leave in the middle of the game for good reason? What if we are a parent and our child just fell down the stairs or there was some other emergency? what then?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-25T10:48:39.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, LeaverBusters aren't bans. They are a lot like dodge timers, where you'll have a timer you have to wait through before you can get into queue that get longer the more you dc. You've only received a warning here, not an actual punishment.\n\nSecond, you are still affecting other players. What difference does it make to your team whether your net dced, or you were being irresponsible and playing a game with only 15 minutes of free time, or that you decided you didn't like losing and quit? They still have the burden of a disconnected player, whatever the reason is.\n\nYes, it is sometimes out of your control, but that's why you don't get punished the very first time you dc. That is why even now, you have only received a warning that continuing to DC continuously will result in LB punishments (more than likely because you had 2 in close succession). \n\nIf you aren't disconnecting often, you have nothing to worry about. If you're disconnecting every other game, then you need to either take steps (troubleshooting, calling your ISP, etc) or accept the consequences of ruining the experience of four to nine other players.\n\nEmergencies don't happen often enough for an account to be punished for it. Only if an account has a significant history of leaves would that ever be a concern.","replies":[{"poster":"Blue Blumaroo","date":"2018-04-25T11:24:35.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh okay thanks for the info","replies":[]}]}]}
