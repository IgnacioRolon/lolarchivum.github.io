What a sad state to play this game in. so vindictive.\n\n\nI&#039;ve had the privilege of playing on NA for decent part of last year and its a much better experience, a person can absolutely despise you. but will still be a teamplayer and try to win the game or gain an advantage in the match.\n\nOn OCE the mindset is very selfish and closed minded.\n\nFlame me or whatever for the post. but its how i see OCE.\ni wish it wasn&#039;t the case but it is.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackwhiteKuma","date":"2018-02-02T18:54:31.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And the rank in AU is a freaking joke.
