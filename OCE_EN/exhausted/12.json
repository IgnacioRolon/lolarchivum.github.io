It likely comes down to believably. It's entirely believable that someone names their club after the Egyptian goddess because they love the mythology, less so that someone called their club f a g because they really like cigarettes.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-25T05:58:59.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even going beyond the context of a club tag, it would be more likely for people to be using \"Isis\" (such as calling someone by their name, or referring to the goddess) than it would be for someone to be using the term \"f\\*g\" to refer to cigarettes out of context, such as during general chat use in a video game (as I understand it, it's rare for anyone to refer to cigarettes as \"f\\*gs\" out of context, even in real life).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-25T07:04:10.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean we aren't in the UK, so it's barely even accepted slang for cigarette for most of us on OCE.
