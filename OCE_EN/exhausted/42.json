Riot treats the league community like a bunch of snowflakes, \"removing toxicity\" which they came up with the word \"toxic\" as any CHAT behavior that shows frustration or discomfort. There is ABSOLUTELY no way to communicate outside of utilizing pings and muting your teamates. Any curse words in a chat log that is reported will result as a tally towards your ban. Any insults will be the same, and the report system bans grow onwards.\n\nShould Riot remove players who are toxic?\nIf they are truly toxic and always rude and mean to all their teamates and carry out a constant negative attitude. This means a constant toxicity of serious negativity. This should also be toxic enough to have to go through a report system only available through an extensive process such as reporting to a riot employee or moderator who can then inspect unique reports, stopping the report system from simply allowing players to just vent frustration through reporting all their teamates after a loss.\n\nWhy is Riot Games called Rito?\nRiot is called rito because players do not respect a company that does not respect them. The company refuses to communicate with players, balance the game in a healthy way, and update the system in progressive ways, let alone admitting any mistakes in their employed teams.\n\nTo improve League of Legends, what should Riot do?\n-Regain the respect of their player base. \n-Change toxicity to a more in depth report system, effectively removing trash talk reports from the system and implementing an extensive system where a process to report a player takes a bit more effort but is also quite simple. Anyone experiencing real discomfort wouldn't hesitate to report a player but would consider the effort of reporting a player and the possible repercussions on the player and would take more time before reporting someone and every report would actually be worthy of a human reviewed response.\n-Allow banter and trash talk. This means calling each other noob, bad, etc to an extent. Changing this would allow a less strict policy and players could vent their frustration and enjoyment in their triumphs while also allowing Riot to ban:harassment, Racial slurs, suicide and homicide jokes + threats  efficiently through human response.\n-Change the gameplay back to a healthier game. Defensive items should be cheap and easily accessible and defense piercing items should be a bit more expensive but much more effective. The old last wisper was MUCH MUCH better than the new last wisper. Bring back items that weren't popular. Atma's impaler, zephyr, etc. \n-Stop enforcing the meta ---> SERIOUSLY stop enforcing the meta. The highest mastery point singed taking smite as singed support invading and had a high winrate and was high elo was forced to stop or he would be banned. That is insane. Now the player is happily moping around in gold, unable to enjoy himself using a meta strategy he created because he's not a big figure.\n-Change the rank system and elo system to one in the same. Players hate having wins that give 6 lp and losses that take 35lp\nThis simply makes the game feel more toxic and makes players feel unrewarded for winning.\n-Give blue essence per win again. The old system of ip per win allowed players to play to earn champs, now the essence system is rng based and every level up you might just get 2-3 90 blue essence champions or 3 3k+ BE champs. \n-Punish inappropriate game play with game play punishment, and punish inappropriate chat with chat punishments. Nobody should ever be permabanned from playing a game they love and paying money towards the game they love because they trash talked some teamates. This is behavior that exists in all competitive games. Denying this cuts into company profits as the more bans given the less likely a player is to spend money on an account.\n-Talk to players that main champions and exhibit serious amounts of devotion towards a champion. They may give great insight into the balancing of a specific champion.\n-Talk to high elo players and low elo players and see if there is a way to balance a champion and buff them through the skill on the champion rather than generically buffing their kits and stats.","replies":[]},{"poster":"collects","date":"2018-04-14T13:52:26.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This actually started happening when the trinket system was introduced and riot moved their forums to the boards and pushed that aside in favor or reddit. Then a failed game designer who shall not be named took control of the long distance vision of the game and now we have the following problems. \n\nLack of a effective vision system caused by failed trinket system caused so many jungle balance changes and jungle/jungler nerfs when the cause of all these problems is vision. Those 2 wards are not enough to secure lane and red wards reward lane dominance which allows snowballing lanes to keep snowballing harder with vision protection and needless to say without red counter warding trinket the 4 plants early game alone is more than enough to completely strip any lane of all their vision but they instead of adjusting vision it's easier to rework the whole jungle... again and again and again. This will keep happening till they either make red wards stealthed or allow a better vision system to prevent jungle camping or at least require a time investment to clear vision.\n\nSnowballing: This has been the highlight of the season so far. I have watched many games where it only takes 1 kill for the enemy player to assume complete lane dominance by getting just 1 kill. It needs to stop. No one likes being 1 shot yet there are too many champs now where their identity is based around being able to all in with no poke and 100/0 with literally their skill set and 1 or 2 aa. This isn't fun to watch or be on the receiving end and once that happens it's going to keep happening all game. Now combined with towers hitting like nothing and the trinket system it's more rewarding to surrender at 15 than sit through the r**e train the enemy zed, fizz, alkali, talon, Kat or who ever else.\n\nI could keep going but typing on my mobile and even thinking how the game I loved even got to this point is pissing me off. It's going to take something magical to stop this decline now. Leagues used to be the undisputed king of twitch now it's just riding on it's merits. No longer innovative, just waiting for something better to dethrone it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-04-12T15:54:33.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear this same thread was posted two days ago.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2018-04-13T07:01:47.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry didn't realize there was another thread.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-13T02:10:18.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mean I'm not just going insane?
