I agree normals is generally for fun, and I barely ever play ranked and usually just play normals. However, sometimes the matchmaking is just a bit too spread out, since there are people who play pretty much just ranked. I think it should have some degree of influence.\nJust a degree, not a 1:1 influence sort of thing.\nAlthough I enjoy being pitted against people way above my skill level sometimes, I can see why it would be frustrating for people too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-20T09:13:47.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[](http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAcQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.euw.leagueoflegends.com%2Fboard%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D1885661&ei=cPrmVPW7HuHOmwWW_4KABA&bvm=bv.86475890,d.dGY&psig=AFQjCNF-KWUbtBGnOCzj05YvP9ohUyNxXA&ust=1424509926410490)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-20T03:29:58.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-20T03:08:29.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, even though you are versing people with much higher ranks, you probably still have a chance of beating them (otherwise you wouldn't be matched against them).\n\nI've been put against people who were challenger and my team still won :) It's likely they're versing you because they screw around in normals and only take ranked matches seriously (because there's no way I won a serious match up against people in diamond/challenger).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-19T23:55:16.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's normals.
