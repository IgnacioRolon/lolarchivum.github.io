It might seem that CARRY.GG has been quiet for a while, but we&#039;ve been hard at work on some new features over the past couple months. Check out the new summoner page with match history, runes, masteries, and champion performance. Click on a match in the history to see its detailed stats and scoreboard playback.\nWe&#039;ve got a lot more features we want to add in the coming months. What things would you guys like to see?\n\n--------------------------------------------\nI&#039;ve spoken with the team over it carry.gg, about posting this on our boards and they were all for it. also asked if we could compile a list of improvements or features we would like to see in the future.\n\n\nLeave your suggestions below and i&#039;ll compile them and send them over to the guys at carry.gg\n\n\nLive Match Screenshots\n\nhttp://puu.sh/iRdex/8068f92d9a.png\n\n\nProfile overview\n\nhttp://puu.sh/iRdg7/9a6448d11f.jpg\n\nhttp://puu.sh/iRdiT/b48ce7befc.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-08T07:55:19.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OH wow the match history is really nice!\n\nIt would be cool if there were indicators of kills/deaths on the timeline aswell so it was easy to jump to when I died.","replies":[]}]}
