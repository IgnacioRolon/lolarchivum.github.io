Especially TSM vs. TL. I am not a fan of either team really but they are at the top of the ladder for a reason so I thought it would be a good match to watch. I was thoroughly disappointed after seeing xSpecials failed tibbers engage. I understand that that kind of stuff happens to everybody but he is a verteran pro player and I expect more. But xSpecials failed engage was nothing compared to TSM's awful map movements. They were frequently moving in to take a turret and allowing themselves to get flanked by TL. This even happened when TL walked straight over one of their wards and TSM just let TL walk all over them. There were a few ocassions where TSM got falnked without wards and I have to give credit to TL for taking advantage of those ocassions but it really is TSM's responsibility to make sure those flanks are warded. Overall just a really disapppointing performance from both teams considering their calibre. Gravity seems to be the only team performing consistently at the moment and if NA wants to have a decent showing at worlds this year TSM and TL really need to step it up.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-17T05:49:24.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree, also that piglet steal on baron was completely avoidable, he had smite available he was just lazy. which i felt was the general theme for the day.\n\nNA is so passive, no much roaming or outplay for the first 15 min.\n\ni feel NA has become lazy and over obsessed with fame, in Korea they have to work really hard for it,\n\nalso the coaching styles is absurd, they talk back to their coaches, and consider them more friends rather then their coach. picks and bans are questionable and debated.\n\nMonte said recently if NA players talked to their coach like that in Korea, they would be dropped from the team not long after.\n\nJob security is too high in NA..","replies":[{"poster":"BunnyFuton","date":"2015-07-18T02:22:02.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is an interesting point about job security. I never really thought about it much but you are right. I am wondering if that is gonna change soon though. I mean after so many poor international performances and with all the Koreans/Europeans etc. coming in it might force them to perform. I do really think a lot of coaching staff in NA at the moment aren't doing much of anything though. The fact that there are teams in NA that don't know what to do in certain situations in game is not really anyone singular person's fault but either the players need to be upgraded or the coaches need to make sure these players know what to do in each situation before the game. In all honesty I think NA this year is just not going to be able to compete internationally, maybe Gravity can pull something off but they are still a pretty new team. Compare this to last year where C9 was able to take a game off Samsung Blue and at least stay competitive in most of the other games it really is a step in the wrong direction.\nLets hope they do better next year I guess :/","replies":[]}]}]}]}
