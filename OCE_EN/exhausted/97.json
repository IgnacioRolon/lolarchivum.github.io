Duo ADC's poke style has worked very well, plus the Reksai's nice team fight engaging (Msfish's Gragas is doing more of tank than engaging/disengaging, which is abit disappointing, with such a great team gold lead in the early game, he should play more aggresively rather than let Tris to engage/bait)","replies":[]},{"poster":"elmatto1","date":"2015-07-09T10:14:38.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No more 3 way tie hope {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-09T10:26:24.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha","replies":[]}]}]}
