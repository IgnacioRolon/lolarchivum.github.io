Despite your intentions, you are ruining the game for 9 other people. If its happening often enough to get a 20 minute queue restriction and you still haven't done anything about it, then it's your fault. Get a new computer, find out whats causing crashes, pick better times to play when family wont need the computer, whatever.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Robinson","date":"2015-08-21T16:54:19.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never quit a game ever. The only times I've ever abandoned matches were either because of net cuts and bugsplats. Of course I reconnect as soon as possible which usually is 5mins after dcing at most. Majority of my dc's have been mid-way through the game which I would say is much better than dcing at the start of a match, thus the team having the advantage the may have been built and 4v5ing for 5mins. It's really sad if this does go through after all the hard work I put into ranked to get diamond... I'm sure a a lot of players can relate to this after achieving the rank they aimed for only to get nothing, I've only dc'ed about 10 games out of my 350+ ranked games and they were weeks or even months apart from each other and unfortunately I received the 20min low priority queue. I was just really look forward to receiving the rewards after friends making fun of me since I'm the only one not diamond yet, I thought I'd show them I could do it... Literally wasted a year. This is something that shouldn't be enforced halfway through the season either, it would make more sense to input it at the start of a season to warn people about the consequences of these penalties and avoid them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OriginalReaper","date":"2015-08-21T09:00:07.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well f**k...
