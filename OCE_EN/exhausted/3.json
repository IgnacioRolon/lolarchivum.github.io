When you smurf you don't tell people, all it does is provoke people to troll and afk just so it annoys the person smurfing. If anyone tell's you they're smurfing or acts like a dickhead over all chat or normal chat, they're usually just little children who need to be spanked. On the off chance they are smurfing and are completely insecure about how big their dick is, realise that they're a sad bastard who spends too much of their time worrying about what other people think of them (especially on a game where no one knows who you are) and only say shit because if they did that IRL they would get knocked out by someone soon enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-05-16T09:14:08.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"going full BM or not doing anything at all, its still an awful experience.\n\ni'd get it if it was used to learn new champions and they sucked quite badly, i'd get that. but smurfs arent used like that at all.\n\nthe 3 top reasons for smurfs arent for self development or fun with friends (if it was you would play blind pick, customs or teambuilder)\n\n\n1. to boost your mate\n2. to relieve your stress (while transplanting it onto others)\n3. to troll and play whatever you like.\n\nits hard enough to climb if your legitimately at that elo\nthis needs to stop.\n\n**its cruel.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-05-19T09:36:18.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eh it's human nature to want to feel superior to other people, if someone has to smurf to get a feeling of superiority I feel bad for them, that being said it's technically legal and short of linking peoples real life identities to their online game accounts (which is stupid and wouldn't happen in a million years) there will always be smurfs in any online multiplayer games, it's just the way it is. So that leaves you with the options of either not playing LoL anymore or just dealing with it, these are the only options no ones word would ever stop smurfing nor would Riot ever do anything about smurfing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-05-16T16:11:13.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"80% of my elo is boosted shtlords and kids who lucked out in placements so instead of getting salty about losing games because of bronze level kids in diamond ill go ahead and drop 20 bombs in gold elo :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2015-05-16T16:35:47.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A Vayne got a Quadra, and a Penta in one game a few days ago in Norms.
