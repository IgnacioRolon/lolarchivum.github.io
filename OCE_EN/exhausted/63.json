If you take into consideration of team fights, one single hard cc with the proc of Tahm's passive is certain death. There is no counter play, there is no escape. Once it is applied the Tahm Kalista combo will guarantee a kill. This champion will definitely be banned in competitive play due to this extreme synergy. \nIt is however fun to play with in normals or ranked to troll people, having your tank jungler swallowed while Kalista ults you into the fight is an amazing strategy. Tahm can also Devour enemies, flash and regurgitate them into the tower. Overall good job on the design of Tahm, but as for seen in competitive plays? Perhaps not.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-11T02:15:30.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you take into consideration of team fights, one single hard cc with the proc of Tahm's passive is certain death.\n\nOk lets say this is a 5v5 Teamfight, and your using Tahm to eat someone to take to your team.\n\nWhy is Tahm able to get Q+2 auto's on you while still being alive?\n\nHis a strong champ, and this is great synergy, however it's not as amazing as your trying to make it sound.\n\nNo pro player would let 3 stacks on them as easily as it is in the video (Lulu polymorph would be used to stop it for sure, still not sure why it wasn't.)","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-07-11T08:01:10.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=LK1UrUU3,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-07-11T02:15:30.440+0000)\n>\n> Ok lets say this is a 5v5 Teamfight, and your using Tahm to eat someone to take to your team.\n> \n> Why is Tahm able to get Q+2 auto's on you while still being alive?\n> \n> His a strong champ, and this is great synergy, however it's not as amazing as your trying to make it sound.\n> \n> No pro player would let 3 stacks on them as easily as it is in the video (Lulu polymorph would be used to stop it for sure, still not sure why it wasn't.)\n\n3 stacks isn't that hard to execute, auto, q auto is an easy thing to do. I think you're underestimating his kit and his effectiveness from Bronze all the way to Worlds. There are an extreme amounts of different scenarios and champion picks but one you get 1-2 stacks yyou are nearly completely zoned away from the fight, or away for the reset.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T20:47:42.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strong yes, Broken No.\n\nSimple fact is you shouldn't be letting the three stacks on you when Kali is sitting that far back (where is Lulu's Polymorph in all of these instances?)\n\nAnd this is Kali blowing what is a really major cooldown for the one kill, punish her for this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-10T10:02:34.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so broken","replies":[]}]}
