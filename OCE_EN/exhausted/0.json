Especially if it isn't a server wide issue.\n\nCould Riot consider giving ranked matches the ability to pause (similar to Dota 2?)?\n\nHas there been any considerations on increasing the punishment for leaving a match? I really think Riot should look at how Dota 2 deals with these kinds of issues (5 minute return window.. loss waived for losing team if they lose a player.. harsher penalties ~~for parole violators, Stan~~ for leavers, pause option for disconnect issues, etc).\n\nI really feel like Riot's current approach to people who afk/leave in matches punishes that team more than it does the person who left.","replies":[{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-02-15T01:19:37.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THEY DO HAVE THIS ABILITY!... \n\nPeople are just un-sportsman like, and refuse to respond to the pause request.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yolo Babaduchi","date":"2015-02-12T07:53:14.511+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't understand why everyone is having a go at the guy who made this thread.
