It REALLY allows you to work on your champion, maybe not it's matchups but that's not up to a randomizer doing it for you, you should be able to tell by paper what hurts your champion and what your champion is good at, that enough tells you that Katarina is going to be able to dodge your triple shuriken burst very easily by shunpo-ing behind you.

Congratulations, you're playing your Champion well and should seek a more challenging opponent. You lost?
