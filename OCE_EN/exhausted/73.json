Due to that IM's snowball didn't start to roll in the early stage which delay all IM's players' gold and experience, hence lead to a mid game loss.\n\nBut I like IM's tactic (even I tipped AV's winning), it's more entertaining to watch a game with different strategy and different match ups, rather than the boring laneing match and wait for the opponent's mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-07T10:36:33.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely agree.\n\non a sidenote tho im really liking destiny's supporting.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
