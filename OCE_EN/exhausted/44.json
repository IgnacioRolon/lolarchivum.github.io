The team is working his ass to solve these tech issues. I'm going to explain why this had delayed.\n\nFirst of all, We are deeply sorry for the delay.\n\nSecond, I want to set some expectations on the timing. It is not happening this week, potentially not next week but we think / hope it is going to be question of weeks and not months.\n\nThird, I would like to give you some context.\nThere are couple components that need to be in place to deploy something like this: hardware and software. When we started working on this, we had to make sure we had the right hardware in place (tick) and the software was working (tick).\nWhat we did not check, was that we had the right version of the tool in order to be able to deploy this software...\n\nOCE was originally build with a system (excuse my lack of technical understanding, I'm trying to explain it the same way I understand it) which was different from the others in other existing regions. This was supposed to be the new best system which would allow deploy to be faster.\nAfter some time (and after couple of other regions were also deployed that way), we realized that while this new system was working faster, it was also more complicated and there were not many people out there able to use that new tool.\n\nSo we started working on a migration project to go back to the original one. We are half way through that process and this means that some team needs to deploy using the existing tool and some team have to use the new one.\n\nThis is the long explanation of the reasons why we have delayed this system in OCE.\nWhile I hope this helps understanding why we are delaying, ultimately the WHY doesn't really matter so we apologize for the delay.\n\nThanks\nMasterMirkinen","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-06-27T10:18:52.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for answering\n\nlets hope its sooner rather then later.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-07-02T22:19:57.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is now live :)\n\nthank you for your patience.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-27T08:35:51.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my question relates to this.\n\n>After some time (and after couple of other regions were also deployed that way), we realized that while this new system was working faster, it was also more complicated and there were not many people out there able to use that new tool.\n\nHow is it every other region is deployed and we aren't?\n\nYou've just said that at least some other regions were using the more advanced tool, if that's the case how is it that only OCE is being delayed by week's to months behind everywhere else?\n\nLike i'm trying not to be over critical about this, but this seems like a bit of a poor excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-06-28T05:41:23.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other regions were recently moved back to the other system.\nWe are the last one needing this change.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-26T20:35:44.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there are some tech issues.
