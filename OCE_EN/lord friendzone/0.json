The system has never worked that way so I don't get why you would suddenly think it would be different. This is always an issue in online gaming where there is a competitive mode.\n\nIf they gave compensation to the players affected (because victim is a strong word), people would find ways to abuse the system to get loss prevented or whatever system they have in place to compensate for an afker. As mentioned elsewhere, you have a lower chance of getting a troll or afker on your team because there are only 4 people on your team who could potentially be those players (assuming you are not going to as well) and 5 on the other team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Friendzone","date":"2014-12-14T04:08:55.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it different I think it should be.
