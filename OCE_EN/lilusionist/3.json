Earlier I had played a game as Riven and the entire game I was battling with the enemy Darius and Udyr (verbally). After the game, I decided to let it go and not report them. They go by the names &#039;Toyo Suken&#039; (Darius) and &#039;3D2Y&#039; (Udyr). They reported me and got me chat restricted, and I think it&#039;s only fair if they also get a punishment, as they were as toxic as me. They mentioned things like &quot;ur mum&quot; which I retaliated to with the same toxicity. Is there some way of finding a chat log and getting them reported? Thanks for your help.{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-10-01T09:49:46.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo Illusionist,\n\nMight I suggest not engaging in verbal arguments entirely. The first question that comes to mind with this thread is were you the one who started the argument. Regardless of whether you reported them or they reported you, if you were the initiator the chances of you receiving the ban over them is higher. That said, if what you're saying is true they should be deserving of a chat restriction and chances are they got one. But I strongly suggest never engaging in verbal arguments. Whether you started it or not don't do it. If you start it that's bad right from the start. If they start it simply don't respond. Don't give them any opportunity to attack and/or distract you further. Focus on your own game play and ignore anyone that negatively impacts your game.\n\nRegards,\nAatrox","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-10-01T13:21:33.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I was chat restricted from typing \"glhf\" and \"I love Akali jungle\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"lIlusionist","date":"2015-10-01T10:10:22.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Aatrox, I'll remember that in the future :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-01T10:07:23.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Claims \"unfair punishment\", doesn't report people when they deserve it and has no way of knowing if other people receive punishment.\n\nWhere's the logic?","replies":[]}]}
