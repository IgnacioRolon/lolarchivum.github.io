Firstly, my support, a Vel&#039;Koz, who I will not be naming and a top lane Vladamir, who I will also not be naming. the game started of well, everyone wishing each other good luck and making jokes about how broken Ekko is. After 1 minute of laning my support walks into the enemy Thresh and Graves spamming his laugh giving the Graves first blood. He then said in chat &quot;stfu ashe i told you to stop laughing&quot;. As you know the 1 minute and 30 seconds before the laning phase starts is always a party for you and your Jungler with spamming dance, taunt and laugh. After this little mishap with Vel&#039;Koz I apoligised to him and stopped spamming my laugh. When he got back to lane he would take 3 creeps off every wave, leading to my essential early game items very delayed. We then got into a fight with the enemy botlane and as the Thresh landed a hook on me, he started to recall and as I died he said &quot;sorry I lagged&quot;. Coincidence? I think not. After a while the Vladimir who was _losing his lane_ started saying things like &quot;sigh, I get trolls everygame, **** this ashe and vel&quot; and &quot;your an incompetent piece of **** ashe&quot;. Vel&#039;Koz and Vladimir both ganged up on me because I wasn&#039;t doing very well, which was stupid considering the fact that the Vel&#039;Koz had caused me to become behind. I Vel&#039;Koz but from Vladimir&#039;s chat I could see that they were fighting and being quite immature. &quot;u suck vel go get a life kid get a gf&quot;. I un-muted Vel&#039;Koz who came up with a retort that I will not say. After the terrible loss the Vel&#039;Koz said &quot;cya nerds xD&quot; and left the chat and the Vladimir reported me which which is just totally obnoxious. I want Riot to create a better banning system rather than anyone being able to make random stuff about other people and then ban them.

Games that have far smaller player bases and draw in far less money manage to have active admins and moderators, and its quite obvious that the current system of reporting and automated bans is totally ineffective. Its also noteworthy that we all agree to 'the summoners code', an electronic contract. contracts are two way binding legally binding documents, if were bound to follow the code, riot should be bound to enforce it properly. \n\nA game as widely loved as this would have no shortage of volunteers that would be willing to pitch in and act as a tribunal, but it seems like it impacts 10 cents bottom line too much to manage this. It feels like it wont be until the game is so toxic that it starts to go into decline that anything will actually happen, which is quite sad because its such a good game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-29T12:34:14.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL i found who that Vlad and Velkoz are. Anyway if you look at the item build of Velkoz he/she actually doesn't have a sightstone in his inventory which means he/she is most probably not a support main and was forced into playing that role which could actually be the reason why he/she is feeding (maybe even for fun).That Velkoz support's CS is just way too high for what a support should ever have (106 CS wtf) and the amount of damage items instead of support items that Velkoz has is just ridiculous. There is no excuse for a support to not have a sightstone especially after laning phase. Also that Vladimir should counter Shen and should therefore do well against shen unless he is camped by the enemy jungler or he is just unskilled. I guess you should just mute both of them and try to do your best. Also report them so that riot knows who they are.  Judging from the bad support i don't think you did that badly (KDA wise). From the match it is pretty obvious that Velkoz and Vlad are actually feeding (again im judging from their KDA which is negative). I guess you are just unlucky here. Your best bet to avoid a bad support imo is to duo queue with someone of around the same rank as you are, someone who knows how to properly play the support role.  Don't ask me to be your duo queue partner though because im not lvl 30 yet although i am a support main.  Good luck with your future games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Serfige","date":"2015-05-29T11:00:54.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Bronze-gold\" \n\nLiterally 90% of ranked players are in that category m8","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-29T11:44:42.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Serfige,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Er24Yp0n,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-29T11:00:54.329+0000)\n>\n> \"Bronze-gold\" \n> \n> Literally 90% of ranked players are in that category m8\n\nPremades, they cause the \"inbetweeners\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Vilemaw Bot","date":"2015-05-29T09:52:48.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been told there is a new tribunal system coming out... but yes I do agree that our community is toxic at some times. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-05-29T14:32:13.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"is this your first experience of something like this happening if not what do you hope to accomplish from complaining on the forum boards besides looking at responses which agree with you for some sort of feel good pat me on the back im not the only one type of feeling you are chasing?","replies":[]}]}
