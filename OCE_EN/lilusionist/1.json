Your'e probably gonna think, \" This guy is sh*t as, there are no good lower Elo Lee Sin's\", but I consider myself as a very good Lee Sin player who knows all the tricks. I've dominated games, sometimes going up to 15/0 while still having good farm and generally just being able to split, and work appropriately In team fights. Unfortunately ( Yes this sounds Cliche ) Nearly every game I will get a lane that will feed so hard that the enemy Team will just snowball out of control.
