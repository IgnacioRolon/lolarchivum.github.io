Do I start by doing commentary on pro games or local uni games? Not to blow my own horn but i&#039;ve been told I have an awesome voice that I should use on radio but this I believe would be way more awesome!\r\n\r\nWould love to know your thoughts on this and will be doing doing more research on this by myself.\r\n\r\nCheers guys!","replies":[{"poster":"REF5ESH","date":"2016-03-05T04:41:51.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reach out to smaller tournaments and events (uni games are a great start) and offer to do casting for them. Practice your familiarity with switching between play-by-play and analysis of games in the meantime, and ensure that your game knowledge is at a good level. Playing and casting are very different since you're seeing everything all the time, so recording yourself casting over a VoD is a great way to practice and improve.\n\nGood luck with it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-02T08:49:38.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe uni games.\n\nGood luck!","replies":[]}]}
