They've hit his ability to trade which means you might have to get used to the laning phase and late game split push 1v1s not being as strong as they used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"Derikay","date":"2016-09-12T14:58:56.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just purchased him from the store, so i never played him before the nerfs, so i dont know how strong he was before the nerfs but i just playeed him in a few games and he is fun :D","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-13T00:32:36.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always good to learn a champ when they're less strong, then when they get buffed it feels amazing :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-12T13:51:19.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not god tier anymore but definitely still viable","replies":[{"poster":"Derikay","date":"2016-09-12T14:13:55.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :)","replies":[]}]}]}
