At last, we got 3 adc in team and lost the game. These guys blamed me for ruining the game. Since they are friends, as allies, I can't and don't want to argue with them but it seems like they think they have the right for insta-locking and could do whatever they want due to they have more acquaintances in that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-12-01T08:49:16.243+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just report and move on.

Hmm?\n\nIt can't be that you are thinking draft pick order is based on MMR. It hasn't been based on MMR all year, Riot said something along the lines of \"Last pick people keep getting abused for having lower MMR than the rest of the team\" and \"We want to give all people equal chance at being first pick and all picks equal opportunity\".\nSo what did they do? They made draft pick order (including ranked) RANDOM.\n\n\nSo please tell me the logic behind it being your own fault if someone picks before you in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-01T21:41:55.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is possibly the dumbest argument I've seen on this topic.\n\nYes, they introduced random draft order because you automatically knew who was likely to be the \"weakest link\" on your team even if that wasn't necessarily true when it was based on hidden MMR. Oh, and by the way, if you're last pick (We're talking ranked, OP, if this was a normal, it may be a different story) and you call ADC and lock it in after TWO have already been picked, telling you they're both going bot, that is your fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-01T13:54:49.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if there are 2 ADCs locked in....whose fault is it if you lock in a 3rd ADC and go bot lane?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AgonyQ","date":"2014-12-01T17:07:59.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You're playing a team game with 4 other randoms as team members, get used to having anti-social people that sit in their mothers basement doing nothing with their lives but playing this game, most of which are dropouts from school and are heavily learning impaired, so after 5000 games they still don't know how to play at a basic level.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-02T01:43:45.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So people like you?","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2014-12-02T02:28:24.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooh, please apply cold water to burnt area","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-01T22:52:29.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a normal game...
