(Need some opinions and help)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I randomly suffered from ping spike, just for some of the games. For the first few minutes of the game the ping was normal, like 20-30, and then it went up to 200-700. Even if you are disconnected, the ping is capped at 500, but how it could be 700? (sometimes it went up to 1000) I found the only way to solve this is, disconnected and reconnected, but it only works for the first few minutes you rejoined the game and then it lags up to 700 ping once again. Also, I noticed that when it lags, the ping is dynamic, between 200 -700. But for the first few minutes of the game, it was stable at around 25-30. Just wonder if anyone have the same issue? And what is the possible solution?","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-07-05T08:17:10.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wipe your computer clean and reinstall, sanitize your computer like a hospital, download \"no script\" plugin on firefox \n\nMost likely trojans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raptorzzz","date":"2015-07-01T23:55:20.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happend to me dont know what made me DC..","replies":[{"poster":"Fuerdai","date":"2015-07-02T00:06:08.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt if there is certain kind programme that  can search and target player's IP and jam the IP address to cause lag.","replies":[]}]}]}
