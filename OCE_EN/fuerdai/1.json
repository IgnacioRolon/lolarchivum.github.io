These players are normally &quot;troll&quot; in game and has a blank matches history. When I tried to communicate with them in game, they don&#039;t talk at all. Some times there are even up to 3 pre-made players with blank matches history. The feature of these players are: 1. Most of them only play normal games. 2. Act as &quot;troll&quot; or &quot;dumb&quot; players in game. 3. They rarely talk in game. 4. Blank matches history. 5. All level 30 with some runes.\r\nEvery time I met these players in normal games. It make me doubt if these accounts come from somewhere like &quot;gray market&quot; or if they were &quot;hacked accounts&quot; that from &quot;account laundering&quot; (with similar concept of money laundering).","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-19T00:43:51.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've only played one game where i was certain there was a bit.
