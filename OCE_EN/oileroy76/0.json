I was waiting for my game to load, taking longer then usual, I minimized the loading window to find a dialogue box saying that this game no longer exists, feel free to play another game. I go to create a new game then I get a message saying Ive been put in low queue for 5 matches! wtf why?? This is the 3rd time this week! its crap! Does this happen to anyone else. I think Riot needs to be more sensitive when it comes to situations like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-29T04:37:23.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me try to put this in perspective. Your issues may be out of your hands, but they are also out of the hands of the 9 other players that were matched with you. Are you saying that they should be punished, and you should not be, for an issue on your end?\n\nLow Priority Queue exists as a disincentive to afks and leavers yes, but also to encourage players with technical issues to realise that their problems are negatively affecting other players, and that they will have to either make their best effort to not negatively affect those players or failing that accept that they are going to be given a lower priority for games given their history of badly affecting them.\n\nPast that, if you give the details of your internet issues, the Wrenchmen here on boards may be able to help you resolve them, but I will start with the most common solution and say that if you are playing on Wireless, don't. Find an ethernet cable.","replies":[]}]}
