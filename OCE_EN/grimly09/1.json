I am sometimes successful with getting into the login screen but 90% of the time it just doesn&#039;t come up after I click the League icon on my desktop. I am playing on a **mac** and the only way so far I have found to fix it is to **restart** my computer, this process takes way to long so usually I have to wait 10 minutes before getting it to work. \r\n\r\nI am looking for a **quick fix** for this bug, if it is happening to anyone else using a mac or even windows please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"U2SB","date":"2016-11-14T21:07:10.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea, same right here and iam using window","replies":[]},{"poster":"GGJellybean","date":"2016-11-18T02:27:50.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine just took 14 minutes to open!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Grimly09","date":"2016-11-17T08:23:06.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, this still happens all the time and I would really like it to be fixed.","replies":[]}]}
