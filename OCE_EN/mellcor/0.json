She's definitely longer ranged and safer than Graves or Vayne, so safety supports like Soraka and Janna aren't as useful as aggressive supports like Annie, Leona or Xerath, who turn the lane into either a poke-flash-ignite-fest, engage-and-poke-fest, or poke-and-poke-and-die-fest, respectively.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-07-20T11:04:29.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her laning phase is the safest in League, she can poke better than anyone else assuming you use her passive correctly, she has an escape + traps, an execute that can work wonders when used during the laning phase. She beats most ADC's early game and midlane, she needs to stay ahead to do well and if the game goes on for to long she falls off.\n\nSo she's like every ADC, has pros and cons.","replies":[]}]}
