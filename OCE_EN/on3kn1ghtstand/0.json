Considering its a team game im pretty much sort of do I really want to play because I enjoy the game, and I just cant pull the chat away as I want to make friends, sure muting them works, then you see them in the end game screen but also the consistent pings is just as bad.\r\n\r\nAnyways, long story short im mainly asking if anyone knows any alternatives to getting new friends in league of legends.","replies":[]}
