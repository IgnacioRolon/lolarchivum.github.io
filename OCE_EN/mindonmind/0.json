If you hate being matched with people clearly not in your elo range, don't play Flex Queue.\n\nAs with the case of Autofill. You need to be competent in at least 2-3 roles in Ranked anyway, might as well make Support one of them. Not mention, as Tele had brought up, without Autofill the queue times were just absolutely insane, and so it has to be there.\n\nAlso as Tele said, Autofill isn't the problem. Because it just shoves people into the role that has the significantly lesser amount of players queuing for in order to improve queue times, which right now it just so happens to be Support. If today everyone has made the decision to not queue for mid, then you'll see people start getting autofill'ed into mid lane. The problem is Support itself.\n\nAs for my opinion on Support role. I feel that as soon as Riot stop shoving Support into bot lane and intentionally keeping them there, there WILL be more Support players around for sure. They just need to stop forcing Support into a duo lane AND at bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomphlosion","date":"2017-01-31T05:02:22.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As per OPs title if you typically play in the early morning you are forced into flex queue, I know from experience this can be quite frustrating, I've played against diamonds and plats in 5am flex queue games, often it feels like the outcome is determined before it starts.

Riot can change things for all they like, but the meta will adapt with it. If they make supports gain more xp by introducing new items, other lanes will use it also. If they make the support \"position\" in champion select gain more xp, smart teams will do a role swap so that their carries gain it. You can't fix \"support\". Support is a role determined by the meta, not set in stone. If they change the game on summoner's rift to have 3 players, for example, you wouldn't have a support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-01-31T02:05:16.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might provide some more insight into very early thinking about supports\n\nhttp://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/155454221703/so-is-there-a-game-plan-for-the-support-problem\n\n> **“So is there a game plan for the support problem yet?

At a high level, there are three broad areas we are exploring:\n> 1) More agency for Support players. This is a bucket of a few different problems. The Support position tends to earn less XP and less gold than other positions. Support players can have a lot of down time without interesting things to do. Statistically, Support players have less of an impact on the outcome of the game than other lanes (especially Jungler and ADC).\n\n> 2) More recognition for Support players. The game does a terrible job of letting you know if that Support you had was really MVP. We celebrate things like KDA, but not at how great your Support was at blocking or engaging (and no, I don’t think number of wards placed is the stat we’re going for).\n\n> 3) More diverse ways to play Support. This gets into non-traditional champions in the Support role and also includes experiments like making traditional support champions less expensive so players can try out more of them to find one they like.\n\n> 1/5/2017","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2017-02-03T05:52:15.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean back when I played Heroes of Newerth I loved playing support because even though it was much the same, when something amazing happened like I body blocked a killshot, or disabled a kill shot or set up an amazing play there were actual announcements for that. \n\nIf someone came in with 100% health and tried to 1 shot my squishy carry and I disabled them then we killed them.

Even if I can feel **powerful** playing thresh because the enemy team knows if I hook them they're dead, it still feels dull having to rely on my team so much, I like every other role because I can **carry**, I have that opportunity by myself. Unless I'm playing with 4 other friends I gotta try and solo carry every game and even when I'm supporting the best to my abilities its just not possible in that role. I have seen some insanely good supports, I was playing a game as Darius and I was super fed, there was a level 7 nami on the enemy team that would bravely run straight at me and constantly harass me spamming her bubble and Ebb and flow on me but unfortunately none of her team would follow up on what she was doing and I would just turn on her and get a free kill. She was doing everything she could do as a support on an insane level, she had both objectives warded 24/7 and we had to keep sweeping dragon every single time, she landed perfects ults that would set our entire team up to be ambushed. But unfortunately the rest of her team was an awkward mess that couldn't initiate properly and they ended up losing because of it. Probably the only time I had ever felt sorry and wanted a support to win.

When you have a map with 3 lanes and 5 players and a certain strategy to have a late game scaling squishy adc, you will always have a support. It's just optimal meta. There will be no rework unless they remove adcs.\n\nThe whole situation of support, autofill, flex queue etc can be solved very simply by deleting flex queue in regions where there are bugger all players and just having soloqueue like it used to be. There were no issues with queue times in season 5. Back then all players also knew that they had to know every role to play ranked.
