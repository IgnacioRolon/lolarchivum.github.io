With the addition of Iron tier the base rank for a new account will be a bit lower, and they will be matched faster with people closer to their skill. Position ranks will also help since autofill won't make already typically polarised games even more one sided.","replies":[{"poster":"NaTionzOG","date":"2018-11-26T13:55:32.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"except it wont, adding new ranks only spreads the players. I will still being seeing fresh level 30's in my gold games.

How does the name \"solo queue\" help your argument, if anything it supports my argument. solo queue limits your chances of winning with low communication and 9/10 you have to rely on yourself to win the game, having someone with a terrible understanding of the game doesnt help your chances at winning.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-11-24T23:34:06.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"A better solution would be to have new accounts score 250 wins in normals before being allowed to play ranked.

The number is not so important, but the experience of closing games, and playing to win is the point im making here. Monkeys entering ranked should just be placed in Iron 4 and if they are good enough they will climb. Punishing established players in ranked by allowing new accounts with no experience into higher mmr brackets in a small population server is just not acceptable. Especially when you see that a lot of these accounts are really just banned bronzers that bought one of those bot accounts with ids like \"#@$!firstname\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
