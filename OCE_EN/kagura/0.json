But all your guys probs think nahh those champs are awesome but this is my opinion so calm down. Riot please go back to making champs like Rengar, Kha'Zix and Lucian yeah thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Areaze","date":"2015-01-26T02:44:16.400+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"not bronze, paper","replies":[]},{"poster":"BackFire","date":"2015-01-26T02:37:55.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Confessions of a bronze player","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-28T02:00:28.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny because really only Rek'Sai is top tier right now and all you complained about was his ult, which is arguably less useful than a TF or panth ult as it requires a tunnel and does no damage.\n\nJust because YOU get wrecked by them doesn't makes them 'r e t a r d e d'","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-26T06:51:04.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rango...zix....lucian....\n\nyup, troll thread. if only you also said THRESH! lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Kagura","date":"2015-01-26T09:51:43.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know I actually coulda said Thresh, Why didnt i think of him :(","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-26T04:23:19.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kalista gets destroyed by mages, azir is weak early, gnar is kinda stupid I agree.
