Riot has equipped us with a mute button so that we dont have to listen to their hateful filth.

So it's a part of life and culture at the moment.\n\nRiot do have a strict system that I have seen work like it did for me. I raged at a person and received a 2 week ban which has calmed me down alot cause I know the system is there and works. \n\nIf you ever get up set with a game in general is best to takea break and do something else fora while then play again when you are relaxed. You will play better. \n\nGood gaming guys. \n\nHavok","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-10T02:53:13.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Harden the fuck up, way too many LOL players get upset at the merest slight before screaming they are going to report you and begging for more reports in /all.\n\n\n Riot has promoted the same kind of whiney community that feminism is creating in college campuses.\n\n Need a safe space?

The best way for Riot to combat this is through the report system. But even then it would have very little effect. The only way to reduce the amount of verbal abuse in the League community would be for the community itself to reduce their need and compulsion to resort to verbal abuse.\n\nOne thing I would suggest doing is to play with a party. This way you at least have someone you know and can talk to and basically ignore whatever negative comments come your way.","replies":[]}]}
