But no matter how it seems, he would not win that.","replies":[{"poster":"charming rebel ","date":"2019-03-23T04:08:54.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like you give jhin the short end of the stick  whisper (he's gun) is a Smith and Wesson Magnum on steroids and i mean major steroids and when i look at vi she doesn't seem to be well protected and jhin is smarter then both of vi and caitlyn that's the thing people forgot and the idea of vi being strong enough to snap him yes that is true she could but have a gorilla charge a man with a  Smith and Wesson Magnum on steroids and strength is not longer a valuable ally to the gorilla and brains is not a good ally when the enemy is smarter then you","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-23T10:48:52.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'd just like to point out that lore wise, Vi is just a strong lady with a pair of mining gloves, they don't do alot to protect her from the type of shenanigans Jihn gets upto, and if this is outside the regular cultural sphere of 'good always wins' because good is good, I feel Jihn very much has the advantage. Jihn and Cait are both snipers, but Jihn likes to setup camp and plan intricately, which I feel is probably the better choice in a battle of snipers. \n\nJihn isn't more powerful, in a straight fight I reckon he'd lose to Caitlnn 1v1, but I feel that the fact that he'd setup camp and wait for the goodie-two-shoes to come to him puts him at an advantage in this fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
