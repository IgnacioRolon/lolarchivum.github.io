Also the meta has adjusted to be more favourable to picks like rakan recently, with more wide scope teamfight comps, which has probably outweighed the effect of this small interaction change.","replies":[{"poster":"charming rebel ","date":"2019-05-20T10:08:12.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm fueling my low self esteem with a small dose of confidence plz let me have this","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-20T12:39:21.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll give you this life advice.
