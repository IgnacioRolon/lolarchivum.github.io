But in saying that, because he is more versatile, he can accomplish more, in more situations than Caitlin, so therefore that would make him easier to play.\n\n**So ultimately, I think Jhin is easier to play, but also takes more skill.** \nIf that makes sense. (theres a very fine distinction between the two.)\n\nCaitlin requires less mechanical effort. However because she isn't as situationally adaptive as Jhin, it is harder for her to excel in some situations, making her a little harder in that respect.\n\nI.e. in a teamfight, she has to think about less than Jhin right?  Her play style in fights boils down to; stick traps down then get to max range and shoot shit.\n\nWhere as Jhin has to pay closer attention to his auto attacks, in order to A): Not be caught reloading at the wrong time, and B): Hit the right targets with the right auto attack.  When caitlin gets a big range indicator pop up when someone steps in a trap, he gets nothing and has to constantly be aware of who is around the trap.  His range is shorter, meaning he has to constantly weave in and out of the line between battle and safety.\n\nSo while it takes more skill to do that, he also excels in so many more situations that Caitlin.\nHe can chase like a mad-man, and also kite better than most other ADCs.  Where Caitlin doesn't particularly excel at either.\nFrom extremely long range _(like, not in the fight anymore kind of range)_, Caitlin has 1 single target ability. Where Jhin can still affect the fight with 4 seperate ult shots each with a mega slow, as well as a potential snare.  Not to mention he can dance with danger more, because his free speed boost gives him more freedom when it comes to escaping death. Where Caitlin gets 1 dash/slow, that costs resources and has a cooldown.\n\nHe is just more useful in a wider variety of situations.  So while he requires more mechanical skill than Caitlin, this boon makes him easier to play in the wider scope of things (its like training wheels.  It takes more skill to use him, but theres also a lot to catch you if you fail).\n\nSo what you're essentially asking is: \n**Whats more difficult to ride; a Tricycle, or a Bicycle with training wheels.**","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-20T07:11:15.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on how fast you're going. Riding a tricycle at a higher speed is easier than a Bicycle with training wheels.\n\nBut I'll also point out that Caitlynn has to attack move and kite whereas Jihn has to auto and run. Caitlynn's traps do give an indicator, but animation cancelling with them or her net can be difficult to do whilst kiting back or forward, and her animation cancels and resets are just as important to her dps as they are to a Riven. \n\nAlso I see alot of low elo adcs who turn useless in teamfights because they can't kite worth a damn, and either stand still and 'turret' or they can't attack move and only get out half an auto per second, making them useless.\n\nJihn doesn't have to worry about kiting and attack moving like other adcs, his attack animations are fast and his atkspeed just makes him hit harder, not have to attack move more often, and so he just has to auto and move, taking away one of the near universal requirements and very skill expressive features of attack speed carries, the orb walk. However he is also short range, the 4shots passive is awkward to get used to, his q bounces can be an art, his w requires good map awareness, and his ult is obviously alot harder to use since it requires better positioning and is a skillshot, not a point and click lockon.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-03-20T08:25:48.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We'll like I said, theres not really a huge skill gap between them, they both have things that make them easier and harder than each other.\nI'll confess to not being an expert on ADC's though.

A highpoint in her skill curve is managing trap animation cancels and auto resets, and managing her headshot passive for burst. \n\nCaitlynn's skill expression is very based on exploiting very basic mechanics and being very good at micromanaging attack moving and animation cancels smoothly to pump out mad dps at a long range. Caitlynn can also be put at alot of risk if she's bad at positioning, and if she's bad at attack moving, kiting and trap cancels, her damage can be subpar.\n\nOn the other hand, alot of my friends find Jihn easier since his main focus is lining up q bounces and his high burst on auto making trading more forgiving, and his movespeed passive makes it much easier to avoid or recover positioning mistakes. Jihn is very ability based and doesn't attack move, and whilst his 4shot passive can be awkward at first, alot of people find his large burst per auto does simplify trading and target focus and overall make his auto based mechanics alot simpler. Jihn can also be at alot of risk if he's bad at landing abilities, and his shorter range does mean that being able to use his higher movespeed to dodge is alot more important.\n\nOverall, I'd say Caitlynn requires higher skill with the basics of the adc role, but Jihn requires higher skill with his specific mechanics; that is to say that neither of them can clearly be said to be more skill intensive than the other, and this is just about low elo players trying to stroke their egos by convincing themselves that they're better than other players in their elo because they main 'difficult or skillful' champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-21T05:17:34.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"None, but Caitlyn is harder to master due to trap placement.","replies":[]}]}
