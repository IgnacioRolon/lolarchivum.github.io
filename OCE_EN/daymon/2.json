it isnt linear, the more there is the more effective it is, each extra bit of true dmg is worth more then the bit before it, because u hit thresholds to blow through enemies likewise of defences which creates critical turning points, not gradular scaling that is soft in(gage) soft out(disengage)) this effect exists with other forms of penetration and damage output, hitting thresholds, but its most true for true damage because of the infinite scaling of its 'penetration' nature in 100% ignoring armor (ignoring -ve armor scenarios)\n\ntheory crafted to max attack speed at lvl 18\n\ncull\nberserkers grieves\nrunaans\nie\npd\nga\nrageblade\n\nthis puts u at 93.14% of max atk speed gainable via items runes and levels at end game and generates highest true damage output. max ur silver bolts first after taking a point in condemn and tumble respectively to this end.\n\nrunaans is there to farm and then still scale at 6 items it cant be ignored. yes true damage only procs on one target but it doesnt proc on creeps anyway and thats its main use. and the true damage output on conqueror is on all damage sources even vaynes p*ss non bolt spray will eventually be proccing true dmg off conq anyway. as well as hedging the fact the main targets true dmg proc cant be converted into extra true dmg. so ur cannibalising one form but more then making up for it in another. it also funnels cull farming. yes funnelled true damage doesnt have 100% purity, boo hoo. realpolitik maximised solutions are still exactly that, maximised, tangibly. and theres zero item substitutes for vayne that arent suboptimal on the basis of her kit being true damage sourced adc on atk speed as her gimmick. shes all out of other options.\n\nrageblade goes last to get u to atk speed cap, as well as give ur true dmg and its now (cause u lvl bolts first for max true dmg output graphs) massively scaling ad on her other abilities coming up, and it all gets a nice conversion over (albeit dampened due to conqueror mechanics) to true dmg from all dmg sources including the late flat ap onhit u build that then gets converted into the dissolve of rageblade instantly at the now new capped % rates as well as getting insta conversion into true damage at -because of the 6th item timing- max atk speed.\n\nga at 5 when u need it\n\nrush berserkers for the tier 2 movespeed asap this will occur within one standard deviation of variance, anything beyond that high or low skip boots get zeal first then runaans then farm back into the game linearly as the build order path suggests(states)\n\nie immediately scales ur innitial 3 item rush setup and starts p*ssing mass damage which all gets converted over as explained to true dmg with vaynes bolt interaction procing on main target but not sequential, however conq true dmg does, so ur hedging it both ways optimally and perfectly\n\npd scales this as well as segwaying into the defensive shield set of completed ga timings for both the items at 4\nthis is the most hyper carried adc buildpath in the game to date. \n\nif ur in a true 1v9+ aside from the runaans rush hack the only other thing u can do is from lobby and thats ignite teleport, and just lane rotate with fullmute on while u farm cull and runaans up into a game (if its on) - best bet. this is a last ditch effort case scenario. probabilistically you will never need to do this unless ur smurfing out of iron4 or something and would rather the teleport macro over the micro flash, depending on where ur meta (true skill vs lobby skill placement) is\n\npost ur non setup vayne true dmg highscores postgame screencaps yo\n\n-get a bf early if u want to trade in lane and get the threshold gold\n-get boots early at least\n-get a stopwatch early if u need it depending on their lineups\nbut generlaly ull finish builds as listed, going from bf to ie is almost the same as bf to runaans, of which the latter is superior unless ur ending the game at 2 items(as good as never ie less then half a basis point in relative npv occurance)\n\nscaling hp is to give u a bit of buffer in true damage exchange and funnels vs multi dmg lane outputs when ur going all in dmg urself with ur other runes\ncoup de grace likewise stacks rotationally and hedges most adaptively against all possibly weighted likelyhood outcome occurances of that which you will be facing\nlikewise triumph for turnover and synergy to scaling hp(to true dmg - core) to cull/runaans gold funneling.\n\nresources used: fandom\n\nin terms of gameplay just navigate the mid to early game no matter what just dont bleed, just hardline rush runaans and go farm a safe lane, whoever is there will understand if bots unusable. after that try not to int the team fights. if it goes 7+++ items rotate ga for zonyas cooldowns and stack wraiths pots for team fights, iron for tenacity, sorcery for split push. buy ga. when ga is on cooldown. buy zonyas. vice versa repeat ad infinitum. also sell ur boots for an attack speed item if you want but ull be missing ur mobility so make it a trinity or something,.\n\n-skirmish and scout along the fringes\n-solo something out when safe and go fucking ham\n-piss bolt true damage blood for life all game\n-keeping ignite in ur kits more important then flash, if u cant macro, who cares about ur micro. \n-run ignite cleanse if they are running targetted comps\n-keep the dps up!! which means not dieing.\n-know ordering and approaches on fight\n-sorcery elixer on a splitpush is f^cked","replies":[]}
