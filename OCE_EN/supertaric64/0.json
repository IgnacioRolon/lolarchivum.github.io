The chat logs provided certainly seem to indicate it was just a case of \"confirming what someone else said\", things is, though, the system has a lot of trouble picking up on that, and so you likely received the ban due to the system not properly understanding the context.\n\nIt's happened to people before, and, in all honesty, Support doesn't really seem to be useful in situations like this. It's certainly worth a shot, you might actually get a good agent who'll help, but I'm willing to bet they'll basically tell you they can't (or *won't*) do anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-04-11T01:23:48.079+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is worth a shot, as in cases like this Support *should* unban assuming there are no other recent cases where they've actually been abusive or unsportsmanlike.

The fact bans are handed out for squabble level banter and rage chat is a disgusting system that needs a reform.\nMuting exists for a reason, if people don't like someone's attitude, they can mute them.\nBut instead angry people get banned/suspended and trolls/inters/griefers get off without a hitch.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-04-10T23:07:39.005+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-04-11T02:45:47.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To avoid robotic bans like this in future, don't quote idiots.
