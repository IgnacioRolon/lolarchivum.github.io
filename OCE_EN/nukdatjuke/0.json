I'm a new LoL player and have been playing for 4 days so far. Each game I commonly see ridiculous amount of cs among some people, I on the other hand get around 100 farm on a 40 minute game. My cousin, who is Gold League player's main is Vayne {{champion:67}}, this champion is ranged. I have used Vayne as well as Ryze but I mainly use Jax. Each game of PvP I play Top Lane. Usually when I farm someone will harass me, leading to less cs and me ultimately dying a lot. This also leads to me feeding the opposing top lane champ, therefore we loss the game. Please give me some tips on how to farm without dying a lot. But if I keep dying I might have to switch to Ryze (First champion I ever used and has made a comfortable build with.) which is okay with me but Jax has been my favourite to play with. Thanks if you ever give me some tips! Add me on Oceana server and you might show me some tips in-game.

If you're versing another melee champ, then remember, they have the same weakness as you. If they go in to poke as you farm, you could probably do the same.\n\nIf versing a ranged character, then what you can try doing is only going in for cs when you see that your opponent is also going for cs. If they decide to poke you at that moment, then they'll lose cs while you still gain yours. If you health regen over time well enough, then you'll leave with the advantage. Also, with Jax specifically, you can activate your dodge skill when you go for cs so they can't auto-attack you, significantly reducing damage.\n\nMost importantly though, you want lane control, that is the ability to freely roam in your lane without fear from your enemy, and the best way to do this is to let them know that you'll kill them if they get in range. You can really only do this if you have a significant lead and sufficient warding, so use it wisely.\n\nBest of luck in the fields of justice.","replies":[]}]}
