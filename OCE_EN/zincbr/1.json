Given the timing it's likely it's a third party ban since a wave just went out. 3rd party/scripting bans are instant permas, so ban history is irrelevant.\n\nAssuming he didn't use the scripts himself, the most likely scenarios are account sharing, boosting, or compromise. If his account was compromised he'll get it back once he goes through the support process and secures the account since this is a first time. If it's account sharing or boosting, sorry but that's on him and he won't be getting the account back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-06-24T14:24:07.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wont tell you why he was banned. \n\nHe has to open a ticket himself or check his emails to verify the reason.","replies":[]}]}
