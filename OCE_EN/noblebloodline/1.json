However i feel like i just wasted alot of time learning to play every role because of this new champ select and i feel like instead of putting down your best lanes, you should be able to put down the lanes you are the worst at instead. For example i like to play anything but support but now i can only choose mid or jungle. Just an idea i think many would find nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2016-01-20T01:31:32.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be a nice feature, but I think valuing what my best roles are would still trump banning out my worst role. If you are really comfortable with every role, why not pick fill & mid?","replies":[]}]}
