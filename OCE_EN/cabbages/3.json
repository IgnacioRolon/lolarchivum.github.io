His early is garbage, he is a melee ADC, you have 10-15 minutes at the start of the match to rek him again and again. It's not his fault if he survives into late game where he truly shines, as it is yours for failing to capitalise on any of it.\n\n> It has been 2 years since he has been touched.\n\nIt's precisely because there is exactly nothing wrong with him so there is no incentive to touch him. But really he was nerfed once right after he was reworked because no one liked the idea of Yi also being pro competitive for whatever god damn reason.\n\n>He is fast, can't be slowed, he can heal himself and he goes untargetable. \n\n* Because not being able to be slowed is the end of the world, wat. We still have suppress, knockback/up, silence, blind, root and stun all on the side waiting to delete YI, just use them. Not to mention he has to be lvl 6 first before getting that anyway.\n* His heal stuns himself and is not effective against turrets.\n* His invulnerability has a 18-14 seconds CD, and it needs an enemy/neutral target to use it, and it's a one way ticket so he has to put himself in some kind of danger most of the time when using it. Also his refresh is basically nonexistent until either he is fed or high level.\n\n> You can't really kite Yi.\nYou can't really skill shot Yi at all.\n\nYes you can. Because he has to either run into your face manually or use his engage/disengage/burst/invulnerability all in one, which has a high CD, to chase you. So you have plenty of chances to kite and skill shot him.\n\n________________\n____________________\n_________________\n\nYou literally make a Yi QQ thread every 2 weeks, while you join and comment on other people's ride on Yi's blade to fill the void in your heart during the mean time.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Master Yi, there was only once that was actually his fault for being broken OP, all other cases were the items' fault.\n\nHe only cost 450 IP to buy anyway, I say play him yourself if you're unable to grasp his actual strength, outside of the Bronze and Silver range and you'll see that he is in fact, not easy nor broken to play as.","replies":[{"poster":"Existance","date":"2015-09-04T05:19:13.042+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"YI and q, is OP you guys all rant about how squishy he is, well he really isn't, yi 'q' and isn't even targetable, wow i wish some of you would come back with an ACTUAL response, rather than this teen quasi intellectual rubbish.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-04T12:26:48.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Existance,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=HgpBxHMp,comment-id=000b0001,timestamp=2015-09-04T05:19:13.042+0000)\n>\n> YI and q, is OP you guys all rant about how squishy he is, well he really isn't, yi 'q' and isn't even targetable, wow i wish some of you would come back with an ACTUAL response, rather than this teen quasi intellectual rubbish.\n\nHe is both not OP statistically and mechanically, I am sure you've already noticed by now.\n\nYeah clearly this post, if we can call it that, is an actual and intellectual response to my constructed analysis.

Well played sir.\n\nYi is not OP, he only was when \"that item\" was and when AP Yi was still a thing, that's it.

But not everyone can use YI to the highest effectiveness, not even pros can do it atm.\n\nYi actually has a rather high skill cap, since all of his spells come down to an evaluation between risk and reward considering everything he has, save for the passive, backfire him in some way after and/or during their use. \n\nThat's a great design. And because of it, his kit is punishing when you dun fked up, and rewarding when you roll it right. Just because he is a snowball champ who has the tendency to ruin low elo in any game title ever, doesn't mean his design itself is problematic. In fact, his kit is one of the most healthy out there I am sure not many would dispute this fact.\n\nYour attempt at shaming your opponent here is neither right, clever or funny I am afraid.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-03T12:41:31.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever heard of CC?\n\nHit him with some hard CC and he is useless and will die instantly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-03T00:29:06.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have one thing to say to you:\n{{champion:133}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2015-09-03T02:06:23.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's not even an answer, what about in normals?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-03T02:43:13.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn can completely destroy Yi, even a fed Yi.","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2015-09-03T08:39:58.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yes but you are first of all talking about 1 champ and second of all, you don't know you're going up against a Yi in normals.
