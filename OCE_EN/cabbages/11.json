It's not actually hurting your Ranked experience at all, and they have also improved matchmaking to give higher priority to your primary role so you get that more often even when playing an in-demand one so the opposite of what you feel you're experience is happening. If you think your team doesn't know their roles, it's not because they were forced into a position they don't know, it's because they are Bronze and they aren't that great in any role.\n\nJust focus on what you can do to improve yourself and you'll climb.
