Does not listen, does not reason, only calls you the C#@! word and other bad things. Doesn&#039;t matter if your nice or mean.\n\nAnd other players say, keep playing he&#039;s doing well... well that is what a Yi is, he is the easy champ, the non skill champ and now we have young little annoyances like this guy, below, who ONLY plays yi because he&#039;s so damn easy and way too op, and he CAN troll because ppl want wins over seeing little rude kids like this get their own way!!!\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-10-19T00:21:02.252+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I edited out the name and shame. \n\nIt's important that you report them at the end of game screen to assist the Instant Feedback System. \n\nTotally understand the frustration - I hate it when I get games with people like that.\n\nThere's some more information on how the PB systems work in the FAQ: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-10-19T04:51:39.074+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am literal walking proof that your report system doesnt work.\n\nNotice how i have the non toxic icon? i once spent an entire month trolling games just for the sake of leveling, i mustve been reported close to a thousand times.\n\nStill got non toxic.\n\nThe community isnt going to say this again.\n\nThe instant feedback system doesnt work, just bring back the tribunal.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Existance","date":"2015-10-21T01:59:10.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot, your report system needs to be harsher, the people spending money and paying are older than these kids who ruin it for us.

Walking proof? They AWAYS get away with it and I played with him again and a few of us reported him and then his account is still up. This sucks! Little kids are wrecking this. it's all you hear, how bad the toxicity is. \n\nI think I read that the last person to report the person who ends up getting the temporary ban will get a notification, but because no one else see's this, it feels like it doesn't work. Can't there be some sort of alert we get? Right now, no one feels the system does anything, even with this being announced as not everyone reads. I don't know... an alert saying, \"your report has been received and this champion has moved into 'red' zone\" or something or other, just to show us it's counting or something?\n\nCan't you create an \"instalocker\" or \"lane stealer\" or \"kill stealer\" so it can be really refined. Some things are more annoying than others.\nI'm mature in age and spend on this game but I tell you, this immaturity and all the above is really turning me off. You don't get this in World of Warcraft and they're as big as you guys.
