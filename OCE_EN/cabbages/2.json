I&#039;m personally stumped haha! I want to choose a lot more than I am allowed to... I assume the idea is to choose one of the last options at the bottom.. But this is LoL assuming that one row fulfils what that champ with that choice is right.. I just don&#039;t like how it makes you only have ONE or the OTHER in the one line. \n\nMy general thought so far is I DON&#039;T like the new masteries at all although I definitely agree they needed tweaking/adjusting, but this whole way I feel is really limiting... we are all going to have more likely the same masteries and this is making the game more that we all have the same the same whereas with the other masteries we could be more daring, mix it up and add our own flavour to it. \n\n\nI feel I just was starting to understand the masteries and the picks, but now they are all over the place and I don&#039;t understand them. If I don&#039;t pick a whole row and end up with one of the bottom picks, does that mean I&#039;m missing out on a better buff/bonus?","replies":[{"poster":"Zarlakk","date":"2015-11-19T01:18:01.018+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mastery changes is another thing that this game really needed to freshen it up, after like 4 years in this game, the last few patches as well as the riot support staff team have left me very impressed :).

From what I've seen you can pretty much swap either Ferocity or Resolve for Cunning and still be effective, it's all about how you wanna play right? I've seen mids with 18 in Cunning that do just fine. I love it! Though I do think maybe Strength of the Ages needs tweaking....it's just so inferior to Bond of Stone atm. \n\nI think it's perfectly ok to go 18/6/6 in mid, take Explorer for the roam and Secret Stash for the biscuits. It does mean forgoing Insight though, but now that Distortion is coming back a bit maybe you don't want/need it.\n\nThat's my take on the new masteries anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-18T08:08:54.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They punish you for falling behind.","replies":[]}]}
