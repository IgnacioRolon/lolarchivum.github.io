I have like a black dripping tar image in my head haha. I know it needs to be detailed, but he is overdue for a new one I reckon :D Although, a hard type to pick. Maybe a rainbow swain with a peacock bird? Or a ghost?

You can't do much with Zac except for Chromas which he has and Riot said they won't make skins for Yorick until he got reworked. Now he has been so I expect him to get one sometime next year.\n\nBig stand outs for champions that have been overlooked.\n\n**Swain. 6 years old. 3 skins.**\nDiana. 4 years old. 3 skins.\n**Rumble. 5 years old. 3 skins.**\nTalon. 5 years old. 4 skins.\n**Taric. 7 years old. 4 skins.\nUrgot. 6 years old. 3 skins.**\nZyra. 4 years old. 3 skins.\n**Viktor. 5 years old. 3 skins.**\nXerath 5 years old. 4 skins.\nSkarner. 5 years old. 4 skins.\n\nPretty sure Urgot falls under the Yorick rule of no skin until he is reworked and Xerath is like Zac. Can't do much but recolour.\n\nI think each champion should have a release skin +1 every year. So each champ should own 1 more skin than years they've been out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-17T07:38:07.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good post. If only a skin a year was possible :P\n\nThere's what like 150 something champs now? That's like a new skin every 2 and a half days :P Even 1 every two years wouldn't be very realistic unless they pumped out a lot more chromas or 750 skins than the levels of quality we are getting at present.\n\nTo go through your list though, some are easy to explain, others not so much:\n**Swain** will probably get a model update before a new skin.\n**Diana** probably comes down to a lack of solid ideas since she's a difficult champ to concept for (i.e ideas that make it through the vetting process)\n**Rumble** has a legendary so is probably pretty low priority compared to most others. He'll likely get a model update based on SG in some capacity before he gets a new skin.\n**Talon** could do with a texture update but doesn't need a model bad so he's a good candidate for a skin.\n**Taric** will likely get one pretty soon now he's had his update, I expect he and Yorick would have gotten a new one with the update release but they weren't ready yet.\n**Urgot** as you say won't get one till he is updated.\n**Zyra** is a strange one. She's a good candidate and isn't too technically hard to make skins for I would think. Perhaps she is like Diana in the concepting respect.\n**Viktor** Same as Diana.\n**Xerath** Same again, as you say, concepting for champs like these are difficult. Guardian of the Sands was genius for Xerath and fit his lore, but all the easy concepts are already done for him.\n**Skarner** Likely same again.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-17T11:29:16.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh. I did the calculation. For each champion to get a skin a year, plus a launch skin, Riot need to pump out 72 skins to catch up (6 per month). In addition to 134 new ones for next year.\n\nHOWEVER if each champion were given 1 skin a year, they would have 62 extra skins on the market, so its fair to say, each champ should have at least 1 skin per year of action.\n\nThere are currently 741 (incl next patch) skins created for Champions (not including Chromas). WIth 134 Champions, that averages to over 5 each. Any champion that is over 5 years old and doesn't have 5 skins is getting ripped.\n\nI know in the beginning, with less champions, the likelihood of a certain champ getting multiple skins is high, but as you see from below, some champions were simply overlooked completely whilst others like Ryze and Annie cashed in.\n\n{{champion:113}}  4 years old. 7 skins.\n{{champion:58}}  5 years old. 8 skins.\n{{champion:79}}  6 years old. 9 skins. \n{{champion:81}}  6 years old. 9 skins.

Even if you disregard the age of the skin as a factor in quality and only use pricepoints there is a bit more to some of them. There's also legacy skins and promised skins to consider. For our purposes I will count 750 or less skins as 1/2, 1350 skins as 1.5, 1820 skins as 2 and ultis as 3, and I will minus any skins that were promised as server gifts, esports skins, victorious, tournament or rework gifts etc since they were prioritised for other reasons.\n___\n{{champion:113}} +1 +1 +0 +0 +1 +.5 +.5 = **4 skins over 4 years** \n{{champion:58}} +.5 +1 +1 +1 +.5 +.5 +1 +0 = **5.5 skins over 5 years**\n{{champion:79}} +.5 +1 +1 +.5 +.5 +1 +1 +1 +0 = **6.5 skins over 6 years**\n{{champion:81}} +.5 +3 +.5 +.5 +1.5 +.5 +.5 +.5 +0 = **7.5 skins over 6 years + chroma**\n{{champion:21}} +.5 +.5 +1 +1.5 +1 +1.5 +1 +1 +.5 = **8.5 skins over 6 years + chroma** (**-1** for Captain if you wish since it was a champion specific lore event)\n{{champion:13}} +.5 +1 +.5 +.5 +1 +1 +1 +0 +0 +0 = **5.5 skins over 7 years** (**6.5** if you count triumphant)(worth noting that most of his skins are legacy or otherwise unavailable)\n{{champion:1}}  +1 +1 +1 +.5 +1.5 (Hextech) +1 +2 +.5 +1 +1 = **10.5 over 7 years** (**8** if you don't count hextech and goth) (Annie is a flagship champion like Katarina is, so it's unsurprising she would see some extra treatment, especially in those early days which is when most of her skins originated.\n___\n{{champion:77}} +.5 +3 +1 +1 = **5.5 skins over 7 years**\n{{champion:26}} +.5 +1 +1 +.5 +.5 = **3.5 skins over 7 years**\n{{champion:69}} +.5 +.5 +1 +1 = **3 skins over 6 years** (has a notoriously difficult model to make skins for, will likely see a model update [if not anims] before she sees a skin)\n{{champion:28}} +.5 +.5 +.5 +.5 = **2 skins over 7 years**\n{{champion:38}} +.5 +1 +1 (CR was 1350 but sold for half price for OCE) +.5 +.5 = **3.5 skins over 7 years**\n{{champion:74}} +.5 +1 +1 +2 +1 = **5.5 skins over 7 years**\n___\n(Filtering out champs I addressed above)\n{{champion:59}} +.5 +.5 +1 +1.5 +0 +0 = **3.5 skins over 6 years**\n{{champion:96}} +.5 +1.5 +1 +1 +1.5 +.5 +.5 +1 = **7.5 skins over 6 years**\n{{champion:90}} +.5 +.5 +1 +.5 +1 = **3.5 skins over 6 years**\n{{champion:98}} +1 +.5 +1 +.5 +.5 +0 = **3.5 skins over 6 years** (though taking into account approximate quality after his update +1 +1 +1 +.5 +1 +0 = 4.5 skins)\n{{champion:45}} +.5 +.5 +.5 +1 +2 +.5 +1 +1 = **7 skins over 7 years**\n___\nSo the champs we could consider to have an unfair amount of skins taking other factors into account would be {{champion:21}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:98}} (9 out of the 25 you listed) and only two of those are 'overloaded' champs (which implies that even ignoring the creative process, champions not having skins appropriate for their age is not a result of other champs having too many).\n___\nWhile it's not an exhaustive list, and there are still champions who (by numbers alone) deserve more skins, in the scheme of 135~ champs it's not very many. I really feel that we have to take more into account than just number. The multitudes of Teemo recolours are worth a lot less (RP wise and enjoyment wise) than Veigar's or Rumble's Legendary.\n\nThis is also assuming that skins are created on a solely by the numbers basis, which is just not the case. There is a lot of creative integrity here, and Riot's standards continue to increase as time goes on (Snow Day Malz at 975 vs Baron von Veigar at 975 for example). A significant portion of skin decisions comes from what ideas are the most suitable for a given champion at a given time, and only those ideas which live up to Riot's standards make it any further than concepting.\n\nThere are loads of skin ideas that Riot throws around, but until they can meet standards they will not see production, and may be scrapped for more suitable ideas or shelved for another time.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-18T09:01:24.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg.
