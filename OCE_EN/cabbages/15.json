Corki{{champion:42}}  is able to get past it as he flies over it, but Vayne&#039;s tumbles THROUGH it and so does Caitlyn with her E- Net that she recoils back from. IMPASSABLE means you cannot go THROUGH it. I understand OVER. But tumbling through it is not right...\n\nThe ability says that the wall is &#039;impassable&#039; so this obviously shouldn&#039;t be able to happen.\n\nNot sure what other champs can move through it with abilities. Please fix asap! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-05-16T02:01:40.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumping this, needs to be seen by Riot... if it says \"impassable\" it means NO champ should be able to \"pass through\"... i get that OVER is okay but cmon","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-09T04:22:35.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite can also go through it with 'Unstoppable Force'. Azir can jump over it with his soldiers. Hell, even Riven can hop over it. It's treated in game as terrain, nothing more. It's not a bug.\n\nSpeaking of which, all bug reports belong on the [Report a Bug board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), not here.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]}]}
