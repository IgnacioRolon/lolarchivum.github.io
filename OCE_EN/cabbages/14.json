Can Riot make this 3 every year or even 1 refund a year or something like that? Or perhaps that we can &#039;earn&#039; a refund?\r\n\r\nPlease if you agree that the refund system needs improving, please click the arrow UP to riot hopefully see&#039;s this :)","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-24T06:45:39.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have played this game for some 5 years now and have not needed or wanted a refund in a long time. I think it is good the way it is as it allows new players to refund something that quite possibly does not suite them.\n\nIf you have been playing long enough, you should really know how this game works and have enough IP to 'waste' on new champs. You also shouldn't really need runes after a long enough time. Refunding for veteran players should never happen.\n\nI have 97 champions and don't really want to get anymore, I don't see myself ever playing them, so for each new champion that comes out, I should have enough IP saved to simply buy them with no hassles.","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-05-24T07:18:49.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough. That sounds very reasonable. Although I still think it an idea to bring in a reward or to be able to earn a refund skin? Sometimes it's just not how you thought it would be haha","replies":[]}]}]}
