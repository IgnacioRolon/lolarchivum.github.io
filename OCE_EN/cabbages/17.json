That they actually see?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I love how Riot brings out a new champ and uses other champs as examples of what a champ &quot;does&quot; or &quot;doesn&#039;t&quot;...\r\n\r\nCan riot make a LIST of in their opinion of what a champ IS and ISN&#039;t good for? I find I learn moe about champs by reading their updates and opinions on champs than versing them.\r\n\r\nLike for example, with their notes about this new Champ, Kindred, they say:\r\n\r\n_Twisted Fate and Twitch - have been really gimmicky, and either dominate a game or do absolutely nothing. Their early ganks are often devastating (not many can survive invisible red buff ganks or TF&rsquo;s guaranteed stun)_\r\n\r\nWell, I would never have thought and I have barely seen Twitch a a jungle and now reading this, I&#039;m like... Oh I&#039;ve been missing out on trying this because i never imagined he&#039;d work&quot;\r\n\r\nMY POINT I GUESS IS RIOT OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE BEST TIPS FOR CHAMPS AND I FEEL I MISS OUT HEAPS SO IF THEY HAD A SUMMARY OF CHAMPS AND WHAT THEY&#039;RE BEST FOR, THAT WOULD BE COOL AND USEFUL AND GETTING MROE PEOPLE TRYING MORE CHAMPS","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-19T08:49:43.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But riot doesn't have the best tips for champs, if they knew exactly what each Champ should and shouldn't do then they wouldn't ever need to patch because all the champs would be perfect, think back, LB used to have a silence until someone thought \"hmm maybe she is too op with that, let's take it away\" and they took it away, but until then she did have a silence and so for that whole time she must have been 'wrong' yes? therefore they don't have all the tips because if they did she would have been right to begin with. The game is constantly changing, and no one can know everything or make everything work perfectly, supports used to not have support items, and now you basically can't function without them. \n\nAlso just because they create something doesn't mean they are the best at it. Smith and Wesson is a firearms brand, but the ceo of that company isn't the best sharpshooter in the world. \n\nThere is no set list of what champs are ane aren't good for, twitch isn't supposed to jungle and in my mind he still is not meant to be there, yet I have seen many people do it with varying levels of success. Ezreal is supposed to be an ADC yet for a while (and still kinda happening atm) he was better as an AP assassin in the mid lane. RIOT didn't plan for that to happen, but because they made some minor changes to items etc it just happened.\n\nThere are obvious do's and donts, like you don't take soraka jungle because you will really really struggle, but no one says you can't try.","replies":[]}]}
