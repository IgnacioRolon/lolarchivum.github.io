You counter everything he does. With sufficient damage you destroy him.\n\nTry saving your CC for after he Alpha Strikes or else he'll just dodge it with it. \n\nYi is traditionally squishy as well. Stun him and kill him, get a Morgana to snare him. A Ryze to snare if etc. He's not OP. \nLate Game Rammus destroys him.

Normally you can't account for a yi, except everyone is playing him all of a sudden (where's the skill gone?), but it would mean always playing less interesting champs just to counter the yi. Garen is op, I don't complain about him. Zed is beyond op, but he at least requires some skill.
