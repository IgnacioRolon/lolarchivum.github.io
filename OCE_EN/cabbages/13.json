It&#039;s extremely frustrating. \r\n\r\nIf you agree with any of this, please click the up arrow so Riot hopefully see&#039;s this and implements more to be allowed to play ranked and harsher punishment if you stuff up a game on purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-06-27T10:41:00.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"AshenOCE","date":"2016-06-03T00:41:58.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is quite a competitive environment. And for someone who just starts to play it they may have struggles to change to suit what is needed of them in a ranked match.\n\nAs for harsher punishments, they are already harsh enough. Eventually they will get a ban which should reform them, if it does not rest easy knowing that their account will most likely be perma banned.\n\nWhat is worse then having all your experience and money gone after wasting your second chance by being an idiot?","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-06-03T06:40:11.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm really surprised to read that you think they are harsh enough... you don't agree that punishments of trolling/stealing lanes in ranked should be different to the punishments already in place for normals?? \n\nBy the way your third paragraph makes no sense to what my point is... it takes awhile for these reports to build up and my point is that ranked is more serious than normals, so why shouldn't there be harsher/stricter rules for it?","replies":[]}]}]}
