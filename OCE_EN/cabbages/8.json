As an example, say you had Pulsefire Ezreal because you played him at the time and then stopped but when Spirit Guard Udyr was released, you didn't have enough RP to buy him. So you refund Pulsefire Ezreal because you may not play Ez anymore and just buy spirit guard udyr with the refunded RP instead of the large amount you'd normally spend to get him.\n\nLoL players were spoiled to even get three of them in the first place for nothing, I'm sorry that sounds harsh but it's just not smart business for them to allow resetting refunds. As I said, send in a support ticket, that's an innocent mistake that they may consider fixing, but giving you a full refund on the purchase isn't the solution I would think, they would probably have to find a workaround.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ace","date":"2016-08-19T01:44:10.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Cabbages,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=GbsZNPco,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-08-18T07:52:36.143+0000)\n>\n> What about if you&#x27;ve been playing for years and used up all your refunds really fast not realising the quality of them and years later make a mistake :D\n\nPretty much what happened to me, A while ago I made the same post, apparently they can't do anything about it ;/\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ExEonVAx-getting-more-refunds?comment=00020000","replies":[{"poster":"Cabbages","date":"2016-08-19T10:25:45.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah damn that sucks.
