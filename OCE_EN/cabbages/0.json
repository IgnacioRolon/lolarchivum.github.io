I think a skin for Swain would be a big/tough job for the designers cuz it has to be COOL. \r\n\r\nHas anyone had any ideas for new skin ideas? \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve thought of, Peacock Swain, Ghost Swain (love the Gnagplank ghost one!) I dunno maybe a &#039;magician swain&#039; with sparks from under his cloak, lightening somehow? Might not suit the birds though haha.
