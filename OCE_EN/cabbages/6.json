He has speed to catch you or get away, he has a self heal and then he has that moment of invisibility while doing huge damage- how is it, the most hated and complained about champ in games, patch after patch has had nothing done to him!? \r\nThis is frustrating and unfair. Please, please nerf him. Not asking for a delete like I see people crying for. Just nerf him, he completely needs it and I really would love to know why this hasn&#039;t even been broached yet!?? He&#039;s the easiest but most op champ in the game.
