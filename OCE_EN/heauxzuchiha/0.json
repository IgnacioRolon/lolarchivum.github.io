The community decides what should be punished and what shouldn't by what we choose to report or not, so if you see negative behaviour and choose not to report it, you're saying you're ok with that sort of behaviour.\n\nAs for your punishment, a 10 game chat restriction is the first tier of punishment. In essence it is a warning that you are falling on the side of negative and need to lean up your act. Failing to do so will see you receive more punishments, through 25 game chat restriction, 14 day ban, and ultimately permanent suspension of your account.\n\nAs for your logs, you got a little homophobic for one, and you have a negative attitude pretty much from the third line on. I'm not saying your behaviour was serious, because it wasn't, but there's two things you have remember about this. The first is that this is a warning that you are starting to get yourself in trouble,  a minor punishment for a minor offense to hopefully prevent the start of worse behaviour. The second is that the behaviour of others does not excuse your own. If someone is abusing me all game, that does not then give me the right to abuse them back.\n\nIf someone is being negative, mute and report. You only hurt your sanity, your skill/focus, and everyone else on your team by retaliating, and open yourself up to punishment as well. SO long as you report them their behaviour will be reviewed the same as yours was.","replies":[{"poster":"HeauxzUchiha","date":"2017-11-09T10:11:41.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, you are right with that first paragraph i tots agree i shouldve reported back but i didnt think it was that serious! \ni dont recall where i got homophobic?? i just pointed out that they were boyfriends but i didnt say anything abusive about bein gay? so? \nbut anyways i dont think i deserved this 10 day ban i was far from being abusive i was defending myself in a comedic way and trying to not get bothered by what they were saying about me. all im trying to say is whoever was incharge with reading the chatlog shouldve read everyones chat log and judged on that, i feel like they didnt look into this deep enough to see i am not deserving of this ban. :( please remove this ban \n </3","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T10:17:27.164+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are judged on your own behaviour not the behaviour of others.

They rarely ever revoke a restriction unless it is unlawful.\n\nYour best bet is to wait out the restriction as it is only 10 games. Think of it as a learning curve and learn from your mistakes. Muting them and not retaliating is the first step to avoid being punished.\n\nIt's like Seras Dragon stated, your judged on you own actions. What you may not feel is discrimination may feel like it to your team mates. \n\nIf you wish I can go over your chat log and explain why you got this restriction then maybe you will understand the reasoning behind it.\n\nCheers,\n\nRequinox","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T09:27:39.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is pretty harsh at the moment.
