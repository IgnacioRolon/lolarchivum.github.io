Not in the sense of statistical balances, reworks, buffs, and nerfs but more so in regards to attention and creativity. Im talking about SKINS!\r\n\r\nBasically I just want riot to make a Handy Man Braum skin. He&#039;d look kinda similar to Lumberjack Sion with the Red Flannel shirt and some blue jeans on the bottom and a tool belt thrown in for good measure, BUT HE&#039;D CARRY A DOOR! Like a wooden front door you&#039;d see on a suburban house.\r\n\r\nIn regards to his abilities:\r\nQ - A Hammer is thrown out from the door\r\nW - ...(I couldn&#039;t think of any way to change or improve that animation)\r\nE - Instead of a blue translucent wall he could construct a picket fence in front of him to block incoming damage\r\nR - Braum throws down his red metal tool box and tools come flying out around him and in front knocking everyone up!\r\n\r\nhis taunts could include him constructing things like a playground or a dog house. Maybe even carting dirt in a wheel barrow? I definitely believe that his recall animation should be him constructing a door frame and then fitting his door that he carries, into the frame and then walking through it like a portal back to the fountain.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Let me know what you think of the skin idea, post some suggestions and lets make this skin happen!!","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-12T05:33:55.679+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it.\nI'd like to see this with unique vocals as well.\nGive him the \"home improvement/Tim the toolman Taylor\" signature grunt as his laugh, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LlamaLegend","date":"2016-09-12T05:37:56.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As a Braum main myself, I would love to see a skin like or similar to this. At the moment I use Dragon Slayer Braum and is getting a little old because most of the taunts, voice lines are the same and his recall is pretty bland. A skin like this would be absolutely amazing, but don't change the voice lines too much (Braums voice lines are too inspiring to change), maybe just the taunt voice lines. A skin I would defiantly purchase.{{champion:201}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smethy","date":"2016-09-12T05:46:10.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great suggestion JDJ as I prefer the funny/comic humour skins this would really appeal to a heap of people id say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-12T05:44:04.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also think a FMA Major Armstrong style Braum skin would be awesome.\nCopyright hasn't stopped them up until now.","replies":[]}]}
