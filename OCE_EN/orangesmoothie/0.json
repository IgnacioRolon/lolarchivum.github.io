You then ask them if they are playing with WiFi, 9 times out of 10, they are. \r\n\r\nWell, I&#039;m here to tell you to look into &quot;Ethernet over power&quot; it&#039;s basically a long Ethernet cable that uses your electrical lines. Google it, choose any brand, connect 1 to your modem/ router and connect the other to your PC/laptop. That&#039;s it, stable connection.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-05-02T08:20:05.832+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Most of the time, the problem is with the internet connection, not the wifi. The fact that '9 times out of 10 you ask if they are using wifi and they are' is meaningless since the majority of people use wifi anyway (Its like saying, 9 out of 10 people in car crashes have a drivers licence. Well yea, because most people on the road have a drivers licence, doesn't mean they're worse drivers). An ethernet cable won't solve the real issue most of the time","replies":[{"poster":"orangesmoothie","date":"2016-05-02T09:52:41.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=McRuthless,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bs3B5iEf,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-02T08:20:05.832+0000)\n>\n> Most of the time, the problem is with the internet connection, not the wifi.

You plug it into the power point and then into your laptop/computer.  You then plug the other one into your modem which is on the other side of the house.  It uses the power lines, you don't need a super long ethernet cable.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"orangesmoothie","date":"2016-05-02T07:15:52.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bumping this so more people can see it.
