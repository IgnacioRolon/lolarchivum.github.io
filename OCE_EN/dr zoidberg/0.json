After that he decided to not come to bot lane anymore and he was constantly at mid lane all game and as a result I was flaming him. But can you really blame me in this situation when someone is purposely going out of their way to ruin your gaming experience? In game 2, I don't see how it was being toxic because it was just banter between me and my support. \n\nI've been playing this game since season 3 and I've never been banned until now season 9. Three or four months ago I was banned for 2 weeks, that was my first offence ever since playing this game. After then I had only one bad day with two bad games, the first game resulted me to tilt into the game 2. \n\nAfter the 2-week suspension I was reformed for 3-4 months and I never went out of my way of putting down other players with toxicity. Just one bad day of two games and I'm being judged in all my 7 years of playing this game. I feel completely shattered now knowing that I will probably never get my account back after spending so much time and money into this game. I've sent numerous tickets to RIot games and they've all replied with the exact same answer with NO removal of the punishment etc. However I had one response that told me to post here on the boards for review.\n\nRiot games please give me one more chance to reform, I know now its not right to be abusive towards players even though they are abusive, griefing or purposely ruining the gaming experience for you. It's sad to say but I think Riot games just don't care deeply for their players anymore..Praying for one rioter to do a good samaritan here please.","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2019-08-22T02:12:56.361+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion, permanently banning accounts does nothing good for the game.\nThe person could make another account and troll even harder to get back at Riot for permanently banning them.\n\nI feel like banning a player for 1-4 weeks is a good amount, and the player may think about being careful next time, if they missed playing the game for a month.\n\nAll permanently banning does is make the player have a different username, or stop playing the game (and potential lost revenue). There will always be non-banned trolls, so banning a troll here and there won't increase revenue by decreasing the number of lost players. Players will always encounter trolls.\n\nLiterally half my games (in silver/gold) have people being abused in champion select. 10% of them have people AFK/Int from the start as a result of the champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Freesia","date":"2019-08-22T20:21:09.907+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed Riot has some fucked up ways of measuring punishment on using the in game chat because this money scheme is an endless loop for those weak minded to pay more money on the game when they get banned.

What I can do is offer you some more context, though if you've submitted tickets then some or most you will have probably already received. I'll try to boil it down to your key concerns to keep it concise.\n___\n**.1. Why were you punished in this manner?**\n\nTypically punishment follows four tiers: \n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14-day ban\n* Permanent ban\n\nHowever, it is possible to skip tiers depending on the severity and type of behaviour. Gameplay offences for example (intent feeding, griefing, etc) skip the two chat restriction tiers since a chat restriction doesn't make much sense in that case. The other thing that will skip those chat restrictions is what is classed by Riot as \"no-tolerance language\". This includes discriminatory language/hate speech (sexism, racism, etc) and suicide encouragement (\"kys\", etc).\n\nGiven that you said you received your first punishment recently, and in the form of a 14-day ban, I imagine one of those applies to you. If not, some more info from your part would be appreciated to give the full picture.\n\n\n___\n**.2. Why does my clean 7-year history not matter?**\n\nIn short, it does. I would say that what damned you here was that initial 14-day. To receive that 14-day as your first punishment, there must have been some pretty serious behaviour going on there (as mentioned above).\n\nEssentially, after that 14-day your account is no longer an old, previously clean account, but is instead now an account with a recent history of *serious* toxicity. \n\nIn saying that, constantly calling people things like \"spastic\" and \"dogshit\" would have probably run you afoul of the system regardless of your clean history, but without that initial escalation it probably would have been a chat restriction. \n\nTo put it in perspective, if I go my whole life without stealing anything, I might get let off easy for stealing a candy bar (still illegal though), but not so much for stealing a car. While there are rewards for being an upstanding citizen, not stealing things is the expectation not the accomplishment.\n___\n**.3. But they started it.**\n\nIt doesn't matter. Frustration is expected in those scenarios, but abuse is not. If nothing else, anything you say at that point is going to make things worse, and not just for you and the person being an ass, but also for the other *innocent* players in your games.\n\nUltimately, you are held responsible for your behaviour, just as they are responsible for their own. If you reported them, then they will be held accountable in the same manner.\n___\n**.4. Can I have one more chance?**\n\nUnfortunately no. The 14-day ban was your chance and your warning. Given that you were sitting on that 14-day received tier, that meant your next punishment was going to be a permanent suspension. This should have been made clear in the reform card for your 14-day. It is possible to drop tiers, but it takes a lot of time and at least neutral gameplay to do so.\n\nThe punishment tiers are chosen very specifically, with a lot of data to back them up. The short version is, after that 14-day tier, reform rates drop to almost nil. Giving players that extra chance, results in almost 100% relapse rate, which hurts *far* more innocent players that have to be in those games than it does the odd player who would actually reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Achad44","date":"2019-08-21T19:28:05.272+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":3,"body":"why we can't say what we think ? this remind me of communism.","replies":[{"poster":"Freesia","date":"2019-08-22T20:23:00.549+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yea tell me about it feels like RIot is suppose to be some kind of a daddy day care centre for the inters and griefers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-08-22T13:44:07.083+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":9,"body":"Hey, the person who has the time to log in roughly 8 different accounts to create a false display.

Why doesn't Riot games introduce that system or just permanently chat restrict.

Basically, it didn't encourage form, didn't prevent toxicity, and didn't even do a great job of hiding it because they'd just find other ways to be toxic.\n\nBans aren't about money, they are about protecting players. Whatever you may think of Riot and their current direction, that fact remains. Perma-banned accounts are a tiny percentage, not exactly a big moneymaker even if we were to assume that banned players would be inclined to spend more money (which more often than not they aren't). Even MMO games without microtransactions of any sort have bans.\n\nIt is your choice to continue on a new account or not. Whatever you choose, good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Zoidberg","date":"2019-08-19T15:33:44.406+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"As for the permanent chat or even months/season long chat restriction, you can't just assume every player is going to be toxic in gameplay ways. As for me I won't, I play to win and for fun and I don't see any benefits of ruining other peoples game experience by intentionally feeding or being a nuisance in game. I've never told anyone to kys or said anything racist, but I agree that kind of abusive behaviour deserves punishment. Perma-banned accounts are actually higher percentage from what I've read from other sources and they are mainly aimed at abusive players. There are other methods of Riot games to handle these kind of situations, but they're just lazy and ready to lay down the money hammer by permanently banning which completely disregards that persons hard spent time and money on the game, literally zero loyalty or respect to their players. They should at least implement the reform program and track that player's behaviour and if they reform, then they deserve only one more chance to recover their banned account. But again Riot games is lazy and only care about money, because they know their system will just bring back those banned players to buy champions and skins all over again.\n\nIf I do get my ban removed, I definitely will remove my chat box for sure because I know the IFS is literally flawed and gets flagged sometimes for unnecessary reasons. I've read so many complaints of players that have said this system is flawed and have been banned even though their in game messages were not toxic at all. You're better off not typing anything and just mute all every single game. Back in the old days the tribunal system was much better at locating what is toxic and whats not, that system was 100% better and I miss those days. \n\nI play Dota 2 and Heroes of the Storm and I'm usually not that kind of person who abuses other players. I've never been chat restricted or banned in those games because their punishment system seems justified. Never have I seen a case of their players complaining on how their system works. Now when I think of Riot games the words that come to mind are \"greed\" and \"tyranny\".\nMake League great again..","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-20T06:11:29.709+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":10,"body":"> you can't just assume every player is going to be toxic in gameplay ways\n\nIt's not an assumption, it's a statistic. Before the IFS existed, permanent chat restrictions did (to be more specific, infinitely stacking chat restrictions). Among those that offended enough to get more than 1-2 chat restrictions stacked on their account, the stacked chat restrictions had basically 0 impact on toxicity/negativity. Why would they continue to use a system that does nothing?\n\n>As for me I won't\n\nWon't you though? Don't take this the wrong way, I'm simply trying to put it into perspective for you. Consider that from the outside, you are a player that ran afoul of the system and received a 14-day ban, were *explicitly* warned that any further violations would result in loss of your account, and despite having a purely selfish reason not to offend again you did so. \n\nIf you were permanently chat restricted, there would be no personal incentive for you to improve your behaviour, because there is no worse in that scenario. If you didn't control your behaviour to save your account, why would you control it just to prevent another stack of chat restrictions?\n\n> permanently banning which completely disregards that persons hard spent time and money on the game\n\nIf I refrain from murder for 20 years of my life and then murder someone at 21, I don't get a free pass because of my 20 years of not murdering people. Not murdering people is the expectation, not an accomplishment.\n\n> literally zero loyalty or respect to their players\n\nGiving every perma-banned player 1 more shot to reform, with the knowledge that 99+% of those players are going to go right back to being toxic within a few games, is disrespecting every single other player that those banned players will play with in that time, every single player that has never been punished, and especially every single player that got punished and made a real effort to reform and get their account back into good standing. Riot simply cannot choose that &lt;1% of players over the 99%. It doesn't make sense to make that choice.\n\n>the tribunal system was much better at locating what is toxic and whats not\n\nIt really wasn't. The tribunal system universally punished more harshly and more often than the IFS does, for even the most minor of infractions. It required so much oversight from Riot that almost every case required manual review, which entirely defeated the purpose.\n\n>Never have I seen a case of their players complaining on how their system works\n\nIt is not hard at all to find people complaining about unjustified punishments for either of those games. Any online game (see OW, WoW, DOTA, HotS, CoD, CS, etc, etc) has people complaining that they get punished for 'nothing', when more often than not they are forgetting that they are playing an *M/13+ rated* game and that going off at someone for making a mistake isn't an appropriate way to behave, in-game or otherwise.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Zoidberg","date":"2019-08-20T07:24:24.640+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":4,"body":"So the statistic says so but the minority suffers because Riot can't put the effort in place? By the way if you read what I said before, I was reformed for 3-4 months after the 2-week suspension, but like I said I had one bad day because someone griefed in my game but yeah I forgot and should of known that I was on thin ice..What has murder got to do with this situation, you literally make no sense. If i was to murder someone at least I don't go to jail for the rest of my life.

Also I never got chat restricted, just straight up 2-week suspension and that seems unfair to me. For your information the tribunal system was run by a committee of people, believe me I know because I've played this game for a long time. It was not run by an automated bot that doesn't seem accurate at all, you need to do your research. I can literally list a lot of youtube links here explaining that.

Literally any banned player could say \"I promise I won't do it again, I just need one more chance\". The statistics say that 99~% of those players when given that chance, would go right back to hurting innocent players. \n\nIf you give that chance, you have a tiny percentage of any already tiny percentage of players benefitting, but you also have a much larger number of players hurt by those that haven't benefitted. Or, you have the current system where that tiny percentage of a tiny percentage suffers, but the majority doesn't. You can't please everyone, and no system is perfect.\n\nThe murder thing was an analogy, same as the stealing thing. You don't expect congratulations for following the law, but you do expect punishment for breaking it. The same applies here. You knew what the rules were, if only because you brushed with the system in the past and were explicitly warned of the consequences. \n\nA murderer who was jailed, got out, and then murdered another person 3-4 months later probably *would* be jailed for life, since they've proved that a timed sentence isn't a deterrent and they didn't learn any sort of lesson like \"murdering people is bad\" from the experience.\n\nIf you play literally any online game, you don't own those accounts. You rent them. This is not a Riot thing, it is a business thing. It exists to protect them and to protect us.\n\nI never at any point said that tribunal was run by a bot. I said it universally punished more harshly, more often, and less accurate than the current system (which is a computer learning system) does.\n\nI *have* played those other games. While I can't profess to be as intimate with the details of their punishment systems, I do know that *any* system has its flaws, and there will always be people who disagree with how things are moderated. Every person is unique and it is literally impossible to make every single person happy.\n\nAny large group of people, be it a church group or a multi-billion dollar gaming company have to appease their majority. Riot isn't going to cater to the few hundred people who would benefit from that extra chance over the thousands that would be hurt by it.

Starting with\n\n> https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/12/top-riot-executive-suspended-without-pay-following-investigation-over-workplace-misconduct/\n\n> Earlier this week, Riot’s CEO sent an email to employees describing the punishment its COO, Scott Gelb, will face after multiple employees **_alleged _** that, as a comedy bit, he has repeatedly touched subordinates’ balls or butt or farted in their faces. \n\nDo you understand what the word ALLEGE stand for? In mean accusation WITHOUT PROOF.  \n\nSo this Kotaku website started with baseless accusation and built their whole argument around it. GREAT JOB! Too bad in the court of law all of this is hearsay, unless the accusers is willing to come forward and give a formal testimony. \n\nAll of this is DEFAMATION. Source-less DEFAMATION.\n\n> An eight-month Kotaku investigation, informed by interviews with dozens of current and former employees, revealed that Riot Games has fostered a culture of sexism. \n\nThey've linked those investigations to THEIR OWN SOURCE? who the fuck does that? They are playing trial, jury and executioner all in one. \n\nNot even a fair rebuttal, all one sided bashing to further their own narrative. LOOK THROUGH IT, EVERY LINKS IS LINKED TO THEIR OWN \"KOTAKU\" SOURCE. \n\nThis is like communist china's trial, they have a 99.99% conviction rate. Corruption and power play. What a joke mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Freesia","date":"2019-08-21T16:00:34.965+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":4,"body":"Hey look Riot did retaliate and deleted the post but nice try though but I still have it. Pretty scummy of them to do so, it's like they wanna hide this embarrassing fact.\n\nFeels good to have quit this game because I know how shit this company is and I'm now enjoying myself playing Fortnite and Dota 2. Again just how disgusting is this company and my recommendation to current lol players is to quit and play another game. If I was playing a premade game with friends and I drop the N word, the \"perfect\" IFS will think I'm being toxic and I get banned even though that's how I talk with my friends.\n\nWhy bother playing this game if Riot games can't punish players who grief or intentionally feed, we are held hostage and can't retaliate to their behaviour. If we message them so we get banned for that, how fucking stupid is Riots justice system seriously. Sometimes you even get banned for literally using the in game chat when you haven't said anything toxic at all. Then you get banned and they expect you to create a new account and spend more money on champions and skins WTF that's some greedy ass money scheme right there!! Btw Korean servers don't punish toxicity, rather they punish scripters and inters. So that means Riot games can't meet quality standards across the board. To be honest I think Riot games will ban you whenever they please and not have a valid reason, as many people have complained, again Riot being a corrupted company.\n\nYa'll can agree Riot is going full greedy mode with skin prices going up, prestige skins, eternals (pay for achievements), event passes, over priced TFT pets. A lawsuit for not asking permission from a soccer player?? LOL client is still bad after 10 years. Dota 2 has bigger prize pools compared to low baller Riot games :), I'll definitely spread the word out that this company and game sucks. I had to dig out all the bad history and linked it below.
