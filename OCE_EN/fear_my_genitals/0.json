Watch their game along with them as they play\r\n- People can properly be coached by someone of superior skill and help with the learning curve\r\n\r\n**_I know this is pretty much the same thing seen in dota 2_**. However i believe it would add to the experience of League, especially in someone learning to play.","replies":[{"poster":"lineers","date":"2016-11-03T13:00:19.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having a real coaching system will help a ton of players get back into the game since you could always have a friend watch your games and help you out along they way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-03T19:07:36.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You forgot sight will only be limited to allies.
