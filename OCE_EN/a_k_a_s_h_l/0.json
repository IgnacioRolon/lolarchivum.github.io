During my leave from league, my account was hacked by someone. So as any other person would do, change the password straight away, and right after that send a ticket to Riot to see if they can help out, and that would be the best way to resolve things. right? WRONG. My account got banned straight away. No notice, not replying to my original ticket asking for help about someone hacking my account, (keep in mind I have no given any sort of information regarding my account details to ANYONE). So naturally I got the automated you got banned message which stated that I have used &quot;3rd party hacking programs etc etc..&quot;. So I started another ticket, asking riot, why did they ban me? Someone hacked my account and supposedly used &quot;Third Party Hacking Programs&quot; and I have to get punished for asking them for help? Is this really the right protocol on how you treat a player that has been playing on and off for over four thousand games? The reply I got was absolutely astounding. \r\n\r\n&quot; Your account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends. Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\r\n\r\nOCE: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\r\n\r\nWe won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.&quot;\r\n\r\nDisgusting customer service, this is what you call a money hungry company guys. They completely ignored the fact that I TOLD them I have not shared my account information with anyone and have been HACKED. They claimed that their systems have detected &quot;scripts&quot;, I call that a load of BS. Why would they not ban the account as I was being hacked. It has played over 30 unauthorized ranked games, and if the &quot;systems have detected scripts&quot; why did they not ban it before I mentioned that my account was being compromised? And let&#039;s say I DID script, why in the world would I report my account for them to check so I can get found out that the account has gone through 3rd Party Programs? \r\n\r\nRiot please pick up your game with the customer service, I&#039;m sure that I am not the first one to experience this kind of unfair treatment by Riot staff. You are banning loyal League of Legend players, and for what? Help out for a change. \r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nMy account got hacked, asked riot for help, got banned for supposed &quot;Illegal 3rd party programs&quot; (even though I quit playing for like 6+ months) , ticket closed there, riot did nothing to help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:09:32.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok this might end up being a bit long but I'll help you as best I can, since there's been some pain with these compromises lately.\n\n**First** thing I'm going to ask you for is the ticket number so I can pass it onto someone who should be able to help you.\n\n**Second** thing is have you secured the email attached to your account? Changing the PW on your account stops the intruder from accessing your account, but if they got access via your email then that is still going to be a problem, so if you think you're email may have been compromised, change the password on that too. I'll save you the spiel about not using the same PW for anything, but I will say if you have anything that uses the same PW as your League account, change it, because one of those (with the same acc name or email) is also a likely place where they got your PW from.\n\n**Third**, an answer to the question we get asked most often, namely \"Why can't they tell me what specifically was detected?\". You didn't ask this yourself, but I'll give you the tl;dr and say that the more Riot keeps there detection methods in the dark, the harder it is for the legit cheaters to avoid them.\n\n**Fourth**, Riot technically has no obligation to return your account to you, since by the ToS the account claims responsibility (rather than the player) so the punishment is valid for the actions taken. That said, the policy is that if the account was banned as a result of compromise (and it hasn't happened before) then they'll give the account back after confirming original ownership (they'll ask a whole bunch of questions RE info that is unique to but not visible on the account).\n\n**Fifth**, this isn't about money. Assuming you speak only the truth (which I will do, but understand there is scepticism, not everyone is honest here) then this is simply a mistake on Player Support's part. Presumably, the agent failed to recognise the compromise, and therefore banned the account under the assumption you were simply using it to cheat/ruin games, which is obviously perma ban worthy, this isn't about trying to take your money. In fact, banning innocent players is a rather absurd way to make money don't you think? If someone sells you something, then takes whatever it was back and keeps the money, you're hardly going to buy from them again are you? Whereas if they provide desirable goods and don't screw you over, are you not more likely to continue to spend money with them?\n\n**Sixth**, Riot does security bans on accounts as well, i.e you will get a ban that just says to ticket support which is basically a \"we detected compromise so have banned the account so no harm can be done until it is secured\". This doesn't sound like what happened, but it could be a case of a second agent involved that didn't get all the relevant info (i.e the ban was a security ban, but when you ticketed support asking why they just saw cheating so assumed, which seems like the likely cause to me).\n___\n**So, what can you do about this? Well, ticketing support was the right way to go, but clearly something has gotten lost in translation here, so I will talk to one of my peeps who may be able to help you out/look at the tickets and get it sorted, the ticket number (if you have an open one) will help here but isn't strictly necessary. With any luck, you'll get a proper response on the ticket in the next few days so the only other advice I can give if to have a little patience and work on securing any other accounts that may have been compromised.**","replies":[{"poster":"A K A S H l","date":"2017-05-13T03:28:19.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this lenghthy reply. I truly, truly appreciate this. The only reason I started this thread was because an hour before I posted this, one of my friends who I have been playing League of Legends with for pretty much 4-5 years has also got banned for \"Malicious 3rd party programs\" when he HAS not touched any of those, and I thought to myself, what's going on? Why are you guys banning people who do not touch any of these stupid programs? Thankfully, his account ban has been lifted this morning. But anyway I will reply to all questions in the same manner.\n\nFirst : I've got a few already closed tickets, if needed I will find them when I get home from work, which is 12 hours from now. \n\nSecond : I have changed all passwords ever since the compromised League account, as something like that has never happened to me before so naturally I got really scared and instinctively changed all passwords.\n\nThird : I infact am pretty sure I asked that question in any way or form, ie \"How can you tell the supposed 'hack' was coming from my computers?\" This can 100% not happen because I only had a macbook back then when I was playing League and League was like 6 months out of date. (I won't dig into questions about your system security because I sure as hell don't need people dodging all my skillshots)\n\nFourth : I understand this, but I really feel something better could be done in this situation. I really feel like i've been treated badly as i have not shared my account info with anyone, it got hacked and apparently the hacker was playing with '3rd party programs' which caused my account to get banned. Which I, a returning player, have no say to.\n\nFifth : Now this makes sense I guess, I was speaking put of my anger. And about the Agent banning me for being under assumption of hacking, it would be stupid for me to send a ticket if I knew my account was under illegal activity would it not? It's like going to the police and telling them I might have killed someone are you able to help me hide the body? or something like that.\n\nSixth : Thank you for answering one of the things I never thought I'd get an answer for. You're actually a champ. \n\nThank you again, for a lengthy reply which HAS help me better understand the situation. You're the best riot team member I've talked to so far (i'm assuming you are). If there is any extra information you need for me to get my account back (somehow, i won't get my hopes up) please let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-13T05:06:25.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll pass on what I can and clarify a few things as well :)\n\nAs to number the fourth, I don't mean to justify what happened to your account, merely to explain the technicalities about accounts and responsibilities. Riot's policy is to give the account back in the case of compromise like this (exceptions would be if say, an account kept getting compromised over and over), just something happened with yours that meant it wasn't.\n\nI am not in fact a Riot team member, only a volunteer here on boards, specifically an Emissary specialising in Player Behaviour. Riot team members always have the Red name and the Riot fist icon on the boards. any other colour name that isn't normal is either a volunteer (green, blue, yellow) or a Distinguished Member (purple) and have no real power. We can make recommendations and pass things on, but that's about it.\nMore about the Emissaries here: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Edu7E6Bp-introducing-the-emissaries\n\nAs for your issue in particular, I'm gonna have to ask you for some patience. As I said we can pass things on, but obviously our contacts are busy with their own stuff so it can take a while for them to take a look at our requests. \n\nI'll get back to you as soon as I can.","replies":[{"poster":"A K A S H l","date":"2017-05-13T09:26:26.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be good thank you :) Hopefully they are able to see things in my prespective. I understand that my account had caused unfair gameplay for other players, though it will still take awhile for me to just accept that my account is banned and I'm just left here in the dark. But thanks to you i'm able to have a better understanding at why they did that. Before I was acting in anger wondering why I got banned for something I didn't even do. It was like getting backstabbed twice, getting hacked then immediately getting banned cause the person who hacked me was hacking felt super unfair as a loyal player. \n\nIs there some sort of double authenticator available for League? If not I think it would be good to add that in since other popular companies have implemented it. But good on riot for finding and making the 'Emissaries', I think it's a good way to help players. You've really helped alot. \n\nThank you once more, I'll look forward to hearing from you again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-13T09:55:08.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two factor authentication is one of those Soon (TM) features.

Then I try to log in on Sunday and it says my account's perma-banned. wut?\n\nSo then I check the email address for my account, and lo, it is not the one I used, instead some sketchy-looking address (***qna@163.com). Doesn't look too good. One of the odd things is that this hacker didn't actually play any games (checked my match history online), so maybe he used hacks on the client to get the account banned?\n\nThe most confusing thing of all, though, is that the email I was using was not mine, it was my brother's (this being because I did not have a personal email four or five years ago). And to change the email address, you have to have access to the old address as well. So the hacker would have had access to my brother's email address AND my account's username/password. Not the same passwords either.\n\nI've sent a ticket to riot support, but I suppose I shouldn't expect them to have replied in 24 hours.
