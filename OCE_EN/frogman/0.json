I&#039;m a very friendly person, but can also play seriously and take criticism (as long as its constructive). Would prefer someone with voice comms (discord, curse, skype, whatever). My best support champs are Bard, Thresh, Janna and Nami, but can also play Rakan, Soraka, Blitz, Braum and Leona :)\n\nAdd me ingame as I probably won't remember to check back here.","replies":[]}
