Any information that is unique to the account *but not visible on it* in any way is useful in determining original ownership. The closer the information is to the accounts creation date (i.e the older it is) the better.\n\nSo for example, if you know you purchased x skin the day it came out x years ago, that's helpful information. A list of skins you own (which is something a lot of people actually send in) **is not helpful**, because anyone with access to the account can see that and it is therefore useless for identifying you as the original owner.\n\nOther things you can add that would be helpful:\n\n1. Any RP purchase receipts you still have (that are from well before the compromise) \n2. Any particular IP purchases you remember making (for example if you bought x champ(s) at their 7800 release price instead of the 6300)\n3. Any relevant dates that would be trackable like if you have a screenshot of the first time you hit Honour 5 or Mastery 7 on a champion, or Gold etc, etc.","replies":[]}]}
