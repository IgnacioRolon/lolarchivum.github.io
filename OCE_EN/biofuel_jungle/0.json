Sometimes it will go back down and it will be fine for a time, or the game will lag out and I am forced to attempt to reconnect.\n\nThe only issues I have with this are ; #1 my internet is working properly when I go to open my browser ; #2 This is one of the reasons why I keep getting queue timed out for 20minsx5 ; #3 I am forced to either restart the client (which does not always solve the problem) or restart my computer (which causes my account to incur a queue time out(etc).)\n\nI would love to hear why this might be happening. I am well and truly, f*cking over this.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-11-24T17:36:33.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Velvet Vanity IV,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
