Therefore due to the changes in regards to Last Whisper thresh gets gimped pretty hard compared to any other champion and it really makes me wonder if they thought about him when they did these changes.\r\n\r\nTldr: All of thresh&#039;s armour gets reduced by last whisper everyone elses is just bonus armour.  {{champion:412}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-11T08:15:41.857+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Meh Thresh is OP anyway, no harm done.","replies":[{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2015-11-11T08:22:01.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen you ingame before 0.o","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-11T10:13:46.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure that wasnt my in-game doppelganger FioraTheExplora?\n\nSorry I can't say your name rings a bell.","replies":[{"poster":"The Beauner","date":"2015-11-11T22:38:43.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also have a friend called FedoraTheExplorer","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"GreenLightn1ng","date":"2015-11-11T09:15:53.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about that thresh doesn't get the melee execute when using targons, but also can't use runaanes?

And I've played Thresh a LOT this season so I'm not just saying this because I played like trash one game (I didn't, we still won the game but so many hooks fell short and I feel like a week ago they definitely would have hit)","replies":[]},{"poster":"P0Ps","date":"2015-11-11T07:32:55.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well dayum, rip my main {{champion:412}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
