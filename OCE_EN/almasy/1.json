In fact really, unless it's a kill that's guaranteed and easy to leave for them, don't worry about trying to leave it, and if you get it you get it. Your ADC should know their limits, and while you shouldn't be stealing kills from them, if they are out of range or in a bad position, securing that kill is your best option. \n\nUnfortunately though, you will face ADCs who don't know their limits and who will think they can get a kill when they cant, or who don't realise their support isn't in a position to leave a kill for them. Of course this is only really a bad thing if they then abuse you for it, you have to learn somehow. Assists are still worth quite a bit, and if you are in a position to make such a decision, it usually means the ADC is out of position for the kill, and you are better off taking it. Better an assist for them than nothing at all.\n\nEvery support makes a mistake and steals an easy kill to give every now and again, but most ADCs in my experience will be pretty ok with it so long as you apologise for that sort of thing. Another good way to stave off their frustration when you do choose to take a kill, is to say something like \"Sorry but I wasn't sure you'd be able to get it\". Usually any who are a little frustrated will be ok with the fact that you acknowledge the action and what it meant, and any who still take offence are generally mute worthy anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T09:20:07.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i say sorry alot.... support or not = .=\ndon't know why...","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-11T09:52:17.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Helps stop people getting frustrated :) It's a good practice even if it isn't always necessary/relevant.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T10:08:18.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"which reminded me of a joke\n\nSon: Dad! i wanna marry this girl!\nDad: ...... say sorry\nSon: Dad?\nDad: ...... apologise\nSon: Why?!\nDad: just say sorry\nSon: No! what did i do wrong?\nDad: don't worry about that, just apologise\nSon: ..... ok, i am sorry...\nDad: good, now you have learned and prepared to be a good husband","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T04:03:48.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Icarus1314,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jKEm8b1y,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-11T01:34:46.535+0000)\n>\n> since the topic of this thread is about support\n> one question that's been in my head for a while now, if you could answer that's would be great\n> coz i play support alot, and i have encounter a problem many times\n> \n> for example, during a lane fight at early stage\n> after my ADC takes down one enemy and the other one trys to run with minimal hp\n> my adc is clearly outside atking range, and i know i can kill the enemy\n> for a few time i took the kill and got called KSer, \"your job is to support me not KS me noob!\"\n> and for a few time where i decided no to take the kill, and was asked why i let enemy escape\n> so i am confused...\n> \n> should i as a support, \n> ignore the fact that my ADC might or might not have the ability to take down this running enemy\n> (with his/her ult or other means)\n> and make the kill myself when i feel necessary just to be sure?\n> as a support, do i have the rights to make decision like such?\n\nIf you're worried that the enemy will escape then go ahead and make sure they die. Sometimes you'll make the wrong judgement and your ADC could have gotten the kill, but it's better to be safe than sorry and your knowledge of limits/potential will increase as you play more. If you get flamed then ignore them and mute if you need to.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-11T09:17:53.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"will do~\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-02-11T01:48:28.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Icarus1314,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=jKEm8b1y,comment-id=00040000000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-11T01:34:46.535+0000)\n>\n>\n> as a support, do i have the rights to make decision like such?\n\nYes.

If you are playing Braum and have a dominant early then you may want to be a bit in front and off to one side to hit the q poke or set up for the stun. If you are playing Soraka then you likely want to play a bit behind your adc and sustain off pots in the early rather than your q if they are dominant or if you are really squishy. \n\nIt kinda comes down to playstyle here, but having a very good understanding of that parallel line is important, regardless of where you choose to sit relative to it. I tend to play aggressive supports like Nami so I'm usually sitting a bit in front of my ADC, but I've mained support for a long time and have a pretty good understanding of how strong I am vs how strong they are and where I can or can't get out if I have to.
