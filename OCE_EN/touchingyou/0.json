But what&#039;s going on with bot games atm\r\nSure getting boosting bots happen sometimes 1 maybe 2, but surely not 4 after 4 after 4 =/ maybe im just unlucky. Ok fine 4 bots thats fine i can deal with that, but when you get the real AI bots tower diving on you (ryze is a boss for this) cant do anything so its loss time. \r\n\r\nSo tell me reporting boosters clearly does nuffin all im doing is wasting 40-50 mins of my time or having to quit and face a timeout for leaving to meny games. \r\n\r\nOtherwise carry on fun times and all that","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-10-28T04:42:44.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">So tell me reporting boosters clearly does nuffin all im doing is wasting 40-50 mins of my time or having to quit and face a timeout for leaving to meny games.\n\nThey do get banned, however the bans will not go out immediately as 3rd party bans go out in waves. 3rd party bans are always investigated to double check that the permaban could be deserving, after all, quite a few new players do play like bots. \n\nThe problem is, that even after all these bot accounts are banned, heaps more pop up to take their place because the market for level 30 accounts still exists.

If you play yasou or some big hyper carry it's not actually that hard to carry the 4 feeder scripts against the 5 intermediate bots.
