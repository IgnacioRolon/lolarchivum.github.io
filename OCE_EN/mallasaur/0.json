Why did i get permabanned is the only question i want to ask. i dont recall doing anything that breaches the summoners code and that could give me such a harsh punishment. My mach history is free of leaves and i generally tend not to swear in games. so i want to know **why i have been banned in the 3 years i have been playing this game?\nAny helpful comment will be greatly apprieciated**","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-03T09:33:37.852+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possible that you've been framed, if you have no recollection of breaking the code/EULA and are completely aware and understand both (remember, you can't even use proxies to play League). Nevertheless the best course of action for you to take is to send Riot an e-mail about this. If you don't know the exact address/were never given one, [submitting a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) will do.","replies":[{"poster":"mallasaur","date":"2015-06-03T10:28:40.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for you help. I sent a report to explain that I had nothing to do with the banning of my account. I try to be the best player i can be and to see me get permabanned without an explaination or other less harsh punishments really makes me lose faith in the tribunal. How long do u think they will take to answer? Another thing I want to know is that do you know of any incidents like mine resulting in them getting back their account. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-04T11:20:14.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">lose faith in the tribunal\n\nThat's a pretty hard thing to do, considering that there *is* no Tribunal.\n\nWhen they're not busy, they get back to you within the day. When they *are* busy, they can take up to a week. If they take longer than that, then they've probably forgotten about you. You think that making another ticket would help but apparently that just makes it worse.\n\nAnd they're busy the majority of the time. Just make sure you at least get the confirmation e-mail saying that your request has been filed.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I haven't seen a situation like this before. **But** I did just see someone else make a discussion just like yours. You might want to monitor [that discussion](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/vXlvtHtb-im-sure-i-got-banned-from-leavebuster-while-i-was-in-full-game).\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
