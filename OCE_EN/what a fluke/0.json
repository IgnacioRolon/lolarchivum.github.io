By the end of champ select when the timer runs out, a message pops up on my screen saying &#039;there was a problem in selecting your champion. Please try again&#039;. Also sometimes it says &#039;Trying to reconnect&#039;  and that also goes on till the champ select timer run out. I have been put into low priority queue twice because of these problem now. I have tried re-downloading my client, but that didn&#039;t help at all, instead got me stuck on the MSI invitational loading screen. If any knows how to fix these problems please comment it below.","replies":[{"poster":"what a fluke","date":"2017-05-10T05:38:33.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still experiencing the 'Trying to Reconnect' issue, but that's most happening on the loading screen after champ select now. I am also now having random disconnections and  login problems, that even after I have restarted my computer multiple times it still wont let me login. I have tried the D.N.S and firewall troubleshooting options before I posted this, but I had to change my D.N.S option back to auto connect because of issues. I can't have a wired connection because there is no plug for the router where my PC setup is located but I will try to play league another computer which is located closer to the router and see the game run better. I also can't open ports for my router because only my dad knows the username and password for to login. I am not using any V.P.N or Proxy connections.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-10T04:49:59.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?\n\nSounds to me to be connection related, could you please run through the \"[Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues)\" support article for me and let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]}]}
