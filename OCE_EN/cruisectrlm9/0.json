Just to get back in touch with nostalgia and for the sake of variety..\r\n\r\nOr why not open Dominion up for play on alternating weekends instead of TT?\r\n\r\nFeel like its just grinding away at ARAM and SR. I enjoyed the variety of maps and game types when I was on the NA server (but obviously not keen to trade off all the champs/skins and the extra 150+ms latency)\r\n\r\nAnyone else keen, or what does Riot think??","replies":[{"poster":"Sw4g3ttiYoL0n4yz","date":"2015-03-25T05:06:12.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't like those maps 'instead' of the alternating TT we have now, but if they just had them occasionally available I'd love to jump in and play a game to break up the monotony.","replies":[]}]}
