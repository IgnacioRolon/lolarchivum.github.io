Losing LP when you lose a 4v5 is a slap to the face of anyone trying to climb. The game already recolonizes that a player has gone afk in the post game by red texting their name. So the game CAN recognize a 4v5. It is not fair for players to be punished for not being able to play a fair matchup.    Cant riot implement a LP loss discount or even LP loss waiver for a an unfair match.","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-11-23T22:30:37.766+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't want to lose LP if you lose a 4v5 you have to be willing to not gain any if you win a 5v4. The system as it is works, your teammates will leave just as much as theirs, if your teammates are leaving a lot more than the enemies chances are it is something you are doing as that is the only difference between the two teams, you are on one, and not on the other.\n\nThe same applies to trolls... Technically if you count everyone as a blank face, and assume you will neither disconnect nor troll, the enemy team will statistically have a higher amount of games with leaves and trolls... again though that assumes that you yourself are not the cause of them trolling or leaving.\n\nNot all games will be fair, but if you are really struggling to regain 1 games worth of LP you are in a good and fair mmr for yourself skillwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IlCosmolI","date":"2015-11-23T17:29:16.574+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think about how easily that could be abused.","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2015-11-23T18:26:22.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i know it is abusable.

These scum not only lose the game but they usually cause the rest of the team to lose. It shouldnt matter what sort of game it is, someone going afk/quitting any game really sucks.","replies":[]}]}
