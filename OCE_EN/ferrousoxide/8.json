Tanks/Bruisers are supposed to be the counters to mages. No one whose kit revolves around 'burst' should be able to fight Tanks. \n\nAP champs that can fight tanks with success (but often need peel) are: \n{{champion:136}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:69}} {{champion:10}} {{champion:13}} \nBecause those champs  have less burst than other mid laners, but have lots of sustained damage, they are like the ADC's of the AP world. \nIf every mage could take on a tank, the above champions would have little/no purpose in the game. \n\nIts true that mages have less defensive items available to them \n(limited mostly to {{item:3157}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3102}}) , BUT unlike assassins and fighters, most mages can stay at arms length in a fight (Xerath, Lux, Vel'Koz, Azir etc etc.) and so it would be unfair to give them the same number of defences available to people who actually need to be in the middle of the fight. \n\nAs for counter-defences, because it is the mage's job to kill the squishy targets (ADC, Support, Assassin, other mages.), and those targets don't build many defensive items, it becomes more important to build straight damage items like ludens, instead of having lots of magic pen, which explains the lack of anti-tank items for mages.\n\n______\n\nWhat I think the problem is, is the fact that AD champions don't have to adjust their build path situationally much at all.\nAlmost all of their items give them all the stats they need for most situations, (they have the same build wether they want to burst a squishy, or cut down a tank):\n\n{{item:3156}} gives AD, MR, CDR, plus Lifetsteal, Spellvamp, and a shield.\n\n{{item:3814}} gives, AD, MR, Lethality, movement speed, and a spell shield.\n\n{{item:3147}} gives, AD, Lethality, movement speed, and vision denial.\n\n{{item:3071}} gives, AD, HP, CDR, movement speed, and armour pen.\n\netc etc \n\nLiterally all of those items gives Offence stats, Defensive stats, and counter-defencive stats.\nand Almost all of those items are key items in the NORMAL build path for assassins and fighters, meaning that without even trying, they have all the offencive, defensive and counter defensive items they need. \n\nWhile mages have to greatly change their build to fit the situation. \nFor example, how many mages usually rush Zhonyas? not very many at all (maybe only like like Lissandra, or Morgana?), its stats aren't particularly good, its active is really the only reason anyone ever buys it!  But when vs a Zed or other assassin, it becomes a necessity to buy it early, regardless of what its stats are.\nThis means that the mage has to delay buying items that give them their power (Like RoA, Ludens, or Rylais), just for some essential-but-not-so-great defensive stats.\nMeanwhile, Zed or the other assassin, builds Maw as one of their key items anyway, so they don't have to sacrifice any power spike to get their defensive stats.\n\nIf a mage finds themselves against a heavy MR team, they have to take away a big power item like Deathcap or Ludens, just so they can get a Void staff. \nBut AD champs don't have to sacrifice anything, as 99% of their items give them lethality anyway. \n\nThis is where I think the real problem lies, Jack-of-all-trade items are not good for this game, they nerfed Rylais for that very reason. \nNo matter who you are, you should be have to build appropriately according to the situation. ADC's have to do it, So do supports and Mages. I don see why Assassins and fighters shouldn't have to.\n\nIm not a gameplay designer so i don't fully understand all the complexities of the game, but I do think that building situationally, is an art that is lost on some AD classes. \n\nAnyway, thats my 2 cents. xD","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-23T05:07:50.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think thats a better way of summing up what i was getting at.

Especially the difference between the Last Whisper family and Void staff. Last Whisper and upgrades are useless against targets without any bonus armor, while Void Staff is shredding 35% regardless of the target having any bonus magic resist, making it always useful.\nAlso champions base defensive stats, Armor varies from:\n16 - 31 @ lvl 1\nto \n65 - 105 @ lvl 18 (excluding Thresh)\nwhile Magic resist varies from:\n30 - 34 @ lvl 1\nto\n30 - 55 @ lvl 18\n\nChampions scale into the game with more armor than magic resist, meaning AD damage needs more armor pen to stay relevant.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sha4o4","date":"2016-12-22T17:49:06.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG OMG i was thinking the same today\n\n\nwhen there is fkin tank, Ad can kill but ap can't\n\n\nFor Ad champ like zed{{champion:238}} {{champion:91}}  and more they can build these items to defend+attack{{item:3139}} {{item:3156}} {{item:3814}}     \n\nBut for Ap champs we only have 1 option to defend {{item:3157}} \n\nNot no mention Ad champs even build {{item:3026}}  Where as this Item is useless on AP champion \n\nRIOT always care for money and not for details","replies":[]}]}
