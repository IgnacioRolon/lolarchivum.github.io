Just like they're screwing over Lucians ult so it does Nil damage again, mages time will come and they'll buff them in some way..

The deathfire's touch mastery buffed alot of mages, brand, malzahar, maybe your just playing the wrong ones. and whilst i agree that yas reigns supreme, i can still nuke zed to kingdom come with Annie. but yas is definitely unstoppable once he gets going.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-23T19:57:36.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They didn't 'completely crap' on mages there just saying don't burn all your mana at once or you'll suffer.\nbesides why would they delete mages its the most strongest class in the game only struggle is early game.(removing mana pots only made this game more skillful.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-23T18:19:56.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"They completely crapped on Mages this patch and they're only really decent late game.\n\nYou can still succeed but the whole Fiora top every game (still) is pretty sad. Horribly inbalanced top laners, very few viable picks and it's basically league of ADCs.\n\nRiot will never do anything because you just have to pick the other OPs and deal with them and they call it \"counterplay\" when its really just counterpicking with a tiny bit of counterplay and there is a tiny window of opportunity for counterplay when dealing with the OPs and when it comes to mid laners basically anything goes because they're glorified supports and occasionally carries.\n\nJust main Assassins for a while.","replies":[]}]}
