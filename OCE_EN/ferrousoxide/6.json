If i am your support and i have a Relic sheild/Face of the Mountin. \r\nPlease stop obsessively taking all the farm. Especially mid game when you can clear waves so fast i dont even see a trickly of gold. \r\nLet your relic sheild bearing support use their charges, else you will end up with a teammate late game who has no useful gear at all.\r\nOk? thanks. \r\nPs, also in this case DONT ABUSE ME FOR USING MY CHARGES I AM NOT TAKING YOUR GOLD IM GIVING GOLD TO BOTH OF US.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-21T13:18:25.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree with you that this can be annoying there are a few things that you can do to help with this.\n\nThe first thing to keep in mind is communication, a lot of the time during the mid to late game there are a lot of things that players need to be focusing on, the minimap, rotations, movement of their champion and etc. When you go to proc your relic shield think of ways that you can make it easier for your team to remember how important it is for you to get those few CS. Usually what I like to do when I get a relic shield in game at the very start I will tell my team that if I use the on my way ping on a minion it means that I want to proc targon's on it. With it being done this way they have both a visual and a verbal reminder in a way to let me last hit minions.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is how you react when you don't get to proc the charges. Sometimes players just forget that the item is in the game or don't notice that you have the charges. When this happens make sure that you don't get mad at them in chat for not letting you proc your targon's, think of how that effects the player you are talking to. This goes into a bit about user experience about how a player who receives a kind note to next time let you proc your targon's is more likely to let you give it to you compared to if you get mad at them and tell them straight up what they should be doing.\n\nAt the end of the day communication is key but another thing to keep in mind is possibly swapping out the item in the mid game once you get up to the second stage of the item (Targon's Brace). What some players will do is they will save up the money and then sell their Targon's and either build into Spell Thief's or Talisman of Ascension. This can be done for many reasons such as the active of the item or just wanting to get more gold income from the passive.\n\nI hope that this helps in your games and if you find out a strategy to effectively remind your teammates to let you proc targon's such as pinging let me know what you find out! Good luck in your games and I will see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-21T05:29:06.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah supports who use Relic Shield variants do run into problems with income in mid game or so (unless winning hard already which in that case it doesn't matter) since most peeps could clear the entire wave with a couple of strikes, and often from afar and the minions are downed before you are even close enough to land a single attack.\n\nIt would be nice if people could see the charges and go \"oh, I'll let them get the gold as well\". But most peeps are too busy trying to get the \"+gold\" comes up their screen.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-21T05:52:09.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as a support main I find, when this happens it's best to just run straight for the caster and cannon minions because often the melee minions will be cleared first and way before you can finish your auto attack animation. You'll generally be able to get at least the cannon and maybe 1-2 casters.","replies":[{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-21T06:35:03.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is that, but even then a Draven axe juggling or a vayne with 1-2 kills will take out a cannon minion if you're just a little slow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vegathron","date":"2016-12-21T04:11:12.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree but on the flip side if you buy a F***ing relic shield (particularly YOU thresh) A) use the fking stacks and dont bait me into missing seige minions because i see you have a stack but your autistic.
