So i was ahead in mid, 3/0 Lux swaped lanes with the mf so she could solo lane,(the whole team was accommodating to her little spat( having a level on the syndra(i was bulling the fuck otu of her keeping her under leveled) she proceeded to die and then go on full tilt, Raging at the team, death threats racist remarks, the whole 9 trolling yards. She fed intentionally after that and we lost the game...\r\nPlease Tell me that a whole team reporting a player gets them banned because this player dose not, should not, be in ranked play.","replies":[{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-12-14T22:01:25.249+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure how many reports you need to ban someone, but the only way to get someone banned is enough people reporting the same person, doesn't need to be in the same game. So if it didn't get her in trouble (probably did) that would mean she is much closer to getting a ban now because of your team, and if she continues toxic and more people report her, she will be in trouble. I believe that if you're the last person to report someone and they get in trouble (a mute, ban, or just a warning) you get a email from Riot too!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T23:03:10.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to clarify really quickly, in the case of verbal toxicity and super obvious intentional feeding, [one report is enough](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/dBcmRkNo-why-the-reportingban-system-will-never-be-fair?comment=0002).\n\nBut [Riot is suspiciously unclear](http://pages.citebite.com/q5t6e1n8x5mku) on anything manually reviewed, which leads me to believe that you may be correct in those cases.
