One such individual had apparently been in 3 games prior and trolled the same according to a team mate how had played with and against him in previous auto matches. Why was he not banned after the second time. I understand one games reports are not worth a ban but 2 games in a row in provisional ranked? This last individual declared his intention &quot;Orubi: fuk you ferrous, dont order me around you stupid b itch....if i say i will troll this game, I WILL&quot; before the game even started. that quote was in response to me asking him not to troll.\r\nNot only does this hurt my and the other 3 people on our teams final rank it damages the game experience.  I wish riot would take a much more aggressive stand on trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"i dont troll","date":"2016-01-22T02:19:05.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I get called a troll a lot...
