If i wanted to adc i would of cued for adc. I would not mind waiting 10 more minuets for a game if i could get the role i wanted, It should be an option. I am sick of losing games because I&#039;m forced into roles I&#039;m not good at and cant contribute to the game to my full potential. I just want to get out of god dammed bronze and if it want for the fact that 50% of my game i am playing a role that is not optimal for me i would have a higher than 50% win loss ratio.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-03T21:27:21.981+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is it's not just \"10 more minutes\". In some cases you will be waiting upwards of 2 hours without auto-fill (depending on your role). For example, [this guy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/Jzgc3iUW-i-watched-the-entire-avengers-movie-in-the-time-i-waited-in-the-ranked-que) in Bronze who watched the entire Avengers movie in queue.\n\nYou're lucky though since Sona and Lux are two of your mains. Both these champions transition really easily into support. \n\nIf you get auto-filled into ADC, chances are someone else got auto-filled into support and is willing to trade. Let people know you're terrible at ADC and see if you can trade :D","replies":[{"poster":"NoMoreChillies","date":"2016-12-04T00:37:37.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tele,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=QXUBAHvw,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-03T21:27:21.981+0000)\n>\n> \n> If you get auto-filled into ADC, chances are someone else got auto-filled into support and is willing to trade.

Why are they queuing for roles at all? Neither guy gets the role he queue for....","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-04T01:35:54.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what you're trying to say? They queue for roles because there is still a good chance they'll get the role they want.\n\nIn that particular case it didn't happen, but a good majority of his games are on his preferred roles. For example, in his last 20 ranked games **FerrousOxide** got mid or jungle 15 times.\n\nThat doesn't mean auto-fill is great either BTW, but that's a whole other discussion ;)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
