And not a lot of poeple know how to Jungle since the new season changes and are afraid to mess up a route or just ignore one. Mid has always been popular because there are a lot of Faker wannabes. Top lane is where tanks and bruisers are and we all know what Meta we are in now, so poeple are looking to abuse that fact for free wins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-25T03:06:08.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen, I think there are two main reasons.\n\n1. They are they only true 1v1 lanes, and so when you get a kill or take a tower, or get more CS, people get and like that feeling of \"I am better than this person\" \"My skill is superior\" \"I am the alpha.\" Which are all primal instincts. But when you're in bot lane, you get 2 kills and you think \"Yes! i am the greatest... but only because my blitz is god...\" Mid lane and Top lane attract people who don't like to share the glory. \n\n2. Quite simply, most of the fun champions are mid or Top champs. Look at Zed. Yasuo, Ahri, Azir, Leblanc, Camille, etc etc. \nAlmost all of the 'Solo playmaking' champs are top or mid, Bot has some fun champs, like Kalista and Vayne. But they aren't as fun for most because (especially with Kalista) they are two-man champions, so you look and feel awesome but there is that nagging thought that \"its only half me.\". Look at the supports as well, Leona makes awesome plays, but cant do anything about it by herself. \nUnlike most mid's, all the ADC's are pretty much the same, Sivir, Jhin, Ashe, Varus, etc. as different as they all are they all basically work around the same formula \"stand there, auto attack, and pray you have more damage than the enemy.\" While Mid laners have so many different variations of how to kill the enemy Azir's playstule is totally different to Talons etc. Yasuo's is so different to Galio's.\n\nThats what I reckon the main reasons are.","replies":[]}]}
