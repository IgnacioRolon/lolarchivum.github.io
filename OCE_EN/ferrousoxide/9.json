Lux Ahri and Annie are my main picks. I just want some tips on facing Yasuo. His Mobility is insane, able to close distance or evade any skill shot as long as there is a minion wave. His Damage output is very high and his reach is very good for a &quot;melee&quot; champion. Then there is that damned wind wall it blocks everything and can also be used to deny you farm. If that isn&#039;t bad enough the fact he doesn&#039;t need mana give him much more sustain than a mana dependent mid lane. On top of that his Passive shield makes trading with him always difficult. \r\nDoes he even have a weakness?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-04T22:35:32.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have any trouble as Annie. Just AA his shield and stun him with W if he tries to harass then just walk to a safe distance and keep AAing while the minions crush him. After 6 he'll just die if he goes in so you can pressure him as long as you're watching the map for others interfering. Keep AAing and Q if you can until he's under 70% hp with no shield then just all in. Late game, unless he's tank or has at least 2 MR items, he won't be able to go near you because you'll just kill him instantly, even if his shield is up. You can just dominate him.\n\nWith Lux just play safe and farm as much as you can. He can't kill you since you have your W, a lot of CC and probably Heal or Barrier. When you try to combo him, if you catch him with your snare then try and position your E so it won't hit the wall but will still be in range of him (takes practice but is possible) then blow him up. Never go super aggressive unless you're just so far ahead that it doesn't even matter.\n\nAhri vs Yas is more of a skill-related matchup. You need to position so that your Q hits both minions and him, and you need to make sure you maximise your mana efficiency. Don't Charm unless he either has no wall or you can see where he's going to dash to, or you're baiting him. When he puts his wall down just kite away and re-engage and nuke him once it's down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hexadus","date":"2016-02-07T07:57:33.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Break his Shield with AA > When he Qs minions - harass and make sure you don't miss too many minions while doing it.  \n\nAnnie - Some of the longest Autos in game - Her harass is difficult to dodge since her Q is point and click; Levels 1-6 Just harass, ward, and Dodge his Tornado of death. Bait out his wind wall with a Q or W and trade when it's down. You can win against him. Get Boots early if you find his Tornado too difficult to dodge. Also, don't stray too close to your minions because when he wants to all-in you at around level 3-4, he can dash to your minions to get to you.\n\nLux - Poke him with Autos - Harass him, your spells outrange him completely. Dodge his skillshots, have a friend in a custom game play Yasuo, and you just practice dodge his skillshot.  That'll help you learn it's pathing/hitbox and the way the player thinks and you'll begin picking up queues on when he will try to use it on you or the wave.\n\nAhri - Level 6 can downright kill him.  Auto his shield away, bait out windwall with W or whatever, then E>Q his ass. :P You have built in sustain and true damage in your kit. You can win against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-02-05T10:23:35.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You pick malphite mid\n\nonly champ that can rekt yasuo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyahs huge","date":"2016-02-04T22:58:53.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly seeing as just about any champ can buy it, i'd get a randiuns","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-04T20:40:18.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Having a Yasuo come after you is like being bitten by a brown snake, theres only 1 thing you can do!\n\nHopefully you are wearing a belt! \nif you are you need to take it off, \nundo your trousers, \ndrop them around your ankles,\nbend over slowly,\nand kiss your ass goodbye, \nbecause theres nothing on god's good earth that can save you now.\n\nIn all seriousness he is supposed to have a weak laning phase (but take it from a former Yasuo main) that is utter BS!\nYasuo has a strong as laning phase. \n\nYasuo was my favourite champ but now everyone plays him in every game and i just didn't like being one of them and having a mirror lane every couple of games.\n\ntry and get an aa off on him while his shield is up, then go on him when its down, trying to fight when there aren't any minions around is the best thing, not only can he not use his dash to dodge everything, but he also has less opportunity to proc his Q.\nHaving a good knowledge of what goes through the wall and what doesn't can be a great help, for example Xerath's Q goes through the wall, but I've had Yasuo's try and wind wall it anyway which means its down when i go in for my stun, someone like Azir's Q is blocked by the wall, but the soldier doesnt disappear, it stays even after being stopped by the wall, use these little things to your advantage.","replies":[]}]}
