You harass and engage and they follow up time and time again, you win lane.

Your map awareness should be ok and your trades should be good too if you're an aggressive support. From playing adc I improved my positioning, peel, engage timing and if when it is possible to make a kill or when its best to retreat.\n\nI used to think support was a thankless position but now i know I was just a poor support. I have improved but there is always room for more improvement.  \n\nI hope you reach the level of skill that shows the impact of a good support in the game.

You want Health > CDR > Armor/MR\n\n^ This\n\nThe answer to my question was (in the current meta, of course):\n\n1) Provide vision control for your team. All supports should get a sightstone, but not only that, a **sweeping lens**. This is your main job, to deny the enemy vision, and provide it for your team. You just learnt something that you didn't know in three years of playing the game.\n\n2) Peeling for your carries. This doesn't mean doing damage. You are not the carry, you are the support. Items that have actives can be purchased to do all kinda of peeling/shielding/crowd controlling the enemies. Only if they game is going very late and support finally get some gold to play with, can they think about buying damage items, and even then you don't give up your ability to peel. For example  a support may choose to build an AP item like a deathcap, or they can buy a vision ward for the 6th item slot. That vision ward could make or break the game.\n\nIf bronze noobs go all AD, its unlucky, but still, remember your **role**. One thing that annoys me when i am ADC is supports constantly engaging in stupid fights. For example a thresh who would land every hook and then go in on their Q and die, then blame the ADC for not following up. There is a time to fight and a time to be patient while the ADC farms. As a support you should be thinking \"what does the ADC need right now?\". Harassing the enemies is the lowest priority of the support player. A good idea in bronze is to ping your attack on the enemies and then see what the ADC thinks. Or type to them \"we should do this, or this...\". Bronze have limited map awareness, so pings are very useful, even in the direct lane.\n\nGood Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2016-02-10T00:01:49.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you buying the eye of the equinox and not face of the mountain. you sacrifice cdr early and an active component of peeling for your adc?","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2016-02-10T02:43:03.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Typhon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EHoEtFWo,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-02-10T00:01:49.278+0000)\n>\n> Why are you buying the eye of the equinox and not face of the mountain. you sacrifice cdr early and an active component of peeling for your adc?\n\nBecause its gold efficient and gives me an extra slot to buy more tank stats so that i can peel for my adc. Are you looking at the game that our team was so far ahead and won in 20 minutes or the one where the opposition had 4 AP champions and I needed to be a frontline with the Poppy?
