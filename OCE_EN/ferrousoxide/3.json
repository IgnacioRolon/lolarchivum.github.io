This includes communicating where he is, warding often, and target focus in fights.

The CD is also rather to very long in terms of normal spells because it's nearly 20 seconds long at skill-lvl1 and nearly 15 seconds long at skill-lvl5 when no CDR. The fact the vast majority of this champion's strength is built entirely in that skill alone and that it has a rather long CD, this actually makes him very counter-able rather than the opposite. He also has no CC of their own, nor does he have a reliable escapes (and he has NO escapes prior to lvl6) and his own saving-grace also stuns himself and it's on a ridiculous CD for a normal spell, being constant 35 seconds when no CDR.\n\nHe has a hard counterplay called \"team-work\", not kidding, literally any kind of teamwork wrecks this guy. Team coordination destroys him, CC fondles him in the ass, and the notion of not getting enough farms/kills early also completely screw him over later (unless you could make bruiser Yi work, dunno if it's still possible now). Not to mention the counterplay items such as Randuin's Omen, Frozen Heart, Thornmail etc.\n\nThere is a reason why besides the period when a certain or 2 items were broken, or the constant revival of AP Yi in its various incarnations, he's really only a thing in low elo region with only a small handful of them beyond that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-26T09:16:52.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hard cc before he gets to you, snares, stuns and roots, then run like hell or in my case as a supp main i tend to buy randuins and frozen heart to stop him as much as is possible","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-26T09:16:37.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play Lulu press W.","replies":[]}]}
