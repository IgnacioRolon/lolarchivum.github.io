SO far in my placement games this season i have had team mates taking off meta stupid champs, Picking champs to go against their own Counter or just taking stupid shit in stupid roles (like no smite jungle). All i can do i play my best but i can rarely ever win because I&#039;m always trying to carry 2-3 people who i don&#039;t think have the hand eye skills to tie their shoe laces. \nAnd its always laced with them saying, &quot;its cool i strong late game&quot; or &quot;trust me this works&quot; ~NO IT ####### DOESN&#039;T!. PLAY A META CHAMP IN A META ROLE WE ARE IN BRONZE YOU ####~ If you knew better then the high tier players who set the meta you wouldn&#039;t be in bronze you retarded special snow flakes. \nI am not the best player, I am in bronze too. The difference is i know that am I&#039;m striving to improve. I have focused a small group of champions. \nI have accepted i will play against champions who seem broken to me and destroy me, but then I will go study how to win that match up. Hell on this board i have posted about how much i hate Yasuo mid, but you know what? last 3 times he has been counter picked against my Lux I have won the lane, because i studied. \n({{champion:103}} {{champion:99}} Mids, {{champion:113}} {{champion:106}} Jungle {{champion:102}} {{champion:106}}Ifi get autofilled Top {{champion:222}} {{champion:51}} when i get auto filled adc and {{champion:89}} {{champion:37}} when i get autofilled Support.\nAnd am getting pretty competent with all of then. \nBut i can never advance, every time i take a few steps forwards by my own power, I get throw double that back with a team of complete retards who feed, troll, rage quit, or have some sort of anime inspired fauls confidence that they are fated to win some how.\n\nI just want to get out of ELO hell TT-TT\n\nP.S\nAnd you ####### who refused to ff when we are down 2-3 kills to 1 (like 36 to 12) and are knocking on our inhibs get a grip.. If the game was close the score would be close. Just FF and start a new match, preferably not with me.\n\nOk. rant over.\n\np.p.s\nJust came to me. Dear other Bronzies, If you get auto filled to Support, PLAY SUPPORT. Don't play a champ with no utility, don't start with a Dorans. Buy an income item, Get wards don't take CS and ffs don't Go ham for kills and end up feeding. Because a lot of you do, and as some one who take the role seriously when it gets forced on me and some one who isn't a great adc so needs a good support It just hurts your team. PUT THE EGO DOWN for once in your mid of feed toxic lives.","replies":[{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-12-09T08:11:41.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you might have noticed that decent players tend not to flame about their teammates, usually because they sack up and carry","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMoreChillies","date":"2016-12-09T04:09:04.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dodge every autofill game from now on.
