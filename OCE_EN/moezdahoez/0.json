You won't earn loot for the duration of your punishment, be it a temporary suspension or a chat restriction.\n**Signs of reform**. Once your punishment has ended, you'll continue to be restricted from earning loot until you're recognized to have made significant progress in amending your past behavior.\n___\n>**REFORM PERIOD**\nOnce your punishment ends, you'll enter a reform period, during which you'll remain ineligible to earn Hextech Chests and Keys. Ending this reform period requires consistent displays of good sportsmanship. Your reform period isn't over after a specific number of games, or after a certain date, but is completely dependent upon your behavior.\n___\n>**Why can't you tell me exactly when I'm going to be eligible?**\n\n>Eligibility is dependent on a consistent display of good sportsmanship, not just \"be nice in X number of games or days.\" Negative behavior during this reform period will cause it to last longer.\n\nBasically, the better behaviour you demonstrate the faster you will get rewards back, but as long as you don't show negative behaviour you will be well on your way to getting loot back :)\n\nIt's always good to see people recognise their behaviour and take steps to be better, so keep it up!","replies":[{"poster":"MoezDaHoez","date":"2016-09-22T04:23:36.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty, how long do you think i would have to wait before getting loot back?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-20T07:38:11.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back before OCE server existed, my first account (this one was also created on NA server), got permabanned.\nIt wasn't that I was a total dick, I just responded to dicks in a dick way. I accept that, and the ban.\n\nI reformed (mostly), and I tend to behave myself more now (sometimes I cross the line while drinking). I found moving to ARAM only a big help in reducing toxicity, people are far too serious on the rift (even unranked/norms). Die once or twice early and hear about it constantly for the next 20 mins, no thanks. I make great use of mute and block functions, as I suggest all players prone to responding to trolls/dicks should.\n\nI have had no issues (bans etc) for years, and it's great to see other players that once had problems, reform.\n\nGood on you Moe, just mute those dicks and rise above the bullshit. I have faith in humanity still.","replies":[{"poster":"MoezDaHoez","date":"2016-09-22T04:25:17.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, hopefully ill get unbanned from loot quickly and i will mute trolls","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheJukesThough","date":"2016-09-20T07:39:36.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlucky buddy, never be toxic in the first place and you would have never got the 6 month ban, maybe they will forgive u but i really doubt it.
