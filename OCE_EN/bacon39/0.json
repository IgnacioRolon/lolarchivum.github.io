It was to have a fire/ice theme to them, so like a fire rakan and ice xayah. So Rakan&#039;s Gleaming Quill could be like a fireball, his grad entrance could look similar to brand&#039;s Pillar of Flame, his Battle Dance could give a flaming sheild, and The Quickness could have him covered in flames. With Xayah her feathers could be like ice shards and her Deadly Plumage could give her an icy surround.\r\nWith their recall they could look like the photo in the link provided but having them circling.\r\nhttps://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbeamingnotes.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2Fmaxresdefault-2.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fbeamingnotes.com%2F2016%2F08%2F15%2Ffire-and-ice-by-robert-frost-summary%2F&amp;docid=LQDn0CP3DTrlHM&amp;tbnid=S3VAxDg2FL8mOM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwj9-9S4jNDTAhWMxbwKHWe8CbsQMwhHKBIwEg..i&amp;w=1920&amp;h=1080&amp;bih=954&amp;biw","replies":[{"poster":"Rackdos777","date":"2017-07-14T19:35:37.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A more fun idea for a skin, Kitty Cat Xayah and Alpha Cat Rakan. Their ears support the cat theme, but would still have their looks, where they are half human and part animal. Xayah and Rakan \"feathers\" could be yarn. Rakan CC could be a ponce and jump. i'd just like to see paws instead of claws. Xayah could be calico and Rakan could be orange tabby.","replies":[]},{"poster":"starwolf788799","date":"2017-06-22T03:22:25.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there was this cool idea on google called ravenborn xayah and rakan i think that would be pretty dope \n \nxayah -  https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/005/756/901/large/slown-damn-concept.jpg\n\nrakan - https://goo.gl/images/mPXyr4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-02T04:54:16.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rakan's release skin was literally fire...\nAlso nice link to google images with nothing there.","replies":[{"poster":"Bacon39","date":"2017-05-03T05:14:31.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rakans current skin is not like how i was describing, and it was an idea no need for the negative feedback on it. and the photo was of two birds swirling around each other, one made of fire and the other of ice","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-03T07:17:43.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was referring to the fireboy and watergirl image.
