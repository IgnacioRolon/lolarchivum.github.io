The only solution for me is to quit the game and rejoin again which takes 4-5min which is really annoying! It shouldnt be my internet because its around 100ms and fps is about 40-50. It happens in any mode and with any champions and i dont know because i do NOT want to get a leaverbuster due to this and my friends doesnt experience this. plz help.","replies":[{"poster":"Low APM High WPM","date":"2018-08-23T02:48:25.249+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"exact same thing happening to me except my screen just freezes, i can still move my cursor and hear ingame sounds but i cant alt tab or move and the game is just frozen, i have to manually shutdown my laptop and reboot which already takes around 10 minutes. ive already received a leaverbuster for this, very annoying and only started happening after patch 8.16","replies":[{"poster":"Åšteve","date":"2018-08-24T00:02:42.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda hard to explain without boggling you...\nWhat I've found works is : \nCTRL+DEL= Task Manager --> Alt+Tab and close Task Manager.\nIf you have another desktop open *CTRL+Windows+Right/left* switch to that --> right click on Taskbar and open Task Manager --> Force close the league client.. \nThen go back to your first desktop and reconnect to the game\n\nWe'll just have to bear this until *HOPEFULLY* the fix comes \nI'm sorry if you don't understand me...
