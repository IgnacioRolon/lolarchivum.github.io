As you can see, the sales include the mystery gifting, but not the icon as a gift, that's in the actual Lunar Revel.\n\nIt was pretty damn close, though. If you make a support ticket and send it in to Riot, asking nicely, they might give it to you without you having to buy another gift.\n\nBest of luck with it!","replies":[{"poster":"Scholar","date":"2015-02-14T06:33:17.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh ok thank you so much!! :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-14T08:03:14.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tell me of the result!
