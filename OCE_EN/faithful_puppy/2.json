But I really don&#039;t appreciate that I was gifted a champion I don&#039;t want. I only play aram, and I&#039;ve succeeded in only buying champions so far that I enjoy playing in that format, because the randomness and possibility of getting a free-week champ is stressful enough without owning champs I don&#039;t like playing. I was gifted Kayle yesterday, and now I&#039;m probably going to roll her a ton. Since she was a gift, she&#039;s non-refundable, but I don&#039;t want her. Is there a way to have this reversed?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-05T14:00:58.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAs you're unable to use a refund token for this content you'll have to [contact Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new), as they're the only ones who can assist with account specific inquiries.","replies":[{"poster":"Faithful Puppy","date":"2016-11-09T02:23:36.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you.","replies":[]}]}]}
