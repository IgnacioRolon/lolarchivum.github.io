I&#039;ve checked my computer&#039;s tasks and performance, and it&#039;s not using more than 4% processing power outside of League. I don&#039;t have any games, videos, or music playing in the background, in fact no active windows at all. I usually have some lag while playing, as the wifi in my flat is a little unreliable, but this fps problem is new. Is anybody else experiencing it, or should I go talk to the IT crowd?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-26T16:32:12.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">  or should I go talk to the IT crowd?\n\nhave you tried turning it off and on again( lel srry couldnt help myself)","replies":[{"poster":"Faithful Puppy","date":"2015-12-26T22:58:00.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":";) several times!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-26T19:16:16.698+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're having FPS issues, please try the solutions in the Low Framerate (FPS) Troubleshooting article linked below.
