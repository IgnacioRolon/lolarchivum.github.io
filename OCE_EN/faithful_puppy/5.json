It just completely ignored me each time I pressed it. \r\n\r\nHad been working fine all game before that, and the Varus on the other team still had his working at the end. \r\n\r\nI just have no idea why this might have been, and it might pay to have a little look into it? I'm no genius so it may have been something obvious, but I've never seen an ability just completely not respond like that. Usually there is an obvious reason, you know?
