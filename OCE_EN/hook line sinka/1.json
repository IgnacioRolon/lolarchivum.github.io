(i havent put any paragraph seperations yet so its all just one block xD sorry) skins in the story are blood moon yauo, blood moon jhin, blood moon kallista, thresh (default) and taliyah (default) and id also like to thank my friends (if they're reading this) for giving me the confidence to enter this contest!\n\n\nWind, Memories, and an Ink of Blood\n\nNumerous bodies were spread through-out the improvised arena. Among all the dead, one was standing. His red robes blending in with the floor, his sword dripping from his victims. &ldquo;hmph, did those fools really think they could stop me?&rdquo; his voice was deep and unsatisfied. &ldquo;this was not a solo act yasuo, you were merely a puppet, and I was the conductor&rdquo; another figure appeared from the darkness, his gun smoking and his eyes a glowing red. &ldquo;nobody asked you to help me jhin, I could&rsquo;ve managed on my own.&rdquo; Yasuo stared at jhin through his mask. They both held a cold silence before jhin broke it. &ldquo;well, there are performances else-were which I must attend, they&rsquo;re waiting for me.  Ta-ta!&rdquo; jhin waved before disappearing into the darkness. &ldquo;what a fool. I suppose I must return now.&rdquo; yasuo poured a liquid onto the ground before striking it three times which opened a portal and he let himself descend into it before re-appearing at his clan&rsquo;s homeland.\n\n &ldquo;welcome back&rdquo; a mysterious woman adorning a mask with two horns and a sword in her abdomen greeted yasuo as he arrived. &ldquo;Kallista&rdquo; yasuo replied with a neutral voice before walking past her. Yasuo walked through the village to get to one of the clan&rsquo;s elders. &ldquo;a group of men had wished that their souls be taken by our clan&rdquo; the elder turned and looked at him. &ldquo;did they actually offer them to you?&rdquo; yasuo stared back blankly. &ldquo;they attacked me without warning.&rdquo; The elder turned back. &ldquo;well there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about them now. Better their souls go to the blood moon clan rather than have them taken by that damned chain warden.&rdquo; Yasuo clenched his fist &ldquo;he took more of our souls?&rdquo; the elder replied. &ldquo;yes, 5 more than before. Every time we take the kill, he swoops in and steals them. From our reports, he was last seen fighting some little girl, but before we could intervene, a giant wall ripped up from the ground, and he escaped.&rdquo; Yasuo turned and stared into the sky. &lsquo;it can&rsquo;t be&rsquo; he said in his head before turning to the elder.\n\n &ldquo;let me go after him elder. I will rid this clan of his nuisance and take back our rightful souls.&rdquo; The elder turned to him &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not going alone. I&rsquo;m sending jhin with you. Both of you are our best this clan has to offer. Both of you will deal with this immediately.&rdquo; Yasuo leaned in towards the elder. &ldquo;no! I can do this on my own, let me prove myself!&rdquo; the elder looked at the ground and shook his head. &ldquo;yasuo, I know you want to do everything on your own, but you will not fight him alone. This is final.&rdquo; Yasuo turned, grunted and stormed off. He walked to the edge of his homeland where no-one was around and removed his mask. Yasuo stood in the cold night and looked at the red moon. The silence was calming. The winds blowing through the grass eased his soul for a second. He then looked down at his mask and slipped it on again before returning to the village.\n\n When he returned the elder was standing with jhin at the entrance waiting for yasuo&rsquo;s return. &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve located the chain warden. You will go to him with jhin immediately and end this.&rdquo; Jhin stared at yasuo with a smirk under his mask. Yasuo walked up to them both and stared at them. &ldquo;fine. Let&rsquo;s go&rdquo; his voice was stern. They both stood in an empty courtyard and yasuo poured the strange liquid around both himself and jhin and struck at the ground three times as he once did and they both descended into the red portal as the elder channelled a spell to guide where the portal will open.\n\n They both rose out of the ground in a forest and it wasn&rsquo;t long before sharp rocks flew at them and they both dodged it. Yasuo drew his sword and jhin loaded his gun and they scanned the area for where it came from. They quickly found that a battle was occurring between the chain warden and the lady who threw the rocks. Neither her nor the chain warden had noticed yasuo and jhin appearing near-by. They were locked in an intense battle which had obviously been going on for a while due to the amount of damage the trees have taken around them. &ldquo;release those souls, or you&rsquo;ll regret it&rdquo; her voice had lost its threat due to it being a bit shaky as a result from the prolonged battle. &ldquo;HAHAHA, I&rsquo;ve taken thousands of souls, and I haven&rsquo;t regretted it yet! And now there&rsquo;s one more, TO ADD TO MY COLLECTION!&rdquo; the chain warden immediately threw out his hook and yasuo out of instinct jumped in front of the girl and sliced the floor forcing wind to blast out from it creating a gale so strong, it was as hard as a rock. \n\nThe hook was blasted into the air and it returned to the chain warden. &ldquo;ah, I knew the blood moon clan would come after me sooner or later. Are you going to donate your soul to me? Aha how kind of you&rdquo; suddenly a bullet ripped through the air and hit the chain warden in the back &ldquo;ARGH&rdquo; he screamed before turning to see jhin standing elegantly on a tree branch in a bowing position after he shot. &ldquo;the stage is set and the main character is being introduced. WELCOME LADIES AND GENTLEMAN TO THIS ONE TIME ONLY SHOW! However, this one will be particularly&hellip; graphic&hellip;&rdquo; jhin immediately shot again at the chain warden but he dodged it however with his back turned yasuo came up from behind and forced his sword straight through his chest. &ldquo;is that the best&hellip;&rdquo; before he could finish yasuo pushed him off his sword and rocks burst up from underneath the chain warden. Jhin aimed his gun. &ldquo;timing is everything people&rdquo; and shot. A direct hit to the stomach.\n\n While still being in the air yasuo channelled for a moment. &ldquo;this is for the clan&rdquo; he dashed to the warden struck him three times with a devastating blow that sent him crashing to the ground. The warden was finished. With his last breath of air his soul whizzed off into the air along with the other souls he has collected. &ldquo;hmm, it seems we have not seen the last of our chained nemesis. It will make for some good drama.&rdquo; Jhin stared at the souls then looked to yasuo who was looking away from both jhin and the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait over there yasuo but don&rsquo;t wait too long, a performance must not be delayed.&rdquo; Jhin walked off with a deadly spring in his step and left the girl and yasuo alone.\n\n &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you, isn&rsquo;t it? Yasuo?&rdquo; the girl spoke to him but he kept staring out. &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d see you again Taliyah. I thought you were in shurima?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;the emperor was stronger than I thought. I was defeated but I escaped. I had come here to get stronger and when I heard of a man who stole souls, I knew I had to stop him. But yasuo, I&rsquo;ve heard some things about you. Some things I don&rsquo;t want to believe.&rdquo; Taliyah spoke in a disheartening tone. &ldquo;yes, I&rsquo;ve done some things I&rsquo;m not proud of anymore. And I&rsquo;ve decided that the road I travel is a lonesome one. I&rsquo;ve tried to travel it with others, with a clan, but it doesn&rsquo;t work. I must do it alone. But&hellip;&rdquo; yasuo removes his mask, turns to look at his former companion and points to his tied back hair. &ldquo;I will never forget those who have helped make my trip a little less lonely&rdquo; Taliyah smiled and almost shed a tear before holding herself back.\n\n &ldquo;so, what are you going to do now?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heared rumors of a place called the institute of war. I&rsquo;m pretty sure none of my friends are there so that&rsquo;s where ill go.&rdquo; Yasuo put on his mask and went over to jhin. Yasuo stared at jhin and spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving the clan jhin. Don&rsquo;t try and stop me or ill&hellip;&rdquo; before he could finish jhin interrupted. &ldquo;your performance isn&rsquo;t finished, and no-one can write it for you. Not even me. Do as you wish, I will find my own way back to the clan and inform them.&rdquo; Yasuo nodded in gratitude and turned back to Taliyah as jhin disappeared. &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not gonna go to the institute wearing that are you?&rdquo; Taliyah said in a sarcastic voice. &ldquo;I dunno, it kinda suits me.&rdquo; Yasuo said looking at Taliyah with a grin under his mask.\n\n With his last words said he looked ahead and began walking, after all, he has a long road ahead of him.
