Quit ranked for this season a while before preseason started because of sad games that were just making me salty. Go to normals because I like this stupid ass game. Play for a while before preseason and all is normal. Then randomly all of a sudden im versing diamonds, challengers, masters, everyone above me in skill, elo, rating, base stats and everything. Meanwhile my normals team consists of a couple unrankeds, a bronze, a silver and the shittest of all, me. Get pooped on every single game. Not always in lane but if you&#039;ve ever played in lower ranks with higher ranks there are more catches in the jg than you can count. I dont want to constantly try hard every game, so i dont. Noone wants to tryhard every game in normals. I lose a lot more games than I win now cos big elo vs low elo and I get shit on sometimes as well and I am aware I&#039;m not up to diamond, master or challenger skill, but I think I am up to gold/plat skill. So why am I vsing these teams with such a huuuuge skill differential? Then some games I am on the team with the super high elo vsing super low elo. I am not having fun in normals anymore because of this alone. Winning games in fun. Carrying is funner. Getting pooped on in a lot games is not fun. Just let me vs my skill level. You cant just ruin the whole experience for me riot.I have no idea where to post this btw","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-14T14:36:05.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i find the game very depressing when i play with all these bronze and silver players, literally just feed all game, no map awareness and really brings the games to shit. Its hard to practice champs in normal because everybody is so bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-14T14:22:31.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i to have this predicament some days.... most rift games i play are one sided fuckfests and imho are not very enjoyable, your either on the team thats getting smashed or your on the team thats creaming them. the funnest and most memorable games ive had are the ones that go for over an hour are literally neck and neck to the end, ie all turrets down on both sides, nexus to nexus.  this is why i mostly play aram.","replies":[]}]}
