I am so salty rn I have played around 30 games in the past 3 months of ranked and lost at least than 25 of them. I was 20 wins up over my losses with a great win rate on tryndamere and an mmr around 1700 according to op.gg at the latest game I can find. I was getting 26 or more lp a game and having good games, not always one sided. Now my mmr is less than 1500, I&#039;m playing with silvers when I&#039;m in Plat, dropped from Plat 4 high lp to Plat 5 0 lp, and I still cant win. I stomp my lane regardless because of the obvious skill difference but just take a general gander at the recent scores of ye olde tema. I&#039;m not even saying ELO hell because I climbed out of bronze 5, but holy mary mother of fucking shit what is going on. A drop and win/loss that big is ridiculous, and I literally can&#039;t lose lane in the current ELO I am playing in. My rant is sad, and I pray for a lift in chance for me to win, because the game can be over quickly  due to a large snowball, and that seems to be happening a lot, and its happening so early that I cant help enough to win. I&#039;m posting this because I&#039;m so salty because of it, and I think that if your able to stomp lane so badly that he is almost irrelevant, then leave lane to the losing lanes and get kills in some games. depending on the amount of kills that have been lost, then you should be able to rise in ranks regardless. I have no idea where to post this btw","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-30T15:52:10.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read this in the same voice I read vvvortic's comments","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-09-30T05:57:33.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blame your Ez for having a 71% win ratio, and the enemy Lee for his 45%.","replies":[]}]}
