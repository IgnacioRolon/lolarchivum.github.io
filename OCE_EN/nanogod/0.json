Maybe it's just the fact you don't know how to counter her or pick her off? In my experience, she has many weaknesses, such as low immobility and not a high amount of survivability (especially when picked off when sending off clone). The only unbalanced ability at the moment would be her ultimate with the shield being kind of ridiculous. Other than that, her kit seems to be quite balanced. She is a spell caster; she is supposed to one shot people with her kit.

The new mages riot is releasing have mechanics that make no sense and are really unfun to play against and just like Zoe neeko is another example, however unlike Zoe neeko can be tweaked..\n\nMy main issues with her are:\n\n-why does she have low cd Q that clears waves quite easy but at the same time have an on-hit mechanic on her W?~\n-why does she need a root that's a skillshot but can go through minions and get an increase in time if it hits minions (not to mention the time is just dumb at level one you can rooted for almost 2 seconds).\n-Plus right now the ult gives way to much for the cost, it has a really small CD, gives a shield, a stun and has a 1.3 AP ratio like what? I can understand the ult can be a bit hard to land or to set up properly but this is too much.\n\nIncrise the CD on the ult or drastically reduce the ult dmg so she actually has to use her combo and not 1 shot you with just a spell (which most of the times will be cast in FoW and boom there goes ur entire team.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2019-01-28T06:43:48.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your issues have no construction. You're basically asking why the champion even exists. Her Q and E work well as a combo and if she didn't have the empowered auto on her W, she would be extremely inefficient as a pick. It's like saying removing Lux's passive; can you imagine Lux without it? They are tweaking the ultimate as patches go by, but her \"mechanics\" that make \"no sense\" are unique and fun. It provides real mind game plays that not many other champions (excluding Shaco and Leblanc) can provide. Her ultimate damage is fine because of how it roots her in place when used. They have also removed the slow, which makes it fairly easy to dodge. Again, you just need to learn how to counter-pick and play against her.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-12-13T12:00:39.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, and her ultimate does feel really over tuned with it having a stun, massive base and ap scaling damage and a shield, other than that she seems fine in my experiences","replies":[]},{"poster":"DJ Halik","date":"2018-12-13T12:18:14.942+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah her kit is very balanced considering what we already have however letting an ult that strong in the game was a definite mistake with very little counter play to it no matter which way you put it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NanoGod","date":"2018-12-13T00:18:39.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Stop messing with the game everyone loves and make it reasonable is that to much to ask from players god damn son.","replies":[]}]}
