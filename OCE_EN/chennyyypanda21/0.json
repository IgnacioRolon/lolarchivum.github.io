Replace \"tracert\" with \"ping\" and it will give you a reading of your latency to those servers and you can see which one provides the best for you. Tracert is like a ping, but it tells you the latency to every server hop on the way there and you don't really need all that info to test your speed.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-03T00:00:14.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A majority of the servers listed there will not respond to ICMP requests, hence the suggestion to run a traceroute instead of just spamming packets at them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"chennyyypanda21","date":"2016-01-02T11:58:17.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a bit confused :P and what if I'm doing it on Mac?
