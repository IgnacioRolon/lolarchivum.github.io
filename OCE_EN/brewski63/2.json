He tried the &#039;Forgot your password&#039; link but he doesn&#039;t receive the email (so whomever hacked the account change the associated email address). He also tried the &#039;Forgot you username&#039; link but his summoner name &#039;PlaysTv&#039; doesn&#039;t come up. The account is Diamond 5 as you can see so it is pretty frustrating that this has happened. \r\n\r\nWould love some help about what he can do to recover his account.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-04-25T07:49:12.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYour friend is going to have to submit an [account recovery request](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) via Player Support, we here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific issues.","replies":[]}]}
