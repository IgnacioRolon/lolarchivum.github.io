This is extremely frustrating in ranked when players lose 20+ LP when they get a DC and only win &lt;20 LP. Obviously the player would have to be disconnected for a longer period of time to prevent people disconnecting themselves to prevent a loss of LP for themselves.","replies":[{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-05T09:52:24.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot are not transparent in their knowledge of issues like this, they will not address this problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-10-04T04:34:45.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You  could bully someone on your team to the point of afk, just to reduce your LP loss when you game isn't going so well. \n\nIt has been suggested countless times, but it is waaaaaay to easy to take advantage of.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-04T04:07:32.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You think riot would give a shit about real issues?","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Worst Baker","date":"2015-10-04T03:40:59.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This issue was already addressed and Riot wont add something like this because as Riot Lyte said \"It's Toxic\"","replies":[]}]}
