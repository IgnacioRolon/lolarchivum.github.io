I don&#039;t think that is the way her passive was intended to work (but i could be wrong).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above if the Mark of the Kindred is applied to other epic monsters such as the Herald and Baron why does the mark never apply to the dragon? As a monster with a faster spawn rate (and the stacking buffs) would it not give more incentive to both teams to try and take the dragon?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-08T12:29:33.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nI'm not sure if this is intended, however by the sounds of it I'm assuming not.\n\nUnfortunately, this board is for player support with technical issues experienced in/with the game, bug reports would be better suited for the [Bug Report](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board located on the NA boards.","replies":[]}]}
