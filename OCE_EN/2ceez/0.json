The value that they show there is based off an estimate that op.gg and other sites like lolking use to try and guess the MMR of the players involved. \n\nThink of it this way, you win a few matches in a row against players of the same tier level and so then start getting matched with people of higher MMR, if you're climbing then a lot of the players you'll be up against will be lower MMR players of the tier above you. The reason why you're up against those players is that the matchmaking algorithm thinks that you can compete against them as your MMR is high (not even considering tiers), if you win out then you have the right to be at that MMR. If not you will lose, and go to where you're supposed to be.\n\n(in theory)","replies":[]},{"poster":"2ceez","date":"2016-08-24T06:16:56.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://s4.postimg.org/cemlr44jh/hgh.jpg\nand it happens again the other teams mmr is far beyond my team wtf \nthis is my very next match up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-24T04:37:32.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe because you have similar mmr?
