In order to play I had to go through and set High DPI Scaling compatibility just to be able to get the game to load and play, then revert back to no compatibility mode just to see my LoL Client and Login Screen.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely frustrating and there are apparently no fixes available to those who have decided to upgrade. Will there be a support thread for those who have upgraded to Windows 10?\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}  {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"troyktdapus","date":"2015-09-04T00:50:50.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"seomone help ??????????????","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ghost of Didact","date":"2015-08-18T21:31:23.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, I can't even get the client to show.
