The ping spike lasts for about 1.5 seconds. It is literally unplayable with the constant teleporting and rubberbanding happening in-game. I&#039;ve checked my internet for any programs using my bandwidth but there are none that are chewing through my 100mbps connection. I&#039;ve reset the router and my WiFi adapter and it still spikes. This doesn&#039;t happen to me when I play this game but it seems to be occuring tonight. Is Riot performing BTS server maintenance operations?","replies":[]}
