Bad or spotty connection while installing/patching can also cause endless grief.\n\nYou don't mention particularly what fixes you have tried, but there are 3 I would recommend:\n\n1. Make sure your GPU drivers are up to date.\n2. Run a client repair (Settings Gear in top right of client > Initiate Full Repair).\n3. Do a clean uninstall with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool), then redownload the game.\n\nIf all else fails you can submit a ticket to player support and they should be able to help you: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI would also recommend checking your PC/Mac meets the minimum technical requirements.","replies":[{"poster":"KtronUniverse","date":"2019-10-25T03:17:06.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thx for the info.
