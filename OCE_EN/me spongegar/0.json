I try usually to not be a toxic player i used to never be that way but lately im just feeling its becoming harder and harder not too. Now when i get toxic i dont mean afk or ignore my team and afk farm my lane all i do is just flame the player that is doing bad. Now why is that so bad? When i see our top laner give 3 kills up top and tell him to play safe or give him any other advice and just get ignored or when they ignore advice in general why should they not get flamed. When our mid feeds and is the sole reason why we are losing the game why isnt it a justification to be flamed. I know that a game sometimes isnt won or lost on a single player being garbage but sometimes it is and i also know that to win games you cant just always blame others and that you have to be the play maker to win games but thats just not possible all the time. I mean if being flamed is such a problem why dont people use the mute button ? its easy and a quick fix. I mean were not bloody children no one cant take some damn criticism? Iv never been banned at all or received any punishment. Im sort of rambling currently but my final message is why is flaming worse than flaming the person that lost you the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Barkingspider73","date":"2016-07-20T03:16:54.436+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Me SpongeGar,realm=NA,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=339Ej0Ee,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-07-20T03:01:52.665+0000)\n>\n> I mean were not bloody children \n\nThen you would know how to play a video game without getting upset at another person. It's a game. Ever thought that maybe they are trying their best and that sometimes you just have  a bad game? And you can't blame them for ignoring your advice because you can't trust everyone who gives advice, especially in low elo. I'm not saying you specifically give bad advice, but a lot of people do. \n\nBefore you flame someone, put yourself in their place. Would you feel like you would do better with someone trash talking you and telling you how bad you are at the game? It's a team game and therefore you have to act like a team. An effective team does not tear each other down.","replies":[{"poster":"Me SpongeGar","date":"2016-07-20T03:37:25.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iv been the good guy that tries to help boost bad players confidence. it doesn't make a difference when i do they still do the same thing weigh the team down.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-20T04:28:02.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's awesome that you're tying to help people, but it's quite unreasonable to expect them to improve in just one game. \n\nLeague is a really complex game. It can a lot of time for players to learn new concepts. I'm sure even you took longer than a game or two to learn complex ideas like playing when behind.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ImNewImSpecial","date":"2017-06-13T02:45:16.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I got chat restricted after I complained to this kid about him leaving me to gank top and resulting me to die. I said like, \"whyd you leave me? fuk u\". I regarded this to him as a joke and not to be taken seriously. And somehow he got super offended and asked me why I was so toxic for. I told him I wasn't being toxic. Then his friend joined along and said in all chat, \"report yasuo. toxic\". I replied in all chat, \"but im not being toxic...\" He ignored me and continued playing. Soon, I died and he spam pinged me. I replied with a simple, \"fuck off, please\". And then him and his friend started calling me \"bad\" \"trash\" \"garbage player\",while I was doing perfectly fine with like 9/5 score. He, on the other hand, was 4/2ish that did not contribute anything to the success of the game. I flamed him back, like what a normal person would do. I told him something along the lines of, \"Like you're doing anything good, My flames are never direct. I've never said like, \"You're fucking retarded bro, you fucking piece of shit. Kill yourself.\" even though I did think he was a piece of shit. My flames were more sarcastic. Then towards the end of the game, he says in all chat, \"report yasuo, most toxic person ive ever met\". \"replied with a simple \"lol\". Couple hours later, I get chat restricted. I deserved the chat restrction but i doubt he got it because there were two people agreeing that i was the most toxic person ever. I deserved that chat restriction. I was a piece of shit and I dont regret any of it. Some people just can't take fucking jokes. :/ So now, I can't be open and talk to everyone because there will always be that piece of shit that complains. I don't like taking shit so I'm gonna flame back and yeah.

Why? because no doubt as soon as you say 1 thing to either duo the will BOTH report you. Then add in another asswipe that generally looks for someone to blame and that's straight up 3 reports against you. It happens alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll the time mate.\n\nAnd I've been chat restricted for MUCH MUCH less than what you have.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-20T04:28:33.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a difference between constructive criticism and old fashioned verbal abuse. In essence, each \"style\" carries the same content (someone did something wrong and you want to tell them) which means it's the way that you choose to present that content, and why you've chosen it, that makes all the difference. The _why_ is important as it determines what you hope to achieve. If you're being constructive someone might learn something but if you just want to blame someone to unburden yourself of responsibility that's a short-lived feeling probably not worth the effort (and risk).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Huskk","date":"2016-07-20T03:12:22.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]}
