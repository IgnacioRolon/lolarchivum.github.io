When i got inside the game, i realize my 4 teammates are Bots, and all rush mid with 1 item. I got a really hard time with them but im being able to get the game rolling.. Until the 24 minutes mark, the bots started to surrender and with 4 bots it was a completed ff. I know this is not really a major problem for any old players, but imagine a newbie getting in to a bot game with the same situation like me, confuse and mad. One to another, people will just quit on day 1. So fix your stuff Riot. I saw threads about this problem 2 years ago and it seems you guys just don&#039;t care at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Smurfin USA","date":"2018-05-02T14:26:31.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its the same when leveling a new account in ARAM.\n\nChinese account farming bots have literally taken this game by the ballsack and squeezed it for everything they can.\n\nRiot will never admit to this of course, the game is working as intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DIV1D3","date":"2018-05-02T12:40:56.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup, I can remember having the exact same problem once before. \nI never have this problem anymore because I never touch Co-Op vs AI anymore, but it seems incredibly damaging to the new player experience.","replies":[]}]}
