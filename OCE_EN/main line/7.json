Sazahu was the only good player in the games, and even he managed to get executed, while a certain jungler died to a minion in the middle of a lane farming...hmm. These two teams look like finishing at the bottom of the ladder by a long way, no clue whatsoever how to pressure, close out, or play the game.\n\nThe worst play I saw was when Lost (TM ADC) was chunked after Avant had won an engage and gotten a kill. Instead of applying map pressure, or taking an objective, what did AV do?\n\n\"Lost is chunked, chase him through his jungle even though we have no vision! Lets go\" ..... BOOM MEET THEIR TEAM, and AV give up 2 kills mindlessly and lose objectives through it.\n\nAbsolutely terrible the whole series, especially game 2. Was hoping that it would be closed out by game 2, so that LGC vs DW would start, but had to endure game 3... ugh. Montecristo would sack the entire roster!\n\nP.S.I forgot to mention another ridiculous play (many of them came from Chenyboy, the ADC of AV).... AV are pressuring mid lane, so as Vayne he comes from the wolves camp behind the mid tower to take a couple of tower shots to get some autos in.... of course they just turn around and kill him flat out... that was WOOD 5 level.\n\nHis positioning was so poor in every game, that he is probably thinking \"IM RICH GANG FOR LIFE, I BET AGAINST MY TEAM, HAHA SUCKERS, HELLO TAB PAYOUT , RICH GANG 4 EVER!!\" Even Rosey was SOLO killing him once as the support, hilarious! \n\nDestiny would run rings around him in the adc role, get him back for sanity's sake.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-25T06:17:20.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All E-$ports is utter crap son","replies":[]}]}
