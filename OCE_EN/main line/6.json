That's what majority of the posts in an OCE Facebook group was saying. But seriously, for the love of Summoner Icons, just play on the map! We won't be getting to the final boss monster with this kind of attitude! \n\nLet's go OCE!","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-02-02T01:21:09.750+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a fundamental lack of understanding how to play TT that prevents people from really getting into it. The thing that really hooks you into SR is learning how to play the map and seeing yourself improve, noticing when you made a great play and when you got outplayed. You're forced to do those things if you actually want to learn how to play League.\n\nI didn't play TT a whole lot until we did some internal tournaments at Riot Sydney. Due to how few players we had, we played them on TT in order to create enough teams and balance them effectively. Taking a really competitive approach to TT made us thoroughly assess how to play the map properly. Metas formed, power picks began to arise and different strategies developed.\nI now enjoy TT as much as SR and can see clear skill differences between players based on how they play the map. I know an SR-only player when I see them in TT, because the way they play shows they don't really understand the nuanced strategies and different phases of the game.\n\nYes, TT has an early, mid and late game. (Laning phase + mid jungle control, mid game objective control, late game siege)\nThe 3 man comps mean that the strengths and weaknesses of different team comps are far more pronounced on TT!\nA team that gets stomped early by a highly mobile snowball/assassin comp might be well built to take advantage of the late game siege scenario if the enemy hasn't built a way to transition into closing the game out and the defending team play their comp right.\n\nThat sort of understanding is something most players can only associate with SR, they just don't see the depth in TT because they've never had to learn it.","replies":[{"poster":"Reginleif","date":"2017-02-02T01:39:49.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great way to put things in perspective there! I myself am a huge fan of Twisted Treeline! So I have nothing against it. Just wishing a lot more people learn to play the map. It's a lot of fun!\n\nAnd like I said in another post in \"The News Hour\" people tend to complain and whine majority of the time instead of just sucking it up and playing the game. I mean if they really badly want the \"Reward\" for this challenge, they must be willing to work hard for it. It's called a REWARD to start off with, not a GIVEAWAY. \n\nI just think the community needs to start valuing and working with each other in order to achieve \"community\" rewards. And since people have been so vocal about their dislike of the TT map and not wanting to play on it, then tough luck, no rewards for not participating enough. There are so many ways to get around defeating these monsters since the whole community will benefit from the rewards, but some people just can't help but be so selfish and just think of THEIR OPINIONS and EXPERIENCES on a map that they just \"dislike\". It's not a valid enough reason to not participate.\n\nThen they will go to the boards and complain. It's just like the American elections, majority of the people complaining didn't even go out and vote! It's the same context here. Majority of the people complaining that we lost this one, probably didn't even try to play on the TT map due to their reasons of dislike and negativity.\n\nThanks for taking the time to actually explain that concept Gehirn, hopefully it'll make people more aware and open minded!\n\nCheers!\nReginleif ","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-02T04:46:17.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Reginleif,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=4yOAaYev,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2017-02-02T01:39:49.637+0000)\n\n>  \"people tend to complain and whine majority of the time instead of just sucking it up and playing the game\"\n\n\nI feel like this comment displays a fundamental misunderstanding of why people play games...","replies":[{"poster":"Reginleif","date":"2017-02-02T09:53:50.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm saying in regards only to the TT Map this Ocean Week.
