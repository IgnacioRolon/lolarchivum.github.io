So what do I do if i&#039;m not in ranked? Play normal games of course. But lately I&#039;m extremely hesitant to even queue up into a normal game due to being dehumanized for not performing like a god. Isn&#039;t the normal game mode made so that anyone could have fun regardless of elo? It makes no sense to flame someone for not doing good enough, yes it is normal to flame someone if they&#039;re trolling, but come on, flaming someone because they can&#039;t carry 4 other people? not to mention League of Legends is a team game, not all games are won solely from a single person &quot;carrying&quot;. It&#039;s even more disgusting the fact that most of the time the people who flame aren&#039;t even on my team since I play with a full premade (normally friends in silver-plat), so why not get the victory and keep it that way? You may argue &quot;why not mute them?&quot; yeah I would but the damage is already done when it&#039;s the first thing they&#039;d ever say.\r\n\r\nTLDR; \r\n-people in every elo even in challenger are still human, treat them the way you want to be treated.\r\n-no I can&#039;t carry 3+ team mates that are behind just because my elo is higher than yours.\r\n-I begin games with same base stats like everyone else, so don&#039;t expect us to do heaps of damage before 5 minutes.\r\n-stop being toxic, no one likes that. If I wanted to be at the beach, I wouldn&#039;t be playing league.\r\n\r\nps. good luck to everyone for season 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-22T07:15:59.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah that's not going to change.\nI'm only gold and I've had fucking bronze and silver players do that to me.\nbetter get used to it tbh","replies":[{"poster":"AscenSHEN","date":"2015-12-22T07:19:43.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Alfawarrior3,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=n2PkgGkG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-22T07:15:59.652+0000)\n>\n> yeah that's not going to change.\n> I'm only gold and I've had fucking bronze and silver players do that to me.\n> better get used to it tbh\n\nyeah I do agree it wont change but it's just something I felt like I needed to put out.

Time spent and matchups .... other than that.. its scary how close i see mistakes... bad placement, bad chases, over extending, over taxing lanes by jungle. and so on...\n\nwhat Bronze and Silver need to understand, is Diamond is not that great!  and Diamonds need to realize that they are not that far above the others... to many players feel entitled to boast bragging rights... and thats what causes this, when the only true thing that separates them is Time!  i was a Diamond 1 player.. and now after being off for a year i fear going through ranked... used a smurf and won all 10 provisional was placed Bronze V.. i mean come on... if Norms actually carry MMR, some adjustments need to be made right now!  Bronze V is Hell to get out of.... 5 players barking  orders, 3 different game plans, 4 different objective pings alerts... 3 players targeted, scary builds, team fights can be counted as 3v5 because 2/5 will not cast and land.... this is Bronze V typical team fights and leading up to!\n\nWish me luck, im currently unranked ATM im sure my MMR is dirt... so any tips.. cuz just letting you know now.. if im placed in Bronze V after wining 7/10 or more provisionals.. im out... done... finished with this year.. may try, but who wants to carry 4 players that dont take direction or even attempt to help their teammates.. or unite to accomplish goals","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-12-23T01:09:56.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's normals, just mute, and go about your business.\n\nBetter still, tell them you are bronze 5 but got boosted by a challenger mate for the nice border, and then mute them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bribery","date":"2015-12-22T18:55:11.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lel im currently d3 was challenger few month back. if u look at my match history i wud always go 1/10 in normals and 10-0 in soloq cuz i want to test champs to the limit in norm queues. however i never seen sum1 talk shit bout me doing bad in normals tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-22T07:22:19.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its called \"send a support ticket to get your border removed\" people will never know what elo you are unless they look you up.","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2015-12-22T12:53:40.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=n2PkgGkG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-22T07:22:19.563+0000)\n>\n> Its called \"send a support ticket to get your border removed\" people will never know what elo you are unless they look you up.\n\nHey rocka :D","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-22T14:30:32.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AscenSHEN","date":"2015-12-22T07:26:58.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rocka,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=n2PkgGkG,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-22T07:22:19.563+0000)\n>\n> Its called \"send a support ticket to get your border removed\" people will never know what elo you are unless they look you up.\n\nwell the thing is, I've stated that these people are normally not on my team so they can't see my border anyway unless they do a team search such as lolnexus.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Epica","date":"2015-12-22T10:14:02.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see stuff like what you're talking about in Norms all the time, i'm constantly paired with and against people gold - challenger in norms and the amount of times iv seen a diamond - challenger player get abused by someone of a lower rank is just ridiculous, the frequent comments i see when high ranked players aren't doing well are \"Wow you must have been boosted\" \"You're trash, how did you make it to X ELO?\", \"You must have been carried to X ELO\" and \"Did you buy your account?\", even high ranked players have bad games i don't get why some people have such a hard time understanding that?","replies":[]}]}
