I play ranked constantly. Not gonna be any different this time.\r\n\r\nI queued up as support; I solo queue.  I have known this to be the ultimate exercise in masochism.\r\n\r\nAs the matches began to flow - and I, predictably, began to lose - I noted with a sick feeling that if things didn&#039;t shape up, I was going straight to bronze. \r\n\r\nI had my game face on. Ultimate focus. No Doritos, no Mountain Dew. Those are distractions. Glass of water, that&#039;s it.\r\n\r\nI supported my ass off. I supported like if I didn&#039;t.... Well, we&#039;d lose. I got S- through S+ on my champs, I got honors, I did alright! Well, for some of them.\r\n\r\nBecause, as seems to be the case, the game falls apart around me when I solo queue support. It doesn&#039;t seem to matter what I do.\r\n\r\nSo what was my provisionals score? 3-7. Ouch.\r\n\r\nAnd then I got the message - Your climb begins at Bronze V.\r\n\r\nI was heartbroken.\r\n\r\nI went to jail once. I remember being arrested in the courtroom. My world seemed to end. My head spun, and I wasn&#039;t sure it was worth doing anymore.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s how I feel now. Like maybe it isn&#039;t even worth playing anymore. I&#039;ll never climb past Bronze IV solo queueing. \r\n\r\nAnyone feel similar as these provisionals come to a close?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-17T09:48:25.448+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I queued up as support; I solo queue. \n\nThat's where you fucked up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2018-01-18T00:37:23.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have not done my placement matches yet, but I will definitely be placed in bronze if not bronze 5...\n\nI personally likes bronze, where you can be comfortable being bad","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-01-19T21:25:45.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just sayng being comfortable in bronze is why youre bronze.\n\nRegardless of what people may think of me i have climbed out of bronze on numerous occasions.\n\nI am not an amazing player by any stretch, the only difference between myself and other bronze players is this one simple thing.\n\n\"I feel disgusted in myself for being bronze\"\n\nThats it, thats my secret.\n\nThe double edged sword is im also disgusted by other bronze players hence all the tilt, rage, lose streaks, and permabans.\n\nBut hey if it makes me climb i can always make new accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2018-01-20T09:18:19.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KaynMid,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=42w53LcM,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-01-19T21:25:45.404+0000)\n>\n> Just sayng being comfortable in bronze is why youre bronze.\n> \n> Regardless of what people may think of me i have climbed out of bronze on numerous occasions.\n> \n> I am not an amazing player by any stretch, the only difference between myself and other bronze players is this one simple thing.\n> \n> &quot;I feel disgusted in myself for being bronze&quot;\n> \n> Thats it, thats my secret.\n> \n> The double edged sword is im also disgusted by other bronze players hence all the tilt, rage, lose streaks, and permabans.\n> \n> But hey if it makes me climb i can always make new accounts.\n\nOkay, that's perfectly valid (well, kind of), but who do you think is having more fun playing this game, you or the other guy?","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-01-21T03:19:22.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me flip the question back on you.\n\nIf you play to have fun and not to improve your rank, then why play ranked in the first place?\n\nBecause i have fun when people like the other guy arent in my ranked games, because then its a purely competitive environment, and i enjoy purely competitive environments.\n\nThe other guy doesnt have fun when people like me are in his games because i will berate him for not playing for the competitive nature or go out of my way to stomp him if im on the other team.\n\nIf people who play for fun would play normals instead of ranked, and people who want to tryhard played ranked. The game would be more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nHell when i want to fuck around and have fun i purposely queue for normals, purely to not fuck up other peoples ranked games.\n\nI go out of my way to make sure the other 9 players in the ranked games i play have a proper competitive environment, (unless im inting, but if im inting its because the other players have ruined my competitive environment so its out the window anyway)\n\nTl;DR\n\nThe only reason to play ranked over normals is to improve your rank.\n\nIf you dont want to improve your rank then Draft Normals is identical to ranked in game-play, literally 100% identical, same queuing system, same pick-ban system, same items same champions, only difference, is it doesn't have a ranked system tied to it, and you arent responsible for 9 other players mmr by queuing up when you know you cant cut the mustard.","replies":[{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2018-01-21T06:10:25.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't specifically disagree with anything you say. Whenever I play, I play to the best of my ability, and I enjoy seeing my rank improve. The minor difference is that my ability is extremely low, and my rank might improve from Bronze IV to Bronze III, and then almost immediately go back down.\n\nThe major difference is that I never feel disgust at myself, and the fun that I get out of this game is not dependent on winning. I'm not saying this makes me superior to you in any way, but I do believe that both I and the other guy get more out of this game in Bronze than you will for the foreseeable future.\n\nI will say, however, that you're wrong to assume that 'berating' someone makes the game more unpleasant for them. For me, at least, it doesn't have any effect at all, because I habitually mute chat. The net effect of berating someone who sucks is that now they're going to suck more and for longer because they're not paying attention to chat, they're not learning as efficiently. And since my terribleness doesn't bother me, but does bother people like you, ultimately you're only hurting yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-01-21T06:29:52.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The  problem is you arent learning.\n\nYou recognize that yourself \"every-time i get to brone 3 i drop back down to bronze 4\"\n\nThe reason is because you have no reason to learn.\n\nYou are content being bronze 4 skill level and inturn have no motivation to improve as a player.\n\nJust as if you are content being a slob who lives with their parents you will never get a job.","replies":[{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2018-01-21T11:36:13.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, okay, so long as you accept that it's a 'problem' for you and people like you, but not for me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Plectrums","date":"2018-01-20T09:16:07.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"See you there, friend!\n\nHonestly, it's just a game, does it matter? Unless you're in the top few percent of players, your experience is going to be basically the same: you'll play a bunch of ranked games, sometimes you'll be the best player in the match, sometimes you'll be the worst, sometimes your team will suck, sometimes the other team will, sometimes you'll be incredibly frustrated as everything goes wrong, sometimes everything will go right.\n\nJust play your best, let the cards fall where they may, and have fun regardless of rank. Because unless you've got serious aspirations of turning pro, your rank doesn't matter to anyone.\n\nPersonally I look forward to a long season of sucking it up in Bronze V. Maybe this time I'll even surpass my achievements of last season (my first) and make it to Bronze II! Given that I found Bronze III too tough, I'm not holding out much hope...","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-20T09:27:09.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your attitude!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-17T09:28:11.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will pretty much always be placed 2-3 divisions lower than your end of season rank, so if you finished Bronze 5 you're basically guaranteed a Bronze 5 placement, whether you go 10-0 or 0-10 in placement matches.\n\nDoesn't mean you can't climb though. The best thing you can do is to focus on one thing at a time. Instead of just trying to improve generally, pick something you know you aren't great at and work on it until you can say you're proud of it, regardless of what rank you're sitting at. Then pick something else and repeat. If you do that the climbing will come on it's own.\n\nClimbing is a process of improving, it's not just a matter of playing a whole bunch of games and hoping. Ofc though it is important to be aware that being in Bronze 5 the odds are stacked against you, even if you do gradually improve. \n\nIf you improve a whole bunch and feel you still aren't climing, you could consider starting a new account, getting to ranked and placements and seeing where your at. It might be an easier time to improve for a while on a fresh account where things are clearer, then go back to your main when the gap is bigger and it's easier to climb out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flopmonster","date":"2018-01-22T21:24:36.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 9-1 which awarded me Bronze 4...
