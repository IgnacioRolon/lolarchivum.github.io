I would understand making him visible when close like twitch&#039;s Q ability, that is fair. But also making little icon above the closest enemy to him, is far too much. It completely nullifies any pressure whatsoever that his ultimate has, so they can not only see him close but completely expect his leap. This completely ruins the fun factor as now I&#039;ve played him several times where people just hide behind the tank or retreat farther back and you can&#039;t dive the back line because you become seen and you can no longer at least be sneaky and jump over a wall or come from the side because the icon makes them fully aware that you are lurking. This hurts the players capabilities to blow up a player, which is a common and effective strategy on rengar. As someone who has been playing for a very long time it disappoints me to see that change to his Ultimate, it feels utterly useless except the speed boost and barely useful invisibility he gains. I believe the only way you may be able to fix this problem is to decide to have either the icon with full invisibility or close range visibility without the icon.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-16T09:47:44.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the things that you complained about, like hiding behind tanks or running away from the assassin as a squishy, are called counterplay.\n\nYes, I can understand that it isn't fun as a melee stealth assassin with no escapes, that when the enemy adc hides next to their nautilus, poppy, ect... and you waste you camo/stealth since you can't go for the adc without running in to your death can be annoying, but consider this from the other end of the situation. You are a squishy adc, rengar has just ulted, you must now run to safety and try to gain distance from him because if you aren't near a tanky teammates when rengar leaps out of stealth to rape you, you're fucked.\n\nI have had games where I've legit seen adcs build zhonias, especially against release post rework rengar before he was nerfed into an averagely strong jungle assassin.","replies":[]}]}
