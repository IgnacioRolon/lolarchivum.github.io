However, every minute when it cycles through the wallpapers, the Wallpaper Engine display is briefly replaced with the League Displays wallpaper and then replaced back with the Wallpaper Engine one. This is not a big deal but I was wondering if it is possible to run League Displays on certain monitors, for example just my secondary monitors so that the Wallpaper Engine and League Displays do not conflict. Thank you very much for any responses!","replies":[]}
