Literally Co-Op v.s. AI style bots. Fake accounts created by Riot so that people can actually play these game modes. I have a feeling that judging from these events on the NA server, 3v3 and Dominion probably won't be coming to OCE servers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-06-09T08:48:05.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been asked repeatedly, and to the best of my knowledge the stance hasn't changed. Something along the lines of not enough people on OCE to make it worth it, and not enough interest in the people that are.\nHowever, as far as I know, they haven't said anything since, despite numerous people asking, which is suspicious to me. We haven't even recieved an update on how many more people would be needed, we've literally been given nothing.","replies":[]}]}
