When I tried to open the launcher, nothing happened. The League. icon just hopped down in the toolbar, and I tried to come up with a fix. \r\n\r\nThis worked for me, if it doesn&#039;t work for you... I probably can&#039;t help you, cause I&#039;m no genius on computers. However, this is an easy fix for PBE Launcher (Jan. 2018)\r\n\r\n/Dudeofskiss1\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Open Finder &gt; All My Files &gt; Search for &quot;.dmg&quot; in the search-bar. \r\n2. Find the &quot;League of Legends installer PBE.dmg&quot;.\r\n3. Make sure there are no Download Files for PBE, Clients or dmg-files in the Application folder. **(KEEP THE PBE.App in Applications!!)**\r\n4. Open the .dmg launcher normally.\r\n5. Drag the League of Legends icon into the Applications folder. \r\n6. A message (by default) will open saying either Replace, Keep, or Cancel. Make sure to press the REPLACE button. (This will replace the already downloaded file with the new one)\r\n7. Wait for the copying to finish.\r\n8. Open PBE.App in Finder&gt;Applications.\r\n\r\nHope this works!\r\nBest of luck! \r\n\r\n{{sticker:galio-happy}} \r\n\r\n//Dudeofskiss1 (EUNE)","replies":[{"poster":"Le Tmo","date":"2018-01-28T15:37:24.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you happen to know a fix for windows by any chance? or can you link me to anyone who did.

Very few people on OCE have access to PBE (and as far as I know only through NA accounts) so there's very little experience here.","replies":[]}]}]}
