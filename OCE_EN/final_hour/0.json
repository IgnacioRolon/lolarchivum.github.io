So, I just finished watching the Doom Bots video and it's pretty much the LoL shout casters versing the most insane bots with random moves/passives. If you're interested here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7YGtxF1iGU\r\n\r\nAnyways it got me thinking of how awesome it would be if there was a game made that supported this a 5v5 on Summoners Rift or Howling Abyss with a random champion with four random moves and a random passive and ultimate. For exmaple a Gragas with Annie Q Ezreal W Shaco E and Garen ultimate for example. You would get some quite funny spell kits and see champions do the weirdest things. I think it would be so enjoyable and hilarious. Just a thought, let me know what you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"RAPTOZZZ","date":"2014-12-07T06:40:08.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you could have a champion with full cc abilites which would be fun/op","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-07T08:00:15.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> you could have a champion with full cc abilites which would be fun/op\n\nLissandra already has that.","replies":[]}]}]}
