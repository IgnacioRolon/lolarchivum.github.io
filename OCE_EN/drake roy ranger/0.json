{"poster":"Drake Roy Ranger","date":"2015-01-20T06:03:47.521+0000","title":"Jack of the Spring Heel","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hallo everyone!\nThis character was inspired by the old Irish folk tail of \"Springheel Jack\", so, I was thinking that he would be an extraordinary piece of the League of Legends puzzle if it was able to make it through \"LOL's\" approval. Also if this character is made, make sure that when he attacks he only uses his feet and occasional backhands.\nPassive- \"Spring Picking\" allows Jack to gain +40 extra movement speed when he is targeting Champion's with less than 1/2 of it's health, but, drops back to original movement speed when targeting Champions with more than 1/2 of it's health.\nQ- \"The Dublin Dabble\" makes Jack slide leaving a trail of water that allows allies to gain a 5% movement speed boost. During the slide Jack bends down and wets his hands giving him a 30% attack speed boost. While this is active he only attacks using palm strikes (mana cost: 30/40/50/60, attack speed: 30%/45%/60%/75%, duration: 1 sec/2 sec/3.5 sec/ 5 sec.)\nW- \"Irish Intimidation\" is a skill-shot that causes Jack to Scream out loudly, suppressing his opponent as he sprints toward him/her and dealing out a strike (120 ap + 1/2 of current ap) which slows the opponent and causes them to bleed (40 ap per sec + 1/2 of current ap) for 5 seconds. (mana cost: 60/70/80/90, ap dealt: 120/145/170/195, bleed damage: 40/45/50/55, bleed duration: 5 sec/ 6.5 sec/ 8 sec/ 9.5 sec.)\nE- \"Keep Calm and Keep Quiet\" causes jack to gain a shield (340 hp + 1/3 of current ap) and negates silence and slow crowd control effects (mana cost: 50/65/70/85, Shield: 340/360/380/400).\nR- \"Leap of Faith\" allows Jack to jump to the aid of a targeted ally creating a small radius around his ally where enemies are slowed and get dealt 450 ap (+ 3/4 of current ap, mana cost: 80/85/90, ap dealt: 450/500/550).\nI hope that you all like my idea, be sure to comment on it and tell me what you think should change, also please be polite.\nJack is a tall, skinny man wearing a tattered suit and a top hat. His voice is a solemn one but he has a sense of humour.","replies":[{"poster":"Everlusion","date":"2015-01-21T11:36:31.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So friggen detailed!
