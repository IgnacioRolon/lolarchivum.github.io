Not because **Riot**'s systems are bad, but because at those higher MMRs (close to Gold 5+) most players play exclusively ranked. Which means the normal queue at those MMRs has really low populations.\n\nYou don't seem to be getting stomped in your recent [match history](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=hzx86s), but if you really think that you're severely out-classed and loosing lots, then the system should slowly adjust and match you with worse players over time.\n\nMy normal queue fully adjusted in about 20 games after I stopped playing ranked, you could expect yours to be about the same. I totally feel your pain though :'(","replies":[{"poster":"hzx86s","date":"2016-09-18T09:07:13.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea , i  understood. But this happen to me april, i played rank on last week. Maybe i should ask RIOT's staff .Now i can not practice champ on normal, because i don't want to play this unfair game. Thank you for your help.  WHERE CAN I FIND THE RIOT'S STAFF?

It only fixed itself for me once I stopped playing ranked.\n\nThe best way to talk to a **Rioter** is to send in a [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ticket directly to **Riot**.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
