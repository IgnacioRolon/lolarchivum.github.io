Some time you just have bad luck or your teammate fed the enemy, it will makes player feel irritable. The player reactions are only 2, abuse or ignore. The player is enraged and abuses enemy team, on the game they will only think how to kill the guy who taunt and break the full game. If player ignore them, usually they will keep taunt because they can have fun by the taunt.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we can block the speak of the enmey but we can&#039;t block the action(dance or ctrl 6) or emote, those behaviour will make player fell really angry but they can&#039;t do anything. Some of the player can abuse but some of player just want to ernjoy the game. They don&#039;t want to spend time on the abuse but they can&#039;t counterattack them. \r\n\r\nYou may say &#039;We have report system to help you&#039;. Unfortunately, most of player will leave after they had a bad game, they just don&#039;t want to see the guy who make them feel angry. Also, most of player you may not play another game with them, so it makes player feel you can&#039;t do anything to them. THe player will not see any feedback after they finish the game. \r\n\r\nI think you all see the same game before but I see a lot on my account. Some of player just make fun by taunt. It is normal but it is worng. The player behaviour will not change by the current report system. So I just want to understand why ther is no countermeasure fot the bad player behaviours. This behaviours makes many player can&#039;t enjoy the game. I know the staff is working on the new champ and game balance, IF there is no player the game has no meaning.\r\n\r\nI can understand it is a really hard to fix the game behaviour but can you give us some hope or feedback to make us know you are working on this. The player want to have clean game environment and plealse don&#039;t make you player feel sad on the game.

In fact, they using emote and dance to taunt and report system do nothing for those player. Also, most of player will not spend RP on the emote.\n\nUsually you will not play the second with the player who taunt you, it makes me feel really angry. I report those player but on the next game I see the trolling player again. I doubt the report system is useful or not. I think some time you meet the player who is really disgusting，they never respect you. I try to tell staff and change this condition.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-26T05:24:25.642+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a war game dude, if you can't handle a silly taunt, god help you.

I'll be honest and say that maybe you need to chill a little. In addition, the fact is that often the enemy team are the LEAST toxic in the game, I find I'll be abused by my own team several games in a row before I have an enemy become rude; but then again, I don't consider emoting to be rude.\n\nDisregarding disagreement though, you ask repeatedly for \"something to be done\" and say the report system is insufficient - what do you suggest? What possible system could there be that would support the report system in the cases you talk about, or other cases of player harassment? How can they be made fair and balanced? Contrary to common belief, devs do not have a list of features to perfectly address every situation, and the chances are good if you can't even come close to a suggestion - neither can they.\n\nI'm sorry, honestly I am because I get angry at people to and it does suck and it does ruin your game, but the only answer here really is for you to learn to chill out a bit; I've played a lot of games, I've never come across any where dance-taunting isn't acceptable (teabagging anyone?).","replies":[{"poster":"hzx86s","date":"2017-10-26T11:44:54.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In fact, i will report the player who tanut the other player. I don't care who they are and why they taunt. \n\nYou don't consider emoting to be rude but i am talking about the reply the emote and dance in some of situation (like they have advantage or killed u ). If I can record the game video i will show you the situation. I don't know why usually this kind of player will in the enemy team. Also, the speak is not the part of the taunt, but if u block them they will use emote instead of taunt. \n\nMy queation is that why the report system do nothing on the game. IF it works, why there are not any change on the game?  I think i reported at least 1000 times on my game but there is still nothing happen. The taunt is still happen on my game (8/10 games ). In fact, you can forgive those player instead of the player has this problems. \n\nThis is the toxic on the game experience Why no one can fix it? You can it should happen on the game ? I never taunt on my game but another can't do this. I can't require other player to have good game etiquette like me, SO i don't think u can require me the have the same option with u. \n\nMy suggeation is that if we can block the emote and dance on the game Maybe i can ignore those player on the game. However, those toxic still that. IF the report system work why this situation is not reducing on the game? I can report but no feedback. You want to record the video of the game? Does riot pay for this? We are player not the riot's staff. We play the game SO we need do somehing after we finish the game?(report system is a part of the game.) \n\n\nSorry for the terrible grammar.","replies":[]}]}]}
