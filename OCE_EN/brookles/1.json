I watch some streams and they stand still for a while and wait for the last hit. My problem with being adc is relying on my support to not go in on the enemy when I am trying to farm.\r\nAny tips would be appreciated! :)","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T04:35:53.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"action is a resource play an rts (otherthan sandbox MOBA) and learn economics in and out and then transfer that to your play, study ludwig von mises' treatise on human action & praxeology. learn ergo sum homo economis xx\nergo sum homo economicus\nhomo economicus\n\nalso gold and backs... nobody knows how to play this game, your pro tiers are fucking garbage. anyone decent doesnt play this game. im the only one. do you understand? im talking globally. im the only.","replies":[{"poster":"Brookles","date":"2016-01-01T23:41:04.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please stop commenting on my posts, that was painful to read.\n\nI have like 15 more things to say about that but I will keep it to myself, because I'm the one, the one and only you understand?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-01T06:14:40.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Halting your Champion just lets you focus a little harder and freezes the lane a bit when the minions start hitting you. You could go into a custom game and just practice last hitting as precisely as possible with no runes/items/masteries or just focus on csing as much as possible in game.
