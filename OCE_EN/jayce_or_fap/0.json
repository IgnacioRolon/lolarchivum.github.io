You're outlawed because you offend the rules, not because you can or can't read them, where did you get the idea the latter is the case? \n\nRead the ToS's Code of Conduct section, concerning languages there is only statement forbidding offensive chat and spamming etc, the obvious stuff, it mentions not that a person speaking another language qualifies the breach of rules.

It's not wrong to ask more tolerance of people.\n\nI have no idea why you have to think virtual places are somehow more rigid than real world. Yeah real world and virtual are different, but it is so that people are everywhere in the virtual world as opposed real world where it's hard limited by cash and other factors; in the online world you only need a computer and internet and off you go. It's precisely that we're handling virtual matters, that we should be more flexible with this kind of thing because I can be accessing a server from half a world away at any time, but I can't do the same irl. It's simply a no-brainer that there will be more \"foreign\" people on any server than there will be in real life, so why are you lowering the benchmark for the virtual space as oppose to expanding it like we should?\n\nConcerning \"You are EXPECTED to speak english\", \n\n* For example in Europe, it's common for people to be exposed to 3 to 4 languages to a certain extent daily, it's extremely common for people to go about be it online or real world within Europe and speak in the languages that don't match with the local official language. Besides a few die-hards, people rarely complain about the massive amount of individual languages being crammed into just Europe itself (especially with EU's migration laws), and they just learn to deal with it, and everyone goes about speaking their language just fine.\n* What about places like say China? Where even just within their own borders they have 50 something recognised ethnic groups, 8 major languages, and nearly 300 dialects in total that are still used today across the land? The answer is simple, besides for official and business reasons, no one is forced to use the official language, being Mandarin. Similarly online, no one is forced to type Mandarin either, you either can read or can't read it, assuming it's not against the rules of the forum, server or country. China also rarely places enforcement on other nations to use Mandarin, be it irl or virtual.\n* Similarly on say Steam's forums. It's very common for people to start threads in a language that's not English despite the platform's official language being it. Do people complain about it? I haven't seen any. Because people just learn to deal with multiple languages as oppose to rejecting it.\n* What about the old NA server, before they'd split out 2 LA servers and BR? I was there, playing games with 3-4 languages per game looking at the \"huehuehue\" and \"jajaja\" every game. Do I lose my shit and tell them to type English or gtfo? No, because I learn to deal with it.\n\n**Official language is the suggested common language, it by no means is the 1 and only language, nor is anyone being outlawed, punished or prosecuted for not using it.**\n\nIn the case of League, it only ever states that offensive chats, spams, and refusal to communication are outlawed. While one may or may not consider using another language as refusing to communicate, I for one do not, as I only ever considering it so when they also happen to ignore pings entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-23T05:38:51.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T05:57:55.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=toKJqFEV,comment-id=00040000000100000000000100000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2017-01-23T05:55:18.405+0000)\n>\n> Sorry here is an actual dictionary site.\n> \n> https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bigotry\n> \n> Still basically the same thing.\n\n\"Intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself\" implies nothing specific to racism, just that it's intolerance to differences, which is what I was preaching and using the word correctly for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T05:42:21.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=toKJqFEV,comment-id=0004000000010000000000010000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-23T05:38:51.022+0000)\n>\n\n\nI like how you used a site for synonyms and antonyms rather than an actual dictionary site.\n\nHell, even with your own site it states:\n\n> Bigotry\n> _noun_ intolerance, prejudice\n\nIt is in the SYNONYM sections that it mentions discrimination and racism.

Imagine, what's the response you'd get if you get bombed in say Russia with a \"speak Russian!\"? Most people would say \"fk you\" in whatever their native language. This is the same deal, but more \"international\" I suppose.\n\nI mean, a great deal amount of pros and high elos play on KR server despite not knowing 1 bit of Korean, a few Chinese players also choose to play on KR server, and before the JP server's inception many Japanese also play in KR server with also relatively no knowledge of Korean. How many times do you hear the Koreans complain about people not typing in their official language on their server? Do you not see the Koreans are doing it right while we're doing it completely wrong?\n\n**EDIT: **Again, speaking in another language does not constitute a breach of anybody's rules.

The \"locals\" and the \"foreigners\" can be the same racial (though I really don't like to use to term)/ethnic group just of different nationality and/or language/cultural background (imagine say a British shouting at a German for not using English and/or following their routines in UK), and what I've said would still apply. I intentionally keep my description general, so that it covers a much wider scope and not about digging 1 specific aspect.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-22T05:44:43.079+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"你有说中文的人问题？\n\n说的尖尖耳语很有乐趣。","replies":[{"poster":"Jayce or fap","date":"2017-01-22T06:10:10.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You being a smartass doesn't change the subject, i doubt you go into games and refuse to speak english given that you normally speak english on the boards.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-22T07:16:29.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to, you know, when i played.

Rulebooks are statement of boundaries, they never go after people because they don't or can't read them, agree with the rules or otherwise, but only the people that crossed the boundaries; and it's not within both LoL's ToS and any credible nation's laws that using their non-official language or disagreeing with the laws is forbidden, the only thing that's forbidden is offending the stated rules.\n\nI mean, for example, have you read LoL's ToS or better, Australia's laws, word by word? Chances are you didn't, it's a fact that most people don't read Term of Use and laws unless it's work/academia/life related things. If so, aren't you just as \"guilty\" as those who can't understand it because both of you practically haven't read but \"agreed\" to the terms? Or is it that the rules are merely written in the language you understand and that suddenly makes it okay, just as if you've actually read it yourself?\n\nExample #2. Do you agree with Iraq's law and happen to be able to read and write say Arabic? If you don't agree and/or aren't able to understand the language, do you suppose say the Iraq law enforcement can immediately arrest you after you've entered their nation merely on the basis that you do not understand their laws and their language or whatever reasonings like that?\n\nYour logic is afaik, very flawed, not to mention very badly biased.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Reginleif","date":"2017-01-24T10:44:35.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Someone's been spending way too much time on Pauline Hanson's One Nation webpage. 😂😂😂","replies":[]}]}
