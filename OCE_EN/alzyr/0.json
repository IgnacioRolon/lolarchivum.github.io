( boosting scripts topic )","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hello everyone, today I write my first and last post ever on LoL forum. I am here to talk about boosting and my experience with it.\nI am an ex gold player, and this season i got placed in Bronze 4. I played around 50 games and i didn&#039;t figured out i could ever get back to gold, because each there is afks, really salty people that feeds and ruins intentionally, and this kind of stuff. I then decided to contact a boosting website : **[Boosting Website Removed]**.\nI paid 50 dollars for a bronze 3 &gt; silver 5 boost. I know that if i get catch i am banned 2 weeks but I still by the boost. <redacted> got me a booster. The booster said he was master. 2 weeks after my payment, my account was still in bronze. The booster has lost a lot of games and even worse : I realized that he used my account to make streams, youtube videos, and talking to friends. And in reality he was gold 3 only. I was angry so i contacted <redacted> again, i told them to get me someone that is good. Then, <redacted> sent me another person. A real challenger this time. He did only 8 games or 9, and i got silver 5. I was happy, because i was finally silver. I played some games in normal after 2 weeks without a game. Then, the next day, i log into my account and.... banned. PERMA banned. I didn&#039;t understand what the hell was going on. I then checked why i was banned. I got banned for scripting. I then realize that the boosters on my accounts did use scripts to win. I contact <redacted> to tell what is happening. No answer...\n\nI lost my account. I had 300 skins. All runes. All champs. Because of boosting. I am not looking for pity or anything, i am not looking for unban. I just wan&#039;t to warn people about the danger of boosting accounts. Never do it ever. If you are tilted because you are losing games stupidly, don&#039;t give up, don&#039;t tilt. Don&#039;t lose your mind like i did. Enjoy the game guys.\n\nThe perma ban sucks honestly... I have the name ID of the scripter booster. I don't know if I deserve this ban or not. But i'm mad at me... Riot if you wan't the name of the account send a message here or in private. Feeling like my life is over.\n\n**_Farewell._** And ~~sorry~~ my english sucks. Take care of you all.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-22T00:58:10.896+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"League of Legends is a game of steps: small goals you set for yourself that get you closer to your greater goal or simply self-improvement. Each win and loss is an experience that you can take, and from most of them you can learn from. However, if this is a farewell forever, I too can respect that. \n\nIf you'd like to report the player(s) for boosting, you can submit a ticket to Riot GMes Player Support who can investigate further. Submit it under General Questions > I have a Question, and it'll get to the right place.\n\nI wish you all the best, and if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask.\n\nRegards,\nWuks","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-23T05:56:14.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yaddy yadda blah blah blah.\n\nI hear all the same shit from people here, so far I have seen Gold, Diamond and Platinum players from previous seasons all saying the same, THEY CANNOT CLIMB OUT OF BRONZE!\n\nNo matter what shit people say, this season and the fucking dynamic queue has ruined the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-23T06:02:48.546+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=PO%%%KB4,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-06-23T05:56:14.778+0000)\n>\n> Yaddy yadda blah blah blah.\n> \n> I hear all the same shit from people here, so far I have seen Gold, Diamond and Platinum players from previous seasons all saying the same, THEY CANNOT CLIMB OUT OF BRONZE!\n> \n> No matter what shit people say, this season and the fucking dynamic queue has ruined the game.\n\nI've managed to climb from Silver to Platinum this season; everyone has their own take on Dynamic Queue, but to generalise your observations as facts doesn't provide for a strong argument.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-23T06:07:47.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"So all those other players who are in Bronze, who used to or are currently on other accounts not in Bronze, are not facts I should be using?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-23T06:13:22.531+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omni Presents,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=PO%%%KB4,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-23T06:07:47.551+0000)\n>\n> So all those other players who are in Bronze, who used to or are currently on other accounts not in Bronze, are not facts I should be using?\n\nYou can use them, but I don't think it makes for a strong argument. On the converse, I've made it from Silver 4 to Platinum 1-3, so I could perhaps say that Dynamic Queue has made it easier for players to climb.\n\nBut I digress. We should keep on the topic of scripting and suspensions.
