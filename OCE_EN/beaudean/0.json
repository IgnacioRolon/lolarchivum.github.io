Trying to sound as least salty as possible.\r\n\r\nRanked supporting, specifically lower ranked solo/duo, has become more of a game of luck rather than a game determined by skill. I do understand that this is a team based game, but when wining or losing is determined whether or losing is determined often by your team rather than your personal overall performance or participation in the team, I feel like something is up.\r\n\r\nI hate wording things so just in case let me try give an example. Promotions in lower ranked games require you to win over 1/2 of the games during this time to progress to the next rank. When the least (from experience) preferred role is the support, I often take it as I am impartial and fill every game. \r\nI feel though regardless of my own performance, if the game is tilted in favor of the enemy team, I am in one of the least influential roles on my team. Sure I (because lower ranked don&#039;t like to) warding and de-warding for the majority of the team, as well as the occasional roam, gank or save, but when it comes down to it, I can only &#039;support&#039; the team in many cases. If the team is a few sprinkles short of fairy bread, my addition or absence probably wont make a difference. \r\n\r\nWhat can I suggest to fix this, no idea. Am I saying supports need to have a larger impact in games, no. Hell my debate isn&#039;t even about supports. From my perspective, a solution would lie in re-vamping the way ranked occurs. For example, have &#039;ranked points&#039; similar to how they score things in chess. The points gradually build up or decrease, but you do not need to win X games in a row before climbing the ladder to the next division. \r\n\r\n[hr]\r\nFor example:\r\n(Note - I do not know the specifics of the ranked system so I am making it up.)\r\n\r\nLets assume all players are 1500 to start. \r\n\r\nBronze - 0-1250\r\n\r\nSilver 1250-2000\r\ngold 2000-3000\r\nplatnium 3000-4000\r\nDiamond 4000-5000\r\nMasters 5500-5750\r\nChallenger 5750+\r\n\r\nGames increase or decrease can stay the same I guess, averaging 16-25 for lower ranks and decreasing higher you go I guess.\r\n\r\n[hr]\r\n\r\nWill this fix my &#039;pet problem&#039; no. Will it help, I think so. If in 10 games vsing the same people. I got 12 out of 15 wins, the current system, assuming the last 3 games were losses, and the previous 10 got me into promos, I would still fail to climb the ladder. If I got 30 out of 60 wins, and the last 3 were in promotions, I would progress to the next rank. Regardless of how you climb, to rank up seems to relate to luck rather than skill...\r\n\r\nIf in the rare and barbaric chance that my &#039;imaginary system&#039; was added, a player who wins 50% of their games would hardly move in comparison to a player who won 80% of their games like in the example above.\r\n\r\nNOTE - I know I ramble and probably changed topics 10000 times, but I hope I got the point across in the end.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-08T23:25:52.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> as well as the occasional roam\n\nBig problem here already. If you want to carry on support (and i assure you it's possible, i went from silver to plat this season filling, which was mainly support) the best way is to roam a LOT. Pick champs with decent burst and good cc (Leona, blitz, annie, brand etc.) and you can snowball games really hard quite frequently. Also try to identify which of your teammates are most likely to carry and focus on snowballing/protecting them, this is very important if you're playing solo. Also look for every opportunity to get wards into the enemy jungle (when the jungler is top or just died somewhere etc.) so you can make plays on them too. Supports have a huge impact on the game in the early-mid game, try not to waste that opportunity by playing passively in lane and not doing much on the map. If you're only good at playing peeling supports find a duo that you KNOW will be able to carry in the lategame if you peel for them properly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-08T09:53:35.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm almost certain your idea for the ranked system is very similar to what we had in Season 1 and half of Season 2. I wasn't around then  so I don't really know why we removed it, but your \"promos problem\" will be fixed in Season 6. \n\nRead more [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/ranked-improvements.html) especially the part about Promo Helper.\n\nSupports can carry BTW, just roam and ward heaps.

I guess it does help a bit, not sure if it will fix. Oh well some change is better than none. \n\nAnd in regards to roaming, I tend to do it quite a bit XD I wouldn't say 'carry' but I do attempt to make an impact where possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-08T10:16:20.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roams depend on what champion you're on. Obviously Janna roams are pretty bad compared to Blitzcrank. Also, deep wards are so strong. Ward the enemies bot-side buff, and watch the jungler fail 90% of his ganks because everyone sees him 20 seconds before he's a threat. \n\nOh, and ping, because everyone in Bronze and Silver is like Lee Sin, they can't see shit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
