Long suffering part time author. XD This was originally a lot longer. At one point it was almost twice the word limit so I had to cut out some ideas and descriptions! The word count it exactly 1,500 words. Anywho, I wanted to write something with Rakka in it, so here it is:\r\n\r\n[Life and Mercy](http://oi64.tinypic.com/2zspsb8.jpg)\r\n_Ashe knew her journey would have been over a long time ago if they had never met, if the healer had not stayed near her side and helped her fight. OR: three times Soraka saved Ashe&#039;s life and the one time Ashe returned the favour._\r\n\r\n**1.**\r\n\r\n&quot;Don&#039;t move - you are not yet strong enough.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe soft words were accompanied by a warm electric shock running up and down her arm. Magic, she had felt it before, but never like this, never in such a light feeling that made her feel like she could take on the world. Ashe had the strangest feeling that if she opened her eyes the blood and her wounds would be gone. When she finally got her eyes to cooperate she was right - but she was not prepared for what else she saw.\r\n\r\nThe Legend - the myth - the fabled Star Child herself was staring down at Ashe in concern.\r\n\r\nThe archer found herself completely at a loss for words.\r\n\r\n&quot;Your wounds have been healed but your strength still needs to be recovered. The men that attacked you had such evil in their hearts, their work was strong and deep.&quot;\r\n\r\nAshe couldn&#039;t keep her eyes of her - watching Soraka&#039;s every moment, they way that she just seemed to float from place to place, like she wasn&#039;t bound to the way that gravity held people like her down. Her golden eyes were brighter than anythings she had even seen, shining almost as brightly as the green light that was shimmering and shifting in her hands.\r\n\r\nEverything about her was perfect, nothing seemed out of place - from the silver strands of her hair to the shimmer of her horn, even to her clothes, immaculate. Ashe could not find a single fault.\r\n\r\nUntil a scar appeared, bright and red down across her forearm, cutting through the purple hue of her skin. Ashe didn&#039;t miss that it happened at the exact time one of her&#039;s disappeared.\r\n\r\n&quot;Wait, wait - no...&quot;\r\n\r\nSoraka just stared at her with piercing eyes. &quot;Rest - your troubles will be gone in the morning.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd they were  - as was she.\r\n\r\n**2.**\r\n\r\nThe bow flew out of her hand, landing with a soft thump behind the wall that she had just been pushed up against. Her head reeled at the pain of the projectile (she didn&rsquo;t even have a chance to figure out what it was, bullet, arrow or blast of pure magic) that had crashed into her hand.\r\n\r\nThis was not good - Ashe would always be confident with her bow in hand, always knew she could at least get herself out of trouble, if not take care of said trouble. But without her bow, the enchanted ice wrapping around her fingers, she felt naked, exposed like a nerve. Not a leader but a nobody, a nothing. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You should have killed when you had the chance Freljord scum - mercy is a weakness.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe knew what was coming - the charging up - the flowing pulse of magic intertwining around him as he pulled back his weapon. In mere seconds she would be hit with his ultimate power, and not even her quick reflexes would be enough to save her. She had seen this too many time in her journey, in her fight to save Freljord, although Ashe had never been on the end of one she had no doubt how she would fare. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Mercy is not weakness.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe laughed, and pulled back his weapon, ready to fire the final attack. But that laughter suddenly turned into a yell of shock, a yelp in pain as a blue and white pulse of power fell over him, draining him of all his magic as he stumbled out of the circle of silencing magic that had burned his skin.\r\n\r\nIt only took a  few seconds for him to stumble back, to shake away the feeling and regain his composure, but a few seconds was all Ashe needed. By the time the man looked up the bow was once again rightfully in her hands. By the time he looked up, the beautiful ice arrow was heading towards him.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I never miss.&rdquo; Ashe muttered, turning away from the man as he fell to the ground. Not taking delight in having to take his life when all she wanted was passage past. She had extended him mercy and he had shoved it back in her face with no regard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thank you - for saving me.&rdquo; This comment was directed towards the large grassland that Ashe couldn&rsquo;t see past. She couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the figure that walked out to stare at her with golden eyes. &ldquo;It seems you have once again been here just as I needed it.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I go where I am needed, for the life of others.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAshe made note that Soraka wasn&rsquo;t as immaculate as she had last seen her. Sure she still held a air of beauty and grace about her. Something otherworldly, but her time with mortals had obviously dulled her glow just slightly. Her purple skin no longer looked like it was made of the stars themselves.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I still appreciate it and I-&rdquo; Ashe was stopped short as a long forgotten familiar feeling flickered through her pain, green golden light encircling it. She wasn&rsquo;t all that surprised to see, Soraka flinch slightly in front of her, the star child&rsquo;s own hand turning red with blood under the glow of magic.\r\n\r\nAshe opened her mouth to protest, to tell her that she needed to stop sacrificing herself - but in the mere moment it took for the archer to look down at her hand in frustration and then back again - the healer was gone.\r\n\r\n**3.**\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We need to stop meeting like this.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSoraka tilted her head slightly to the side, as if confused by the lightness in Ashe&rsquo;s voice. To the star child this was all she knew, this is how she met people - why she met people.  What other purpose was there for her to met and know people if it was not to protect them.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I had a feeling it was you, at first I thought the golden light had been an attack - but then I recognized the feeling.&rdquo; Ashe couldn&rsquo;t stop smiling at the healer in front of her. When everything had seemed lost for her tribe, fighting back intruders intent on leaving none alive Ashe had prayed, had wished for a miracle. And it had came, in a healing light called down by Soraka. &ldquo;I glad to see as well, that this time you did not seem to take any damage for our healing.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThere were no visible injuries on the Star Child and for this Ashe was grateful, it still turned in her stomach so much that she had to suffer for others to be protected. All of the tales of the many people she had saved, about the many people that the Star Child had stood beside and rescues, and all that time - she was giving up her own health and life.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You saved the life of myself and many of those in my tribes - for that, Star Child, we are in your debt. For that you will always have a friend in Freljord, in the tribe of Avarosa.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I was merely doing as the stars have called me - I heal those that need it, no matter their name.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nAshe had a feeling that Soraka had never really had anyone to call a friend before - she was hoping to change that. &ldquo;Please, at least let us show our thanks by doing something - rest here, eat - perhaps restock your supplies, or upgrade your orbs.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSoraka somewhat stiffened at the offer. &ldquo;I - I shall go visit your tribes stores.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt was a small victory and Ashe knew that she would be gone by first light, but it still made her smile.\r\n\r\n**+1**\r\n\r\nThis was it. She knew it, she could feel it - and she could hear his laughs and heaving breathing as he moved slowly towards her. She had no strength, no mana, her elixirs had dried up a long time ago. This was why she did not fight, this was why she only protected. She was staring death right in the face, and it was going to claim her, claim her and take her heart for his own.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You are nothing but a fool Star Child, you always have been.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA small pulse of magic filled her and Soraka threw out a pleading call to the stars, the burst of light catching the advancing attack and stunning him slightly. Soraka could only run a few paces before a pain crashed into her back, as her skin burst open and blood started to soak her skin, her silver hair staining.\r\n\r\nHer vision swarmed and she felt her body falling forward, towards the ground. Her mind screamed at her and in the distance of it, at the back - she faintly heard the stars scream out in pain as well.\r\n\r\nThere was a voice, calling her name - yelling it, getting closer and closer, stronger and stronger. She recognized it, in the back of her mind - somewhere in her memory.  The word friend came unbidden into her mind\r\n\r\nThe last thing Soraka saw before she closed her eyes was the glistening ice arrow as it soared past her.\r\n\r\n**End**\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, please feel free to leave any comments or questions :D\r\nSee you all on the Rift\r\n-Thief","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:27:49.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reads so well and so beautifully.
