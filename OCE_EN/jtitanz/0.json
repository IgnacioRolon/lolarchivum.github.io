This most often leads to the loss and in my opinion is very unfair. So why cant you and to whom this concerns implement a system where when someone afk&#039;s for a certain period of time grants the losing team a loss prevent with the winning team still winning the LP. I think this would save a lot of frustration and people trying to rank up.\r\n\r\nThank you, Jtitanz.","replies":[{"poster":"Jtitanz","date":"2015-09-03T16:18:12.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just had a game where I had 2 Afk's, then lost 18Lp.

You will get those kids who are just trying it and suck ass who leave. You will get those who have had enough of the crap players and just leave, or those players having either a bad day or are being simply beat fair and square, or anything, if something bad happens players start revolting and leaving. Or someone's internet die.\n\nTo implement some sort of system would take a lot of thought, somehow stop your rank lose when it is not your fault, but somehow make it so players can't abuse it? I can think of one way and that is to make it so you can't have too many accounts per IP, but than that stops families who play with say 3-4 kids not able to play together.\n\nThe main issue are the kids, those who are actually kids and don't give a fuck, you simply can't stop them from having a hissy fit and either leaving or forcing others to leave with their bad play or behaviour.\n\nWhat can be done, those players who do AFK or leave, put a damn mark on their account so if they keep doing it they are forced to take all the rank lose onto themselves and if when they get to Bronze V? Give them a time out period on playing ranked games, make them drop to Bronze V and stay their, that is the only real choice.\n\nEven take that same mentality and put it onto the report system. Players who are close or have been banned, put a mark to their name also, if they fuck up, give them a time out, the only way to make players learn is not to ban them, but to force them to stop playing for some time so they can realise what they are doing before they are banned and allow other players who want to play to have a good time without being trolled or having free loses and ruined games.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-01T17:17:01.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=akaRaven,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=8QRquzao,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-09-01T15:16:47.561+0000)\n>\n> What can be done, those players who do AFK or leave, put a damn mark on their account so if they keep doing it they are forced to take all the rank lose onto themselves and if when they get to Bronze V?

A time-out from participating in ranked games is the only reasonable solution I can think of. It's a light enough punishment that even if it's an unintentional computer or internet problem or just your weeb brother unplugging the modem because he's a lil donghead it's still not the worst. You have all the other game modes after all!\nAnd it'll hopefully discourage those who do so intentionally at least a little, and if not, well they'll only be able to do it a few times before getting locked out.\n\nI fully support this idea.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-08-31T17:08:34.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be great, really.. but sadly you'd find a lot of people abuse that and have one player intentionally afk/exit the game in order to grant the rest of the team a free pass.\nAdding a huge penalty to the player who afks/exits is a solution but then it just isn't fair for those who genuinely do not wish to leave the game but have internet or computer problems. You can't win either way, I really don't see Rito doing anything or too much about this.. But I do admit it sucks. A lot.\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jtitanz","date":"2015-09-01T14:12:19.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish you weren't right XD.
