The allocated time for someone to reconnect seems really short. My client crashed, I reloaded, logged in, and pressed reconnect and loaded into the game AS the vote was in progress, two votes for yes and well it&#039;s been remade causing a loss of LP and possibly leaverbuster. \r\nThis has happened 4 of the 5 times ive had the client crash on me since the /Remake system has been released. \r\nMy laptop isn&#039;t overly slow, I run the game with everything on highest (with shadows turned off) at 50-60 fps with you-tube running in the background. But it seems I can&#039;t reconnect in time. \r\n\r\nAnyone else experienced similar circumstances? Because it&#039;s putting me off playing the game at all even when disconnecting is a rare problem.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-03T02:26:34.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The allocated time for someone to reconnect seems really short.\n\nHonestly it's annoyingly long if your not the one crashing, because realistically you have to take into account all the time you took getting into the game (For ranked this can easily be 10 minutes) then you have to lose 3 minutes before you can even remake, so you basically waste 15ish minutes of your time because someone can't connect.\n\nAnd your issue, is just that, your issue, it's not something that should be dealt with by anyone else, you need to fix your crashing problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-03T02:20:05.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it sucks but you gotta consider it from the other side. Would you want to wait 4/5 minutes in a 4v5 before you can remake? The time you spend in champ select, the loading screen, waiting to remake and then going through it all again just to play one game can add up really quickly. If a future patch were to add 10 bans, for Ranked of course, this'll make the entire process even longer and as such I doubt they will tweak the remake times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-09-03T02:09:24.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having people disconnect in my games puts me off.
