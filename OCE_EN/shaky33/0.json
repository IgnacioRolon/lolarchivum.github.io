This is solo/duo ranked and I won 5 games out of the 10 and got ranked in **BRONZE FIVE**. Are you bloody kidding me riot, my friend won 5 games and got placed silver five. Its not even like I did that badly in this games, positive pretty much all games. \r\n\r\nLast season I was an absolute noob, fed in all games and won 1. And got placed Bronze three. Riot this is absolute bullshit, unless this is some sort of bug  please explain what the hell is going on.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-23T10:34:21.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A large factor in where you are placed is where you were last season.

What if a player became good just playing in norms after having a bad last season. Then playing decent, winning a fair amount of games then being put in the lowest rank. Doesn't seem very smart.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-23T14:21:53.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 wins is kinda average out of 10. You basically have a 50% winrate during your placements against other bronze 5 players, so you probably aren't going to be placed much higher than that. \n\nI think the rule of thumb is 6 or 7/10 placement wins to maintain your elo. Anything less lowers it by quite a bit, anything above will generally score you maybe a tier higher unless you're high plat, maybe 2 if you get 10/10.\n\nAlso the mean mmr is around silver 3. He probably netted more of an mmr loss than you did, but over those 5 lost games, he probably only lost enough mmr to land him in silver 5, whereas your mmr started off in bronze 5 and may have actually risen, but was still bronze 5 mmr. Also if you played a lot of ranked games last season you probably stabilised, or in other terms, elohell, where your elo becomes so hard to budge that without a sudden increase in ability, you probably won't be able to leave the elo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-02-27T10:10:39.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's ok we all go through the phases of rejection.\n1.
