I haven&#039;t been able to properly connect to a match since then. Is there something going on today? Normally my ping is around 190-180, but today it has been around 230, spiking up to 500. I&#039;ve barely been able to play matches and I&#039;m just trying to earn enough IP to get a champion. I play on the West Coast of the US. It hasn&#039;t ever been a problem before today. I know it&#039;s a problem with the server, because I tried the NA server and it worked perfectly. I checked my internet speed, my router, everything is running fine on my end. Is this going to be a permanent change in ping/lag? Am I going to have to pay to move my account to a different server?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-10T00:35:40.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nStill experiencing this issue? \n\nWhat country are you connecting from?\n>I play on the West Coast of the US\n\nIf you're in the US, your best choice for where you should play would be NA.","replies":[]}]}
