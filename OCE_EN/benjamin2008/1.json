As a malphite I started ganking as much as I could and we were finally even and nasus got a lot of stacks. Then I was recalling didn&#039;t notice that my team was actually doing baron then they actually got it but everyone died.Then everyone in chat started to be like OMG malph you threw this game so hard. Now we lost because of you. Then they just won&#039;t stop blaming also I admitted it was my bad but they just won&#039;t stop being negative to me. Then we lost the game and in the ingame lobby my teammate was all like GG malph threw, suck dick at grouping and etc. All I wanted to say is if as a jungler I ganked a lot when I have my ulti and helped my team but they just won&#039;t remember the good things I did and just focused on how horrible that mistake I did was. Finally I just wanted to say league is just a game don&#039;t be way too serious about it just have fun. If you are not having fun whats the point of playing.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-04-04T11:06:46.323+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Benjamin2008,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EA5TnVfi,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-04-04T03:12:52.637+0000)\n>\n> So I was playing malphite jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-04T15:32:03.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens mostly the time on other lanes as well. Either it's the lane or the jungle, team comp from the start of champ select to see how it goes however the teams morale are looked upon. Thought it may have been a negative game, hopefully you have learnt from this experience, it's that one game that you will get. Ranked, even though its meant to be a competitive environment, make sure that you are enjoying the game like everyone else is. So I agree with you to enjoy yourself when you are serious in your ranked games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-04T03:34:39.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're playing ranked, which is a competitive environment, not normals, which is the environment for fun.
