A part of that is determining consistency to reduce and aim to eliminate false positives. Depending on the scope of their actions, the system may not pick up on it right away, and that's where your report does count towards establishing a pattern of negative behaviour. The current system is tuned to follow an escalation path of a 10-game chat restriction, 25-game chat restriction, a 14-day suspension, and lastly a permanent suspension. Single-game escalated bans are rare, and are generally the result of excessive toxicity.\n\nYou can read more about the IFS here:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-","replies":[]}]}
