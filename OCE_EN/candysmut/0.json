I can&#039;t even close the game so the only thing I can do is turn off my laptop. When i try to reconnnect it does the same thing. I can&#039;t manage to play a game on my laptop even though it has good enough specs to run the game.\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n-windows 10\r\n-8gb ram\r\n-intel i7 4700MQ\r\n-nvidia gtx 740m 2gb\r\n-1080x1920 screen resolution\r\nmodel name: HP Envy 15 (2014 i believe).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be nice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:19:32.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you tried [repairing your client](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes#wq6)?
