Say for example, that I somehow manage to get my honour back up to level 2 by November [rather unlikely], would I then be eligible for ranked rewards associated with this level? Or will the fact that I have received this temporary suspension on my account mean that regardless of the fact I may have brought my honour level back up to an acceptable level, I still won&#039;t receive the rewards? As I am aware this was the case with ranked rewards last year if you were to recieve a suspension before a certain date in the year, that you would not be eligible.\n\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-12T14:03:49.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be eligible for ranked rewards this season you must:\n\n1.

If you have an active punishment your honour will be either 0 or 1 anyway, disqualifying you that way. It's still the case it's just a bit redundant to explicitly state it now.\n\nIt's stated that fraud or erroneous punishments don't disqualify you, which really only applies to false punishments (in which case your punishment would be revoked and rewards restored) or chargebacks, for which the account remains unuseable until the chargeback is resolved anyway. Any other punishments of that nature would generally result in permanent suspension of the account, or a punishment for boosting/sharing, at which point it's irrelevant.","replies":[{"poster":"Adelia","date":"2018-08-13T05:20:23.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for replying and explaining this for me, and any others who read it. Do you know roughly how long it takes now to progress within the honour system? [Of course it's different for everyone, depending on how 'honourable' you are, how many honours you receive, whether they be from premades or strangers and how often you play], I know that at one point it was really quite slow and that a few months ago in the patch notes it was mentioned that they had applied a fix to honour level progression, just that they never really elaborated on exactly what the changes were, beyond that.\n\nIf anyone knows I'd be grateful for the info. n_n\n\n{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-13T06:30:27.081+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know they've made the trek from Honour 0 to Honour 2 a bit easier than it was at the start of the year, but details are a bit (most likely intentionally to prevent abuse cases) hazy there. Like you say progress also depends on a lot of individual factors.\n\nIn essence the fastest way to progress your honour is to play lots of games while consistently demonstrating positive behaviour. Things like encouraging teammates or brushing off mistakes for the bigger picture, making the effort to communicate effectively and adapting to the needs of your team and the game.\n\nHow fast you progress largely comes down to consistency. If you are playing half your games positively and half negatively, you're still going to be progressing slower than a neutral player, because that negativity prevents you from earning *any* honour for that game, even if it doesn't result in a punishment.\n\nAs for actual timelines, for the above reasons everyone's gains are going to be different, but on average players appear to be earning roughly a checkpoint every month give or take. How that compares below Honour 2 I honestly don't know. It might be slower or it might be a bit faster.\n\nGiven this, it may or may not be possible to earn your honour back before season end. Even if you don't however, the higher your honour at the end of season, the better the place you'll be in when honour resets at season start.\n\nKnow that accepting responsibility for actions resulting in a punishment is admirable in and of itself, and making the effort to vent negativity in a way that doesn't affect others means you are unlikely to be punished again, though I will mention that a 14 day ban (I assume that's what you mean by temporary ban) puts you on very thin ice. Next punishment issued will be a permanent suspension, so be careful.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LeagueOfTrolling","date":"2018-08-13T06:28:55.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it takes ages - i've been on honor level 1 for 3/4 months.
