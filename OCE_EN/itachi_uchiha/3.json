Tap tap tap tap. _\r\n\r\nKarthus&rsquo; curled talons made even the harmless act of tapping the table, sound sinister.  The Death Singer stared blankly into space as the countless airport noises swirled around him.  He stirred slowly and a cold dead eye wandered over the sky lounge&rsquo;s clock, the leather of his Pentakill jacket creaked even with this subtle movement. Piltover international airport was not known for its efficiency. His gaze came to rest over the other band members, Yorick slouched in the chair, clumsily drawing faces in his breath on the window, Mordekaiser was seated on a couch across from Karthus, his enormous bulk towering far above anyone else in the lounge, a copy of Mages Weekly pinned between giant fingers. Sona sat on the other end, nose buried in some thick classic novel, The Death singer didn&rsquo;t even bother to look for the drummer, the Viking&rsquo;s heavy snoring made his position painfully apparent to everyone. \r\n\r\n_Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap. _\r\n\r\n_(Ding) &ldquo;Corki Air, Flight 107 to Demacia, boarding now,&rdquo;_ the voice echoed around.\r\nKarthus groaned, when on Runeterra would their flight be ready?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;At this rate, we will miss our own concert,&rdquo; he muttered depressingly.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser looked up, peering over his reading glasses, &ldquo;The mountain regions are notorious for bad weather, give it time.&rdquo; The metal giant&rsquo;s words only irritated Karthus more.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do we have a big crowd?&rdquo; The giant spoke again.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Big enough.&rdquo; The Death Singer replied, the boredom clear in his tone. \r\n&ldquo;Apparently one guy actually bought 400 seats.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Jeez, he must be a big guy!&rdquo; Joked Mordekaiser with a metallic chuckle.\r\n&ldquo;who was it?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKarthus pulled out the register, the Pentakill logo emblazoned on the front cover, opened it and ran a yellow talon down the list.\r\n&ldquo;He paid with Targon debit,&rdquo; Karthus muttered \r\n&ldquo;The name he gave was Mr&hellip;&rdquo; His talon came to rest next to a name, \r\n&ldquo;&hellip;Pantheon, with a P.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Strange, I thought he hated music.&rdquo; said Mordekaiser, as he went back to his magazine. \r\nKarthus made a sound that was vaguely reminiscent of caring and returned to staring blankly into space.\r\n\r\n_Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap._\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well look here!&rdquo; Mordekaiser exclaimed, slapping the pages of Mages Weekly.\r\n&ldquo;They say the lost Emperor of Shurima has returned! Imagine that.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;hmmmm.. What? Ohhhhhhhhh just great! Fan-tastic!.&rdquo; moaned The Death Singer, scowling deeply. He flipped out his black book opened it to a very old old page and angrily scribbled out a name before slamming it shut between his fingers.\r\n&ldquo;So! Anyone else coming back from the dead?&rdquo; he said through his teeth, glaring at Mordekaiser.\r\n\r\nMordekaiser continued un-phased,\r\n&ldquo;Nope, but it says here that Sona&rsquo;s solo DJ album just passed Pentakill&rsquo;s latest one on the charts.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKarthus leered over the table at Sona, who sheepishly hid her head in her book. \r\n&ldquo;Give me some good news then, what about the patch notes?&rdquo; Karthus said.â€¨&ldquo;Flip to the back.&rdquo;\r\nMordekaiser shuffled though the pages.\r\n&ldquo;Look for Zed,&rdquo; Karthus muttered, \r\n&ldquo;any nerfs?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMordekaiser looked over the page for a minute.\r\n&ldquo;Nope, still nothing.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Of course not&hellip;&rdquo; Karthus spat, with murder in his voice.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;They did reduce the AP levels on Zhonya&rsquo;s Hourgl&mdash;.&rdquo; Mordekaiser continued to read.\r\n\r\nKarthus let out a sarcastic laugh.\r\n&ldquo;Hahahaha, greeeeat! Next you&rsquo;ll be telling me that Quicksilver Sash doesn&rsquo;t work against him either&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nKarthus&rsquo; words stopped Mordekaiser mid sentence, his eyes fell back to the single line written at the bottom of the page. Coughing to stifle his next few potentially fatal words, The Iron Revenant quickly slipped the magazine out of Karthus&rsquo; sight. \r\n\r\n_Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap._\r\n\r\n_(DIng) &ldquo;Corki Air, Flight 129 to Targon, boarding now.&rdquo;_\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Finally!&rdquo; Karthus exclaimed, throwing his arms in the air.\r\nThe band members fumbled around picking up various pieces of hand luggage.\r\n\r\nOlaf was less than pleased to be woken, he had been in the middle of an especially violent dream of his death.  He grudgingly snapped up his gear and began following the others to the boarding gate.  The attention span of a sleepy Viking however, is short, and he was quickly torn away from the group by an excitingly colourful candy dispenser.  Sona, the ever responsible one of the group, was mid way through handing her passport to the attendant when they heard the crash.  Every head in the airport snapped around at the sound, just to see Olaf standing guiltily over the shattered remains of the dispenser, part of it still caught up in the chain hanging from his belt, thousands of brightly coloured boiled sweets rolled across the airport floor.\r\n&ldquo;Ill.. uhh.. pay for that.. ha ha&rdquo; Said a now very red Viking, slowly pulling out an old wallet that clearly didn&rsquo;t hold enough currency to pay for anything.\r\nThe look from The Death Singer&rsquo;s snarling face could have turned even Braum&rsquo;s powerful heart cold, if Karthus had any blood left he might have burst a vein. Olaf didn&rsquo;t know it of course, but that was the closest he had ever come to his precious death.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Passport please.&rdquo; the gate attendant demanded staring blankly at the hunched figure before her. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, am Yorick Mori.&rdquo; The figure&rsquo;s words fell from his mouth like tar, slow and slurred.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I see that Sir, please put that lantern out.&rdquo; the attendant pointed to Yorick&rsquo;s trademark lantern.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, am Yorick Mori, The Gravedigger.&rdquo; was the reply.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sir, you are not allowed an open flame on the plane, airport policy.&rdquo; The attendant&rsquo;s voice had less emotion that most of the dead in the Shadow Isles.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I, am Yorick Mor&mdash;&ldquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Thank. You. Yorick.&rdquo; The Death Singer&rsquo;s voice dripped with venom as his bony fingers scraped what little saliva there was off his tongue and pinched out the candle of Yorick&rsquo;s lantern, the flame left this existence with a bubbling hiss, and Yorick lumbered off.\r\n&ldquo;Finally!&rdquo; Karthus sighed, and slapped his own passport down on the desk. \r\n\r\nA Shadow Isles passport is not a pretty thing, the curled paper is greenish yellow and bound by something that could very well be human skin, the thing smells like death itself, but the attendant picked it up and scanned it without a thought.  A little red light leapt into being on the hextech dashboard, she looked up at the frustrated Death Singer and produced a bag.\r\n&ldquo;Is this your bag sir?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Why yes it is.&rdquo; Karthus squeezed the words out from behind a forced smile.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sir we found this in your bag.&rdquo; The attendant pulled out a bottle of face cream from Karthus&rsquo; bag.\r\n\r\nIt took all of The Death Singer&rsquo;s restraint, not to rip out her soul and burn it on the spot.\r\n&ldquo;Yes? AAAND?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sir this is more than 100 millilitres of liquid, you can&rsquo;t take this on the plane.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;And why PRAY, can I not?&rdquo; Karthus spat, well aware of the growing line of disgruntled Rakkor tribesmen behind him, his forced smile now decidedly absent.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sir, it poses a potential safety hazard, explosive devices are not an impossibility.&rdquo; The attendant&rsquo;s expressionless face un-changed.\r\n\r\nKarthus snatched the bottle up in a flurry, waving it in her face.\r\n&ldquo;THIS!, IS FACE CREAM! I HAVE FRAGILE SKIN ON ACCOUNT OF BEING DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS! **THIS IS NOT, AND WILL NEVER BE A BOMB&mdash;**&ldquo;\r\nIt was at that point that Karthus was hit by a bus.\r\n\r\nAt least.. it felt like a bus. His head still reeled with the impact, but he was vaguely aware that the bus was yelling at him. On closer inspection however, it wasn&rsquo;t a bus at all but a huge white bear in a security uniform, pinning him down.\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;.SIR.. LET GO OF THE BOMB!&rdquo;\r\nKarthus quickly released his grip on the bottle which clattered to the floor, a large police woman with mechanical hands pounced on it\r\n&ldquo;BOMB SECURE!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n40 minutes later after being released from handcuffs obviously not meant for undead wrists, he was back in line at the gate handing his passport over.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Sorry sir, after your commotion we revoked your first class seat, you have been moved to economy class.&rdquo; The attendant said.\r\n\r\nKarthus snatched his passport back, with the mental note to make sure her soul found its way directly to The Chain Warden upon her death.  He shimmied down the isle to his allocated seat, and sat down right next to the fattest man ever seen. The man&rsquo;s greasy orange beard smelt of alcohol, he was asleep and making bodily noises, The Death Singer despaired. Karthus had just begun wondering which end of the man they were coming from, when a relatively attractive Ionian woman sat down on the other side. Karthus&rsquo; spirits lifted, perhaps the 12 hour flight wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad after all! The lady adjusted her seatbelt before unwrapping the bundle in her arms...\r\n\r\n revealing the small disgruntled face, of an uncomfortable infant.","replies":[]}
