I haven't used Cho for a while now and only noticed this issue today, not sure how else to go about reporting this issue to Riot. I know how the ultimate works as I have been using Cho since close of BETA on NA server and have kept up to date with all patch notes. I killed two enemies before dying during this game and did not receive one stack. I did not receive any stacks at any point upon killing an enemy with feast during this game. Has anyone else encountered this error too? What should I do in going about to reporting this to Riot?\nThanks~{{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T11:20:03.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a bug, which belongs in the [bug report section](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) (it's on NA but that's what the OCE link takes you too).\n\nI've played Cho'Gath but I haven't noticed this myself.
