Firstly, you need to be must faster. You could've summarized this in 25 seconds with a clearer less boring explanation.\n\n**\"Hey Viewers! Maximum Spice here, did you know if you hover your cursor over either a Pink Ward, Warding Totem, Sightstone or Trackers Knife in your inventory you can see an indicator of which one will be deleted if you placed another? \n\nThis only occurs if you have placed the maximum amount, 3/3. This X indicator (Show indicator) simply shows which one will disappear if you place another.\nAnd of course, the same applies to Pink wards but only indicates one since you can only place one.\n\nI hope you've learned something new and thanks for watching! On my next video I'll be doing a Twitch game play and guide. Cya next time!\"**\n\nDo this on every one of your videos and you will get better ratings, more views and A LOT more subscribers. \nRead this in an exciting tone and time yourself. See how much better it is? Hope this helps. Good luck with your Youtube career.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[]}]}
