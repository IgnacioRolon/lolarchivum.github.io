He is so strong right now and has been for about a month yet no one uses him. I used ONLY shen to carry from plat 3 - diamond 3 in 2 weeks. I believe if I had more time i could reach challenger using only shen too.\r\n\r\nTake a look and let me know what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-25T03:12:46.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nI haven't checked out the guide yet, but I will in a few hours. However, I agree with you on Shen being a very strong pick right now. As you mentioned, you do not need as much mechanical skill, but game knowledge helps out alot. Shens ult and taunt can completely carry teamfights, and even though he is a tank, he still can dish out a fair bit of damage. As mentioned before, I will check out the actual guide later and give you feedback then. Looking forward to checking out your guide.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-03-25T04:09:20.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool cheers man. 100% spot on tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Talwyn","date":"2016-03-25T08:52:12.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\nSo that was actually really amazing and I ended up subscribing to you. Definitely a lot better then what I expected. I really liked how in depth you went into alot of things and your mic was really clear. I don't really have too many this to point out, the only semi obvious one I can see is the fact you say um frequently. This isn't really a big problem and can easily be fixed, but can be distracting at some points. I really hope you continue making these kinds of guides as well to be honest. Hope that helps, sorry there wasn't anything too negative I could point out though. Have a great day ^ - ^\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-03-25T11:39:14.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool man.
