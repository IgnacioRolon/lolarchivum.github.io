I have full knowledge of the champions I play and play against, can cs pretty well, can ward effectively, I check the map every 4-5 seconds, I know how to build against champions such as assassins when they are strong and I know when to use flash and my other summoner spells effectively. The only thing I haven't been able to get good at is solo carrying every game because of the players I have to play with in bronze elo :/","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-04-11T05:45:16.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That can be many different reasons tho. It could simply be the role your playing. A fantastic adc main can struggle to climb (that was me). Switch to a top lane tank with how strong they are, diamond freelo plz. \n\nIt could be not playing enough, or getting constant bad luck. Could be you are just where your meant to be. Bronze can be tough to climb out of tho cos of many afks and trolls. So the main thing is, picking the RIGHT champion who CAN solo carry. Adc's cannot do this very well. A mid lane or jungler (or current top tier tanks) can do this easily.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-11T10:33:32.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a top and jungle main and I play {{champion:122}} and {{champion:107}}","replies":[{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-04-11T23:36:37.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Daruis can be insane but also can be useless, depends on enemy team comp. Rengar however, if you keep practicing can easily carry someone to diamond.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
