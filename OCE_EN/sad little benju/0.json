When an enemy ward dies (either times out or is destroyed) is will make a teemo shroom activate and explode if the two are close to each other. Is this meant to happen? Haven&#039;t tried it with ally wards. Also I&#039;m 4-0 with teeto this pre season.","replies":[{"poster":"M2001ARYAN","date":"2016-02-13T19:10:59.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This doesn't happen anymore though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-14T02:52:53.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Wards trigger as units now i believe (because unit collision is so annoying with wards right now) when they are non-invisible they would trigger anything a unit would.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2015-11-14T02:12:48.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do that now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-14T02:07:14.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"send them a letter at there support page","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-11-14T01:18:10.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wards shouldn't be blowing up shrooms.","replies":[]}]}
