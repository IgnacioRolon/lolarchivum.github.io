There's two ways you can modify sound settings: In-game by pushing ESC and the little cogwheel at the top right of your client (out of game). If you're doing this out of your game, click the cogwheel and scroll down to \"In-game\" and click \"Sound.\" There is a sound bar for pings and a checkbox at the very bottom that says \"disable all sound.\" It doesn't look like disable all sound is checked, but I would make sure just in case. Let me know if that fixes the issue!","replies":[{"poster":"Memelord Sans","date":"2018-07-02T07:08:45.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue even after checking the disable all sound check box and the sound bar.","replies":[]}]}]}
