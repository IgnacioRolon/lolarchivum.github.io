These actions because we&#039;re helpless to do ANYTHING about cause a lot of anger in league, i personally have had account bans due to being toxic. I think the game would benefit from a self mute option or being able to unbind the enter key it forces players not to be able to get themselves into situation where they can abuse other players and get themselves banned. it&#039;s a win, win.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-10T01:23:16.923+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Or you can not be a dick. I've seen many chat bans in my day and wanted a way to mute myself too. Tyler1 had even begged riot for something similar so his account wouldn't get banned and he instead wouldn't be able to talk. But communication is an important aspect to league of legends if you plan on playing as a team. That is why they prefer to see players reform. Like myself for example #reformed.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-12T05:41:06.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"-Dont be a dick\n-OCE\npick one. \n\nAlso, highly doubt reforming happens considering i get nothing but some of the worst (personality wise moreso than skillwise) time and time again. \nConsidering these people do nothing BUT be toxic, without punishment i seriously doubt the reform thing is true.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-13T10:28:19.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got chat banned for 10 games yesterday, I guess you're right if u play oce you're bound to get chat banned for literally anything lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-13T12:19:44.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WildHamster,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dhJmk6si,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-02-13T10:28:19.359+0000)\n>\n> I got chat banned for 10 games yesterday, I guess you&#x27;re right if u play oce you&#x27;re bound to get chat banned for literally anything lmao\n\nI got a chatban for agreeing with someone at one stage. \nI regret nothing of that day.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-02-14T00:52:52.971+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do not regret the sins you make as they are the mold that make the man.
