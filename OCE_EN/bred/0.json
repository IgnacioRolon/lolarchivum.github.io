The ranking system (S,A,B,C,D) should determine the amount of LP you gain for a win, and lose for a loss. \r\n\r\nFor example: Say you are playing a Ranked Solo/Duo game and have a team mate that plays extremely bad, to the point of receiving a D Level grade. Note that to achieve this, the player would either need to be lagging to the point that they should not be playing, or intentionally feeding. On the other hand, say you have another team mate who plays extremely well, and should obviously play at a higher level and gets an S Level grade. Now assuming that they have average MMR&#039;s for their ELO (Which is safe to say this is what the majority of players have), a loss would result in both players losing the same amount of LP, and if they win both will recieve the same amount of LP.\r\n\r\nHow does this inevitable pay off seem fair? Is Riot not trying to reward players who are serious and would like to be better at the game? Or do they just not care enough to update the system in place, which seems old-school and out of place, considering how the game has evolved so drastically since its release.\r\n\r\nI believe that Riot may be working towards this in the future, otherwise I can&#039;t see why they would implement the grading system, but I can&#039;t understand why it is yet to be put into place in ranked games. So please Riot, think about using a system for ranked games as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAM WINS:\r\n\r\n(S-,S,S+) Player - Gain Approx 30 LP\r\n(A-,A,A+) Player - Gain Approx 25 LP\r\n(B-.B,B+) Player - Gain Approx 20 LP\r\n(C-,C,C+) Player - Gain Approx 15 LP\r\n(D-,D,D+) Player - Gains 0 LP\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAM LOSES:\r\n\r\n(S-,S,S+) Player - Lose 0 LP\r\n(A-,A,A+) Player - Lose Approx 10 LP\r\n(B-.B,B+) Player - Lose Approx 15 LP\r\n(C-,C,C+) Player - Lose Approx 20 LP\r\n(D-,D,D+) Player - Lose Approx 50 LP\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the values of the above system are just ball-park numbers I have come up with, the premise is clear. I think the most important part of this system, is that players who are losing with an S Grade, are not punished, or atleast a losing minimal LP. Whereas ranked players who receive a grade of D, should be severely penalised, to the point of recieving 0 LP for a win, and losing up to 50 or so LP for losing the game.\r\n\r\nThese ranked game changes could be an extremely effective way to allow players to stop ignorant and unsportsmanlike behaviour, such as greifing, intentionally feeding and flaming team mates. Whereas, the players who are receiving consistently high grades and are obviously trying their hardest to win are recognised and rewarded.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m very eager to see how Riot responds to this form of grading system in the ranked scene, if they do end up seeing this post. :)","replies":[{"poster":"FlÃºffy","date":"2017-07-15T06:38:32.458+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"the only problem i can see is that the grades are based on how everyone plays that champion and not an overall score of how you play \n\nIf this system was to go into effect riot would have to put in a new grade system based on how well you play the game in general and not how you played your champion.\nBut i totally agree with your idea of lp gain coming of your overall performance of a game and not how your team mates play.\n\nSolo queue should be about how you play the game yourself and not about if your team won or not","replies":[{"poster":"Swiftasaurus873","date":"2017-07-15T07:05:58.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I also agree with you, but the overall idea is great!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JogadorJNC","date":"2017-11-17T12:07:26.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlueFox,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=VEzW6d4N,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-07-15T06:38:32.458+0000)\n>\n> the only problem i can see is that the grades are based on how everyone plays that champion and not an overall score of how you play \n> \n> If this system was to go into effect riot would have to put in a new grade system based on how well you play the game in general and not how you played your champion.\n> But i totally agree with your idea of lp gain coming of your overall performance of a game and not how your team mates play.\n> \n> Solo queue should be about how you play the game yourself and not about if your team won or not\n\nYour soloq rank should be based on your solo skill, not the skill of your random team mates.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bred","date":"2017-07-15T07:03:30.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that is a good point, Riot would need to change the grading system slightly to reflect your game performance dependant to the average player, not champion.

If there was a definitive way to measure this, I'd be all for it, I've lost games as support where legitimately the only kills our team got that game were janna solo kills (if you're 10-1 ezreal and you get 1v1'd from full hp in the jungle by a support janna, then both teams are seriously retarded and they should reevaluate how they spend their lives).\n\nBut I don't think riot is ready for this type of grading system at all because as stated 0-9-2 azir, almost got a mastery token, and the current grading system measures primarily, Kills>Deaths>Cs>Factors for Gamelength>Assists (unless you are sup in which case this comes before Cs).\n\nGrades don't measure warding, peeling or picking (mostly cc score though this isn't always accurate but this doesn't affect grades atm), no measure for flashing in the way of that caitlynn ulty or jumping into a teamfight on low hp to get a critical pick or save a carry, no measure for when your teammates bard ult you or wall you off to troll you and get you killed or when an adc refuses to burst heal to save an ally because they feel they might need it later, the grading system doesn't even really count damage dealt or absorbed. Riot measures these things, but it's hard to tell how well they've been done and so the Riot Grading system only counts Kills, deaths, cs and assists and considers gamelength to scale specific evaluation.\n\nI've seen games lost because somebody siphoned all the kills and didn't do anything with the gold (sometimes that was me, I'll admit deathcap garen doesnt really scale well, I didn't do this in ranked but someone theoretically could). I've also lost ranked games that I was carrying hard, because I decided to try to yolo 1v5 as the support simply because I was the most fed and gotten utterly wrecked and single-handedly lost the game. My Kda and performance that game was excellent, but I was still the principle reason for the loss.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2017-07-15T13:54:35.725+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn this is a great idea!

I am only silver one so take it with a grain of salt, a big portion of my games I play well, I try my best not to feed, I very often win lane, and seem to just outperform my opponent. I win lane, but there is not much one person can do when one person just refuses to communicate. I can get that sought after S ranking, but because of my current MMR I can lose up to 28 LP a game, when winning one I earn no more than 19. I love this game, but it really makes it hard when my performance is not rewarded when instead it is completely ignored. I completely agree with the LP gain or loss based on in game performance, if I play poorly I will accept the hit of up to 50LP. I really hope Riot sees this and implements something similar. I think it would be a breath of fresh air for lower elos. I seriously doubt it will effect high elo such as master/challenger, and if it does, it will really put the great players above the good players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sanivan","date":"2017-12-11T21:04:38.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Obviously because this is a team game and kills don't mean wins.

The ranking system (S,A,B,C,D) should determine the amount of LP you gain for a win, and lose for a loss. \n> \n> For example: Say you are playing a Ranked Solo/Duo game and have a team mate that plays extremely bad, to the point of receiving a D Level grade. Note that to achieve this, the player would either need to be lagging to the point that they should not be playing, or intentionally feeding. On the other hand, say you have another team mate who plays extremely well, and should obviously play at a higher level and gets an S Level grade. Now assuming that they have average MMR&amp;#039;s for their ELO (Which is safe to say this is what the majority of players have), a loss would result in both players losing the same amount of LP, and if they win both will recieve the same amount of LP.\n> \n> How does this inevitable pay off seem fair? Is Riot not trying to reward players who are serious and would like to be better at the game? Or do they just not care enough to update the system in place, which seems old-school and out of place, considering how the game has evolved so drastically since its release.\n> \n> I believe that Riot may be working towards this in the future, otherwise I can&amp;#039;t see why they would implement the grading system, but I can&amp;#039;t understand why it is yet to be put into place in ranked games. So please Riot, think about using a system for ranked games as follows:\n> \n> \n> TEAM WINS:\n> \n> (S-,S,S+) Player - Gain Approx 30 LP\n> (A-,A,A+) Player - Gain Approx 25 LP\n> (B-.B,B+) Player - Gain Approx 20 LP\n> (C-,C,C+) Player - Gain Approx 15 LP\n> (D-,D,D+) Player - Gains 0 LP\n> \n> \n> TEAM LOSES:\n> \n> (S-,S,S+) Player - Lose 0 LP\n> (A-,A,A+) Player - Lose Approx 10 LP\n> (B-.B,B+) Player - Lose Approx 15 LP\n> (C-,C,C+) Player - Lose Approx 20 LP\n> (D-,D,D+) Player - Lose Approx 50 LP\n> \n> \n> While the values of the above system are just ball-park numbers I have come up with, the premise is clear. I think the most important part of this system, is that players who are losing with an S Grade, are not punished, or atleast a losing minimal LP. Whereas ranked players who receive a grade of D, should be severely penalised, to the point of recieving 0 LP for a win, and losing up to 50 or so LP for losing the game.\n> \n> These ranked game changes could be an extremely effective way to allow players to stop ignorant and unsportsmanlike behaviour, such as greifing, intentionally feeding and flaming team mates. Whereas, the players who are receiving consistently high grades and are obviously trying their hardest to win are recognised and rewarded.\n> \n> I&amp;#039;m very eager to see how Riot responds to this form of grading system in the ranked scene, if they do end up seeing this post. :)\n\nI absolutely agree with everything you said. Why should be good player punished for potato teammates? You try hard, perform your best, carry team as heavy as garbage truck but still loose, beucase your team feeds and does stupid things, you get S+ but -22 LP. WTF is that?\n\nSame thing applies vice versa. Why should some random potato brain gain as much LP for win as the person who actually carried him?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Curry Thief","date":"2017-07-16T02:31:37.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"bred","date":"2017-07-16T02:34:54.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please Remove this comment.
