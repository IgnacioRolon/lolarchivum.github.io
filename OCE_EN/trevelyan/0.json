Can we get some sort of time frame for when these features will be available on OCE?\r\n\r\nCan you update us on whether additional queue types will be made available any time soon?\r\nIt&#039;s been almost 2 years since the release of the oceanic server, I was curious as to whether we will be getting any different queue types. I understand that having the full range of queue&#039;s that NA has just wouldn&#039;t be feasible with our comparatively small playerbase, but would we be able to have some additional game modes and queue times during peak periods/weekends? I would really look forward to being able to play draft mode without the pressure of having to play in a ranked queue, and I&#039;m sure many people would love the opportunity to try out Dominion. Could we possibly swap team builder for draft mode until TB receives some QOL adjustments? I feel like there is a better way to organise queue&#039;s and game-mode types so our small server doesn&#039;t have to miss out on so much of what NA currently has.\r\n\r\nThanks to any RIOT-er who spared the time to read this and extra thanks to any that respond :)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-06-10T10:26:20.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"me 2, I want a response from riot.

The most recent one is Reform Cards, which essentially send chat logs to players that get banned by an automated system - this is helpful because it happens so quickly after the negative behavior, which can help people identify what behaviors they need to improve (which is harder to do if you get banned like 2 weeks after the fact...). \n\nBased on RiotLyte's post a day ago, Korea and OCE are the next regions to get Reform Cards:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/395v99/511_is_almost_here_where_is_the_match_history/cs0p4tu?context=3\n\nIn general, RiotLyte does a great job of publishing what his team is working on and what the status of things are.
