Once in a while they give you draw and that only happens if too many people pressure Riot letting them its their fault. As of their server are frucked so don't play ranked cause they wont give you a draw.\n\nmy team mates afked in 5 of 10 of my promos games cause of Riots fault and  it totally frucked up my mmr and my placement. So I lost 5 games of 10 promos games purely of Riots fault and afk/dced teammates. \n\nGood Job Riot, and you won't even give a draw.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-23T10:37:10.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">the whispered cries of the helpless","replies":[]}]}
