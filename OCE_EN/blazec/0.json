That didn&#039;t work because even at the turret, ZIggs could still hit me with his bombs.\r\n\r\nI finally got my ulti, and rushed Ziggs when he got close, but before I could finish him, Zed teleported in between us, acting as a shield so there was no way I could finish either of them off before dying (I assume it was planned and they baited me). The rest of the match went down hill from there.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to deal with situations like that? I feel regret, but I&#039;m honestly not sure what I should have done instead.\r\nUnfortunately things went badly for the rest of my team as well, but I&#039;m hardly in a position to criticize them.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-06T11:43:36.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duo lane can be hard if you're not experienced. Generally, if you're experienced, you should win the lane as you get double the exp, and with jungler ganks, can easily overpower them (especially with TP to hammer home the advantage). TBH Ryze recently got nerfed and I honestly don't think he's viable as a champ any more. His perma-stun combo was high-tier, but instead low-tier players have been stung with its nerf. Zed is one of the strongest champs right now (imho), and Ziggs is just great. Not much you could've done probably other than lane swap or duo with your jungler. If Ryze gets shut out of farm, he'll never super-sayan, especially now since his nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"BlazeC","date":"2015-09-11T14:54:57.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks - usually I've managed to at least keep up in due lanes, but that particular one went very badly :)\nWhile I'm enjoying playing as Ryze, I really need to figure out some other champions to play. Then once I've picked one, I just have to hope they don't get nerfed too soon.","replies":[]}]}]}
