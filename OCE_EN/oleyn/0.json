If you look in the area you select your chroma in champion select it shows 7 chromas unlocked and an 8th chroma locked (the green one). In collection however it will show Winter Wonder Neeko 7/7.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this is a bug or if it&#039;s getting added later similar to the Gold chromas that have been coming out recently in all the events?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-12-11T01:42:43.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not missing, it's just not available through \"normal\" methods.\n\nThe green chromas for several champs are available through the \"League Partners\" program, which allows content creators (such as youtubers and streamers) to give away \"exclusive\" loot to their viewers. The green chromas are also available (after a significant amount of time) through the Essence Emporium, the \"twice a year\" blue essence shop containing a variety of content typically not available anywhere else (I *think* the green Winter Wonder Neeko chroma will be in the mid-season Essence Emporium, but not sure).","replies":[{"poster":"Oleyn","date":"2018-12-11T01:47:58.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok ty for the information ^.^","replies":[]}]}]}
