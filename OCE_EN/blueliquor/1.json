I&#039;ve been having a lot of fun recently making songs about streamers and LCS games. I&#039;ve made a song called &#039;Hardstuck in Gold&#039; and would love to find a youtube video editor who would want to team up with me for this (and other videos hopefully). \r\n\r\nLittle bit about myself:\r\n\r\nIn regards to league: I peaked at Diamond 2 and made a bit of money coaching low levels. I stopped taking the game as serious but I still play a whole lot. I am on very frequently.\r\n\r\nOut of league: Toured down the east coast of Australia playing music. Lived in Melbourne for a few years now I live in Brisvegas. (Would be great if you lived near me. But with the wonders of the net it also wouldn&#039;t matter if you didn&#039;t.) Add me ingame to have a chat if you&#039;re keen. \r\n\r\nIGN: BlueLiquor\r\nI added in my soundcloud link just for the lols.","replies":[]}
