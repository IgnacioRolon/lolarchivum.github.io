Heimendinger! this champion is impossible to gank, has lane domination, high damage out put, a stun/slow, and cannons that put out high damage per second with him just having to run or zhonya's! he can solo baron/drag, legit gets double kills if trying to gank him! He needs a remake! somehow to make him even with other mid laners! why should people be zoned all of the laning phase because he puts up turrets that put out high damage? who's that fun for? for years i've tried to counter him when i verse him with all different types of champions and have never been successful! does anyone else share the same problem ? do they have an issue with his mechanics?{{champion:74}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-03-05T09:15:03.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can consistently beat him with karma, sion, gnar, galio.

This is what I've tended to do when looking for a new champion - look at the champion I've been struggling against the most, and try and play them for a while. The worst case you end up doing badly playing them, and find out what makes you lose when you do. The best case, you have a fun new main to play. :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-05T08:52:03.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this have anything to do with the fact you just lost to a team with a Heimerdinger?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-05T09:09:41.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, he did get rekt by one.
