So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥","replies":[{"poster":"fatflyingbaby","date":"2016-04-18T10:57:26.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!","replies":[{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2016-04-19T11:21:21.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"introduce hextech crafting, doesn't explain how to better the other S ranks","replies":[]}]}]}]}
