We want people who want to learn and grow with other players, tho we do ask you are around level 25+ to start with. We all started somewhere, some earlier and some later than others, but gaming is gaming. \r\n\r\nPeople make mistakes, in RL and on the Rift, so keeping cool and helping your team learn is just as important as listening to someone more experienced trying to coach you. Keep you cool, no one wants to hear bickering.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}} \r\nWe do expect that you&#039;re Humble in victory and Graceful in defeat. \r\n\r\nYou will have at least 1 main for 2 lanes of your choice. This will help to make forming teams easier and Teamspeak is obviously high encouraged, but not a prerequisite unless playing in ranked games.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have around 5 people, but we all can&#039;t be on at the same time. You know that RL thing gets in the way, so it would be good to have a pool to choose from. There is not official recruitment method, just hope in TS and introduce yourself. We don&#039;t bite I promise.\r\n\r\n==================\r\n**Teamspeak**\r\nts3.srcshosting.com.au\r\n===================\r\nThis is public, so feel free to use it.\r\n\r\nSee you on the rift!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nHighway\r\nADC - {{champion:22}}  Mid - {{champion:99}}  Top - {{champion:23}}","replies":[{"poster":"qldhighway","date":"2016-07-26T07:28:56.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey All,\n\nThere is no joining as such, just jump on Teamspeak and introduce yourself.\n\n25+ just means that you will grasp the basic concepts of the game, have a little experience and be able to enjoy your time playing with everyone else. \n\nThe Teamspeak is....\nts3.srcshosting.com.au  (no password)\nit is free and public, so invite your friends to use it! (if it fills up I will apply for a non profit licence)\n\nYou can also add me (qldhighway) or Bloodspiller to your friends. Blood started a little club, and called it QQTIME **rolls eyes** but its just a hangout really as TS is preferred.\n\nWe have found about 7 people so far which is AWESOME! you know who you are! However more are welcome as I previously mentioned sometimes people are previously engaged with RL!\n\nWe might start something up down the track and get some official handles and website and stuff, but that is later as it takes away from actual gaming time. (We already have talent to set all this up if it comes to it.)\n\nSo jump on, say hi and play a few rounds with your fellow OCE players!\n\nSee you on the RIFT!\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\nRegards,\n\nHighway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tangaroa","date":"2016-07-25T04:30:24.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would also be keen.
