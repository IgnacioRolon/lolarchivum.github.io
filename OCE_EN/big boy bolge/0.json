I sent an e-mail to &#039;info@riotgames.com&#039; in regards to finding out the total number of games i&#039;ve played on every champion across my LoL career on my account. \r\n\r\nEg. \r\n\r\nAatrox - 10\r\nAhri - 73\r\nAkali - 0\r\nSo on and so forth.\r\n\r\nSoon to realise that I would receive an auto-response reply to my e-mail, I made my way to the forums. If anyone knows anything on the subject and could help me out or Riot staff could point me in the right direction, that&#039;d be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nE-mail: kylejacobbolger@gmail.com\r\nIGN: elyK\r\nOld IGN: KARROTmofo\r\n\r\nThanks heaps!","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-08-12T15:45:16.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"try www.lolking.net i know they have this information on ranked matches it shows how many times you played with that champ and also how many times you have won/lost a game with that champ just remember when you search the summoner name to click on the NA box and change it to OCE, go to the ranked stats, also shows your avg kda overall and your avg creep score","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Boy Bolge","date":"2015-08-19T01:34:42.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know there are a variety of websites that show information on the number of times you've played a champion, in ranked, but I mean for normal games?
