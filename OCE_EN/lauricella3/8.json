He isn't supposed to be sitting there poking you while you stand there auto-attacking him. He is supposed to be in your face with a 1k shield smacking you down while your health goes from 100-0 in about 0.5 seconds. As I said in a post in the 5.11 patch notes, Ekko can get a free kill on you once he hits lvl2.","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-06-15T07:19:10.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if I play Urgot and Ekko decides to level 2 engage me he has another thing coming to him.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-16T01:04:10.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, that's different because he has a shield which mitigates the damage you take.","replies":[{"poster":"Cookie","date":"2015-07-23T02:56:42.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im just going to let you know, if you are playing against an ekko, even if he is half decent, any good player can take him to 20% at lvl 2 if he goes for trades. I have been playing against good ekkos, and its stupidly easy to counter play them. But you really dont understand what laning at mid is like if you get outtradded by an ekko at lvl 2 as a ranged caster who should be poking him out of lane at lvl 1","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-23T12:59:22.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm talking about playing as him.

He has too many slows. His passive, his Q and his W all slow you if you're hit. \n\nBut I also know how to beat ekko's in lane now.. If you use a ranged champ its much easier. With a melee champ you just have to make sure you're not hit by his passive which is quite easy to avoid. His Q is a sure 2 hit+passive proc if you engage first so try to bait it out or let him use it to farm and then engage him, NEVER engage when he his the Q up unless you're way stronger than him. His W's easy to avoid unless its a _really _ good ekko but some ekko's are next level and turret dive you with its shield at like level 3 so be careful of it. His blink is a stupid get away/fight engager. If you're doing the above correctly and he engages you should go to town with him. If he uses the blink to get away, zone him like hard. It does have surprisingly good burst damage once he has some items though so its pretty annoying. \n\nNow the part I hate more than any of this is that when he has his ult up, you can barely ever engage him unless he gets ganked and he'll get away alive oh yes. Gank ekko and all you do is waste his ult which is pretty much back in a minute of him returning back to lane. \n\nNerf his ult cooldowns seriously. The rest of his kit is.. annoying but it's alright. At max rank and with cooldown items its at like a 55 second cooldown! >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-16T03:03:25.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has fairly horrible chase without the E and the Q would be laughably easy to dodge, considering it IS currently piss easy to dodge. The W? Just guess where it is. Seriously, don't fall for obvious stuff with Ekko. If you're chasing Ekko and you hear his W activate, don't chase him. He WANTS you to go there. As he says, he only needs seconds to kill you. You make a mistake, and you're eliminated. Ekko absolutely stomps people who don't know how to play against him because of that one simple fact.","replies":[]}]}
