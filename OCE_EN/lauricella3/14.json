So, say your E costs 50 health and you have a spirit visage, if we take the increased healing you'll get 60 health back if you kill a unit and if you activate his W then do it, you'll get even MORE health because of the additional healing. And even if you have spell vamp, it wouldn't give a lot of health back anyway. Say your E does 300 true damage and you have 6% spell vamp from runes, it will give back 18 health. That's pathetic.\n\nAs for your ult, it's a tradeoff. The passive of your ult encourages you to build health, not resists. It turns Olaf from a tank into an off-tank assassin.\n\nJust get 40% CDR on Olaf and he becomes stupidly strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xTremorZ","date":"2014-12-16T01:13:54.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure the shield on Lee is like practically nothing and the attack speed he gets is from passive.
