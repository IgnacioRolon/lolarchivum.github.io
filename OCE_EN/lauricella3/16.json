Don't be surprised if he decided to stay and aoe 2 whole minions waves because you were being a DKhead.","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-03-19T05:12:56.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"#justbronzethings","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-20T02:42:36.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll let them stay and farm my minions until I've gotten back to lane, it actually somewhat bugs me when someone could of got plenty of gold and xp off the minions killing my turret while I'm running up to lane and they let my turret die to kill 1 camp.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-20T04:27:20.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some odd players don't mind if their tower gets destroyed though.
