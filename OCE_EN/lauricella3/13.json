Kennen does decently due to the stuns but neither of these champions facerape Riven. Play people who out-burst with CC.

He is basically just there as a presence to not lose lane whilst the riven rampages around the lane stomping anything in her path. \nRiven is always vulnerable to ganks because she spends the entire time going all in though, you're correct. But with a vlad as the laner the kill pressure drops by a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-05T03:47:12.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Riven is always vulnerable to ganks because she spends the entire time going all in though,\n\nWell, the same abilities that she uses to go all in are the same abilities that she uses to escape a gank relatively easily if played right. They are in a low cooldown once the game starts to get going, about a few minutes in.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-03T17:47:55.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no such thing as shutting down a Riven for the match.

You think she is op because you verse smurferinos. She is balanced. At a higher elo you would understand this. If she was op boxbox would be challenger 1. If you think it's a skill less champ then go play with her :^). She is actually hard to play and the nerfs that have hit her has made her extremely balanced and her laning is nowhere near as stompy as before. It's still snowbally but it requires the enemy to make mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-05-05T02:35:57.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what mistakes? qw aa qq aa e off.

But if you reduce the scale by 50% and increase the duration by 25%-50% it would be 350 shield and around a  1.85-2.225 sec duration. Allowing people to actually hurt her. (most riven end up around 700 shield if they build properly, this would be reduced to around 455) Either that or thy could reduce her q scaling to 35% ad instead of 60% bonus leaving you with a nice 105% ad instead of 180% bonus ad. Or. Just halve the base stats on her q and e.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-04T14:28:58.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again the only real disadvantage I can see to playing riven is that she loses damage in order to gapclose and is relatively squishy. her ult and some CDR render the first part useless and 1 defensive item + shield + cc is usually all the defence riven needs.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-04T16:41:13.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, but there is still an 'incentive' to use abilities because of her passive AA buff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-05-03T09:45:09.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-03T10:29:50.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not really riven has no drawback to being manaless, as well as high damage/mobility cc and waveclear.
