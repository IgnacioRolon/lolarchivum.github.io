If her passive gave lifesteal, her scaling with AD would be even stupider, making her harder to duel, making her a stronger snowball champion.\n\nIt's stupid enough that she gets free AD off her W which is why I always feel compelled to max it first...should move that AD to her ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-08T04:32:45.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.surrenderat20.net/2014/08/red-post-collection-fiora-rework.html\n\nThey haven't really explained a lot of what they are doing...\nBut they do plan on reworking Fiora.","replies":[]}]}
