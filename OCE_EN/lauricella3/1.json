I like to do it as an ADC on those super long games where I have the gold for it at the end, unless I have huge reason to keep homeguards. Do it, though I still suggest boots being part of your build. Perhaps you can get away with normal boots (they are cheap anyway) until you need the inventory space.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-05T15:12:58.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trading out boots for zephyr late game is not unheard of. In Tryndamere's case it would be better.\n\nYou don't need too much movespeed for chasing, since you have a low cooldown dash ability that deals damage, on top of a massive slow that also lowers a targets damage output by a flat percentage, which is enhanced if they aren't facing you. Even if they try to turn around on you, you have 5 WHOLE SECONDS OF INVULNERABILITY TO ESCAPE/KILL THEIR ENTIRE TEAM WITH, which also grants instant fury to heal with.","replies":[]}]}
