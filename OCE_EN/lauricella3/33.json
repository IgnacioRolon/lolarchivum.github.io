If anything it would be a buff to his late game though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T12:35:47.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buff. The attack range would make it far to easy to farm against other melee champions, and since his ult increases his attack range by 50 he would end up with a huge 225 attack range with his ult activated. And to that i say no thank you, i don't want to be bopped for my entire health bar when im already hiding behind my entire team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-06-07T12:53:00.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe but it would help when he is being kited just out of his melee range, I would totally support this if they changed his wither a bit.","replies":[]}]}]}
