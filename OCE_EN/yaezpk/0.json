I heard maybe it&#039;s to do with my CS but i&#039;m constantly roaming trying to counter-gank or counter-jungle the enemy jungler or gank my lanes and if i&#039;m not doing that i&#039;m farming my jungle or taking an objective, my mind is literally racing the whole game every game on what I can do next to win the game (seems like I lose every game when I die a couple times idk...)\n\nAnyways 01 and 02 of July in my match history i&#039;ve gotten great k/d/a&#039;s and hard carried most of them games but still failing for an S can anyone help me and tell me what I must do? I feel like I have to just afk farm in a normal game and not care for my team if we win/lose if it is about CS, not only would that be boring but kinda troll...\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/matches/userName=epikGG\n\nAlso, no hate on my builds please, trying different stuff :P\n\nEDIT: Okay, so two games in a row I got S, all I did was farm farm farm, ignore my team, ignore my objectives. 1 game I got fed and the other I went around 17/10 or something (cbf to check history) both with highish CS. So basically, play selfish and just farm all game to get S's, GJ Riot, makes sense.\n\nEDIT: Had to go 17-0 to get my last S+ but finally level 7 :) \nhttp://imgur.com/oEVjLEc","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2016-07-02T00:51:16.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is a comment i put on another post very similar to this the guy compared two games where he went 15,1 on kha and 9,4 on azir so i tried to explain this hope it helps kinda: \n\nok so u dont seem to know how the ranking system works so heres an explanation:\nin your elo u r compared to other players based on cs, kda, dmg, objectives taken etc. so basically riot from what i know they take an avg of all peeps in your elo of that champion in that lane/role. so for example im guessing you are in low elo probably bronze or silver so that's why u got an s on azir. this is because azir has a very high skill cap and people in lower elo tend to do quite poorly on him so that avg score for him is quite low meaning if u get just above the avg u will get quite a high grade. makes sense? where as khazix is quite easy for lower elo and is more or less \"freelo\" this is the same with champs like voli yi etc. so since these champs r freelo this means a wide majority of lower elo players tend to do quite well meaning the Avg is higher. so since the avg of champs like kha etc are higher its generally harder to get an s because everyone elses performances. also your aim to get an s CS wise is 60 per 10mins for a jgler and 80 per 10mins for a laner. another little trick is if u r good enough at a champ u play u can play them in an odd role so like yas support or azir jg for instance, which is an easy way to get an S because the vast majority of players who play that champ in that role (who troll generally) do quite poorly so the avg score is quite low, meaning if u do well u will probably get an S, though i don't advise this cause its trolling and i hate trolls{{champion:48}} , KAPPAPRIDE, #freetyler1.

I found that the more I thought about trying to get the S the harder it was, I was far more likely to do well early and then just tilt and destroy my chances.

If you play well enough it should come naturally. Having said that, consistently getting 100-150 cs over a ~40 minute game is something you should work on, not so that you can get an S rank but so that you can get better in general. If you find yourself getting fed nearly every game the jungle will become incredibly easy to clear, meaning there's no reason you shouldn't. I'm not suggesting you afk farm but get in the habit of clearing the jungle amidst ganking and teamfighting so that you can maximise how much gold you have and how hard you can carry.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-02T04:53:16.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you play well enough it should come naturally.\n\nIt doesn't come naturally and i'm not sure what makes you think that.\n\nLike for Jungle, i find getting an S follows the NB3 train of thought \"60 CS per 10 minutes is what you should have\"","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-02T05:37:58.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I removed one phrase from my post. \n\nIt comes naturally if your ultimate focus is on getting better at the game rather than getting s ranks.
