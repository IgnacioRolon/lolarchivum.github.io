I will be writing a big report soon about it. The masteries if you are talking about how you have to click five times instead of clicking once and then it includes all 5 rank up masteries then that is not a fault. I have to click on each mastery every time, kinda like that in the legacy where you can click on 18 masteries and its done, not you have to click on each one individual so many times, I do some of my masteries whilst I am waiting to get into game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Korrasamii","date":"2016-11-06T10:05:00.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Willtom,realm=OCE,application-id=PpTM71nT,discussion-id=p8E9zVdX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-11-06T06:02:48.504+0000)\n>\n> has anyone else been experiencing lag while choosing or changing their runes and masteries?\n\nI have found this issue too, also for when choosing masteries, it would be nice to have it like the live servers where if you choose a mastery that has 5 points in it, make it so if you click on this mastery it locks in 5 points all at once instead of individually. This will help people who do not have dank PCs and lag a bit.","replies":[]}]}
