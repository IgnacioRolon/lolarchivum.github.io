If it is possible to revoke these penalties after my issue is resolved I would gladly appreciate it.\n\nThank you.\n\nP.S The legacy client also doesn't open, even after I run the exe and administrator. It has worked in the past and now all of a sudden it's flipped, turned upside-down.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-21T07:31:55.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIs your game crashing or are you disconnecting?
