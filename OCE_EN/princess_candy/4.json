I&#039;ve repaired the client. What&#039;s happening is it&#039;s letting me select my champion, and then instead of loading anything, nothing happens. No black screen, no attempted loading screen, absolutely nothing. If I click the Riot Icon in links it asks me to reconnect to the game, but then it keeps doing the same thing. After several attempts, I restart my computer and I get into the game late and everyone hates me.","replies":[]}
