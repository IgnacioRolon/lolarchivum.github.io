You're in diamond, good for you, my mid laner is very good for his level, he wins lane nearly every time, and we have played against platinum mid laners and he has won against them. I would consider his lane mechanics platinum level.

That just completely contradicts with what you've said. In no shape or form did I act like I was superior to everyone else, I did not flaunt my rank (which is in no way good at all) but you point out the obvious so I question the obvious; as to why you think a Gold V (yes Gold V) plays at a platinum level. That is indeed wrong, he plays at a gold level. \n\"Lane mechanics platinum level\" seems awfully naive since the aim of the game is not to even win your lane, but to win the game. Nevertheless, winning your lane against a platinum player in normals does not even constitute his skill; it's normals for pete's sake LOL\nIt's good you have faith in your mid laner but to brag and flaunt about his skill being higher than he is is just ridiculous. I've beaten diamond III mid laners, does that mean I'm diamond III level as well although I've been stuck in Diamond V?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-01-12T10:55:22.275+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Spaghini\nRole: Top\nRank: Gold 5\nMain Champions: Riven, Trundle, Shen, Maokai, Poppy (^_^)\nHow long have you played: About 2 years of ranked play\nWhat specific skills can you offer to our team?
