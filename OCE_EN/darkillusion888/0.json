I sometimes look at their accounts a few days later and see that they have still been playing the game. What frustrates me is that most of the players that I report clearly admit to intentionally feeding or going afk, saying they don't care or say that they're just trying to have fun. Further, some of these players clearly say that they know that Riot will not take any action against them. And I hate that Riot makes you tick that box when you report someone through support to make you say that the post game screen is the best way to report because nothing seems to happen from that. It's frustrating when a player trolls throughout the game and brags about it knowing that they can get away with it. Is there anything more to do when someone exhibits this behaviour?","replies":[{"poster":"LastAccLPQ","date":"2019-04-17T09:20:04.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't mate i tried reporting so guy who was 0/24 on here but how no the emissary Eras Dragon decide to removing the name. If RITO is going to safeguard the identicities of perptrators without publicly shamming them, then i wonder how they will be banned in the first place.

Riot told me these reports through tickets go on a list of manual reviews and when that report gets to the top of the list then an action will be \"investigated\"  if that player actual did something wrong they will get punished. So this could be months or even years after i made the initial report, so they basically get away with it for a period. Their current ifs system for in-game is flawed because you only get picked up if you're obviously inting or legit using chat wrong anything else and you get away with it so manual ticket reports seem like the best thing to do","replies":[{"poster":"LastAccLPQ","date":"2019-04-17T09:21:09.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"quit playing the game no point buying rp when the developers have no respect for customer support useless","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jeneral Pain","date":"2019-04-15T06:42:26.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would be great to see these reports actually being actioned, I had a game with a duo that were abusing everyone else, telling us to \"uninstall our lives with rope\" (basically encouraging suicide) and all kinds of toxicity.
