Playing norms has more communication and teamwork than the vast majority of the ranked games I play with my friends in Soloq. Some games you get the occasional team player who wants to do well, but most ranked games are just painful because trying to rank up with a team who doesn&#039;t communicate or listen to what each other have to say, is straight up aggravating and frustrating...

Don't worry majority of players in higher ranks are cheaters, its only a select few who are actually good or just plain old fake players.\n\nEnjoy, they need you to keep on playing this game.","replies":[]}]}
