I&#039;ve been to America, Korea and all over Australia both representing my teams at the time (FXO, itsGoSu and Team Immunity) and Australia. When I quit playing SC2, within three months I was Challenger ELO on the OCE server, having previously been Diamond on the NA server. Competetively, I believe I have the most experience out of any OPL player in high-pressure and/or LAN situations.\r\n\r\nAs far as LoL competitive experience goes, I played in a few teams before landing in my current team (used to be Dig.AU, Ex-D and now Team Immunity), which played through multiple previous Oceanic tournaments (most recently, losing at EB Expo.. that sucked).\r\n\r\nOur second split hasn&#039;t exactly started off with the bang that we hoped, but we&#039;re rebuilding right now and are still holding out hope for a top 4 finish so we can show everyone what we&#039;re made of in the semi&#039;s, finals and next split!\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll try to answer every question posted here (within reason) and will be checking back on the thread every hour (roughly, between games) for new questions. Fire away!\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to, you can support me directly by following me at:\r\n[@im_tgun](https://twitter.com/iM_tgun) on Twitter\r\n[tguntv](http://twitch.tv/tguntv) on twitch\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;d like to support Team Immunity, you can follow them at:\r\n[@teamimmunity](https://twitter.com/TeamImmunity) on Twitter\r\n[Team Immunity](https://www.facebook.com/TeamImmunity?fref=ts) on Facebook","replies":[{"poster":"HLN Ryoo","date":"2015-06-26T07:51:03.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello fellow summoner\n\nWhat is your ultimate fear?","replies":[{"poster":"TILTILTILTILTILT","date":"2015-06-26T08:06:32.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heights.","replies":[{"poster":"UberBro","date":"2015-06-26T09:02:48.754+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in (for the first time on these forums) for this, haha; https://twitter.com/UberGiantsBro/status/614313667937464320\n\nNot a question, but I still keep track a bit of the team {{champion:32}} \n\nWell since I'm here I may as well ask a question(s).

Pro (#1 best of best) for most rts command and conquer games and many fps titles semi-pro. Got a question. Isn't it true that two ADC bottom lane are much more effective at killing and can easily minion farm while going to work on bottom enemy much more effectively?\n\nI also find these so-called support champions to de-value the finishing ability of sides. I suspect in the future we could see five adc owning hard anf ully intend to prove my words by doing so.\n\nMy theory is that two adc will SHUT DOWN that lane and totally dominate the enemy therefore compromising the enemies ability to ss or gank.\n\nSo if all enemies are locked in to top bottom or middle, it kind of shuts down the ability of players to go on jungle excursions.\n\nI struggle to understand why someone would pick a support when they are so weak as compared to five adc's that can easily any one of them win the game in the end.\n\nDon't get it, cheers.

You lose a lot of pressure bot, and the reason people play support champs is because they're able to conceed farm while still remaining relevant -- think about Alistar, for example, without many items he's still a viable threat midgame. However, an ADC with ~2k gold missing (or, more likely, 3k) is very weak (comparatively).\n\nAs of right now, the only off-meta thing I think is viable is playing a mage as support, as they can snowball / scale hard, yet still remain relevant without much farm (think Annie, aoe stun is always relevant -- Syndra, to an extent, also the same).","replies":[{"poster":"AskiKa","date":"2015-08-20T02:45:03.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a simple concept, don't do nothing stupid, have three adc's fed, other two support, mid game other two are clearing both sides of jungle and feeding while the fed three adc's go to work on enemy team...\n\nIssue is, Now that I have plaed the game a lot, I now know that frozen heart, randuins, hexdrinker etc (thornmail) can make players pretty much invincible...\n\nAdditionally the way pro fights go down, is all five in, an initiation and bang, fight is over in seconds... Ganking a 5 adc side would in fact own them with the tanks not dying... \n\nyou are right, ty, the truth is from a newbies perspective, I would have thought 5 adcs owned, but the truth is, adc's are not the most powerful in the game, it's the tanks that carry not the damage.\n\nI am four months in to my lol and already maining most adcs, aatrox, jayce etc... I have purchased 95 champions. All the OP i could find. Braum may be my last purchase.\n\nYou under estimate who you are talking to. I have been a pro gamer for 25 years at the TOP OF THE WORLD, I will and can easily dominate micro.\n\nBut in truth, now with the variety of the champions, I need to go on a ONE YEAR training camp, playing and majoring in all champions I own, one every three days... Just to claim to be good. I also got lucky and found some pro trained players who are mentoring me.\n\nMy optimal team and you will laugh are these:\n\n1. Hemierdinger. If played right, will always push off enemy from feed. Support...\n2. Aatrox Jungle, he is weak, but purely because phantom hit combined with shiv, frozen, maw, bloow rav phantom or ruined is untouchable, perhaps randuins in stead of frozen. (so he is ultra late game carry - a walking ulti lol) Get cleanse to keep him attacking and you're on a winner, enemy team will have to kbnock him up a few times, by then, the damage picks them off. His revive, plus possible guardian angel make him very cool indeed, let alone the fact his q is a free ulti in teamfights... stomping on two or three and disabling them for a few seconds lol.\n3. Obviously jayce and syndra... WHO WILL SHUT THEM DOWN SERIOUSLY... So they both come in... dont matter their position, feed any one of them and gameover.\n4. Azir, his poke combined with survivability...\n\nso that's basically it. By the way, who said two of them can not tank... If azir semi tanks, his ulti is all team needs and annoying poke. aatrox could tank, hello even noob heimerdinger can tank anyone can tank right...\n\nCatch is, late game you can SELL UP AND ALL GO CARRY... If get away with it...\n\nSo to summize, I think if you go a poke team with many carry, late game they are fucked as you can sell stuff when money becomes irrelevant and multi-carry.\n\nAdditionally, substitute my stupid nooby team for any champions you wish, but if I ever get in to pro (ignoring stupid comments that may come after this post), I will enjoy posing an intellectual threat to the others lol.\n\nOne thing I learnt in rts and fps was one basic rule that some pros today don't even know...\n\n1. LEARN DEFENCE, IF YOU DIE, YOU LOSE.\n2. After pro defense, LEARN TO OFFEND PROPERLY WITH OUT LOSING.\n3. This means no ganking unless full sight, no stupid HOPE FOR THE BEST all in teamfight unless you 100% know where enemy are, ALL OF THEM... Etc...\n\nOnly complaint in watching these so called pro games is the fact they attack HOPING FOR THE BEST, art of war guys, never fight the battle until it has been won.\n\nIf this means you playing a mid or late game carry, then your jungler must be in sight of enemy jungler at all times, annoying the fark out of them so you never get ganked, it also means NEVER INITIATING and coneding a bit of feed to the enemy for safety to get you to mid or late game.\n\nI don't currently see this in the pro games. All I see from the samsung white (my heroes btw) are 5 vs 5 teamfights that they are coming out on top of, RESPECT. I am actually blown away by the precision required and do genuinely look up to the pro teams, wow, amazing focus.\n\nI even take the time to still freeze the videos, go through entire game, copy cat your build orders and practice with them. That samsung white build order where he sells the brutalizer for the black clever, \"harrowing stuff\" lol.\n\nAnyway, I'm off to my newbie ways once again, you're right, it will take me a year or two for you pros to start getting afraid, but it will occur, lol.\n\nSo let's stop wasting time like the noobz on rts and fps and recruit me yeah?...\n\nI need you to know that I WORK.\n\nTakers? message me in oce client 25YearCareerPro \n\nthe position I am seeking is shot maker (caller) and also middle, jungle or top, I feel support is pretty much locked down with adc and I definately love those phantom hit sated on aatrox, you may think aatrox is weak, so build this: if laning, as we all know, aatrox gets pushed from lane and minions, so make a dorans shield, combine with armor, magic resist and FULL HEALTH REGEN QUINTS and attack speed or dmg marks.\n\nHis E will eventually force out a ranged champion who spend cash on health potions that aatrox does not require. Lane will fall, when he is level six, basically, they are dead in a 1v1.\n\nSo I'd build like this, correct me if wrong, infinity, shiv, phantom, blood, ruined or rav, maw., obviously bers, but green as he can catch anyone and escape better with his jumps then, red is good, but he get caught escape, obviously hex drinker and wardens mail for defend if as early as needed, substitute randuins for frozen if need be. My final build for aatrox would be:\n\ndorans blade (less regen as he get pushed off minions, but better later on), zeal, hexdrinker, wardens mail, shiv, zeal, blood, phantom, complete maw and randuins or frozen or thornmail, omit wardens for other armor as build requires), definately buy berserkers but only if winning, boots purchased early on, after hex drinker perhaps, so final build is something like:\n\ndorans blade, infinity, (build defend as required) shiv, phantom (substitude for rav or ruined as required for extended team fighting lifesteal), blood, randuins, maw\n\nIf I need to tank, one that never dies i found is:\n\ndorans shield, berserkers, hexdrinker, zz portal, wardens mail, maw, thornmail, guardian angel, randuins, substitute boots for shiv, substitude something for or infinity.\n\nIs these build orders stupid?\n\nCan someone tell me your best build order for aatrox? you need to be a minimum of level five on aatrox to comment on itemsets for me to take you seriously, cheers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sSilverSoul","date":"2015-06-27T10:12:18.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um maybe a tank team with thorn mails?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-06-28T15:18:40.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is it true that you once had sex with a siren?","replies":[{"poster":"TILTILTILTILTILT","date":"2015-06-29T02:19:06.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".........no","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mantv","date":"2015-06-28T10:51:00.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo Brad teach me league to get better :'), i feel like i could improve alot","replies":[{"poster":"TILTILTILTILTILT","date":"2015-06-28T12:48:05.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just message me when I'm on, brother.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"imustbehappy","date":"2015-06-26T10:41:49.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Bradley I was wondering if you could tell me some tips on playing mid with talon.
