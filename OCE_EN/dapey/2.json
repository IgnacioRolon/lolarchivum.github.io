Give me your opinion.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"!!WARNING: TURN OFF YOUR VOLUME WHEN VIEWING THE VIDEO THE SOUND IS DISTORTED DUE TO THE .25% SPEED OF THE VIDEO!!\n\nOkay guys, I&#039;ve had enough, the amount of yasuo scripters, jinx scripters and just scripters in general is really bothering me lately. This is my first video evidence of a scripter in action (Although I&#039;ve encountered a LOT of them). Notice how he windwalls BEFORE lux&#039;s animation even comes out? How he has PERFECT CS (didn&#039;t miss one cs entire laning phase), he has perfect knock up? Even off off quinns E, he had PERFECT orbwalking / AA&#039;ing (2.0 AS) as seen towards the end of the video... I mean, how obvious does it have to be?\n\nNow to the naked eye this might look just like &quot;luck&quot; etc, or to someone who doesn&#039;t know what to look out for in scripters. But I&#039;ve done extensive research on youtube and this guy ticks all the boxes, he wasn&#039;t using general evade for circular skillshots BUT targeted hard cc he would almost always windwall with ABSURD time (before animations even come out). He would PERFECTLY E last hit minions, i mean he didn&#039;t lose 1 cs and his only gold, not even LCS can PERFECT cs lmao...\n\n\nPS: the first two videos in that are so obvious his scripting watch carefully him windwall 0.0001th of a second before luxs snare animation even goes out..... If needed I can upload his laning phase where he didn't miss one cs...\n\nPSS: Making support ticket now with evidence","replies":[{"poster":"LCHuntsman","date":"2016-12-25T11:30:35.485+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah dude he is totally scripting!\nHow the F*** can Riot continue to let scum like this play their game?\n\nDeserves a PERMANENT BAN","replies":[{"poster":"beers","date":"2016-12-25T11:34:02.771+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ive played a few games with this guy and he seems like a genuinely nice person... i didn't think he would stoop to such a low level of sportsmanship. #endscripters","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-25T18:07:58.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"he hasn't its just another genuine retard complain about really bad use of a yasuo w, a style unique to low low elo hell, anyone can spam w as a general block, not every one has split second reaction times to block spells cast right on top of his model or from multiple different angles. A proper yasuo will keep their wall until the last possible second to firstly get a longer duration out of it, and secondly to be able to block more spells at once, as the spell comes out of his core as an arc before expanding into a rectangle, blocking a wider radius, therefore blocking more, that \"scripter\" (cough 12 yearold who unloaded into walls) wanted to cry because they still haven't learn the basics of fighting a yasuo, he general yasuo does walls just like that, so they are easy to play around and feed on anyway.\n\nThe guy in the video is fine, this kid is just trying to start a witch hunt because he is butt hurt about being worse than this low level yasuo.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fist my Anus","date":"2016-12-25T11:34:02.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mate are you familiar with what orb walking is?  It is using an auto attack with an orb effect (which doesn't exist in league of legends) to cancel an auto attack animation therefore you walk while attacking.  This originated from Dota and what you are referring to is stutter stepping you inbred.  As for whether he is scripting or not, I must say you are a very dull individual if you think that what he is doing is scripting.

Any good yasuo player could do that shit x10 better while half asleep, that looks more like a kid pouting because they don't know how to outplay, literally every single w he used was a basic defensive technique low level yasuo players do to shield themselves. A good yasuo player doesn't need scripts their reaction times are fast enough to stop shit like zac e over walls and block ezreal ults from the fog in less than a split millisecond to save drag. His walls were spat out in a general defensive style unique to low elo, where idiots unload their shit into it and call him broken and scripting, literally all that was. If you really did study you would know his w would be cast at either a certain projectile or every damn projectile, the simple fact it wasn't every projectile and that he used it on things that weren't the same projectile shows enough more so where you showed a slow motion of him pressing w into nothing.\n\nOh another thing i forgot to mention. 0.0001th of a second before her q goes out? well damn diddly, he knows what her bloody cast animation looks like, you know that damn massive windup it has where she pulls back before throwing forwards, with its massive windup of .125 seconds, oh yea I know that one too, any1 with half a brain can read that animation and press w.\n\nOh yeah i forgot to mention, yasuo scales well on aa speed, so he would obviously do better bloody auto attacking at 2.0 than a yasuo (casual yasuo plebs) do with the bare minimum. Stop making up shit to start a witch hunt because some guy/gal knows what enemy lux cast animations look like ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-12-25T12:00:09.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm fairly certain this is a troll post but it looks like you're just pointing out whenever he uses W, which he uses like a very low-level player.
