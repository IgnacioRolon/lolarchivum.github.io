My friend said i should get Vi, so i was saving up for her then Nocturne came on the free week and i played him and now i kinda like him, but i don&#039;t know which one i wanna buy.... So my question is, Who&#039;s better?","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-05-10T01:49:16.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a scrub at the game, and I can do well in Vi.   Haven't been fortunate to play Nocturne so won't comment.   But honestly, whatever you play well and suits your play style.   My issue is \"Shinny things\" attract my attention, its why I have champs I can't play.......","replies":[]},{"poster":"HumptyDumpty427","date":"2015-05-09T07:55:18.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks guys","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-09T01:04:46.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jarvan.","replies":[{"poster":"HumptyDumpty427","date":"2015-05-09T07:54:55.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm, ok haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T01:52:44.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nardiastorm","date":"2015-05-09T03:49:40.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends on how you want to play. Both are very good at getting into the back line and disrupting damage dealers.\n\nVi has better utility and is a more benificial to build tank items than nocturne. And via is a lot better in team fights as she offers more cc and utility for her team than noc. \n\nAs you may know, nocturne fills a more carry role as he benefits more from damage than vi. He does offer a lot of single target damage and lockdown which makes him a decent assassin. Although not bad in team fights, if there are multiple damage dealers nocturne can struggle a bit.\n\nTL:DR\nVi = team fight tank\nNocturne = carry assassin\n\nP.S. I think that vi is a better choice","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-08T23:42:26.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi is definetly better (Ganking) but i like nocturne's playstyle and looks far better","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-08T23:34:44.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vi's better","replies":[]}]}
