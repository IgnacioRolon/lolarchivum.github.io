Right now there's a problem with casting certain skills. It exists to some degree at all pings, but is particularly noticeable with high latency levels. I've seen quite a few posts complaining about the problem but nothing on how Riot could fix it.","url":"http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=2685420","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/small.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please see the attached link and problem described therein. I&#039;m curious whether any Riot developer has looked into the issue and considered implementing the thread author&#039;s suggestions. I don&#039;t believe the reply to the post is accurate, as the suggested fix is already used the most popular MMO&#039;s today like WoW. Any champion that has a Q spam (Skarner, Cassiopeia, etc) is unnecessarily crippled when playing from any location or ISP that results in even moderate latency, and nearly unplayable with lag over 150ms. It also affects any champion that has a abilities with dependencies on other spells like Jayce/Nidalee.\r\n\r\nTL:DR While latency is a problem that realistically can&#039;t be avoided, a simple change in the way the game is programmed to interact with the server could reduce its detrimental effects to gameplay tenfold.\r\n\r\nIs any Red able to provide feedback on this matter? Much appreciated.","replies":[]}
