Depending on when the account was last active, it's possible that the Summoner Name protection decayed and allowed someone else to claim the name. The decay itself can take between 6 months for level 1-6 accounts to 30 months for level 30+ accounts. You can refer to the Support page on [Inactive Summoner Name Rules](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Inactive-Summoner-name-rules) for more on that.\n\nIf you've just transferred regions, then it's likely that summoner name was already taken on the server you'd transferred to, which would force a name change for you. As Ninox said, it's also possible the name was reserved due to being used by a Rioter or esports player.","replies":[]}]}
