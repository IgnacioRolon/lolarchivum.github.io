Who lets off a transperant trail of smoke. Floating above the ground he looks like an innocent champion who&#039;s looks can decive \r\n\r\nInfo: Ogien is a champion who does not rely on mana but instead builds rage at level 6 he is able to activate his R.\r\n\r\nAttacks\r\nOgien throws a small ball of fire dealing 100 damage and also inflicting 1.5 seconds of burning to an enemy dealing an additional 20 damage.\r\n\r\nQ: Ogien throws a ball of fire that travels a bit further than his RB attack dealing 500 damage with an after burn of 2.5 seconds during that 2.5 seconds the enemy champion will slowly burn dealing 100 damage over time. 5 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nW: During Ogiens W he extinguishes becoming invisible to the enemy but partially transperant to allies for 5 seconds. This is useful when he is escaping, but he is still visible by turrets and warding trinkets. 9 secons cooldown.\r\n\r\nE: a small cilinders pop out of Ogien and he spins around shooting small pellets of fire like a minigun dealing 50 damage for each pellet. This ability has no afterburn. 15 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nR: Ogiens R is activated once he has built up his rage. Once activated Ogien EXPLODES!!! Into a large fireball if an enemy champion is in he center of the explosion it is an insta kill . The fireball expands and deals less damage the further the enemy is from the center. Does not expand to whole map. 90 second cooldown.\r\n\r\nLore: long ago a small boy called Alek lived in a small town called torn. Alek was often bullied and had no friends in his town. One day in anger he ran from the village to a cave he sat down and cried. After an hour he picked up a rock and threw it as hard as he could at the cave wall. A spark lit up the cave Alek jumped back in fright and saw a floating flame who he called Ogien.\r\nAfter returning to the village his bullies said he couldnt co e back to the village. Ogien jumped up from behind Alek and just as the bullie threw a punch Ogien blocked it and burned his hand. After a few years Ogien woke up to see Alek was missing. All Ogien Did was look for Alek. Ogien joined the league of legends after finding Alek in the same cave he was made. Since that day Ogien has been fighting with the league of legends to enforce karma like he did to the bully.\r\n\r\nVocals\r\nStart of game: Hurt my friends and ill make sure you regret it.\r\nWin: Meanies never win\r\nLose:  ill be back another day, ill show you whos the boss.\r\n\r\nCreated by Filip and Declan\r\nfizzypop019 {{champion:105}}{{champion:85}}, Golden Platypus{{champion:64}}{{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"Thornax11","date":"2016-04-25T10:36:46.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude this champion sounds awesome, maybe just a bit O.P....\nAlso, how did you get the voting thing?\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"RelentlessLIVE","date":"2016-04-21T10:40:17.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a brand mixed with a lulu....anyways..good work but i voted no. \n\nReason: no one can be more firey then brand :).. Also make up a new skill that sounds nothing like brand nor lulu.. (Obviously apart from the invisible skil)\n\nMaybe he summons bees? Or a beams of light? Or  leafs? Idk think more outside the box.\n\nThis is a constructive feedback so dont get angry :)\n\nAlso the fact that his invisable to his allies maybe the other way around?  or maybe he can use something else as an escape...like if you wanna stick to fire he can have a fire whip? That he can whip his own minion or the enemies minion and has a 2nd option to press the skill again to go towards it or just hit it like a double damage skill.\n\nHopefully that gave you some more ideas dont give up. Also make it sound less childish...\n\nOr maybe create one champion with a firey whip? Someone who came from hell? Crux!! Demon of the underworld seeking to kill one of the champions that set him back to hell idk lol your the artist....\n\n\nHope i helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"XLANHarukaYuuki","date":"2016-04-19T21:01:20.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a really great character but the fact he goes invisible to his allies too is pretty confusing so he would be a solo champion instead of ones you can make plays with since league is a team game. Plus the cool down on that makes no sense if a flame, something brightly colored and beautiful diminishes it means it is dead so having that move is also concerning, do you have any other ideas for the W? Also your ultimate would make this a really unfair champion to fight and would probably make the player lose interest in them fast since they would start feeling like they are trolling when they use him in a match and that they wont have any fun fights like when you see a zed outplay a Diana (Redmercy's Zed outplay video) , because all Ogien has to do is build rage w in a team fight and get a penta like nothing all by pressing 2 buttons. I believe he would be a ridiculously fun champion and I would hope to see him in the future but, you have to rethink him in-terms of base damage because your abilities all do a ton of damage(especially when items are built{{item:3089}} ) and and W should be changed and R should be nerfed  so it is not an \"instakill.\" Other than those things he would be a really fun champion i hope to see more champs like these in the future.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"fizzypop019","date":"2016-04-19T23:28:10.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The W is like teemo when he stands still he is not visible from the enemys perspective but partially visible to his allies if that makes sense","replies":[{"poster":"fizzypop019","date":"2016-04-19T23:34:16.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And yea some attacks seem op.
