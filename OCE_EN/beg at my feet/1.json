My high school is offering 1 week of work experience at our dream job. I was wondering how I could get work experience at riot games in Sydney. Is it possible that I can go to their office in the city and talk about it there with them?? Working with riot would be a huge success for me, I started playing league a year ago and I am in love with the game. \r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Nignu","date":"2019-02-13T19:07:58.527+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"heck no xD are u cereal right now XD{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} ","replies":[{"poster":"WK Nyjj","date":"2019-02-13T19:08:28.277+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"this guy cant be cereal xD","replies":[{"poster":"Nignu","date":"2019-02-13T19:09:03.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IKR XD 15 year old more like de XdD","replies":[]}]}]}]}
