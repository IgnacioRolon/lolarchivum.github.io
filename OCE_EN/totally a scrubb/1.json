I've spent more than 4 hours straight trying out various solutions. One worked for me.\n\nThe issue I had is actually linked to the ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED problem.\n\nThe fix I've found (after trying many popular solutions) is to disable your TCP/IPv6. That fixed it for me. I can sign in the support site and the Lunar Revel Shop button appeared for me.\n\nPerhaps you could spread this possible solution to those you saw having the similar problems. Thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
