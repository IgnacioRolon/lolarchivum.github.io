Hear me out.\r\n\r\nSo imagine a champion where all  basic abilities depending on the output (example Q>E>W) changed the ability of the ulti (finisher) \r\n\r\nSo in my head this champion would be short range and look like it has a martial art background. The champion has a low cd ulti which is completely different depending of the previous combo and can only be used when a given combo is used.\r\n\r\nHope my idea makes sense and you like it\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-12T11:41:02.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:63}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:60}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} ?\nI see where you're coming from and it would be quite an interesting champ. Idk about it adding a new mechanic to the game but it'd be as cool as these combo champs^","replies":[{"poster":"Plectro","date":"2016-10-07T07:45:23.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see, in my head I feel you'd need quite a blank slate to create this character though as the combo element would mean the other 3 non ult abilities would have to be very different to the listed champs.
