So, for 1400g you get 60 AP (20 base, 40 from stacks). Comparable AP items around the same price are Haunting Guise and Needlessly Large Rod. HG costs 1485, gives 25 AP, 200 hp and 15 Mag pen. NLR gives 80 AP.\n\nSo basically what this means is that there's no gamble to buying a Meijai's. Comparable value items give you either significantly less, or marginally more AP. Losing half the stacks has minimal effect because you shouldn't be holding onto it past three items or so anyway. In it's current state, Meijai's is flat out broken. Sword of the Occult is pretty strong too, but I haven't used it as much.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-23T11:10:40.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"youre suppose to buy it early as your soul damage item and then not die\n\nie buying in full tank after to ensure that you dont","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-22T20:44:15.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't agree with these items have 5 starting stacks to them, and would rather see their base values being upped a little bit. However, that would be something like setting a ten to a twenty. To be honest though, they are only items that are viable in games where you are so ridiculously ahead. That isn't often. Whether or not you start with five stacks won't matter for the people who really should be building them, as I would assume they'd reach twenty stacks either way. To be honest though, I think they are kinda silly items and don't see why they even exist. If you are so far ahead, you have the gold to build whatever you want anyway and have tonnes more AD/AP than everyone else.","replies":[]}]}
