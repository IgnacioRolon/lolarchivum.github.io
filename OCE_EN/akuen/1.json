It used to be that while the only language that was officially supported was your regions language, you could manually change the language of the client. Now it seems like we can change the language to the language of any server we can transfer to. This means we can&#039;t change the language to things like Korean or Chinese because we can&#039;t transfer to them. \r\n\r\nAs someone trying to learn Korean that spends an enormous amount of time playing League, the ability to have the client in the language I was learning was fantastic. Now this is impossible. Please fix this :C","replies":[]}
