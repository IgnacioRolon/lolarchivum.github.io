Holds up &gt;to 3 charges which refill upon visiting the shop.&quot;\n&gt;Relic Shield - changed\n\nHere is why I hate these changes so much:\n\n- Real support mains loved the item actives, now supports will just be homogenized\n- Tank supports will be gone from the meta (no more FOTM, harder to complete quest), and poke supports will be even stronger (Xerath, looking at you)\n- Now just about every role will have a sightstone after they buy something like a spellthiefs or relic shield, i.e. return to Season 3 (wards are everywhere)\n- That is, if the game doesn&#039;t snowball and end first because whichever bot lane loses will not be able to come back (no vision until you complete quest)\n- Relic shield will be established starting item for every adc (which is already stupid)\n\nI wish Riot would consult the community before making vast changes every so often, get some pro players advice on how you would like to shape the meta. This change will not make supports feel appreciated, now they will just become ward bots.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-23T01:21:46.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically every lane/jungle already have Champions that do run the support items, so basically every lane has a sightstone now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-24T10:06:24.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The simplest solution to all this nonsense is to just make these new warding support items build from the gold generator and a sight stone. I don't get why this is so hard for them figure out. \n\nHow about this new support item line:\n\nRelic shield: While near a friendly champion, they gain a shield over time (out of combat). Every else same as before. \n\nAncient coin: Same as before except the upgraded item active restores mana to your team (not yourself) and buffs their amour and magic resistance.\n\nSpellthiefs: Buff's shielding and healing, passively generates gold until upgraded to frostfang which then grants gold on hit. Active item acts like clairvoyance. \n\nThese changes make the items support focused instead of being able to be abused on their own.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-01-25T18:18:10.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep good ideas. I don't understand why the balance team changes up the whole meta everytime one item is abused. Just fix the item without changing the meta.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2018-01-23T01:39:41.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"adcs got relic for the shield it gave you, it no longer shields, and non supports that got frost fang got it for the ghosts it no longer ghosts","replies":[]}]}
