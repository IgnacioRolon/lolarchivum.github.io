They die once or twice then leave.\r\nIn my last 3 games this has happened 100% of the time, twice on enemy team and once on our team. Then this morning I&#039;m spectating my first game and the same thing happens. And in game chat a guy complains that its happened to him in his last 4 games!\r\n\r\nGet some balls kiddies. If you are against a smurf, play the game out and learn what you did right/wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you wanna WIN, you will LOSE firstly. Nobody is born a challenger level player.\r\n\r\nP.S. This post was taken down previous because apparently I was naming names by putting up a picture of a screen that I was spectating on. I did not name any names, I just posted what I saw as a third party spectator.","replies":[{"poster":"MrDad2G","date":"2018-01-17T14:11:07.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happens everywhere even in arams...i found after this new year season its gotten a lot toxic. have to wait all the kids to go to school","replies":[]}]}
