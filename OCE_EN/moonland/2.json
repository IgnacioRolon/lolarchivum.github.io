They have a smart system that lets you display what name you are known as without having to change where the information for your account is tied to. This helps keeps thing all in the same spot if they need information on an account and they don't have to go chasing it down under a different name if it changed location.\n\nI hope this helps to explain why this is, keep in mind your username is only used for logging into league, while it would be useful to change this if you wanted it really doesn't have an impact on what other players see your name as.\n\nIf you have any questions let me know and I hope this clarifies why this is.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-11-17T21:32:01.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why in the absolute possible fuck would you want or need to change your username?","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-17T21:49:10.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah chill there, he's asking a simple question, no harm in that.\n\nUnfortunately Moonland, no, you can't change your username.
