They only cost 1 IP each, so you can fill up 2 run pages for 60 IP which is really good.\n\nThere are 4 main pages you want: Attack Damage, Attack Speed, Ability Power and Tank.\n Since you start with 2 rune pages, it best to build the AD and AP ones.\n\nAD Marks, Armour Seals, Magic Resist Glyphs and AD Quints.\nMagic Pen Marks, Armour Seals, Magic Resist Glyphs and AP Quints.\n\nMake sure you check guides/sites for proper builds and masteries. With all the recent changes to masteries and items things may change a lot over the next few weeks, so its kind of a hard time to learn right now. Sites like probuilds.net are helpful in seeing how Challenger and Pro level players are building champions.\n\nLearn what EVERY champion in the game does. You do not need to like them, but by learning how each champion works you will understand better how to counter or play with that champion.\n\nif anyone is being a douche, don't type back, don't acknowledge them at all, just mute. People get angry even when you are friendly and trying to give advice so its best to say nothing.\n\nAs a new player. There is a \"farming game\" you can play which will help with your cs'ing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G0osoXFCck\n\nYou go into a custom game and try to get to 90+ cs by 10 mins.","replies":[]}]}
