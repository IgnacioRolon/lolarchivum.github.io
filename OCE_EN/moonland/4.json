I'm experiencing this as well so it isn't just you. I think it likely it can't save messages properly between legacy and new client (When it was still alpha you could have two separate status messages dependent on which client you had open, so it seems likely to me that the merging of the clients is what has caused this issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Moonland","date":"2016-11-15T08:42:47.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope it's a bug, I hope it wasn't an intentional change :/\nI want to uhh, 'express' who I main ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T08:50:25.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not an intentional change certainly, just something that has likely been pushed to the sidelines for now in favour of higher priority features like missing store functions, RGM, item sets and the like.
