I&#039;ve tried top but I keep getting camped and I can&#039;t &#039;reach&#039; other lanes easily, top feels really isolated (I know about teleport but I&#039;d get camped early so I won&#039;t be able to make an impact later at all). I&#039;m gonna give mid a try tomorrow though so I&#039;m looking forward to that. I&#039;m okay with jungling but I wouldn&#039;t prefer it (personal preference) but I really want to get into support but I just feel like it&#039;s not a role you can carry with, especially since when I play supports I like utility supports (e.g. Janna etc). \r\n\r\nSo as a &#039;low level&#039; player (I&#039;d probably be Lv.19 tomorrow) I need help :/\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"MF Support","date":"2016-11-13T00:21:55.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support.\n\nPick Miss Fortune, Max E,W,E,Q,E,R then max E and Q asap.\n\nRush Eye of the watchers, Black Cleaver and Mortal Reminder.\n\nYou can now E/R combo out the enemy ADC solo, whilst cleaving his armor to nothing and stopping him from healing :)","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-11-13T11:26:43.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lul miss fortune in this meta","replies":[]},{"poster":"Moonland","date":"2016-11-13T04:56:37.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I can tell by your summoner name.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Moonland","date":"2016-11-13T04:52:43.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks to everyone for the responses, all shed some new light for me, but I have another weird question...\n\nI've had two really good games as Soraka, one with S-, one with S+.......and I get censored on chat for saying \"S+ Raka\"?

Adc is really easy to carry with as long as you know how to position yourself and know what to build. Support is easy to carry with believe it or not, you just need to know your matchups and when to go all out and when to be passive asf. Mid is my 3rd preferred role to carry with, as a ex mid laner, just win your lane roam a lot. Jungle is by far the hardest role to carry with for me only because my type of jungle play is all about getting my team fed and if that fails, I fail to get myself fed and we lose the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-11-12T22:56:38.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You, as a level 18, I'd say you can do any champion. If it's hard, practice and then you'll find the other champions much easier because it's not hard like the hard champion you were using. For example, Orianna can be really hard because all her abilities and passive have to do with The Ball but you must still defend yourself because she is very squishy. She is half mage half support (I'm a level 20 and I'm using her that's why I mention her). She is better mid than anything, but she also works quite well as a support. Get good at her and you could find a champion that might also be hard but more fun and you'll get good at her easily.\n\nSo, go ahead and try a hard champion like Orianna (as she can be both the roles you didn't try yet) and play a few bot games and you might find it quite challenging but fun! The sooner you master it the faster you master the whole game.

You can also roam when ahead too, if you are pushed up top their tower and are open to ganks, just leave your lane and go help the other lanes.\n\nin terms of impacting the game, this is who generally affects the game most and when (roughy):\n\n0:00 - 20:00: Jungler/Support\n20:00 -35:00 Mid/Top\n35:00+ ADC\n\nSo if your games aren't lasting very long, playing ADC wont help you be impactful. If you are the jungle or support, you can be very impactful early on, but if your games go on a long time these roles become a little less key. \nBut mid and Top lane are most impactful for the main chunk of the game, and because mid lane is in the centre of the map, you are more likely to be involved in fights or securing objectives like dragon. So by default the mid lane becomes more impactful than Top lane.\n\nIf you're just starting in the mid lane, I would recommend these champions:\nLux\nAnnie\nBrand\nVel'Koz\nAhri\nXerath\n\nThose champions don't require much heavy thinking to use, and are all quite strong for little effort, and easy to learn. Most of them can also double as support too if you need them to.\n\nBut if you are dead set on support, there are a few supports that can carry games very well:\nBlitzcrank\nThresh\nAlistar\n\nThose supports are more often than not, just straight up better than most others. \n\nWhile champions like:\nLulu\nLux\nZyra\nAnnie\n\nAre all equally as good in mid lane as they are in support. So if you want to switch between the two positions, they are a good few champs to pick up. Annie being the easiest and Zyra being the hardest. _(if you like Janna, youll like Lulu)_\n\nSorry for the essay, i hope it helps ^^","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T11:09:19.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Mid lane is the most often ganked lane, BUT it is the hardest lane to gank, so most ganks in mid don't usually end in a kill.\n\nIt's really not that hard to gank, maybe you won't always pull a kill, but it's rare that the gank won't go off, because simply put, you can't really put wards everywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-12T18:47:42.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean in the sense that no matter where the jungler comes from, you can basically run away in exactly the opposite direction (unlike bot or top, where you run straight into the wall that marks the edge of the map). There are more routes to gank, but there are equally more routes to escape. The lane is shorter meaning you also have less time to kill an enemy before they reach safety.\n\nAlso many of the popular mid laners atm, Yasuo/Zed/Viktor etc lack instant hard CC, unlike bot lane where the support throws every form of CC imaginable on you just before the jungler comes in. \n\nAlso many of the champions in mid lane have dashes/escapes of some sort. (we all know how hard it is to gank an ADC with a dash, like Ezreal, and unlike mid laners, he is one of few people in his lane to have an escape)\n\nSo no you cant put wards everywhere, but i still maintain that it is harder to gank than other lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T19:19:40.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just as someone who plays a lot of jungle, Mid is my go to lane to gank if it's even slightly gankable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Moonland","date":"2016-11-12T19:09:44.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My current uhh, possible mid laners (I think, correct me if I'm wrong) are Annie, Akali (who apparently got nerfed tot he ground?), Kayle which I don't like, Malzahar who I'm probably going to use more, Ryze, Twisted Fate who apparently isn't noob-friendly, and Yasuo who I don't really like.\n\nMy personal preference would be to try Malzahar more (haven't been able to yet since I haven't played much recently and I just got some network issues fixed).\n\nThe thing about supports is that I only have utility supports and not uhh, \"carry\" supports?
