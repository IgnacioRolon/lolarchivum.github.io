These bots always seem to start with boots and go into lane when the minions do, also they run specific summoners too: Mark, Ghost. This makes the game really painful for the rest of us as this game used to be who had the better team match up which was fun to see who have better rng, to now just being who has less bots. This happened a while ago and I wasn&#039;t too bothered until my last match. It was me my friend and the enemy riven, the rest were ALL bots. Please rito gods fix this, I&#039;ve seen too many bots in other games and I don&#039;t want their dirty hands to touch our homeland (no offence blitz or heim turrets... or turrets... ermm etc?). Anyways thanks for playing attention to my ermm narrative and have a good day lol. :) (I don&#039;t know if this is only for oce)\r\n\r\nDraphiux","replies":[{"poster":"FENTON","date":"2015-10-12T12:24:21.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this.  I see these bots during the day all up till the afternoon (and sometimes at night).  ARAM is the prime target of bots and its easy to spot them (their scripts are actually getting better).  They usually buy multiple boots, walk all the way towards enemy team and just cast all spells +auto attack without side stepping or any visual indications of tactical movements.  It really ruins everybody's experience.  I've reported them each game and have advised others do as well, but I still see the same names.","replies":[]}]}
