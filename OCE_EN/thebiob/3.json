If you read this please look at the effort I've put into this post and give me some response.\r\n\r\nAbout me: I have been playing league since season 1. I have 4102 hours of league I was in the top 10 most hours spent on league last year but I haven't been playing very regularly anymore. I had insane amounts of fun playing the Star Guardian Game Mode when it was released on 25 September 2017. And when Odyssey was released on the 12th of September I was not disappointed, when I saw the announcement on Facebook I had never been more excited, that much excitement is a feeling I had never felt before. Side-note: The missions made it 10x more enjoyable. I realized that they were both released in September and being the optimistic person I am, I assumed that there would be another PvE game-mode.\r\n\r\nTHEN!!!!\r\n\r\nI was reading your \"State of Game Modes\" post (https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2019/07/dev-state-of-modes/) and I got the impression that there will be no more PvE game modes coming to league any time soon. Needless to say I was very, extremely, massively disappointed.\r\n\r\nI immediately went to my league group chat (remember the tribe system Riot created to make league feel more like a community for people? Yes, it has a use - to unite PvE lovers and strategize how we are going to win without a Sona or Ziggs and only 1 Jinx) to tell them the bad news.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to another point. THE COMMUNITY, there's nothing that unites players like a PvE game where you work together to achieve these goals, if you fail, you fail together and thus, learn together. Never had I experienced this making friends on league before until these game modes.\r\n\r\nPLEASE RIOT give me an answer. This has really upset me, what do I look forward to now?\r\n\r\nI pray you surprise me with something :3. I still love you but I am just disappointed right now.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-08-15T08:42:32.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PvE isn't coming back, its too much effort on their part for so little gain, a 2-4 week gamemode, with an Entirely NEW system and map, i doubt we'll even get any of the old Acension, Nexus Blitz or PROJECT event either, because maintaining a map that appears for a brief time period is not worth the teams time, since the player numbers don't increase when they come in.\n\nAt most we get TFT, MAYBE URF, and Snowdown/Bligewater.\n\nIf this is the only gamemodes you want, i'd just quit and find a new game, the chance of them coming back is minimal","replies":[]}]}
