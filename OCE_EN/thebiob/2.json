IMO easily the best event related game mode hands down.\nIt was fun, hectic, challenging, and united players together in a way that other game modes can't do.\n\nStar Guardian was alright, it was fun at the time but is essentially just an Odyssey beta though.\n\nThe first ever Doom Bots was amazing! absolutely amazing.  Everything since, has been crap.  'The Teemoing' just felt hollow and ultimately pointless.\nI miss the 50 minute long super-turtling that you did to survive (and win) the onslaught of the original doombots.  Seeing the creative teams people concocted (did you build a full turtle squad, or 'kill them before they kill us' all assassins team etc.)\n\nIf Riot can make them without sacrificing other aspects of the game (such as TFT), then I see no problem with bringing them back and making new ones.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2019-08-15T10:53:22.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't agree with you more.
