Repetitive trolling behaviour should result in loss of lp. I understand this way may be very un-user-friendly and/or may violate the ranking system, but this issue needs to be addressed because I need to stop losing lp from dodging and I need justice if it happens! \r\n\r\nFinally, I&#039;m sure you guys will have better ideas to solve this problem but pleaseeee solve it!","replies":[{"poster":"SWORDMASTER52","date":"2017-09-26T01:32:48.626+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a good idea, however I'd love to experience this update but due to my ban I cannot :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cabbage Girl","date":"2017-09-26T00:51:39.011+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"this idea sounds great!!! {{summoner:31}}  we really need a solution to this problem - it's so annoying :( {{champion:117}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-09-26T01:56:08.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a good idea, bit I think it would need a for mechanic similar to the surrender vote, where at least 2 or 3 of the 4 people have to agree.
