The purpose of doing this is so that you could possibly create a twitch.tv account that is just dedicated to watching this &quot;Bot/AI&quot; play ranked to see how far in can actually climb within the League of Legends ranking system. I believe that this could become very popular watching a Bot/AI play league of legends at a human standard.\r\nAnother possibility is that if Riot Games has the tech to do something similar to the amiibo&#039;s on &quot;Super smash bros&quot; where the amiibo&#039;s AI learns from whoever is teaching it to play, maybe by getting high level players such as challengers, masters or even high diamond players to teach the Bot/AI how to play League of Legends. \r\nObviously that if this bot is used on any other League of legends account that the user be punished by a ban or have their account reset.\r\n\r\nI Strongly believe this could be possible to do something like this.\r\nI came to the boards to see what everyone else&#039;s thoughts on this is.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-07T13:48:19.344+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranked system (from bronze to gold) is pretty much entirely luck based, its a 50/50 chance as to wether you get a good team or a bad one, wether you feed or you get fed.\n\nReal skill and strategy doesn't play a part in it until higher Elo's, there are people in b5 that deserve gold and are just unlucky and theres people in gold that definitely should be in b5. \n\nLuck is a huge part of league, so i reckon a bot would rise through the ranks just as easily/diffcultly as any other player in lower elo. \n\nThis sounds like a good experiment (partially because it will reveal so many flaws in the system) and i would back it. However you have the ethical problem of what happens to the players on its team and on the opposing team, it obviously wont understand communication, and thus may be a hinderance, or it could have inhuman abilities like aim-bot etc. and be op as fuck. either way it gives one side an unfair advantage, and those players would undoubtably kick up a fuss to riot when they lose. \n\nBut i think its a good idea regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuusiel","date":"2016-05-08T05:59:35.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With the communication thing it could be helped probably by the technology (like amiibo's from nintendo) where the bot recognises that the team is grouping for a fight for example around dragon or baron and if it has teleport it could teleport to the nearest ward and join in on the fight. Another idea is that the bot could maybe respond to pings such as \"summoner has targeted this champion\" or the same thing with dragon or baron. \n\nBut ofcourse the bot/ai is going to have some sort of aim-bot otherwise it's not going to be able to land any skillshots. As for something like reaction time instead of having like an instant reaction time like you see with scripters, the developers would obviously have to try and make it delayed a little bit because as you said the people who vs the bot/ai would obviously complain.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Shrewd","date":"2016-05-07T08:11:20.335+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really interesting idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-07T05:53:46.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This makes me question one thing.\n\nIs it legal for a BOT to own an account, because if it is, then this would be fine, if it's not ok (which i don't think it would be) then doing something like this would just break the T&C.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-07T13:42:11.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you read the terms and conditions?\n\nIt states that you are forbidden from showing RIOT any fan art or giving them any champion/skin/gameplay ideas at all.\nIt also says that if you are 13 or under you are forbidden from giving any identifiable details to RIOT or posing them on any RIOT associated website.\nIm pretty sure that both those rules are broken every single day.\n\nFirstly, they have a whole board called 'player creations' which is basically an invite to break the Terms and conditions.
