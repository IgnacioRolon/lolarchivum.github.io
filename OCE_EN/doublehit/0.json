Everyone loads in and its complete chaos to see who can type their role out the quickest, even then people just go whatever they want anyway and how do u report that? no body is given a role so its just your word against theirs? it makes no sense.  It just seems like whoever has an SSD gets to type out their role first with the hope that someone doesn&#039;t &quot;Troll&quot; and go that position also.  Why not make Draft normals  for everyone including with limited champions and level so that when you are given a role you and someone else takes it riot can clearly see the system gave u that role not them and they are able to be punished?

I feel like blind pick should be changed where you q up just like draft mode and u get a role u ask for but there are no bans. That way atleast riot can clearly see whos telling the truth and who isn't and a punishment can be handed down and it will be just as fast as the champ select is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-06T01:25:53.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes you can't like if you call a role but they were faster to lock it in, it's bm but they didn't steal the role.
