Now. I&#039;ve seen a lot of people on the forums that have been banned or punished that definitely did not fall under hate speech. The definition of hate speech being. &quot;Hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or gender.&quot; \n\nDoes someone want to define &quot; Competitive BSing&quot;?  I have seen people on the forums who have been banned for &quot;not using chat constructively.&quot; ( Riots words not mine) Forgive me if i&#039;m wrong but Competitive BSing does not sound very constructive to me? but here riot is saying that its fine? So am i allowed to say &quot;Haha you&#039;re pretty fucking shit at this game dude&quot;? after someone fails a play? people have been punished for chat like that but it  seems like Competitive BSIng to me? Doesn&#039;t fall under hate speech in the slightest so what&#039;s the deal here?","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-13T04:53:09.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tip:\nInstead of talking shit, just run it down mid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2018-01-13T10:35:30.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"well we now have a riot employee stating that if someone has muted you, then you should be banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2018-01-13T10:00:45.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot games\n\nWhere pro players get a week ban from competitive for being toxic\n\nBut you get perma banned for 1 naughty word","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-13T10:27:08.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And pant's said %%%%%% once, and didn't get to go to their boot camp.\n\nWhere if we say %%%%%%, we be banned","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-13T01:13:52.325+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot are really just a company that have no idea what they're doing, with anything, except money.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2018-01-13T10:41:05.774+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"they just have the wrong people in certain positions that are making these decisions. clearly they got some sjw types with political agendas on a personal crusade and huge egos rather than logical, objective decision makers that are capable of thinking about the game and it's players on a bigger scope as is required. probably a result of hiring based on diversity rather than merit for those positions that most companies do these days.\n\nthis is what turns simple solutions into complex problems.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Doublehit","date":"2018-01-13T05:42:52.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=L2AZxx6Y,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-13T01:13:52.325+0000)\n>\n> Riot are really just a company that have no idea what they&#x27;re doing, with anything, except money.\n\nYou would think when u make around 2 billion dollars a day you might be able to do something about this..","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-14T11:56:23.655+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yea, because these guys above is the top of the cream; They know best.
