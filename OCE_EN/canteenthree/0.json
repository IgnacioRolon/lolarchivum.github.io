Yet, if you are going from red side to blue side (regardless of the team you are in), the HUD will block the vision.\r\n\r\nI believe this is more unfair to the red team as the red team may have a higher chance w&#039;ing from red to blue side.\r\n\r\nTo minimise the impact, would it be possible to hide the HUD when Nunu &amp; Willump {{champion:20}} use their w?\r\n\r\nPlease be free to discuss your views. Am I the only one who thinks it is difficult to use the w going from red to blue side?","replies":[{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2018-10-29T22:00:10.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my screen resolution is pretty small, playing on red side as either adc or support makes it a lot harder than playing on the blue side. i'm forced to free cam and it's rather annoying, even after i make the HUD size smallest possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-29T21:43:34.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never considered this, but it is a fair point.\nSame goes for Sion R.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-03T23:56:52.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never played the new Nunu, but I say no to removing the HUD. It is still needed to see the cooldowns of your other abilities. You don't want to turn that off for x seconds. However, a solution could be an option which lets you make the HUD transparent, or just show squares with timers or something (anything which lets you see behind the HUD).\n\nI've been playing locked cam since the start, and it's just something which has to be dealt with if you refuse to unlock your camera. I say that assuming the ability doesn't force-lock your camera.\n\nDue to locked cam, the HUD is always in my way (but also the angle/screen visibile distance) negatively affects my gameplay. Hence, I use champions which don't need to fight or aim downwards. E.g. Tryndamere, Yi, Diana, anything with short range. As for global ults, I need to ulti the minimap.\n\nFYI: Blue team gains less and loses more MMR than the red team. Confirmed somewhere on the forums by a mod/developer.","replies":[]}]}
