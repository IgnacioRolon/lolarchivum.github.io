I'm a support main and i wanna try dofferent roles!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, I&#039;m Lvl 18 and a diehard support main. I recently felt like my skills weren&#039;t improving so I thought I&#039;d try some different roles. But after one game of jg{{champion:9}} - I&#039;ve realised that I have completely forgotten my combat skills, I didn&#039;t know what to build, and that I have a warding addiction(I really miss buying Sightstone!{{item:2045}} ). \r\n\r\nso... Any tips? Plus extra tips for {{champion:89}} top coz i main her :).","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T05:08:47.858+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a fairly confident top lane player but it all really depends on you're play style, especially in bronze. Obviously it depends on the champions you pick but I usually have build in defensive runes and masteries and start off with an offensive item like clever or TF. Then build tank from there. \nIf you want specific tips for Leona I would highly suggest you youtube \"Leona top lane\". Lots of good guides out there that will give you a good analysis on how to play and what to build.\nMost importantly, always try and ward out side of baron pit and tri bush because usually the jg will favor bot lane over you. Don't push you're lane out too much unless you want you're opponent to lose farm and the enemy jg isn't visiting you often. Other than that it's on you, good luck =).","replies":[{"poster":"Dancing Death","date":"2016-07-16T05:47:31.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any suggestions for items to use generally in top? I've been playing support almost all the time (no one wants to do it in my level) so I know all the support items by heart(Randuin's, frost queen's and such) but nothing about all the damaging items to use in other lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T07:24:43.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Black clever, Triforce, Ravenous hydra and maybe Blood thirster are the only items you should need in top lane depending on the champion you play.
