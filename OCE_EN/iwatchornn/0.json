Instead, it will all be made available to you straight away and applied in your Collection (though some things may take several hours to actually appear). There are certain exceptions, such as receiving a skin shard for a champion you don't own. Wasn't sure if you were aware of this, wanted to mention it just in case.\n\nFor something like this, probably the best thing you can do is submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (I'd recommend the \"Account management, data requests, or deletion\" option, as it seems most appropriate) and see if they can help figure out what's happening, and find a way to fix it. There are no guarantees that Support will be able to help (or it might be a while before something *can* be done), but there's nothing anyone on the boards could do anyway, so it's still your best option.\n\nGood luck, hope this works out for you.","replies":[]}]}
