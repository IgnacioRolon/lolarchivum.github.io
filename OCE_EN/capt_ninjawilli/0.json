That was fine I accept the leaver buster punishing me then with the lower priority queue. But Tonight IINet had another issue as soon as I got into a ranked match. So I did all the trouble shooting eventually resorting to tethering my phone to reconnect after 15 minutes and helping my team win. Yet leaver buster still punished me? Can someone please explain why it would punish that? I spent more time in game then DC'd and we ended up winning after I reconnected. So it doesn't seem like I should of been punished. #lowerpriorityqueueislame","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:43:41.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">after 15 minutes\n\nThat's the threshold that Leavebuster uses to decide that you've been afk.\n\nYou have my feels.","replies":[]}]}
