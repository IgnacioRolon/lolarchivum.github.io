However, after I confirmed the purchase through PayPal, I got an error on the League Client (An Unexpected Error had Occurred) and the RP was not delivered to my account. I am now missing the amount paid in my bank account and I have checked PayPal logs to confirm that the amount paid was sent to Riot Games. I would like some assistance ASAP to get this sorted. Happy to provide any information needed to get things sorted.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-17T14:15:42.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support and they'll be able to get it all sorted :)\n\nFor efficiency's sake, I would recommend attaching your paypal receipt to the ticket.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
