I just wanted to know why bots are even a part of this game if people don&#039;t use them, the excuse is they&#039;re too easy so why not go play Dota 2? Is it fair to ruin other peoples experience just because you want to learn in a more competitive environment? A while ago I suggested making a Normals Draft Mode for people who want to take a game seriously without having consequences for losing such as losing LP that way we can leave the Normals Blind Pick to the trollers and 4 man feeder teams to have their &quot;fun&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-26T11:28:36.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm saying no because you want to add draft pick and _leave_ blind pick. The queues are already bad enough. If it was a replacement, I'd say yes.\n\nAnyway, what kind of troll goes to where all the other trolls are? WTF? I'm pretty sure they exist to make non-troll's lives harder because, you know, it's kinda the point?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with learning a champion in normals. In fact, if you said \"go play DoTA 2\", you'd better find a way to transfer the champions along with all my runes, masteries and levels. And Junglers have an even harder time because even good players get all whiny when they 2v1 bots in top lane even if they win.\n\nWhat you're suggesting is pretty much \"Play bots all day, or go to DoTA 2, unless you're in some super serious yet not really serious mentality, then play the normal's mode that everyone plays, with either champions you've been using forever, or champions you've only played against with bots. Oh, and we have a game mode that no one plays because apparently trolls dig that stuff. If you're more serious than the super serious yet not really serious, then go to ranked\"","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-27T10:49:15.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say keep normal - blind pick but add an option for Normal - Draft pick learning a champion is good but learning your only main can be banned or picked before you is even better.

Not removing blind pick will just spread out all the players","replies":[]}]}]}]}
