I haven't used Cho for a while now and only noticed this issue today, not sure how else to go about reporting this issue to Riot. I know how the ultimate works as I have been using Cho since close of BETA on NA server and have kept up to date with all patch notes. I killed two enemies before dying during this game and did not receive one stack. I did not receive any stacks at any point upon killing an enemy with feast during this game. Has anyone else encountered this error too? What should I do in going about to reporting this to Riot?\r\n\r\nThanks~ {{champion:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-11T10:37:36.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"send a support ticket, gets to the faster","replies":[{"poster":"Stupid Flanders","date":"2015-01-11T12:07:34.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for letting me know :) do i find that at the support website?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-11T12:19:35.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"top right of this page - (your name) (logout) (support)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
