They both shook hands \r\ncreating a binding oath, the angel placed the mans soul into \r\na a doll which controlled the hand of mother nature though \r\ntelepathic pulses, what the man didn&rsquo;t know was that the angel \r\nhad resurrected him into a doll that was unable to speak or \r\ncome into contact with humans. This mad the man very mad \r\nand angry, therefore he now goes around collecting souls of \r\nthe dead that he has tortures and murders himself to relieve \r\nhim from the pain of hes inner silence.\r\n\r\nThe drawing provided isn&#039;t a good drawing, just a doodle but it gives a idea of what he should be like, he is a doll looking figure that is on top of a hand, which he rides, he has souls floating around he head, he&#039;s very sown together and is sown to the hand itself, he controls the hand like we would control ours, with our minds :o but due to this only created just tonight i don&#039;t have any abilities in my head that could go with this champion. i had like a few but like i don&#039;t have stats or anything, just the ides, he&#039;s passive, like threshes he gains either health or the range of he&#039;s abilities, then maybe his q is that he sends out he&#039;s souls that float around him dealing damage to the target and fearing them for 1.5 seconds, then he&#039;s W could be like Lissandra where she goes under the ground but instead of dealing damage going though the claw he goes under the ground and pops up the target causing the target/s to be knocked up and slowed by 25% and he&#039;s E can be that can heal off minions and he gets a stack and once he gets 30 stack he gets another soul that floats around him which makes he&#039;s Q do extra damage, and then he&#039;s ult may be where he escapes he body of the doll and pulls the champion back to the hand and the doll itself and does damage the further away the target is, has a distant ult :D but yeah i don&#039;t have any good abilities but they are decent i suppose, not much thought but yeah :D tell em what you guys thing. maybe comment how to improve this champion :D","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-11T07:57:25.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it the doll you find in the undead asylum that takes you to the painted world?","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-07-12T14:44:45.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah sure whatever matey","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-20T13:05:08.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ABILTIES?!!","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-20T13:13:30.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sylpharion,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=b4njAyA0,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-20T13:05:08.521+0000)\n>\n> ABILTIES?!!\n\ndont think you read it at all matey lol","replies":[{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2015-05-21T06:01:55.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OF course I didn't, TL;DR didn't think abilities were located in it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-20T14:42:48.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can confirm he didnt^^","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-05-20T12:04:16.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry for the shit around the champion, they are just to get my pen to work, RIP Pen","replies":[]}]}
