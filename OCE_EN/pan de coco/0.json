He's -okay- at support but there are much better picks atm.\nBard is actually a really strong champion in support at the moment, however he takes a lot of game knowledge to utilise his kit to the full potential.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-22T05:21:50.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is easy to play bard badly.

I was in the same situation as you were, bard or tahm, and I got tahm. I will never regret it, he was so much fun the first 10-20 games, after that though, he got a little boring... Bards the same though, just less fun and a little bit weaker in my opinion, as tahm kenches W damage is broken against tanks (40% max health damage!) plus, his Q is a nice poke and slow in lane... His ult isn't as useful as bards can be, but it's passive can really buff up your damage. Overall, tahm is just more fun, and does SO much damage for a full tank support...
