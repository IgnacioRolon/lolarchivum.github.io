By struggling I mean, the majority of my games I am stuck with inept players. \n- They do not farm well\n- They do not ward\n- They do not care about objectives\n- If at all, the very slowly respond to pings or teamfights.\n- They don&#039;t know the limits of the champion they play/play against so they will make plays which will get them killed.\n\nYes plenty of people make this claim that they&#039;re stuck in hell but it is a fact for me. I am almost always the last person to feed on my team. I am always in control of my lane and ping my opponents&#039; whereabouts quickly. I roam often, I gank and help often, and I do all the team related crap to try and win. \n\nDespite me often getting fed depending on my role, the team will more often feed, and then their fed heroes with stuns, knockups etc will happily flash dive me to get me out of the fight asap.\n\nSo for this reason when the team shows absolutely no signs of improving and the game is well past turning around i will just wander around til the game ends hence my &#039;average&#039; stats in the event that any of you judge me based off that.\nIf I&#039;m with a duo/team however I won&#039;t give up even if its a 5% win chanceas it&#039;s unfair to you. But in solo Q when a game, I cbf putting in effort when I see all four of my team not putting in any.\n\n**Anyway, my roles** (in order of preference)**:**\n\n**Mid:** Malzahar main, very rarely will I find someone who can beat me there, regardless of hero.\n**Top: ** Really digging my Garen setup at the moment. Can Cho, Nasus, Urgot, Hec, WW, Tryndamere, Teemo Panth top also.\n**Jungle:** Rammus is my main one atm, Hec, WW or Sejuani are my other common choices.\n**ADC:** Favourite is Ashe, followed by Twitch then Cait. I&#039;m good at position with Ashe so despite dive comps I don&#039;t often get picked out.\n**Support: **Morgana & Taric.\n\n**You&#039;re welcome to add me in game if you&#039;re not like the players I&#039;ve described at the top.**","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-06-23T07:03:54.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lévitate,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=xXTKeWc3,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-23T04:45:29.371+0000)\n\n> - They do not ward\n\nLet's look at your past 5 non-support games.\n- Malzahar, 0 wards placed\n- Malzahar, 0 wards placed\n- Malzahar, 0 wards placed\n- Garen, 3 wards placed\n- Malzahar, 0 wards placed\n\nWhat are you trying to prove?","replies":[{"poster":"Lévitate","date":"2015-06-23T07:33:07.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Umm.. ok\n\nExample being that Garen game you're referring to.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/94327495/200266167?tab=stats\n\n16 wards.

If you include trinket then you can count everyone as being able to ward. Out of 5 games you only have 3 wards purchased.","replies":[{"poster":"Lévitate","date":"2015-06-23T11:11:10.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ward as much as I need to (in the laning phase - if I push). otherwise e.g. Cho Gath warded well that game, so I just warded the leftover keypoints to their/our jungle in the game. It's nice to know you don't consider the trinket to be an actual ward. Should suggest to Riot that they remove it ^\n\nMost of the damage my teams do to the game is early, in the laning phase. So unless you're legitimately suggesting that I buy stealth wards for every lane constantly and you know, just don't start my own build, I don't see how that's particularly 'on me'.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-06-24T09:53:56.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't critice others for not BUYING wards if you don't buy them yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-23T16:48:04.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You hardly upgrade the trinket at all. No wonder you team has shit vision. Look at yourself before you blame your team. 250g for unlimited wards after level 9 makes a huge difference and barely slows your build at all\n\nYou also play mainly lane stomping champs that have a mediocre-bad lategame and dont bring much too the team. Winning your lane slightly with them doesn't make you better than the people you're playing with and wont carry games","replies":[{"poster":"Lévitate","date":"2015-06-23T23:55:38.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright well clearly bringing this to the forums has brought on some narrow minded logic :) Do so love this community.
