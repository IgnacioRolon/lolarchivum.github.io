The reason I&#039;m thinking this could be good is because right now genuinely new players need to learn the game and level up alongside experienced players that are smurfing and I can see it would be very frustrating to be learning something as basic as last hitting and suddenly get demolished by a single champ on a 25&#039; torture game when you are allegedly playing with &quot;people on your same level&quot; and thinking you must be the worst player ever.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sorry if there are downsides on this idea that I&#039;m not aware I&#039;m not proposing this exactly but wondering if someone at Riot already considered something like this and discarded it for some reason?\r\n\r\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Lushfuul","date":"2018-12-22T05:05:09.450+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is really no way to stop or avoid smurfing. Some people do it for fun, others do it because they were banned. I have a few of my own smurf accounts as I like to try new champs, patches and other things on an account that doesn't really matter to me. The only way to really help new players stay and understand the game is to support them in their early games, help them learn by giving them tips in game and even explaining why these low level accounts are so good.\n\nThere isn't much more you or Riot can actually do. \n\nIf you are playing on a low level account just remember that these players are generally not bots they are learning a game and instead of going 30/0 maybe guide them? Even if they are on the enemy team.\n\n{{sticker:sg-kiko}} \nAlways be nice <3","replies":[]}]}
