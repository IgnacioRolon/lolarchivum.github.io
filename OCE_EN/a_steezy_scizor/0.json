There's obviously been a miscommunication somewhere along the line, and playing Singed support is not ban worthy. However, consistently refusing to communicate with the team (that doesn't fall under the \"tactical disagreement\" umbrella) is punishable if done often enough, so it could be something like that.\n\nThere is more to this story, I highly doubt he would get banned for playing singed support alone, even if he wasn't buying sightstone (bm as it is). \n\nWe haven't seen his gameplay, We don't even have a summoner name to see his history. We don't know if the 2 million mastery point claim or the >50% winrate claim or the \"legitimately trying to win\" claim is true without a name/history to look at. The ticket said \"found to be affecting a lot of players negatively\", and unconventional pick or no, very few people are going to complain about a win.\n\nWe don't have anywhere close to the full story, and it would be naive to assume everything in the reddit post was true, or that the ticket outlined the specific behaviour that got him banned (since A. that wasn't what he asked in his ticket, and B. from the ticket response it sounds like he should know what he did wrong, and the support guy is simply answering his questions).\n\nFrom the sound of the ticket, it also seems like \"refusing to communicate with team\" might have involved straight up abandoning his ADC and wandering around the enemy jungle, but again, we don't have the full story. With the limited info we have, this could be spun both ways, and unless more info is released we have no proof it was an unjustified ban.
