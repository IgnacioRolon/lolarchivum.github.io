I play urf to have fun and fuck around, not get my shit stomped in by a team of nidalee, ez, soraka, hecarim and sona.\nalso, people would bitch on forums for the rest of the year about bringing urf back, and it got pretty fucking annoying, so I have no patience for anyone that complains even the slightest bit about the game mode apart from when its about tryhards.","replies":[{"poster":"gragaaaaaaas","date":"2016-04-02T00:15:08.146+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Boy you really don't have anything better to cry about do you?

I can understand English quite fine thank you very much.\nWhat you don't seem to understand is empathy and the massive hype Riot likes to put around their April Fools releases.\nI knew they weren't going to release it on 1st April, due to the fact that you state very clearly, that they wrote they aren't. BUT because of the actions of last year and the year prior, people hoped that it was all just a big joke and they were going to play along and make the majority player base happy.
