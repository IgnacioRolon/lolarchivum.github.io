So make a mass rule that applies no matter what happens, it could be your fault or Riot's fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-23T11:31:23.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Suggest you read up on this.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)\n\nBut it's pretty long, so here's the jist: Leaverbuster will only punish you if you have multiple leave markers on your account (which you accumulate for every game you leave) and/or have a negative reputation (according to how frequently you've been reported and by whom). If it was just one game in which you disconnected from, then you shouldn't get any penalty. If you've constantly been disconnecting from games, then you need to avoid playing bots or match-made games until you've fixed it.\n\nRiot's policy on the matter is that they will never remove a low priority queue off a player under any circumstances, and thus far have stuck to it.\n\nIf you believe that you've been wrongly punished, submit a [support ticket](https://support.leagueoflegends.com/anonymous_requests/new) to help make aware of the flaw in their system.","replies":[]}]}
