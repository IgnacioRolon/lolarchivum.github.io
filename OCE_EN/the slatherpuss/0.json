One of the best features about the current lobby is the ability to compare damage dealt to champs, towers taken, etc. Are we going to be able to see these stats in the lobby without going to the advanced stats tab?\r\n\r\nAlso, there seems to be a bit of a delay in all of the functions of champ select and going into the game through the load screen. im not sure if its just me or its happening to everyone so i thought i would let you guys know. The client is looking really good :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-18T16:45:49.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry about the late response.
