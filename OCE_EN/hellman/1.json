OH NO! its a bad game you have a toxic mid laner who is carrying hate from a previous game or pent up issues from his social life. you lose the game. you shake the tilt off and go again, besides your 1-1 back to the rift. Next game he is in your lobby and starts to trash talk you from the get go. here is my problem. no one in the lobby will dodge and your duo (understandably) doesn't want to dodge either. Why should i have to cop a Loss on my promo and lose the entire thing because this toxic player has decided he is going to ruin my promos ?\r\n\r\nIf you got like 2 dodges per 24hours what harm could come of this? im sure there are 100s of situations that would benefit from this. 'if get a toxic group' 'a player bans your champs or locks it in in spite' Ect.\r\n\r\nyou cant even report a player for doing this. \r\nBack on to the grind i suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2019-09-04T14:07:51.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simple, coding and such will be a hellish job.
