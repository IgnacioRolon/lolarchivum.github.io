These games have included CS:GO, ARK: Survival Evolved, any Total War game, Diablo III, WoW, Terraria, *ahem* Flight Rising and tons more. Most of us are adults with lives, jobs and quirks. For an example of our.. quirks, I&#039;m at the very heart of the group, yet I&#039;ve only spoken over mic a couple of times in all our games, heh. \r\n\r\nWe are welcoming of people of all sorts. So male, female, alien, have kids, gay, cat person, cool. As long as you&#039;re not a total arsehole (or you try flirt with my man, then I will not like you, boo).  We&#039;re CONTINUALLY on the hunt for new friends to become a part of our community so don&#039;t be intimidated to contact us if you&#039;re looking for gamer friends!\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested, visit our discord here: https://discord.gg/FsbAGzT or send a friend request to PapaHuggey, our discord owner (also PapaHuggey#2134). You can additionally contact me on discord by adding Sunlit#4577.
