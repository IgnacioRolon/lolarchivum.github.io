The issue is, if Shaco does decide to jump on top of a player ( to escape/juke), -** if the auto attack option is on**, then he will be **revealed** after ** even 1 frame of auto attack**. A suggestion to fix this would be obviously, to not reveal until the full auto attack animation has played. *Turning off auto attack is an option, but I like keeping auto attack on, as I can continue to jungle, while looking around the map.*\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, though I already know Shaco is superior in the jungle when it comes to ganks, there should be some consideration between making it harder to tell the clones apart. In lower elos, the issues are **buffs **(red, blue, baron), in higher elos, the issue is **stat difference**. The clones should only be departed by **damage dealt**, (where aoe damage is a counter).\r\n\r\nImprovements on clone AI after Shaco dying would be good too.\r\n\r\nThank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-02-28T00:11:28.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know you can actually press i think A-right click or shift-right click to make it almost like an aa. You can have autoattack off but at the same time, have it on.","replies":[{"poster":"GaspKiller","date":"2015-02-28T04:27:27.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, Ill try that out, thanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juju fancIub","date":"2015-02-27T17:02:47.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco is not broken. Pls don't nerf. I never have that problem playing him cause my auto attack is on a. idk why people are having troubles with that. even if i had my auto attack on rightclick like most people do, it would be very hard for me to misclick into an auto or if i were to auto on purpose, revealing me don't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"GaspKiller","date":"2015-02-28T00:03:40.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shaco isn't broken - never said that. I said his q is buggy. I also don't mean autoattack as in a binded key, but the general option. Usually what happens is I fake someone across a wall, and then I get revealed because the autoattack animation plays for a few miliseconds","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-28T04:07:31.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize that was an added feature to make sure you couldn't just bull%%%% around yeah?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
