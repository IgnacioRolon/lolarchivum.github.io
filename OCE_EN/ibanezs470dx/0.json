Some examples above with my crappy photoshop skills.\n\nAnd some below because multiple links are too hard to do:\n\nRed: \n\nhttp://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o696/ibanezs470dx/League/League%20of%20legends%20Friendlist%20Red_zpsvulphdvy.jpg\n\nYellow: \n\nhttp://i1338.photobucket.com/albums/o696/ibanezs470dx/League/League%20of%20legends%20Friendlist%20Yellow_zpsr1zj1ql7.jpg\n\n\n\nObviously it won't look exactly as bad as that but imho it'll look nice in the new client... better than dreary dark theme with the occasional blue accent. Also would be more functional than that tiny icon. The option to turn it off would also be nice to have for the people that don't want it. ","replies":[]}
