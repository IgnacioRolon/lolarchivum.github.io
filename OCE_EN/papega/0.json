The two games that are used as evidence for my report show me explaining to my teammates that I was being trolled by other players who matched with me over the course of 4 games, they continuously harassed and trolled me. Admittedly I used poor language on an occasion.  The two games that are shown on my in-client report card are also games that I played to the end and won. Not one time did I AFK or RageQuit I played to the end. Despite people trolling me in game and flaming me. This account ban is in my opinion incorrect. I therefore would appreciate any feedback from a Riot employee on the matter. Please keep in mind I was in the process on reforming due to my previous 14 day suspension. I know I could have handled the games better, for example not responding when tilted however I intend to reform in anticipation for my account ban to be lifted. All in all I believe this ban is unfair and unwarranted however I understand that a ban is a ban and all I can do is apologise and seek to rectify my mistakes. \r\n\r\nSo in conclusion I would like to put forward my apologies;\r\n\r\nFirstly to those who I have played with at any stage who felt I was rude, disrespectful or toxic towards. That was not fair on any of you and I hope you forgive me for my poor behaviour in the past. \r\n\r\nSecondly I would like to apologise to all Riot employees because I understand you are trying to create a fun loving community and a situation like this does not help to build that community we all seek to be apart of. \r\n\r\nI sincerely hope I am given a second chance so I can make amends for my language and instead encourage the league of legends community to become a more welcoming and caring place. \r\n\r\nMany thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-22T13:12:44.608+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There isn't a whole lot we can tell you without the full context (i.e the chat logs).\n\nIt's worth noting that another player's bad behaviour does not excuse your own. You mention poor language, but people's definition of such varies wildly, so again, not much in the way of specific context anyone can offer without the actual logs.\n\nIf you were coming off a 14-day ban, then naturally your behaviour was being watched more closely by the system than a player with a clean slate.

All I'm trying to say is that whilst I'm not perfect this ban isn't fully justified. Is there a chance we could converse via email so that I might understand what I must do in order to have this account un-banned.\n\nmany thanks for your response, Papega.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-08T09:47:43.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are more than welcome to have the community review your punishment, but to do so we need the whole picture (chat logs). If the ban was not made in error then there is no way to retrieve your account. \n\nWe can't say anything for certain, that's up to the discretion of player support as HeartVine mentioned, but we can offer advice and context on the punishment *if* you give us the full details (i.e the chat logs).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-07-08T04:22:14.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to appeal the ban you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and they'll go through the process with you. The first response will likely be a generalised \"copy-paste\" response, but you can feel free to ask for some more information and they should be able to explain it to you a bit more. If I'm not mistaken, Support has a lot of ticket to get through currently (lots of people sending in about TFT issues), so it may take a couple days to get a response (any additional responses from you will bump your ticket to the back of the queue, so best to avoid that if possible).\n\nFalse positives tend to be pretty rare, so the chances of a successful appeal can be pretty low depending on the circumstances. We wont be able to accurately comment on that possibility without some more context (chat logs would be the main thing here), so if you're happy to provide that someone can go through it with you and give you an idea of whether an appeal would be successful. Generally, Riot's position is that \"each player is responsible for their own behaviour and another player breaking the rules doesn't give them any leeway\", and how well you do in playing/winning wont affect the possibility of a punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Papega","date":"2019-07-08T02:01:56.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I see people are asking for more information what will be enough information? Would you like for me to copy paste my chat log from the 2 games in a comment? \n\nmany thanks for the community input its greatly appreciated, Papega.","replies":[]}]}
