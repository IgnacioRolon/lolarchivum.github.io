I've played league since beta, leveled multiple 30s on NA before OCE was a thing and leveled over 20 accounts on OCE. From my experience with a LOT of game time it's not uncommon at all to see 20 minute queue times because I only play during school hours and late at night to minimise the amount of young kids on my team. As I've since found out I was right and there was server problems that day causing a lot of people to get stuck in super long queues. It seems to have returned to the normal 3-5 minute queues now. That said though as I'm typing this I'm currently 14 minutes in the queue. Usually what happens for me is a game pops after 2-3ish minutes, but someone will decline the invite and that's when you get stuck in long queues. Almost every time that someone declines the invite on the first pop I know it's going to be a 10+ minute queue","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-27T08:48:05.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How are you getting 70 min queue times O.o, i get 10 in a worst case scenario\n\nAs for the  \"unable to start your game\", i get that at least once a week, not even sure why","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-27T11:09:08.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll usually see \"unable to start your game\" if someone dodges at the absolute last second (the dodge goes through but your client thinks the game should have started).
