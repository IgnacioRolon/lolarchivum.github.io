I get matched with legit new players level 5-10, and the other team gets silver and sometimes gold players, every game, just over and over the other team is silver and gold players and I gelevel 5-10 first timers.\n\nI get it that It&#039;s not ranked, I have ranked accounts also. But it takes 3 times as long as it should to level accounts when every game is a loss due to completely unbalanced unwinnable games. The new players just feed the entire game, snowballing the better players on the other team. No one&#039;s blaming the new players, obviously they&#039;re just expecting to queue and get matched against similarly matched opponents, most probably don&#039;t op.gg the games and realise they&#039;re getting placed in games they have no chance of winning\n\nThis isn't the best picture to make my point it was just the first one I thought of screenshotting. I've had games where there's a level 4 and a level 6 on my team and the enemy team has 2 legit gold players","replies":[]}
