You queue again, lobby pops, got your lane you wanted, person who autofilled dodges. Now you queue again, but this time autofill protection is disabled because technically you&#039;ve got your preferred lane twice even though those game never started. You of course now get autofilled. \r\n\r\nThis exact scenario has resulted in LITERALLY 3 days of getting autofilled in every single game I&#039;ve played. And I mean literally in it&#039;s true definition not in the weird way kids use the word now. I&#039;m on day 4 now where across multiple accounts I&#039;ve played autofill every single game.\r\n\r\nWhy do queues that other people dodge count toward your autofill protection. If you are in a lobby and someone else dodges that game should count as an autofilled game and your 2 games of autofill protection should not be reduced.\r\n\r\nAutofill is not unfair, it is required and it does serve a purpose. But the way it&#039;s implemented is broken.\r\n\r\nI think #1 games where someone else dodges should count as an autofill game for you and autofill protection should remain active for another 2 games.\r\n\r\nand #2 players who were autofilled and dodge a queue should have far higher penalties for the dodge than someone who got their lane","replies":[{"poster":"2gurls1chalice","date":"2017-11-15T09:26:52.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's day 4 finished. 5 games, 5 auto fills.
