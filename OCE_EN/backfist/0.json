If i try to reconnect it either goes black screen then back to the recconect page after a few seconds and sometimes it will have a box saying the client stopped working &#039;search for problem online&#039; which does nothing and sends me back to the rc page or &#039;close program.&#039; so after last night i completely deleted league and reinstalled. I thought it would be working so got into another game but i have the exact same problem. I dont know what to do to get it working. The shop and homescreen and chat all work normally, champ select too, its just when champ sellect finishes and it tries to launch into the pregame load screen (which never comes up cause it goes straight to rc page)  Should i do a system restore to a previous point for my cpu or delete a file thats corrupt or something?? If you can help me to get it working again i would be very grateful.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-28T23:48:55.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nSorry to hear you're seeing this issue.\n\nAs with many crashing/connection issues, I'd suggest going through the support articles on [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), as well as [Bug Splats and Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes).\n\nOne other question - do you run any third party programs alongside LoL?\n\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"BackFist","date":"2016-01-29T00:26:24.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks :) what exactly could those third party programs be?
