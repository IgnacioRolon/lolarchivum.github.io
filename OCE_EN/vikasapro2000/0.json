But we can make suggestions for what's worked for us.\n\nFirst, try running your patcher in admin mode. When it gets to the point where it's stuck, wait at least ten minutes.\n\nIf you're sure that there's a legitimate error with your patcher, try repairing it. It *will* take a while, and erase your item sets/config, so be sure to back them up first!\n\nAlternatively, you can try the following:\n@ Close League of Legends if you have it open.\n@ Navigate to \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\".\n@ Go into the latest version number folder (usually the largest number) and create a new text, blank file. Name it \"S_OK\" without quotations, and remove the extension.\n@ Start up League of Legends with admin privileges.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Benny1","date":"2015-06-11T09:34:24.566+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if your on windows 7 and can't create a blank file, just copy and paste the releasemanifest file in the same folder and rename the copy to S_OK. It is already a blank file, and I couldn't figure out how to create a blank file on win7 other than that. I was getting the unspecified error at 32% so yours may be a different problem. alternatively search folder options, go to view tab, disable the hide extensions for known file types. and you will be able to create a text file, delete the .txt after for a blank file. -credit to horse of force for showing me that","replies":[]}]}]}
