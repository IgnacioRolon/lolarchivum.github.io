Dude, you're trying to run a program from its compressed form... Ofc it'll be slower than normal.\nAlso, if it's the first opening, it'll take a bit before the launcher shows up - first thing installer does, is updating the patcher itself. Therefore it doesn't show (usually for a few seconds, but then again you're running it compressed).","replies":[]}]}
