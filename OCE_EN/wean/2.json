Just because you think Nocturne is better if he is played as a jungler doesn&#x27;t mean that he can&#x27;t fight in lanes, does it?\n\nNocturne's kit revolves around and excels at surprising and chasing down targets rather than fighting tooth and nails with them.\n\nIt's not like it's just bad or anything, considering his W and E can make solid dueling combos and escapes and Q makes for okay poke, but their effects are rather limited in the laning scenario especially in earlier stages of the game and thus he would be completed limited to attrition warfare in lanes which also makes it somewhat risky and inflexible. Not to mention most top lane champions generally have higher base attrition than Noc, so solo top lane usually isn't much of a hot topic for him.\n\nOn the other hand, due to his passive, Q and ultimate, he makes for a model jungler template who has the innate advantage of clearing and roaming, hence why he is usually used as a jungler rather than as a laner.\n\nIt's not that Noc lane is bad, but because Noc jungler is just that superior for him.\n\nThen again, if you wanna lane him, by all means. Though I'd say mid lane better suits him than top when it comes to laning him, mid utilises his roaming potential better imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Lupus","date":"2017-01-13T01:49:09.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very succinct and well put Sekai.\n\nCould you lane vs Illaoi? Yes. But you'll struggle vs her sustain if you can't dodge the tentacles. \n\nIf I were to lane against her with Noc I would:\n\nMake sure your jungler knows you're going to need help.\n\nDodge tentacles, and bait them by giving up a little farm - head towards a low minion and she will slam to hit/sustain from you so dodge this and give up the farm. But this will let you push the lane hard early and she'll struggle to farm under her tower (only early though). \n\nDodge her E at all costs.\n\nQ her as often as possible, and use this to trade. I.E. Dodge the slam then Q her, chase and then back off after a couple of autos.\n\nUse your spell shield to block either her E, or her ult after she hits 6.\n\nAnd biggest piece of advice... Roam alot. Push lane and apply pressure to mid.\n\n\n\nLate game, you'll struggle to kill her (I have experience with both champs).\n\nItems to help: Damage - BotRK. Tank - Dead Mans Plate and GA.

Along with this Nocturne is a very mobile champion both with his ult and his Q giving him movement speed when he moves along the trail. So during a fight a Nocturne might be able to use these abilities that he has to make dodging the tentacle smash a lot easier.  \n\nAnother big thing that I would bring up when they are fighting is how effective Nocturnes fear is when he uses it. When Illoai is feared Nocturne has the ability to get off damage for free and depending on how Nocturne uses this time can heavily effect the outcome of the fight. Making sure that you get as many auto attacks off by moving in between autos into them to not lose time chasing while they are being feared away is a great example of using the time well if Noc wants to win the trade.\n\n---\n\nOther than that I think it would really depend on how fed the both of them are and what items they are up to. Nocturne has a big advantage roaming wise in his ult, and if he struggling to fight an Illaoi he can roam around the map and pick up some objectives or kills that will snowball him into the lead ahead of Illaoi which is always something to keep in mind.\n\n---\n\nKeystones may also play a big factor as there a lot of choices as to what a Nocturne can take. An example being if Nocturne were to take Furver of Battle he would thrive in extended trades that allow him to build up the max amount of stacks. However a Nocturne that takes Grasp of the Undying will sustain a lot heavier and prefer short trades that proc it that slowly lower the enemies hp bar through trades or pokes with his Q.\n\n---\n\nWhile on the note of his Q I think that this is a big thing that Nocturne has advantage over Illaoi in being able to poke her from range. This can be useful however might take a lot of Mana so do be careful about using too much. Along with this if Nocturne does this a decent amount, Illaoi will start trying to stop him, Nocturne can use this to advantage and try and bait her to waste her E by going to Q her and then spell sheilding the E that comes from Illaoi in retaliation.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this answers your question! If there is any other questions I can answer or any other ways I can help out let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-01-11T07:54:44.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a fight against Illaoi using Nocturne recently, I did kill her once, but then I couldn't kill her again in that very match.\nIf I ran into this sort of matchup again I might consider getting movement speed items, as well as items like Quicksilver Sash to remove the effects of Illaoi's E if she use it on me, and Guardian Angel should help as well (I may not need all of these items)\nBesides, I had the fight in pvp blind pick, so I didn't know Illaoi was going to be in the enemy team.\nThanks for the info.\nBesides, are there any other items I should get if I use Nocturne to fight Illaoi again?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-11T08:18:11.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Greetings again,\n\nGetting tank items can help against Illaoi, however usually only your first 1-2 items should be matchup specific. The rest should be focused on the enemy team you are vsing. If you gear all of your items against Illoai, it will work well for helping with 1v1ing her, but when it comes to team fights it won't be too effective. Along with this getting all tank items will mean you do very little damage, meaning that being a threat to the enemy back line in team fights can be quite hard if you do no damage.\n\nSo think situationally about your items and when it comes to hard matchups in the top/mid lane try to roam and pick off kills, this works really well if you are someone like a Nocturne who has an ult that is built for ganking.\n\n---\n\nTo quickly note on QSS, I think while this item can work quite well against Illoai, you do have a W in built that can block it, so I would recommend training yourself to be able to block it with your W instead of spending the gold to get yourself a QSS. Usually you only want to build QSS if there is a lot of threats on the enemy team that have CC that if you don't remove you will die in team fights because of it.\n\n---\n\nHope this helps\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-01-11T05:31:18.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depend on if h can spell spell shield the tentacle smashes, really though illaoi has a ton of sustan, more so than nocturne, so i dont think he should beat her 1v1, also depends on build and stuff too, but all in all i beleive illaoi should win.","replies":[]}]}
