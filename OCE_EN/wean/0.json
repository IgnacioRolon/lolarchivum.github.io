A mage does favour the ability power too, as they usually spike at level 6, which is where they out scale flat ap runes, they also do prefer a health/armour mix. And tanks are straightforward, they like to sit on you and tank, a little extra power to help last hit doesn't hurt either, also gives slightly more kill potential, the 25 or whatever armor you get from the Quints and Seals is more than enough to cover you, they do also prefer scaling mr as they start with a reasonably high magic resist anyway.\n\n> Just for those who disagree with full aa speed, yes it doesn't do the most damage, but it provides him more utility and if you have 2-3 points in q at lv4 it will out damage due to the full second reduction (it reduces it to like 2.89, or did since last time played) it gives on his q. It's jsut a safer pick overall for him against poke lanes, as it allows him to poke back with more of a positive outcome, and when you get crit its higher damage for more poke.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-06-02T04:57:41.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your suggestion.\nI already set up the runes for Irelia, which worked quite well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-06-02T03:03:57.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rune pages work pretty much the same as Masteries. They will all 'work' on any champ, but there are 'optimal' builds for each.\n\nIn your Fiora/Irelia example, Fiora's runes will work on Irelia, but it might not be 'optimal'.\n\nRunes allow you to adjust the champion stats to suit your play style, but you generally want to augment their strengths. Fiora has built in attack speed so would benefit from more AD, while Irelia would benefit from attack speed.\n\nHaving rune pages for each champion is not essential and a very expensive exercise (which I think is too expensive and out dated). So, first concentrate on building generic pages (like other people have suggested) by buying the runes that are on sale. Then use those pages to augment the champ you play as best you can. It may not be 'optimal', but it will still work.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-02T00:03:36.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are generic rune pages which work over archetypes (ADCs, mid AP mages, tanky top laner).
