Like, someone who plays several games per day would likely get less BE from the FWotD than considering the XP into their rolls, whereas someone who plays once a day for the FWotD might actually get more BE from FWotD rather than from the additional XP.\n\nI might do the calculations a bit later just to see how it pans out.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-25T05:05:08.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not sure if you actually trying to troll me or what....\n\nNo matter how many games you play, you are trading XP for BE, that rate doesn't change no matter how many games you play, so i'm not even sure what you are on about.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-25T06:54:57.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you're misunderstanding what I'm trying to say, but I probably haven't explained it very well to start with.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, someone who plays several games per day (including FWotD) will gain more XP in a given day period than someone who plays only once per day for the FWotD. The first person might play 15-20 games (with maybe 2-4 being FWotD) to gain one levels worth of XP, while the other might play 4-6 games (all being FWotD) to gain the same amount of XP. In that situation, the second person is likely to get more BE from the FWotD bonus per level (for example 200-300) while the first is likely to only get less BE per level (for example 100-200).\n\nSo for the first person it *might* be more profitable, BE wise, for them to get the extra 175 XP rather than the 50 BE for a FWotD, which is my main point. It's not about *how many* games you play, it's about *how often* you play them (like several per day as opposed to one per day).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-25T07:05:59.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except your maths is just bad, we aren't going for BE's worth per game, we are going BE's worth per XP point.\n\nLow roll - 810 BE, 2880 XP, 1 BE= 3.55 XP, 175 XP = 49.29 BE\n\nSo that is a flat out Low Roll, and we are getting Slightly more BE if we low roll.\n\nNext Roll - 900 BE, 2880 XP, 1 BE = 3.2 XP, 175 XP = 54.6 BE\n\nAnd it only gets higher from here, to the point where, this trade off is just flat out not worth it.\n\nEDIT: Just for the lols of how ripped off we are getting\n\nHigh roll - 1260 BE, 2880 XP, 1 BE = 2.28 XP, 175 XP = 76.75 BE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-25T06:19:31.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"feel they should give like a 30 min drop on the timer for fwotd for every game/win (cuz its riot) its on cd, so its pretty much exact same for those who play a few, but those who play often aren't punished like they are theives","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Grimoire0","date":"2017-11-25T01:32:06.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have this issue too.
