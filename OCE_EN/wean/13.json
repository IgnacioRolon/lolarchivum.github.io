You'll get a better understanding of the meta, the macro play (when to take drake/when to push out waves, when to freeze, etc), and itll help your emchanics out a bit too, without affecting your solo queue rank (the one that actually matters).","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-06-25T03:02:34.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I'll try Ranked flex sooner or later.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-25T01:02:47.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 7-3 maining support zilean for the most part and got placed silver 3 last season in my first 10 ranked games ever when I played last season. All I did these games was stand back throwing out bombs (without understanding the combo but still landing them somehow) and peeling/reviving/speedboosting whoever on my team was carrying the hardest.\n\nI wasn't really good enough for silver 3 really since I had only just started playing league and I didn't understand itemisation very well (I still rushed beserker greaves on adcs and usually went to lane with a dorans shield on pretty much every champ that wasn't jungle or support), I also didn't know how to ping and I pretty much never warded and I thought pots were a waste of gold. After finishing my placements I couldn't really gain or lose lp much but I slowly declined before stabilising in mid silver 4.\n\nSo yeah that was my start. I'm alot better now and in the process of learning what makes the difference between silver 1 and gold 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-06-25T01:11:31.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you saying you lost 7 matches out of the first ten ranked matches?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-25T01:50:26.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no I won 7, lost 3. \n\nI played passively and didn't feed and I did a good job of protecting whoever was carrying.
