Garen counters Yasuo in this regard similar to how he also counters Riven on a similar basis.\n\nBut, Garen has almost 0 mobility, and he is thus extremely prone to being kited and really more or less can not handle the vast majority of all pokes unless his opponents are just bad. Yasuo, Riven and alike can possibly abuse this and get away from being hard-countered by Garen and retaliate reasonably thanks to their spammable mobility and pokes/pseudo-pokes.\n\nHowever the bottom line is still, Garen should be given the upperhand by default thanks to his Q alone completely invalidates Yasuo's kit almost entirely, not to mention Garen has no projectile attacks to speak of so Yasuo's W is also useless in lane against Garen too. What is important as a Garen players in that match up are a couple points:\n\n1. Don't go too passive. You will get poked to death by Yasuo's pokes eventually that way.\n2. But don't go too ham either. You will attract too much minion aggro in the encounter that the winions ultimately end you as opposed being shot down by the said Yasuo opponent themselves.\n3. Do not, I repeat, Do NOT use Q on Yasuo _when his shield is up_, you will just waste a great majority of your trading advantage that way (Q's base damage burst). When his shield is up, poke it out either with AA, or if you can't reach him, E it away, and cancel E by pressing it again which would refund part of its CD, before following up with Q and the rest of it.\n4. Rush Sunfire is a good option for this match-up, because the bonus HP and AR blocks Yasuo's attempt at trading, and the immolation passive brings much to both synergies in trading and shoving lanes that would just eventually force the Yasuo out of lane after a while, having being starved.\n5. Manage your aggression. Be active, but don't be reckless. You don't have to kill Yasuo, as long as you're stalling him from netting any kills and CS by dominating the trades, you're already winning and you only need to keep it up, because the one who should be worried about kills is not you but the Yasuo. You just need to shred him and force him out of the lane again and again, until there is the certainty of finishing him off (either they low but still lingers around while your stuff are all off-CD, clutch just-level6 trades, your jungler is near but he doesn't have a backup etc), which you make the real move.\n6. While it's aggravatingly annoying that Yasuo's knockup is practically up all the god damn time (seriously, its CD really needs some nerf or something), it's not impossible to dodge, at least not when he's more afraid of you than you are of him. Higher MS makes dodging easier, you can try running MS Quints in the runes. I also found using Ghost as a summoner spell much easier on Garen because that synergise with and strengthens his chases very well, and somewhat covering up his lack of mobility a bit, unlike Flash which is really only useful on Garen as an over-the-wall escape or a flash-ulti gimmick.\n7. Remember to ward the river. You don't want someone to sneak up from behind you when you're busying keeping Yasuo at his tower.\n\nYasuo is an absolutely nightmare and a lot of times, impossible horse-shit to lane against for a lot of champions, but for Garen himself personally, Yasuo ain't so bad.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-18T23:30:29.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The strength of sunfire vs a yasuo isnt the armor or health or even trading damage, its the fact you can proc his shield without being anywhere near him.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-19T10:23:00.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Qh0gKz6c,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-02-18T23:30:29.865+0000)\n>\n> The strength of sunfire vs a yasuo isnt the armor or health or even trading damage, its the fact you can proc his shield without being anywhere near him.\n\nYeah that's right.

However there are some things that Garen can do to really get an advantage in the matchup:\n\nA big piece of advice I can give you is try to get a feel for how long Yasuo's Q cooldown is. Reason being is that if you can get a feel for how long it will be until his Q comes up again, you can force a fight only taking 1 Q's damage, and then back out before he has it back up again coming out ahead in the trade. \n\nAlong with this try to stand near your minions when they are about to die and when the Yasuo comes in to last hit it, hit him with your combo to start a winning trade. Going for consistent, short trades that you come out ahead of is the best way to win this match up in my opinion.\n\n---\n\nQuick note on Garen's combo: His Q is an auto attack reset, meaning that the best way to use it in an ideal situation is to get an auto attack off first, then immediately Q. This can be a great way to start off a fight when defending a minion and should be used in trades when you can, but if you have to use your Q's movement speed to chase in a trade, don't be afraid to miss out on the extra auto attack's damage.\n\n---\n\nOther than that, try to get some armour items if you are starting to fall behind such as Sunfire Cape or Randuin's Omen in your build when against him and don't be afraid to build a damage item first if you are ahead and want to start snowballing a bit.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this info helps, if there is anything I can clarify on or any other questions I can answer let me know and good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-17T23:50:01.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen counters yasuo.

Like I can play ap janna/soraka mid and be able to bully some yasou's in lane without any jungle assistance. Other times I can pick poppy toplane (arguably a better yasou counter than garen) and stay under tower and freeze minions and back when under half hp and build full tank and just give up on any cs that's too far away from tower and he'll still manage to kill me if he's good enough. Like sometimes a yasou can be so good, there isn't really much you can do, except try to play safe and not feed him as best as possible.\n\nYasou is an outplay based champion, so he has the potential to win pretty much any lane matchup if he's good enough, regardless of how countered he is.\n\nTips i have for when you are dealing with a bad yasou, is try to learn the hitbox of his knockup, unlike his normal q, the hitbox is actually about as wide as a champion. Try to bait out his windwall and don't launch anything important yet unless you know he won't have it up. Also it's very important to gauge exactly how skilled the yasou is, since if he's good enough to do the dash-draw-animation cancel knockup, you're going to have play the lane alot safer.\n\nPersonally I find it's alot easier to manage yasou if you can draw the minions to the side, allowing you to fight behind or to the side of them. Do this in toplane by autoing him when he's near the bottom side of his minion wave and have his caster minions follow you and hit you. Back off back to your topside bush to drag his minion wave down and reset aggro. Now his minions will collapse on yours faster and your wave will freeze closer to your tower and topside. Making you safer from ganks and allins and also making it harder for yasou to do his dashy dashy outplays on your face since he'll have to get really really overextended to trade with you and you'll still be under tower meaning you can hit him for free basically.\n\nAlso if you are a skillshot champion, it's more stressful for yasou to manage his mechanics since you can enter the bushes and reduce the time he has to react and block any skillshots you may fire at him. This position also makes him very vulnerable to ganks if he fights here and eventually your jungler will arrive to help you spank him, since yasou doesn't exactly have many escapes if he can't dash through minions.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-02-19T01:06:58.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aatrox may be able to counter Yasuo. I remember once that I used Aatrox against Yasuo, and I forced Yasuo back under his tower, but then that Yasuo stayed undertower and didn't move (I think the player was AFK), then I destroyed the tower and killed him. Afterwards, Yasuo moved agaion, but I was already two levels above him, and I just kept on beating him.\nSay if that Yasuo did not AFK, I may or may not win the lane.\nThere was another time that I used Aatrox to fight someone else, and then in the middle of the game, the enemy team's Yasuo came over, and I killed him quite a few times.\nI find that sometimes I can kill an enemy champion with one champion, but using another champion in an attempt to kill the very same champion would produce a different result.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-18T23:42:50.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An easy way to identify if a yasuo is good is to watch his itemisation.
