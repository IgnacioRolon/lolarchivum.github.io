But in high variance times you might not really be able to do anything about it because you'll be stuck babysitting an adc darius who has just hit lvl 30 with bot only games and went straight into ranked with no understanding of the meta, all the while top and mid are feeding because they're bronze and their lane opponents are gold and plat and some games, your jungle gets executed by chickens 3x in a row trying to take them because they didn't think smite was necessary for jungling and took ignite and ghost and they can't kite the camps.\n\nBut for a mid or assassin main this type of chaos where there are some really weird players out, might be a good thing since they can roam and snowball and solo carry much easier because there will be some easy targets among the enemy team like a full crit singed who is trying to take dragon and failing. Doesn't matter if the enemy yasou is high gold if you're playing shaco and already have 7 kills and 8 assists and a bunch of easy counterjungle and have a ghostblade, triforce and whilst he's been farming perfectly and gotten a few kills on the midlane hasn't been able to roam so much because you burned his flash during earlygameand so he's only got a zeal and bf sword.\n\nThis is just my opinion and of course you can play aggressive supports or blitzcrank, but I still feel like support mains should probably stick to peak times.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2017-03-06T01:18:16.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It gives you an estimated time to wait, seems good enough for now","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-03-06T02:40:12.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes the estimated time could be far from accurate or even approximate though.
