I could not beat him 1v1 as I did before (I could use Garen to beat Darius when I took Conqueror and Darius toon Grasp of the Undying some time ago)\nSomething has to be done about certain champions eventually, there's simply no reason for a champion to stay so OP forever in League of Legends, or else I am sure some people would either quit or lose interest in top lane, even if most people starting to move to other roles, if Darius is picked, he is eventually going to dominate. Riot really need to think about buffing Riven, Garen, and other top laners that wasn't buffed recently, just so that all top lane champions will have a chance to survive against their opponents,","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2018-10-12T03:50:09.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Darius is a hard counter to Garen**, his **Bleed passive stops** garen from using his **heal passive**.  **Garen has no dashes**, which means he has **no means to escape Darius's E (pull)**.** Garen has no Hard CC** to stop Darius's movement which means** Darius easily chase garen**, and  in a long drawn out fight.** Darius will get his 5 stacks and win. **\n\nBecause of this, It is** expected that Darius would out trade Garen in a 1v1. **\n\nEach **player is different** and their** skills in playing that champion will be different**.

Does she need buffs to survive against Darius and/or kill him in a 1v1 fight, or is Darius also a hard counter to her?\n\nFrom what I know, Riven's stun (W) is not as useful as it was in season 7, due to the Tenacity runes, it would reduce her stun duration on Darius if Darius takes Tenacity. Don't know if building damage on Riven to vs Darius is the right idea.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2018-10-15T09:51:03.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Riven** would still be considered a **counter pick to Darius**.
