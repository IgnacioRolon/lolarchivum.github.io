Warlord's Bloodlust Page\n2. Fervor of Battle Page\n3. Thunderlords Page\n\nThese 3 can be setup for ADC's, do minor changes based on the ADC your playing in any game.\n\n4. Deathfire Touch Page\n5. Thunderlords Page\n6. Storm raiders Surge Page\n\nThese 3 are for your mid laners, again, minor changes based on which mid laner, and what they need, but these are the basics.\n\n7. Windspeakers Page\n8. Thunderlords Page\n9. Bond of Stone Page\n\nThese are 3 for supports, these actually stay fairly as is between most champions in these categories.\n\n10. Grasp of the Undying Page\n11. Thunderlords Page\n12. Fervor of Battle Page\n\nThese are for top laners, most fall into these 3, personally i don't like SoTA on Top laners (which i see occasionally.)\n\nNext you have your junglers, and these are the most broad as you have to cover every scenario\n\n13. SoTA Page\n14. Grasp of the undying Page\n15. Thunderlords Page\n16. Fervor Page\n17. Stormraiders Page\n\nThese ones stay similar in the points you play around with.\n\nAnd of course i went round to numbering the whole list properly, but you know Rito boards.\n\nThis leaves you at a count of 17 pages.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-07-27T06:04:37.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply, but I still have questions.\nIs it up to the players to decide on what mastery points they put in for a champion?\nAre mastery pages applied based on the champion's stats to enhance their attack power and abilities and to strengthen the champion's defense?\nI have been creating mastery pages based on what champion.gg had suggested, it might be a good idea to do that, but I don't know if it is the best idea to rely on the suggestions of that website. Do I absolutely have to rely on champion.gg to create decent mastery pages?\nNo offence, but if these questions are not answered, I may not be able to create decent mastery pages by making my own decision on where I should put mastery points on for a champion.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-27T08:02:25.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Is it up to the players to decide on what mastery points they put in for a champion?\n\nBasically how you play, will decide a lot in terms of what points are optimal for each individual champion.\n\n>Are mastery pages applied based on the champion's stats to enhance their attack power and abilities and to strengthen the champion's defense?\n\nGenerally speaking your aim is to better your strength's.\n\nI'll Run you down the decisions that should be made for each tier of each tree to give you an idea.\n\nFerocity;\n\n**Fury/Sorcery**: So basically, do you rely more on autos, or Abilities, this one tends to be the simplest to decide.\n**Double Edged Sword/Feast/Expose Weakness**: This can be one of the harder ones to decide on, but generally, you want 1 of 2, and need to ask yourself, Am i doing damage or not?\nThis decides between DES and EW, Feast is basically the one you pick if you feel your going to struggle in the laning phase and want some padding there instead of extra damage.\n**Vampirism/Natural Talent**: This one is an interesting one that can come down to personal preference in my opinion, Slight amounts of sustain, or slight scaling damage.\n**Bounty Hunter/Oppressor**:  So this one has 2 things to consider, Am i going to kill each individual member on their team (am i a roamer that can do this early?) or am i able to give out some CC to amplify my damage (early Rylai's can factor into this)\n**Battering Blows/Piercing thoughts**: Physical or Magical damage, this one should be the easiest to decide.\n\nCunning;\n\n**Wanderer/Savagery**: Basically if your going to be roaming Wanderer is great, but Savagery helps a decent amount with CSing, remember though, that for wanderer to kick in you have to be out of combat for 3 seconds.\n**Runic Affinity/Secret Stash/Assassin**: so this one is generally simple, if you are getting buffs, Runic Affinity is best, if not, decide if you need more sustain or more damage (note if you need an ally with you to deal damage take secret stash)\n**Merciless/Meditation**: Do you need mana sustain, if not take the higher damage below 40% health (supports are better off with meditation)\n**Bandit/Dangerous Game**: Are you a support? Take bandit if yes, Dangerous game if no.\n**Precision/Intelligence**: Precision gives a great amount of pen for early to mid game, if you want to extend the game and get 45% go intelligence, but generally Precision right now is way better, as games end sooner.\n\nResolve;\n\n**Recovery/Unyielding**: If your a tank go Unyielding unless you need the sustain in lane, otherwise go Recovery, outside of tanks just take Recovery\n**Explorer/Tough skin**: Generally Explorer is worth it here, Tough skin is minor unless you are jungling.\n**Runic Armor/Veteran's Scars**: Do you have healing/shielding in your kit? Will someone heal/shield you? Take Runic Armor, otherwise Veteran's Scars _This is a must change game to game based on your team, not just your champion_\n**Insight/Perseverance**: I honestly don't think i have seen anyone using Perseverance, take insight.\n**Swiftness/Legendary Guardian**: 3 Armor/MR per nearby champion is great (max of 15), take this unless your against a CC heavy comp.\n\n\nKeystones Generally speak for themselves as to which you want for each case but if not;\n\nFerocity;\nWarlords Bloodlust: ADC/Yasuo in LANE sustain, good for taking a trade and then sustaining back up. (there are some other off cases but that is a player based thing)\nFervor of Battle: More damage in sustained trades where auto attacks are possible, generally go to for ADC's/Top laners that are opting for damage\nDeathfire Touch: 2 reason's to take this\n1. You have a DoT (Malz, Cassio, Brand etc.)\n2. You are building massive amounts of AD and can proc this efficiently (Jhin, Varus, but note this doesn't proc on on-hit effects So Ezreal Q/MF Q/Passive will NOT proc this.)\n\nCunning;\nStorm Raiders Surge: You have a way to chunk people with normal spells (at least 30%) and DON'T need any extra damage (Veigar is a good example, where thunderlord's is overkill.)\nThunderlord's: Can you hit the enemy 3 times early every wave? This does damage, and should be understood as it has been a meta thing for a long while\nWindspeaker's Blessing: You are a support, you have heals/shields and aren't going towards damage (Someone like Karma could arguably go this or thunderlords)\n\nResolve;\nGrasp of the Undying: You are a tank, and want to do more sustained damage.\nStrength of the Ages: Great for junglers to give them that slight more tankiness early game, and a nice chunk of healing late game for doing a camp\nBond of Stone: You are a tank, and want to tank more.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-07-27T09:17:47.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.\nSo your description seemed to have answered my third question.\nSince masteries are based on how the players play a particular champion, relying on masteries that are suggested in champion.gg isn't always a good idea, that website's suggestion is based on how the other players use their champions, not how I use my champions. While that website's suggestion works for me in some cases, ultimately the decision of masteries are down to me.\nPlus they got the result by analysing a lot of champions, so there must have been a lot of players involved, not just one single player, I am certain that not all of the masteries listed there would be suitable for me. Therefore I might have to customise my masteries a bit while relying on that website, or start completely from scratch when I build masteries.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-26T14:24:57.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're a scrub player like me, I have 1 page if I'm playing support, 1 page if I'm playing adc, and 1 multifit page for top and mid.
