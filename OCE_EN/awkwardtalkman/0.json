I'm guessing you played DoTA? Though correct me if I'm wrong ^_^;\n\nAnd as for what better Champions to choose, it all depends on what kind of playstyle you want. If you want a mage, long range attacker, melee champ, ect. Or if you want something easy to pick up and get into straight away(Also cheap in IP price), or the more technical and less pick-up-and-play straight away champs that cost more but also once mastered are very good champs.\n\nAs for starting, I'd say get 5 different champs for different playstyles. Annie as a first taste of a mage(Mid), Ashe is a good long-ranged champ(ADC/Bot), Garen for a tank(Top), Soraka for a healer/support(Bot), and Yi(Top/Jungle) as pure melee damage output. Then take a look at the more pricy champs and adapt from there with the playstyles you know, and the way that the higher priced ones work.\n\nAs for the 'jungle' role, I suggest trying to use Yi or saving up for Udyr or someone else suggested as a jungle role. But if you're starting out, I'd say stick to the top, mid and bot lanes for a bit before braving the jungle.\n\nAnd overall, just buy the champs that look cool and who's techniques really click to you and get you interested. Sure they might cost a lot, and require saving up, but when you finally buy them and have fun, it's a really good feeling.\n\nI'm not sure if this helped or not, but I wish you the best of luck for your time in League of Legends ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2015-09-21T22:34:39.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me, I just picked any champ that looked cool to me and saved up for it.\nI really liked {{champion:92}} and she was my first champ that I bought.\nJust find someone you like and buy him/her.\nyou would probably like to first try the ones that cost 450 IP-1350 IP due to their \"easier\" play styles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-22T01:20:47.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Charmander, Squirtle or Bulbasaur","replies":[]}]}
