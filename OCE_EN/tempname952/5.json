When your team knows that they have the lead its genuinely all smiles knowing that the game will be surrendered by the enemy team. It's for certain positive but it can drag the fun away since you wanted to do more in game.\n\n\nFrom the games that I am experiencing now there are less players that are not surrendering as much, less pessimistic players are nice and its good to see optimistic team mates of mine not giving up and strive to keep winning through the outcomes of the game.\n\n:)","replies":[]}]}
