Are Butcher and Feast good? The numbers seem rather small(3 health 1 mana). Is Double-Edged Sword something you always want to take? Ranged generally shouldn't be taking much damage, but at the same time you're never going to go through a game without taking **some**.\n\nThat's just the first tier of offense.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T07:03:21.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah you want a full run down.\n\nYour general 21 in Offense as AD depends on if you rely on spells or autos.\nTake 4 in either Fury or sorcery (note that if you have even a small reliance on CD's the CDR is better then the AS, cause honestly the AS is weak)\nFrom here 3 in brute force and 1 in either Double edged sword or butcher (you can take exposed weakness but it's generally pretty meh.)\n1 in Martial Mastery and 3 in exectutioner is good\n1 in Dangerous game and 3 in Warlord are your next 4\n3 in devastating strikes, and then if you are going to crit, 1 in Frenzy, if not, then place it wherever you feel you need the point (This can be the opposite of what you took for DES or butcher so you have both).\nFinish it off with 1 point in havoc.\n\nFeast is honestly rather weak in my opinion and i don't take it.","replies":[{"poster":"tempname952","date":"2015-03-08T07:43:32.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about other roles such as Support or Top?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T07:46:20.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly my suggestion is to go find your champ on a site like lolking, and look at the masterys they give as a general guide.\n\nBecause support varies WAY to much to even bother trying to mention what each one is, and generally your trying to build to your champion rather then your position anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"tempname952","date":"2015-03-11T00:23:28.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Lolking a generally acceptable site for things like that?
