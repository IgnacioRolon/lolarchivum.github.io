Here is my feedback on your OCE Ranked system.\n\nLEAGUE TIERS - As you can see you have over 70% of your ranked player base in the bottom two of 6 divisions. Being in bronze is not something that is enjoyable, especially for those that should be in higher, well for many its an issue of time, even if they are skilled they dont have the time to spend to grind out of bronze. Should Gold not be the average division?\n\nLANE ROLES - To get out of bronze easily you need to carry, this is best done from Mid, and Top, the lanes where others also want to carry themselves out of or just enjoy being powerful in the game. This really needs to be balanced, so support/jungle  get as much gold/exp as the ones they are supporting.\n\nLP SYSTEM - Lets go over an example of how unbalanced your LP system is. Lets say someone is on 99 LP like I have been many times, It requires 4 out of 5 wins to progress. The game to get to 99 LP, then  100 LP, then 2 of 3 promo games.You have now given a free win if you fail the first promo, which is great but how about giving the LP you stole. Because when you are on 99LP and you win a game, then lose 2 games guess what, you got only 1 LP to get into promos, and after failing you now are sitting on 70 or so. What happened to the 13-14 lp? This can be made up if you are on 0 LP after promoting a division, but I have been demoted straight after a promo before.\n\nQUE BALANCE - If I am in a promo, I would like to be in a game with others that are in a promo, should I not have some sense of Promo priority, so I dont end up with Fresh level 30&#039;s doing 10 placement games, or people that have disconnection issues and leave, or people that dont want to try to win and surrender at 20. It is not a small sample to say that 10% of my promo games have someone that leaves &quot;a leaver&quot;, you have no ability to dodge hostile players, I have had many games where you re-que and end up with someone you have muted or reported in the last game.\n\nABUSING THE SYSTEM - People use programs to bring up stats on the players they are qued with, to decide if they should dodge and only lose 2 lp, this is frustrating for those that have to que and pick champs for 20 mins without even getting into game. Many people that dont have the time but dont want to be bullied by friends being stuck in bronze, resort to paying a 3rd party to play on there account to get up in divisions, where as I dont think this is so bad, but the fact that these company&#039;s employ DDOS attacks and other methods to rig the games they want to win as time is money.\n\nLANGUAGE - I will put a small note here about playing with others that dont speak english, or I dont speak there native language. I understand why this is needed to have a larger player base, and to save costs on running a server. Just be aware if you are going to grade our ELO/MMR vs NA and EU then take this into account. When I transferred from NA from Silver 2, I was placed Bronze 2.\n\nThank you for listening, I dont normally post but these injustices have bothered me for 5 years.\n\nSee you online.\n\nThergin","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-27T07:35:39.961+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"**LEAGUE TIERS** \n\n*  An extra tier at lower levels is a terrible idea. It doesn't fix anything anyway, if you add in a _\"Copper Tier\"_ now the Copper Tier players will feel bad. I would also think the toxicity towards Copper Tier would be disgusting, since they are literally lower than bronze.\n\n\n> Should Gold not be the average division?\n\n* It can be. It's up to the players, it's all based around MMR equation LOL uses. No one knows the exact equation (except Riot), and this is super hard to explain so I'll just show you proof. The majority of players in [EUW](http://www.lolsummoners.com/stats/euw) and almost for [KR](http://www.lolsummoners.com/stats/kr) are actually in** Silver - Gold** not **Bronze - Silver**. Riot doesn't control this because there is no limit to the number of people in each division (except Challenger).\n\n**LANE ROLES**\n\n* This is debatable, but I think carrying from supportive roles is balanced ATM. In bronze it might not be, but in higher elo it's not possible to carry without support. Which kind of makes the support the carry in a way.\n\n**LP SYSTEM**\n\n* Actually a good idea. I think it would be good if excess LP was given back after failing the promotional series. After all you did earn it.\n\n**QUE BALANCE**\n\n* The system judges players on skill (MMR) not experience or current position in their division. **This is fair.** With your system, people not in promotional series are more likely to get in game with bad players who are on the verge of demotion. Also in Platinum and higher there's just not enough players in promotional series to do this effectively, queue time would be hours.\n\n**ABUSING THE SYSTEM**\n\n* Riot is insanely good at finding elo boosters. There was a post on here complaining about elo boosters, when infact all of them had been punished already XD Looks like it's been taken down though.\n\n* Looking up your team-mates has been confirmed by Riot to be within the rules. You're handicapping yourself by not doing it as well. [This](http://oce.op.gg/) site is great for that.\n\n**LANGUAGE**\n\n* Not sure what you're trying to say here, but speaking/typing a different language is not a violation of any rules, nor is it considered refusing to communicate with team. Learn more about that [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q4).\n\nI hope that clears up what you needed. I swear Riot should employ me some day, all these essays... :D","replies":[{"poster":"Thergin","date":"2015-11-27T13:58:05.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said ad an extra division I include Challenger as one Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Challenger\n\nPlatinum players dont get fresh level 30's in promo games, and you have way less leavers and trolls so I think it balances out, as far as que times you dont need a preference for promos, only Bronze, Silver, Gold need it.\n\nAbusing the system - I do sometimes look at the stats of players in my game, but I am talking about only losing 2 lp for a dodge, it is not high enough.\n\nLanguage - Do any NA players have issues not being able to communicate with teamates in champ selection, as I said it was a note, not a request for change.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-27T21:21:06.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh my bad I think I misinterpreted what you meant with the divisions. I hope you understand now though, that the average elo is not up to Riot to decide.\n\n**Abusing the system**\n\n_What if I told you that higher LP losses for dodging would make the system super unfair? _\n\nEssentially when you dodge you decrease your LP but your MMR stays the same. With this system you can keep dodging unfavourable games, **and stay in the same league** but with super high MMR. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKs9x02c9d4) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WACnR2J1J4k) are 2 videos explaining the strategy.\n\n**Language**\nNA players have plenty of language issues in champion select, Spanish speaking players are very common there. We are honestly one of the best regions for language, I get the occasional East Asian player but it really doesn't affect the game and most of them know English anyway.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-28T04:27:03.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's so much wrong in the OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-11-27T11:01:15.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with the ranked system is that it is full of people who really should not be playing ranked. Way back, some of the best players I felt I had played with were casual players. They played maybe only one or two champions but they played them really, really well and I was always surprised that they did not play ranked, because, in my mind, they would go really well. But when I see these people play ranked, play their games and end up in bronze, just like me I was shocked, I didn't get it. But now, much later I do get it. As good as they are they are not in the mindset for ranked play. Some are selfish, one track mind players who want to be the carry or not at all, some just want to see more numbers go up and down as the game dulls, some don't get why teamwork is needed if they are the only person who matters to them. The casual player who jumps into ranked and refuses to adjust the way they think about the game is where a lot of the shit comes from.\n\nBTW Riot are putting in a freebe promo win system for next season. People below Gold 2 will have no excuse now if they really can't stick to a division.\n\nI used to mind being bronze. Now I don't give a fuck. Why? Because I prefer to play this game casually. That doesn't mean I don't like to challenge myself, it is just I have more fun without the mind baggage that comes with losing in ranked. There are other things I am better at and keep getting better at.","replies":[{"poster":"Thergin","date":"2016-01-27T05:06:00.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So an update, I finished S3 season 5, preseason made it to Gold 5.\n\nNew seasons starts, lose first 3 games, win next 6 lose last game so 6-4 win-loss, placed S3\n\nNew matchmaker is fantastic!","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-01-28T04:12:36.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fucking obliterated.\n\nEdit, granted, your elo may have declined (was there gold elo decline last season, I dunno?) but left you at the bare minimum to stay in gold.\n\nAlso, does preseason matter that much?
