Then when in champ select they talk shit and I dodge why do I have to wait for your stupidity?\r\n\r\nWhy is so much of how your system works counter intuitive and half as good as your competition.","replies":[{"poster":"Slycandicem","date":"2015-08-16T04:38:30.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a fundamental flaw of the reporting system that you can be stuck in queue with someone you just reported. I have had it happen a few times. really sucks. Some people think that reporting someone means you wont be put in same team as them...unfortunately this isnt true. i was in 2 games and a champ select with one person that i reported in first 2 games. thankfully someone dropped the queue or i most likely would have reported the person again after another frustrating loss.","replies":[]}]}
