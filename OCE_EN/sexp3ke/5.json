He was always strong. By strong i mean, well for about 2 years ive been calling the annoying prick OP. He basically wins top after completing half an item and gets a few levels in his Q.\r\nI Just want one nerf, nerf his fucking regen. His Q is absolutely fucking bullshit. You cannot counter it, thats what makes it unbalanced.\r\n\r\nHe buys sunfirescape and deals stupid amounts of damage, literally after that one item its all over. Early game he just starts cloth 5 and farms all casually, you shove to his turret and yeah he misses a bit if he doesnt go ad in his Runes and there you go, thats apparently his weakness.\r\n\r\nLike in all honesty try trading with him when he has half a sunfire scape, hell land q auto you with his passive use feint and just abolishh you. Nasus cant win him in a duel mid game with farm, like thats saying something. And i know going tri force is kind of troll. But his literally the best duelist in the game with that item (rest tank), he makes Jax look like a chump.\r\n\r\nHe buys armor and there you go lifesteal is negated like crazy when dueling against him. But you cant do the same to counter that regen. His fucking stupid. Always was.\r\n\r\nINB4 go teemo.\r\n\r\nalso why the fuck was he buffed, not really considered a buff, but WHY would you even BOTHER giving him some sort of help. The kunt rapes top like almost against ANYONE. its like buffing pantheon. DOES IT MAKE SENSE? NO? WHY DO IT?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-28T10:49:42.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your just salty because you don't know how to beat him,\n\nnuff said","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-07-29T03:01:09.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every top laner is strong atm imo.

If he deals tons of damage after a sunfire cape or half a sunfire cape that means sunfire cape is Op and needs a nerf and not shen. Fyi if you think of Shen as a threat just build some magic resist against him because all his skills deal magic damage and sunfire deals magic damage and really getting a merc treads as a top laner should be pretty common if not core. Shen will only be dealing damage when he completes a Trinity force or Bork or a wits end (he scales well with Attack speed) which i'm very sure is something a Shen will never build early. Calling his Q op sounds really funny to me because it doesn't deal much damage and it scales with AP which is something that shen will never build unless he goes full AP for the troll shield on the ultimate (going AP will make him very squishy). Shen's only strong point is his ability to teamfight and maybe splitpush a little (shen have very bad wave clear). The regen that Q gives him isn't really that powerful either because seriously Mundo, Volibear and Garen all have them as their passive and they are all even better then shen's Q. \n\nTL;DR \n-Shen not op\n-Sunfire might be the OP but not Shen\n-Get MR shen deals magic damage\n-Shen Deals no damage except with TF, Bork or Wits end which are all items Shen never get early game\n-Shen is only good as a teamfighter \n-Shen has very bad waveclear \n-Not much pushing power","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-07-28T11:08:59.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure about a nerf, but his kit is being reworked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Over Haul","date":"2015-07-28T10:44:36.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No he isn't","replies":[]}]}
