Is it because he didn&#039;t win top lane hard enough? Nothing that&#039;s AD wins him, the only thing is maybe Nasus afk farming and sustaining poke and thats not even considered winning, just scaling and not dying. Having bonus 30 percent armor at all times tied in with attack speed reduction, MS slow, a shield, and high base damage as well as enhanced auto attacks means, i have no choice but to play rumble or maybe Vlad. Why and how is that fair exactly.\r\n\r\nYou give one option, go AP. How is that some sort of acceptable trait of his. He wrecks team fights completely and even if you do somehow outplay his E and suck up his Q damage and try to trade, his auto attacks deal more than yours in lane, no thanks to the new change.\r\n\r\nIt just doesn&#039;t seem logical?","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-29T01:54:20.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has one gap closer.
