But I also think he struggles to kill you. \n\nMy advice would be to pick someone that farms well and can scale. From there you either want someone who can teamfight just as well, think rumble or even singed (MR per Level OP), or someone who lategame will be able to outsplit push, maybe Shyvanna or trinity force Fizz. Because Maokai doesnt built damage generally in a push you can kill the wave chip the turret down and stop him from being a huge teamfighting tank.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, because I think alot of players would struggle with Maokai lanes.\n\nCheers","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-07-15T09:08:12.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus is the correct answer.

I totally agree with that. I more meant that maokai's ulimate and cc is pretty crucial in teamfights whereas fizz doesn't really have any (sure there is the knock-up of his ult and the slow on his e).
