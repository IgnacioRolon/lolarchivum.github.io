Also don't forget his ult's passive that increases his damage output by a % of his own maximum health. Meaning his AAs will do damage as well.\n\nIt's very unlikely that W when used to consume an enemy champion will do true damage, and it's very likely the numbers will be toned down a fair bit while he spends the next two to three weeks on the PBE.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-06-25T23:52:45.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if you cant beat em play them :P the other guys right all new champs have to be strong, who'd wanna buy a weak champ at all? combine a new champ with being potentially op theres a much higher chance of being bought","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-26T07:22:48.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except as I've already said to the others.\n\nNew champs being OP to make players buy them is completely bullshit. \n>Why do Riot only \"balance\" the popular champs, because there is enough data on them to do so.\nIt's like how people say Riot intentionally make new champs overpowered on release so people buy them for FreELO.\n1) Champs are free, you'll find yourself at a point where you have 100,000 IP and nothing but new champions to spend it on.\n2) The PBE is too small to actually offer any real amount of usable data in terms of balancing a champion, only when a champion is on the Live client and popular will Riot know where the issues lie and be able to work on them. Ryze is a good current example of this, and you can hear that talked about in the latest Patch Rundown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feCeOcI8GZ0\n\nThe whole idea that Riot is so thirsty for cash that they make champs overpowered deliberately on launch is retarded.

Spend hardly any effort recolouring and then just throw it at them for money.\n\nHuh now that I look at it, isn't the only way Riot can make money by selling skins and now Chromas?\nAfter all they are the only thing in the game that can ONLY be bought with RP.\nChampions can be bought with IP, and as I've said the majority of players end up at a point where they can't use their IP on anything other than champions because you end up with a stockpile of 100,000 or more. Hell one weak of playing the game and you make enough IP to buy the next three champions to come out.\n\nIt's definitely a money making scheme to make new champions overpowered on launch as to scam real world money out of players. Oh wait!\nThe two posts below give examples of champs that were trash and underpowered on launch, hell if you actually paid attention the majority of champs on launch are weak, with maybe one overpowered ability.\nThere goes that money making scam.\n\nQ: B-b-but Klavinmour, what about all the times I got completely destroyed by this new champ on release?
