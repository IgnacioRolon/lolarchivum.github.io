Q and W nerf are pretty big, big his buffs on his E and ult make up for it, it seems.\r\n\r\nWhen i saw his  spin in notes, i didn&#039;t understand it, the more ticks you gain when leveling etc. His early game is pretty meh, but what they done is basically, garen is a god late gamer. He can duel pretty fucking amazing. Team fight deal more damage, but obviously he lost some things in the process.\r\n\r\nAll im going to say is the true damage is nice, if you can land it on that specific opponent. But that&#039;s not the big change that brought a smile on my face, its his spin.\r\n\r\nAt 170 ad at level 18, so basically just a black clever. his spin done, a total of, get this, about 800-900 damage, that is when it hits several targets, if they are alone, bump that by 33 percent, so just over 1k damage, on a pretty short cd, about 5-6 seconds.\r\n\r\nobviously his still pretty immobile, but i think his late game just got even better along with that passive buff a while ago. I can say, his in a pretty dam good place, in terms of raw power. Id pick him over darius and olaf anyday, for comparison.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-20T09:38:10.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't like new garen.\ncause.\nIm forced to build damage now.","replies":[{"poster":"SexP3ke","date":"2015-08-20T10:07:29.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your not forced to do anything, garen does more damage than before, so why would you need to build damage now.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-20T10:11:58.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SexP3ke,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Z6WoOjqA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-08-20T10:07:29.151+0000)\n>\n> your not forced to do anything, garen does more damage than before, so why would you need to build damage now.\n\nIm kinda annoyed with the garen changes, he is weaker early but stronger as the game goes on yes.\n\nMaybe im just kinda salty since i lost a game with him today against darius. \nI just really preferred the old one .","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-08-20T07:48:21.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is really Tanky too and that regen late game is just insane.","replies":[]}]}
