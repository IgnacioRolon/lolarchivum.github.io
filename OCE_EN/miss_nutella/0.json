By the end of the game I was 37/10 full build and everything but when 3 people tried to kill kog maw he only had 2 life steal items and went from low health to full health instantly! I tried to 1v1 him but his life steal was crazy! Is this just how kog maw is like? I&#039;m not really sure because I don&#039;t have experience with kog maw.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-07T11:20:09.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kogmaw has no defensive tools like dashes or hard cc, his base damage is meh, he's mostly onhit and so his full build is among the most expensive in the game, he doesn't have burst, and the majority of his damage is medium range by adc standards excluding his ult. \n\nHowever kogmaw is and has always been the king of stand and deliver dps. Lategame kogmaw is not something you mess with unless you have a frozen heart and randuins, or are an assassin.","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Nutella","date":"2017-06-13T08:03:26.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty!!!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arsom","date":"2017-06-09T11:26:36.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kog maw can be broken if the player has skill and knows what hes doing with kog. Kog has no mobility and can be burst down if in a bad position, i would say he would be better in higher elo and just try to stop him from farming if you can. He's a god late game{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miss Nutella","date":"2017-06-13T08:03:00.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty Guys didnt know much about kog maw","replies":[]}]}]}
