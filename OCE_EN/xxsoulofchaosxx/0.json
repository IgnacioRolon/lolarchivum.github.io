I am a serious player when it comes to rank and until now i have yet been able to find myself a team that would take things seriously.\r\nNot after the constant LoL player as i know people have commitments, but we can set up days/times that the team is comfortable with to play our team games.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting new people. \r\n\r\nCurrent rank - Gold 5, Was Gold 3 season 4 however due to inactivity as unable to find ranked team ended up back in Silver for Season 5. However i pushed myself back into Gold.\r\n\r\nAny questions comment below or simply add me in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Meteoric","date":"2015-06-22T03:26:23.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey mate gold 4 here and climbing looking for a team willing to play any role except for jungle","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-06-01T02:57:13.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude :) Add me in game BurstFire301 (i dont have access to my client atm and might forget)","replies":[{"poster":"xXSoulofChaosXx","date":"2015-06-01T04:56:59.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will add you once i get online later today","replies":[]}]}]}
