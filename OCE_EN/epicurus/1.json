He brought it down hard, and the sound echoed throughout the city&rsquo;s silent ruins. He could see the lurkers watching him from the shadows, sulking in the crumbling doorframes and peering out of the drains. They were pale, wretched things that squinted angrily in the meagre moonlight, rasping and snarling as he passed, but they dared not come too close, for they sensed the force Yorick carried within him. They felt the power of the Arclight.\r\n\tYorick saw them and felt only pity. They had been people once. Painters, musicians, merchants, dancers, the proud and prosperous people of a great city. But the Revenant, the unknowable spectre of corruption, had turned all their dreams to dust, dooming them to live in darkness and fear. From such a sickness they could never be healed. They could only be freed.\r\n\tWith a howl, the bravest of the lurkers (or perhaps simply the hungriest) came lunging out of the rubble. Its body slammed into him, fingers scrambling over his armour, but its emancipated weight hardly staggered him at all, and he threw the thing to the ground. It was a man, Yorick noticed, but young. He would have been only a child when the Revenant befell his home. Yorick wondered what his name had been, whether the poor creatures still remembered it, and if his soul would thank the king for his service. For it was Yorick&rsquo;s duty, as king and as Arclight, to deliver these souls the only mercy still in his power to give.\r\n\tThe creature made to rise, perhaps to flee or perhaps to fight, and Yorick brought down his spade, freeing his soul from the earth with a single blow.\r\n\tThe watchers howled and cursed, but Yorick ignored them. Closing his eyes, he planted his spade in the ground and spoke the holy rites, praying that man&rsquo;s soul would rise above this quagmire of shadows and find peace in the beyond. Through the vision of the Arclight he could watch the soul ascend. Twisted and shrivelled at first, it grew as it rose, blooming as it broke free of the darkness that had held it for so long. Away from pain, away from fear, it danced into the long sleep of Eternity.\r\nYorick watched it disappear, longing to go with it.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\t&ldquo;AAARRRRRooooooo&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\tA savage roar split the silence, waking Yorick from his reverie. The watchers were fleeing, leaving the fallen behind. Something else was coming. Something big. His presence had woken something deep in the festering heart of the city, something that had fed unchallenged there for decades, and now was rushing to meet whoever had so foolishly entered its kingdom. A great hound, ravenous and mad, with a blade of moonlight through its heart. It had been a man once, a knight of great renown, or so the tales said.\r\nWith a howl, the monster leapt out of the fog, teeth bared, claws reaching. Yorick threw himself aside with only a hand&rsquo;s width to spare, and the hound&rsquo;s great bulk carried him overhead with the force of an avalanche. Its claws tore up the cobblestones as it came to a halt, ready to leap again.\r\n\t&ldquo;Warwick!&rdquo; shouted Yorick. The monster stopped short, the name stirring something in its memory.\r\n\t&ldquo;That was your name once,&rdquo; the king continued, getting to his feet. &ldquo;The name of great knight, and a great man. One who stood against the dark to defend his homeland.&rdquo;\r\n\tWarwick growled evilly. It was blind, Yorick realised. A cruel iron crown had been fixed over its eyes, and its skin was laced with scars where it had tried to pry it free. Yorick could see the tip of the moonlight blade extending from its chest as it stalked closer to where he stood.\r\n\t&ldquo;The Revenant took that away from you.&rdquo; He gripped his spade tightly. &ldquo;He has taken from us all.&rdquo;\r\n\tClaws the size of dirks came tearing at his face, but Yorick batted the blow aside. He sighed, for he could see now that there would be no reasoning with this monster. The man inside was long, long gone.\r\n\tThe two circled each other, waiting for the moment to explode. The king, ancient armour glowing from within, and the hound.\r\n\tWarwick crossed the distance between them in a flash of ragged fur and slashing claws. With a shout, Yorick brought down his spade with all his might&hellip;\r\n\t&hellip; and was too slow. In an instant it had Yorick in his jaws, shaking him like a doll, throwing him clear across the street, where his crumpled form fell broken and defeated.\r\n\t\r\n***\r\nYorick&rsquo;s armour was gone. That was the first thing he noticed. He had carried its weight for so very long now, and without it he felt so light it was euphoric. Closing his hands, he found that his spade was gone too. Opening his eyes, he realised that they were already open: there was nothing to see but darkness, but it was not frightening. It was the darkness of a well-deserved sleep.\r\n\tHave I died? he wondered. At last?\r\n\t&ldquo;My lord&hellip;&rdquo; the voice drifted out from the void, and Yorick felt his heart leap in his chest, and tears well in his eyes. It was her voice. To hear her voice again, after so many years.\r\n\t&ldquo;My lady&hellip;&rdquo; he croaked. He could say no more.\r\n\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been so long, my king,&rdquo; whispered the queen, and even though he could still see nothing, Yorick felt her warm hands take his. He held it: they were as soft as he remembered. They tugged at him gently, leading him on to the long sleep of Eternity.\r\n\t&ldquo;I waited for you here, and now you&rsquo;ve come. Rest now my lord. We can sleep in the beyond together.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed you, my love,&rdquo; Yorick replied sadly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to come back to you, every day since I left.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come now.&rdquo;\r\n\t&ldquo;Aye. But my work is not finished.&rdquo;\r\n\tYorick let go.\r\n\r\n***\r\nHis fingers tightened on the haft of his spade. His eyes opened, the Arclight shining out from them. Warwick bore down, ready to deal the killing blow, when Yorick rose up, turning, and brought his spade down on the beast&rsquo;s crown with all his might.\r\nThe impact split the metal clean through, and the holy power of the Arclight lit the sky.\r\nWarwick fell back howling, clutching at its face in agony. Every vein shone as brilliant as lightning as the Arclight burnt him from within. The monster flailed madly at the air, and Yorick saw the pale hilt of the moonlight blade exposed between its shoulders.\r\nHe leapt, took the hilt with both hands, and before the beast could shake him off, before Yorick even noticed how bone-numbingly cold the blade was, he tore it free.\r\nBlack smoke gushed from the wound. Yorick fell back, the moonlight blade dropping from his hands, and it dissolved into mist before it could hit the ground. Warwick was screaming, tearing at his own flesh as his fur burnt and smoked. It would be no use. The Arclight had no mercy.\r\nYorick himself had stood in that light once. He had felt it shining through the deepest corners of his mind, illuminating every thought and memory with ruthless efficiency. He had quailed, he had screamed, and when he thought that he could bear the light no longer, thought that he would be burnt away to nothing but an ashen stain and be lost in the Arclight&rsquo;s infinite power, the glow had ceased. The Arclight had found him worthy.\r\n\tOn that day, he had descended the mountain with his heart full of joy. With the power of the Arclight, he could return home, and lead his kingdom into a new age of glory.\r\nBut he had returned far too late&hellip;\r\n\r\n***\r\nThe screaming had stopped and the smoke had cleared. The beast was no more. Warwick lay on the ground ragged and broken, a man once again, but his eyes stared at the sky without seeing. Yorick had freed him from his curse, but his soul had not survived the ordeal. Even now it rose above the city, higher and higher, until it was gone.\r\nWarwick&rsquo;s suffering was over. Another soul had been freed from the Revenant&rsquo;s clutches. Without the monster, the rest of the city might gradually heal itself. Yorick hoped that was the case, for he was bone weary of the day&rsquo;s work.\r\nThe Arclight had triumphed. Yorick should have felt victorious, but he could only feel tired. The Revenant was still out there, always a step ahead, corrupting everything it touched, and unless it was stopped there would always be more monsters, more dead cities, and more living nightmares. The Revenant, it was his true enemy. Yorick would find it one day, and they would fight until only one survived.\r\nAnd then, one way or another, he would sleep.","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2018-10-02T10:57:56.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, here is my submission for the Skins Story Slam Competition, featuring Arclight Yorick and Grey Warwick.
