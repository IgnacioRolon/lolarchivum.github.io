I&#039;ve not posted on the OCE boards before (although I&#039;ve been using the NA boards for a while), and currently can not post comments, nor make threads of my own outside of Help &amp; Support. In the comments section it says I can&#039;t post because I must be level 5 or higher, but my summoner level is above eighty.\n\nCan anyone help me out here? I want to enter the Skins Story Slam contest, but can&#039;t without being able to post anything.\n\n\nEDIT. Ironically, posting this thread seems to have updated my account, and I am now allowed to post anywhere. I'll pretend that was the plan all along.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-07T11:02:57.906+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue results from your in game level not being synced to boards which results in you being unable to post in boards with level limits. There is a stop gap sync tool in place which syncs when you either upvote a comment or post, or create a discussion in H and S, which is why it now works for you :)","replies":[{"poster":"Epicurus","date":"2018-09-08T09:48:25.976+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That makes sense.
