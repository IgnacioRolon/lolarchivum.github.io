Legacy historically had a weaker early part of the season and the Dire Wolves roster had been gutted with the loss of ADC prodigy K1ng, and the Chiefs have always been the dominant team in Split 1.\r\n\r\nYet here we are, Week 5 and Legacy and Dire Wolves are the 2 remaining undefeated teams in the OPL. Dire Wolves, the OPL Legend title holders, upset the Chiefs in Week 2 to position themselves as the major threat in the league, and Legacy have demolished every single team they have played this split in one sided series.\r\n\r\nWe sat down with Carbon to get some insight into Legacy&#039;s performance this year\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u1z7CJvto8\r\n\r\nTonight starting around 8pm AEDT (Following the first Bo3), Legacy and Dire Wolves battle to find out which team will stand alone at the top (for now).\r\n\r\nWho do you think will take the match?","replies":[{"poster":"SF ChrisMisTrees","date":"2016-02-16T01:28:05.473+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":1,"body":"dire WOLVES zeratul > k1ng gg ezpzz","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lusankya","date":"2016-02-16T01:25:17.191+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"DYAH WOHLVES http://www.myinstants.com/instant/dyah-wolfsz/","replies":[{"poster":"sprenstama","date":"2016-02-16T01:26:15.353+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kmsfish,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=wAUn3e05,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-02-16T01:25:17.191+0000)\n>\n> DYAH WOHLVES http://www.myinstants.com/instant/dyah-wolfsz/\n\ndireWOLVES","replies":[{"poster":"      Gromethius","date":"2016-02-16T01:29:41.434+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"DIRE WLVES","replies":[{"poster":"PlzDontEvenCry","date":"2016-02-16T01:29:59.563+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"diiiiiirree WOOVLESS","replies":[{"poster":"90845673463","date":"2016-02-16T01:30:21.593+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"direWOFIANS","replies":[{"poster":"Lusankya","date":"2016-02-16T01:31:03.035+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"dyrePUPPIES","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ability","date":"2016-02-16T01:30:30.851+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"dire wVOOLLESS","replies":[{"poster":"D BEST yasuo4bae","date":"2016-02-16T01:31:29.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"diredoges","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mashadar","date":"2016-02-16T01:29:55.896+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"The only way LGC would beat Dire Wolves is if they had a good adc like Zenk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Soulstrikes","date":"2016-02-16T03:45:24.374+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dire wolves tends to like farming up until the point they are on a powerspike. but this doesnt mean they are passive team, they have shown their skirmish in the jungle can snowball their game and hit their powerspike faster (as shown in sin game).\n\nbut legacy plays around the whole map, playing around objective, controlling the side wave management and carbon regret's jungle support synergy in enemy jungle, as such they look like a 5man moving around the map.\n\nRole to watch out for tonight: Top lane\n\nBoth tally and sharp are quiet new to their respectable roles transitioning from carry role to top,\n\nboth Tally and Sharp has impressed me from their previous games, from playing carry champs such as quinn/fiora to more supportive  lissandra/lulu.\n\nwith the meta fading from tanky champ and more carry champ i believe top lane will have the most impact tonight. Who will have more cs (from lane swap perhaps), Who will shove their lane first??
