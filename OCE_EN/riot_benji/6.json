Paws was one of these players that was punished at this time. \r\n\r\nDuring the round of bans in January 2014 we specified and communicated to the banned players that if any player continued to boost accounts, they would receive a permanent ban.\r\n\r\nRecently Paws received a permanent ban on his account due to continued ELO Boosting.\r\n\r\n**Relevant Rules**\r\nThe Oceanic Challenger Series ruleset specifies:\r\n\r\n*8.2.7 Player Behavior Investigation \r\nIf Riot determines that a Team Member has violated the Summoner’s Code, the LoL Terms of Service, or other rules of LoL, Riot officials may assign penalties at their sole discretion.*\r\n\r\n**Analysis**\r\nPaws continued to violate the Summoner’s Code despite being punished for it previously. \r\n\r\n**Ruling**\r\nPaws has violated the Summoner’s code and will subject to punishment.\r\n\r\n**Competition Penalties**\r\nPaws has been suspended indefinitely from all Oceanic Tournaments and his League of Legends Account will be permanently Suspended.\r\n\r\n**Commentary**\r\nAfter speaking to his team, Rich Gang, it is clear they had no idea that Paws’s main account had been banned. Paws had been playing on his alt and the team had no reason to doubt that it was simply his main. We do not want to punish the other members of the team that have worked hard to qualify for the Oceanic Pro League for the mistake of one player. Locally, we are going to look at ways of improving our identification of ineligible players so that this situation is identified earlier.","replies":[{"poster":"Rich Shah paws","date":"2015-01-30T10:40:03.113+0000","up_votes":18,"down_votes":8,"body":"this is a very unbiased and well deserved ban. Benji has finally found me, the boosting lord of oce. I've been hiding in a cave boosting accounts for eight hours a day (only playing support sona). that one person i boosted 13 months ago was the only boosting incident of 2014 so OCE is 100% free from boosters now . well done benji another step forward for OCE ","replies":[{"poster":"Semirhage","date":"2015-01-30T16:39:23.998+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Esse is that you?!?!?!?","replies":[]},{"poster":"First Mate","date":"2015-01-31T13:18:48.377+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Kappa","replies":[{"poster":"AFLYINGTOILET","date":"2015-02-05T09:28:08.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"kapppaaaa","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ended","date":"2015-01-30T16:24:30.447+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's a shame \"Rich Shah paws\" the best support in Oce is banned indefinitely from competitive.
