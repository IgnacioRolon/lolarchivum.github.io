Last year we hosted a variety of panels around Esports, Cosplay and other subjects for both attendees and those who watched on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThis year we&#039;ll be heading to PAX again, but we want feedback from you on what you&#039;d like to hear us talk about. \r\n\r\nBelow are some subjects that our community and crew have expertise in, if there&#039;s something you&#039;d like to hear us talk about please let us know in the poll below! You can only vote once, so make that vote count, if you&#039;re passionate about two make sure to sound off in the comments below. \r\n\r\nCosplay Connoisseurs:\r\n_What does it take to create some of the amazing cosplays you see at conventions? Find out as the experts take you through the process and answer your questions._\r\n\r\nHow to become an Esports Contributor:\r\n_Esports are on the rise but it takes a lot of work to bring it from game to screen. How do you go from a spectator to someone who is involved in making this happen? _\r\n\r\nLife of a Pro Player: \r\n_At the start of 2017 the OPL moved from being an online league to a LAN league, with players leaving behind their homes to live in Sydney. What is it like living in a house with 4 other players? What is the schedule like?_\r\n\r\nHow to Shoutcast: \r\n_Commentators are a core part of any Broadcast. Wether you&#039;re streaming an online tournament from your bedroom or Shoutcasting at the World Championship, there is always something to learn. Join our local Shoutcasters as they run you through what great casting looks like._\r\n\r\nEsports Production:\r\n_What happens behind the scenes of a broadcast? You may hear of producers and directors, but what do they actually do? Find out as the OPL Production team gives you an overview of how a broadcast is put together._\r\n\r\nMechs vs Minions Live Game: \r\n_Some Riot personalities sit down for some good ol&#039; Mechs vs Minions. Will they succeed at the mission? Probably not, but that&#039;s half the fun!_\r\n\r\nOther: \r\n_We would love to hear from you! Post any suggestions you have in the comments below!_","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-25T05:28:46.462+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"My biggest questions about PAX are regarding Neo Pax Sivir.\n\nSpeaking as someone who lives in a different country _(not to mention an entirely different continent)_ from where Pax is being held. It would cost an astronomical amount of money for me to attend, therefore it is highly likely, that just like all previous Pax's and many Pax's to come, I shall not be able to attend. Despite my wishes.\n\n**My Question is:**\nWhy do I now have to waste 10 gemstones _(that I've worked hard for the last year just to get the 7 I have now, and most of them were bought)_ to get a skin I would get for free, if I just happened to live in a slightly different location? And I'm not the only one who will not be able to attend due to living in different cities/countries.\n\n\nDiscrimination by location is still discrimination.\n\nIt seems unfair for people to have to use up such valuable crafting resources to get the same skin that will be given away for free to those lucky enough to live near Pax.\n\nWhat is your justification for this?\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-26T07:08:13.602+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"their justification is if you really cared, you'd abandon your work, your education, your family and savings and buy a plane ticket to attend.

The skin isn't that great to make one feel that it's unfair and 10 gemstones can be better used for the other skins on offer really.
