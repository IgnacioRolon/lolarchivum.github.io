It's clear they were doing everything in their power to continue that one game, but in the end were unable to save it.\n\nRight now, none of us should be saying how crap the situation is, because that can't change. We should all be screaming as loud as we can to show the world that OCE is here and Chiefs will be making it to Worlds.
