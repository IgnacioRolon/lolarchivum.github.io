Unfortunately for them, only one can rise out and claim the title.\r\n\r\nTonight we have our first test for each of the teams. Which house is producing the best results, and which house has to question their setup and make rapid changes to come back in this season?\r\n\r\nWe spoke to some of the players on their thoughts:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7hrX5Z0WA\r\n\r\nThe Bo3 will kick off tonight at 6pm AEDT at www.twitch.tv/riotgamesoceania\r\n\r\nWho do you think will take it, Legacy or Hellions?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-02T02:52:49.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys! More of these videos please! They're like the NA LCS hype videos, I think it'll do wonders for the OPL scene :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"PhenomMonkee","date":"2016-02-02T02:23:45.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is definitely interesting to start to see some of the OPL teams start to adopt the gaming house. I think that it definitely brings either comrodery or chaos. I hope that it is comrodery personally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Revoke","date":"2016-02-02T02:11:24.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Legacy player-for-player has just shown themselves to be better IMO. Maybe not so clear a gap between Bomb and ChuChuZ as i've seen a lot of good stuff out of Bomb in SoloQ but for my money there's a clear gap between all of the other roles. I'll be thoroughly impressed with Hellions if they make this series competitive because tbh I'm expecting a rather convincing Legacy victory.","replies":[]}]}
