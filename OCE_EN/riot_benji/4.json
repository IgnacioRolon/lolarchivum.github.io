Group A plays a double round robin, Group B plays a double round robin, and Group A teams play vs Group B teams in a cross-group single round robin. [EDIT:] All teams are still playing on a single ladder, with standings from 1 through 8.\n\nEffectively, within a split, every team will still play each of the others once, and some twice.","replies":[{"poster":"Zeforus","date":"2015-12-16T08:44:54.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that Group A and Group B have a double round robin among themselves.\n\nWhat do you mean by a cross-group single round robin? \nDo you mean each member of a group will play a single game vs the teams of the other group?\nWhat is the points system for 2-0, 2-1, 1-2 and 0-2 in the bo3?\n\nI'm concerned about the two groups being split, depending on how the system works for the cross-group round robin. What happens if Group A is evenly matched (all matches are 2-1 or 1-2) but a single team in Group B has gone 0-2 the entire double round robin. Would that team have a chance at worst placing 5th in overall standing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wray Z","date":"2015-12-16T07:05:16.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like a very odd system as conferences tend to promote inequality in terms of scheduling and finals, not to mention there are no Australian sports that cover conference systems, do you think it can become popular in Oceania?
