Preferably ones that can be competitive by mid-game in at least 4/5 of the roles. (5/5 would be great, but more difficult given the difference between mid and adc.) - I am not seeking to do ranked with this, I often play in casual drafted and am simply curious of the options out there for it.  I understand most champions, if brought into 4 different roles, will likely have to play safer than usual to survive in some lanes.  The most I want out of the pick is to be able to survive in the lane until one can get the items to be competitive, and not be outright considered a troll pick. \r\n\r\nAtm I'm testing Kayle out.  She is good in top lane, decent in mid, okay in jungle and is possible as a support, but her ADC game seems to be lacking pretty considerably given her very weak early game and she can't be a very competitive jungle(in most cases) do to the weak start as well. \r\n\r\nThoughts and suggestions are all welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Headshott1997","date":"2019-08-03T16:07:36.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the suggestions!
