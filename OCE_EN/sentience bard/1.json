I dont understand why the points work like this. The new change of giving you a free promo game isn&#039;t going to fix the need for a constant win rate of 75%. Atm I have over 600 ranked wins @ 49.4% and still b5/4 I know I need to be a better player, but still did everyone who made it to silver have to win 75% of there games threw 5 lvl&#039;s, when the champ wins are max around 56%?\r\nLet riot know here if you got an opinion on this...","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-11-09T10:07:26.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright,it's hard to explain but i'll try..here I go....\n\nRito made the system to basically seperate the bad,decent and good players.No matter how much you drop if you don't belong there then you will eventually climb out of that elo(there is no elo hell) Let's just say you got placed in bronze V but last season you were diamond III,it won't take long before you will eventually climb out of bronze because you don't belong in that rank.If you don't believe me then watch this guy\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7ghAaiPA0w&list=PLgxjS9_YdxP70SkIc5rAAFIDHfjJPChbi&index=70\n\n\n\nHe went from unranked to diamond...\nAtm the episode is still at 69 and he is still at plat 2 with 69 lp.\n\nHope this explains the rank system that rito made.","replies":[]},{"poster":"demonicslothman","date":"2015-11-09T09:57:11.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like point gain/loss should just be set to set amount of like 20lp or 15lp. or maybe like 20lp gain and 15lp loss so you have the chance to still climb if you are on a dead even win/loss","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2015-11-10T02:34:39.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think many players has the same problem with the system. Rito has created this system that favours smurfs and the elo boosters. The legitimate players in lower tiers has no means to improve progressively and this is why over 50% of the entire community are still in bronze or silver! I have yet to see another sports that player's ratio so unbalanced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sentience Bard","date":"2015-11-09T17:06:18.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But shouldnt I decide where I belong? not riot rigging it with points manipulation?","replies":[]}]}
