I have games that will sit at a flat 30ms throughout, games that spike 200ms every 3 mins and games where you just cant move (not fun for anyone involved). What i would like to know is if there is any way you guys n gals can give me a way to check my ping when im still in the launcher, without having to que up or run a bots game. It would take a bit of refining, sure, but it would also get rid of the &quot;Im lagging im afk&quot; excuse we see in low elo so much. I dont want to play a game were i cant move, my teammates dont want a team member who does nothing or feeds, and noone wants the enemy team to be pushovers because they have a poor connection. Keen to hear you thoughts! {{champion:36}}","replies":[{"poster":"JayLeenEX","date":"2015-11-06T08:57:54.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fdsffd","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-22T03:08:34.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi HoneyBadger,\n\nA couple of questions:\n* What ISP are you with?\n* Do you have connection issues to anything else on the internet?\n* Do you connect to your router via a cable or via wifi?\n\nWhile we don't have a ping checker like this to use, there are a couple of ways you can check up on your connection health.\n\n* Before playing a game, you can run a trace route to our game server network (103.240.227.1).  This will probably be the best indication of the health of your network connectivity to the game servers.\n* You can use [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/) to check previous game logs to look at stability patterns over the course of a game.\n* Additionally, there are some good suggestions in the support article [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) that might help improve your overall stability.\n\nLet me know how you go.\n\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"xoxHoneyBadgerxx","date":"2015-10-22T17:45:57.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kia Ora Mindstar,\n\nI'm with Spark NZ currently, and connectivity issues are with  the whole internet and fluctuates due to time of day, for example at 4pm i cant watch youtube videos, by 7pm i can play World of Tanks but not LoL.
