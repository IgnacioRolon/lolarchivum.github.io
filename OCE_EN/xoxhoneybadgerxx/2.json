I would love to see some artwork of the different locations in Runeterra showing champions in everyday life. Like an image of a street in Zaun, does Zaun have a market day? would we see Ekko shoplifting? If we walked into a bar in Bandle City, would teemo be chatting with Trist and their army buddies, or sitting in the corner nurturing a whisky? What would a campfire in Freljord look like? or a circus at Demacia? Is whos watching the show? whos IN the show? Would be a great challenge to see how people view the different personalities and locations and how they all fit together (or dont)","replies":[]}
