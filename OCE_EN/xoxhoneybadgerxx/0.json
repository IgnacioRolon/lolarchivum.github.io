I do my best not to touch it but, sometimes in the heat of a match, i find my screen suddenly zoomed in, and theirs no way to zoom it back out without the scroll wheel (?) at least, none that i&#039;m aware of. normal +/- keys dont work and theirs no key bindings option for zoom in the menu. {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"xoxHoneyBadgerxx","date":"2015-06-05T11:10:12.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the replies guys, im looking into disabling the scroll wheel presently, however i really cant understand why Riot dont have keyboard commands for zooming :/ i mean it's such a simple mechanic","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-03T22:58:32.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you can disable the scroll wheel completely rather than trying to solve it in game?","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-03T16:06:50.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow really?\nI've never noticed.\nOne thing you could do is to tape/wedge the scroll wheel in place. \nTaping it should suffice so that the wheel won't turn, and it shouldn't interfere with your clicking.","replies":[]}]}
