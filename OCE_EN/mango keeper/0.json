Have you had any other connection related issues lately? (lag spikes, packet loss etc)\n\nFirst thing I would recommend would be to run through the [**Connection Troubleshooting Guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and use custom games to check the fixes.\n\nPast that, try running a **client repair** through settings (the gear icon top right) > Initiate Full Repair.\n\nIf that doesn't work try **reinstalling the game** with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends).\n\nIf that still doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[]}]}
