Anything and everything you say will only be used as fuel for the fire when it comes to these kind of people, and responding in kind only opens you up to punishment as well. Ignoring them completely is the best option. If you feel you struggle with it then you could consider muting all at the start of each game, or moving your chat off screen, or if you find you mostly encounter it on the enemy team you can turn all chat off.\n___\nA chat restriction at this stage is basically a warning. It's telling you that some element of your behaviour was deemed unacceptable, and that you need to do something about it or you will face further punishments. Fourth offence (or less depending on the severity of the behaviour) is a permanent account suspension, so just consider that.\n\nHowever, if you demonstrate [**good behaviour**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751874-Behavior-Worthy-of-a-Champion) for [**3 months**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000) you will drop your account down a punishment tier, in your case that would put your account back into good standing, so good luck to you, and I hope things go better in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"S7 Wrath","date":"2016-06-14T08:16:31.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell me more about the reform period, i am really eager to get this restriction gone asap","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-14T08:28:50.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The time frame of the reform period is different for each player, so I don't really have any more idea than you on a timeframe.

This doesn't make any sense. The toxic players who are reporting him shouldn't get to decide what's acceptable and if anything aren't classed as members of our community anymore. \n\n-Yes, people should ignore/mute instead of retaliation, BUT retaliation is almost the same as defending yourself. It's sad how you're considering toxic players reports against innocent victims. Fueling a toxic player is your excuse for making the situation worse, the match is already ruined having the toxic person playing on the same rift in the first place. The fun is already over for everyone. The damage is done, him retaliating is only a result in the toxic community.  \n\n-What i'm trying to say is stop punishing the innocent it's only going to create more toxicity in the community. You think that you're solving it but you're actually fueling the fire even more. It's a domino effect, many players get pissed off being punished unfairly and then go on to being toxic trolls venting out their frustration on others, THEN the player victims of them retaliate = get a punishment, so on and so forth.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-06-15T13:27:10.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"S7 Wrath","date":"2016-06-19T00:48:14.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-15T08:23:23.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I can tell, this community is just full of C*n*t*.\n\nNo matter what you do, if you come across a premade group, and the large the worse, you are in for some strife.\n\nThe best thing to do is just mute them, as much as I don't like doing that, it is for the better of yourself in most cases.
