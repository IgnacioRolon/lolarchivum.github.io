Please tell me its a bug","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot. Just thought I need to inform you about this. But I just had a rank game before and then I lost. However, apparently that game that I lost said it was my provisional games.  \r\n\r\nSo basically it said 1/10 games. I was not told about this and was wondering if you could do something about this in regards to maybe &quot;reverting&quot; this lost as if I never played my rank games yet. \r\n\r\nI just saw on the server status for Oceania server that it says &quot;_At 06:00 Sydney Time (19:00 UTC), the servers will be shut down and all games currently in progress will end in a draw and stats will not be recorded. We estimate the battlegrounds will be unavailable for 3 hours.&quot;_ So this message that was posted by you guys clearly says that these game results/stats will not be &quot;Counted/Recorded&quot;. \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, I hope this is a bug as I was not informed about this at all. Please remove this lost from my provisionals so that I can start fresh with no games played yet.  \r\n\r\nUpdate: There is a board post here (http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/U1TU3n5X-ranked-has-reset-ps-rito-please-tell-us) that was posted by a League player that also experience this problem/issue. A player that was in that post said that &quot;Rank resets tomorrow or the next day as they are starting the reset on the 7th. This might be a bug in the system but yeah it resets tomorrow&quot; .\r\n\r\nSo I really hope it was a bug and that I hope that game I lost before did not count towards my provisionals or it will be unfair for me and other players.","replies":[]}
