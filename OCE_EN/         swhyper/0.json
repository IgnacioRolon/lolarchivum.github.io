If you want a B series to save a few dollars that's fine, but go for something like the Asus ROG Strix B250H - on top of just being better components, it features an Intel I219V Lan chip (which is better than the realtek chip on the PRIME), 2 * 10 GBp/s USB 3.1 ports instead of 5GBp/s USB 3.0 ports (though you DO lose the USB-C port; honestly it's not a standard anyway; so unless you have a device and cable already I really wouldn't be bothered).\nHOWEVER - IMPORTANT - If you decide to follow my above advice and go for a 7700k you basically NEED a z270 series board, as the unlocked clock timing isn't adjustable on anything else (it will run - I think, I haven't tried - you're literally losing functionality though); the good news is they have higher build quality in the base level boards, and more features - the bad is they will cost ~ 20-40 more.\n\nGigabyte Bluetooth 4.0 + AC Wifi PCI-E Network Card\nWiFi is great - please don't ranked on it.\n\n500W Be Quiet! Pure Power 10\n... Right, here's the thing - I'm a touch old school, I've seen, helped, and yes owned, PCs with PSUs this small and they simply do not function well, the power drain in games is higher than it can output; bare minimum I would recommend a 600, preferably 700W. Great brand though, heard fantastic things about them. Again, I haven't had this issue in several years (because I run a friggin 800W platinum standard PSU), and power consumption has dropped... but I really, really strongly recommend at least 600W.\n\nOn the topic of Windows 10 Home 64-Bit:\nJust quietly, Windows doesn't stop you using their system if you haven't paid for it. No seriously, it's fine - 100% functional and efficient. There's a shitty watermark on the desktop (and I think the background is locked? I dunno, haven't changed mine in a couple of years). 100% do NOT use an activator, and while I'm not advocating piracy, the Windows installer is a free download from the Microsoft site, make a bootable USB (using MS' tool, again, their website - NEVER a third party or torrent, nor your mate who \"totally knows what he's doing and says it's fine\" - we've all got one) and install it. I haven't done this in about a year and a half, so test it on a partition on your current PC before you commit and have no money left - but I haven't heard that it's changed (I own a legit copy myself). I'm not saying steal it, I'm saying if you need to save a few dollars, confirm this, then delay the purchase until later when you have the money :)","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-10-20T04:41:47.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for your helpful reply.
