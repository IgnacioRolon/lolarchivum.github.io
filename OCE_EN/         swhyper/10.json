I have tried right clicking on the ROFL replay file and open with League Of Legends and it did not open nor did anything....Please help. \n\nThis replay is not old as I have just downloaded the replay yesterday. But since I play too many games today, it wasn&#039;t in my match history but it is in my documents folder.\n\nReason why I say \"URGENT\" is because I have heard that each new patch makes the replay unplayable.","replies":[]}
