I haven't played him in a while)_ where you press R mid fight, then immediately Zhonyas for a guaranteed escape.\n\nWith Ryze, once you have your Tear, your can use your Q to last hit minions, as it doesn't drain your mana reserves very much.\nIf you want to clear a wave quickly, use your E on a minion that is low HP to kill it, it will spread to nearby minions, you can then Q any of them to kill all of them. _(you can also use this for poke, if a champion is near a low HP minion)_\n\nIf a champion jumps on you, use your E then your W, then use your Q, that way the snare is longer and you get a movement speed boost and shield as well, for a good escape. If you can, punish them on your way out with as many abilities as you can land.\n\nI like to engage with Ryze in quick bursts, your combo is EWQEQ, then leave! once your snare is down, you are vulnerable. Do as much damage as you can while they are immobile, then get out, rinse and repeat later for a kill.\n\nAs Ryze, you will have trouble with champions like Azir, Xerath, Lux, anyone that can poke you from decent range. Ryze is a mid-short range fighter, but he can out-sustain most mages, so if you do have to fight a long range champ, go ham on them and do it quickly, don't give them the chance to poke you down. Keep moving while attacking and use your speed boost to dodge what skillshots you can, while keeping them immobile and dishing out your machine gun damage.","replies":[{"poster":"macro","date":"2017-05-09T23:46:38.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=KlaoLn1v,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-05-09T12:57:30.618+0000)\n>\n> I like to engage with Ryze in quick bursts, your combo is EWQEQ, then leave! once your snare is down, you are vulnerable.

Since some extremely basic stuff is said I'll explain some things most Ryze players don't know and I've never seen done below Challenger which should be done way more often.\n\nSo pretty much in the absolute early game (pre 6) your goal is to leave the lane as fast as possible to get tear whilst not losing CS. The best way to do this is by abusing your double E as it pretty much out shoves most people early. Focus on pushing your early waves slowely or faster than your enemy. Watch how fast they shove and always try to shove faster or be creeps ahead, you can do this with your E.   It's important you are able to push the last wave that gives you tear gold into the enemy tower so you can deny the enemy from denying you a wave when you base and come back to lane. Count ahead of time how much gold you need. If you ever watch Faker, Bjergsen some of the really good Ryze players you'll see this strategy. Even if you can't execute this perfectly you can just keep practicing. It's important you don't blow Q too many times early as you will oom and mess your wave up. Push slowely with E, use Q when you need to have a bigger wave or out push your enemy. If they are trying to out shove you and know what you're doing they need to use mana too. \n\nSo in the simplest way of saying it. \n1. Start sapphire crystal always and refillable (DON'T BUY 3X POTIONS IT'S USELESS AND INEFFICIENT IF YOU DO THIS STRATEGY PROPERLY)\n2. Focus on wave control early, auto minions to keep the push going \n3. Use your double E to stay ahead with a bigger wave\n4. When pushing the last wave use Q with your 2x E combo\n5. Try to have enough gold for 1x Control Ward and Tear\n\nOther things to note..\n\nAlways watch the side lanes at the start of the game, sometimes at higher elo lanes walk into their lane at the same time to prevent you knowing where the enemy jungler is but at lowers elos this is rarely the case. If you see top walked straight into lane and bot was delayed then you clearly know the jungler started bot. You can then play the opposite side of the lane where the enemy jungler started for the first 30-35 seconds then eventually ward out one side of the bushes and play to that side. It's important you try to get an idea of where the jungler is as you will be aggressively pushing always.\n\nNot only does doing this strategy benefit you it also benefits your team. Your pressuring the enemy mid laner into losing CS and getting a really fast efficient tear. Remember to always take {{summoner:4}} and {{summoner:6}}  or {{summoner:1}} if it's vs Elise and another CC laner. If you're in a sticky situation of potentially getting ganked you can ghost and run the opposite way or flash if it's worst case scenario but never burn 2 summoners unless it's necessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2017-05-09T19:28:53.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh and Lord Sesshomaru explained everything you should know for ryze. I also think that if your snowballing and have a strong lead against your laner then I would just rush an AP item rather than a counter.
