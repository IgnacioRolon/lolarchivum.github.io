Otherwise, some mid laners can snowball very hard and usually my teammates will flame (_'omg that fizz just one shot me, thanks, ori')\n* Roaming becomes more important since your in the 'middle of the map' literally.\n* Pro is, you don't have to rely on a support but it in saying so, you and your jgler would need to in some sense synergize.\n\nThere's probably heaps I haven't covered and some things I've listed above may not be 'correct' but I guess its just my opinion :) \n\nGLHF!! \n\nTldr: you hate auto filled supports? Go mid!","replies":[]}]}
