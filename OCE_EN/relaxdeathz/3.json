Cheapest I've seen a 144Hz monitor (one that can actually display 120fps) is 250.\n\nAnd frankly imo, 120fps isn't worth the tradeoff of havng fuzzy as graphics. You'd be better off aiming for 60fps and medium to high graphics, and even then, you'd be looking at at least 400 dollars.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-11-05T07:36:18.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to go on a limb and say that it's simply not possible. 120+ FPS would require pretty decent hardware, namely a GPU and a CPU, which individually would round out above $200 AUD each.","replies":[]}]}
