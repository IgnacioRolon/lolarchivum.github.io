If you have waveclear you should predict that they are coming mid and push to tower so the ADC can auto. If you're a roaming champ you can go top lane.\n- If you're a safe waveclear champ it's very easy to hold even 3v1 as long as they don't have a more mana efficient waveclear. If you're a champ that's not very safe (like ryze or zed), try to ping jungler and support for help (your own ADC can farm the empty botlane, no need for 2 people wasting time in an empty lane). Even if they're more mana efficient (Vel'koz or Azir will always beat Orianna, Anivia and Xerath in mana for example), if you waveclear 3 times and hold 3 people off for a very long time that's a lot of gold missed out from the fact the ADC and mid have to share while you and your ADC get 1 lane each. This doesn't apply if they have a very strong diving setup like Blitzcrank Ashe Zed. Then ping the hell out of your team tank.\n- If you can roam, roam. Any good roaming champion can 1v1 the jungler (otherwise they're not particularly good roamers) so they have less requirements. Otherwise as an immobile mage you should spend gold on damage or mana depending on what you're lacking to waveclear (Anivia needs  mana, Lux needs damage for example), and shove the wave constantly and then go to the enemy raptors and take those while warding their jungle. By then enemy will have lost a lot of CS or finished CSing under tower and the waves reset or push towards you. Do the same but instead organize something like a gank or dragon with your jungler in chat or pings. Always note your jungler's position, some mages even when ahead can't 1v1 as well but they can 2v2 better than the enemy mid+jg.\n- Generally as a mid laner you ward depending on where your jungler is (since you have to be on the same top/bot side of the map or else you can get caught out very easily), you can ward the enemy jungle aggressively if you know your team can use that information (especially if you have a counter jungler or 1v1 jungler) but sometimes it's better to ward one of the tribushes or river for your top/bot, so top can focus on laning while the support can go for deeper wards without getting caught out.\n- Use TP to get to lane quicker whenever possible. That's probably the sole purpose of TP in mind imo, to get you a gold lead as much as possible. You can do this either from base or *after* roaming, but don't bother using it *for* roaming. The 2-4 seconds you save from TPing as opposed to walking is beaten by the fact you surprise them if the support is responsible and red trinkets the bushes, or the top laner control wards (bonus points if your top laner doesn't destroy a revealed and disabled enemy ward, so when they walk up to auto the control ward they won't see you coming).\n- If bot lane is getting destroyed you can 4 man them and turn it around as a teamfighting mage, though you can ask the top laner if they're tanky, have ranged waveclear or have a whole lot of escapes to swap with bot and farm under tower. In general a fed enemy bot lane is very hard to fix, so there's no safe and clear answer for a fed bot lane. For a fed top lane, a 3v1 gank easily turns things around, or a lane swap. Just be careful and time it so that the jungler is top side if a countergank occurs.\n- AP vs AD isn't really the question people should be asking comp-wise because the answer is fairly obvious (AP if you have lots of AD or your top+jg+support are ALL tanks and the ADC is the only other source of damage, AD if you already have AP elsewhere, etc), but rather carry vs assassin. Carries, even the high burst mages and CC orientated mages are good teamfighters while assassins are good 1v1 champions, and some lie in both (like Yasuo, I think). Its difficult to say, in high elo there's a lot of questions you have to ask like how much CC does the team need vs can you make picks and catch people out, and in low elo you have to ask yourself whether the teams are off doing their own thing (1v1 champions rule in when everyone's running around like headless chicken), or if it devolves into a 5v5 ARAM after a while (carries are the rulers of the clown fiesta)\n- Don't call jungler to gank. I think it's a learning experience to lose lane and learn how to play from that, and the jungler usually has a better grasp on where and when to gank than the laners. There are times you can ask, but you have to actually set it up instead of saying \"jg pls gank\". Be specific like \"I'm going to let him push in and control ward this bush\" *pings* \"can you gank in 2 mins\" (and if they say no then ditch the plan and try again later). I'm not very experienced in setting up ganks though because I naturally just let the wave push in, and I either don't get ganked at all, or get ganked constantly because I'm duo queue with a jungler. (actually, just get a jungler duo queue and you'll be good. Imo good jungler + mid synergy > good support + ADC synergy)","replies":[]},{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-19T16:06:31.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-push with them and dragon if possible\n-defend with your bot or jungler\n-roam\n-depends which of your other lanes are losing\n-tp back after ganking with global ult (galio, tf, taliyah, ryze), or set up a 4 player gank by tp to bot lane","replies":[]}]}
