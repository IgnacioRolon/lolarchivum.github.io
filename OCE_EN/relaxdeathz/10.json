Its not as if they permanently removed your favourite champion from the game or anything. _\"Ruins the game\"_ is either a wild overstatement, or you really need some more hardship in your life..\n\nLike Talon12 says, it'll be gone in a few days.\n\nJust enjoy the Dark Star theme while you can. \nLike the gangplank one, it's probably not coming back for the foreseeable future. \nPlay a few singularity games, pick yourself up a Dark Star skin or icon.\nIts a fun event. Have fun :)\n\nIt'll all be back to it's normal boring self in a couple of days. ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-05-05T12:20:31.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion voice over? Those are not changed unless rework, and besides a couple regrettable losses such as old Taric's most of the new voice overs have been straight upgrades really. But I guess it's up to tastes.
