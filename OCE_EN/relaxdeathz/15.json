I barely see anyone play ryze in solo que i think im the only one playing ryze because sometimes i just feel like playing ryze but when i&#039;m in game i made  a really bad decision this happens to me everytime. \r\nPlaying ryze sucks because of the nerf that riot did with his e and ryze can&#039;t even solo kill someone in lane. ryze ult is nothing ( useless lvl 6 ), no damage all it does in teleport you and most of the time it can lead your team to bad spot. even when you do a full combo using ryze you cant even kill. and as a midlaner you always go for the adc in team fight but on ryze you just can&#039;t because you can only use your ew and if you q they&#039;re just gonna block it . If you e q a tank in team fight and try to kill it first because you cant reach the adc you&#039;re team i just gonna be mad at you for attacking the tank  they&#039;re just gonna be like &quot;gg this mid sucks&quot; &quot;delete the game&quot; &quot;trash&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-10T14:00:02.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahah I just played a game as Ryze because I hadn't seen him in forever and I wanted to see how he performs, turns out his early game damage is horrible and unless he's ahead he barely makes a difference in a team fight.","replies":[]}]}
