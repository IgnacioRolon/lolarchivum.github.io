There needs to be an item that helps deal with that. And so unfortunately the rest of the AD champs suffer because of a few tall poppies.\n\nIf we want Ninja Tabi to be nerfed, we need to get rid of the perma-crit tumors that half our HP with a single auto.\n\nBut nerf it before that happens, and you leave us defenceless against the tide.\n\nThat'd be my view on it.","replies":[{"poster":"ReLaXDeAtHz","date":"2017-05-07T12:44:25.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then just get rid of yasuo's double crit and nerf tabi's","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-08T06:33:37.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yasuo is easy to keep behind and easy to stop getting ahead, yasuo only ** EVER** becomes a pain to deal with when you screw up hard and feed him, letting him get ahead. And he has double crit, because crit is his sustained damage, doesn't do very much without it.\n\nThere is no issue with tabi, it is a niche item that only works well against heavily ad/auto attack based team comps. If you really think about it tabi only blocks ~6% damage which is nothing at all, as most champions get 100 base armour anyway, which is a 50% reduction, and 12% of 50% is only 6%. Lets pretend someone with 400 ad gets a crit on you; it is not even 25 damage, and 25 damage out of 400 ad crit is literally nothing. Tabi is by no means broken, it is just a niche to help people survive in laning phase.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Master Artoria","date":"2017-05-07T14:28:24.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you're saying is a load of crap. There is a reason that Tabi hasn't been nerfed yet and that's cause, amazingly it's not a broken item.  \n\nBut if you wanna talk about stuff like that then let's talk about\nLord Dominik's Regards, an item that ignores 35% of armour and gives up to 20% bonus AD against champions with more (2% of damage of every 100 health) as well as giving 50 AD\n\nOr how about how AD auto attackers are the only class that can use life steal Item to any real efficiency","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-07T08:49:38.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"isnt it 1100?","replies":[]}]}
