However the game which the chat logs are coming from are a game I argue I didn&#039;t even verbally abuse anyone. \r\nSome context for this game is that I was ADC and hard carried, we had a zed who was 1-3 very early in the game. I said to him can you please stop feeding and he then replied with &#039;tell me im feeding one more time and I afk&#039; to which I said &#039;do it&#039; &#039;talk the talk walk the walk&#039; which is not abuse. he went on to feeding intentionally more and afking most of the game, came back at the end when we won because of my carrying. \r\nThe thing I am most annoyed at with this ban is yes I have had past chat restrictions, and yes some games I may say a abusive thing however. After this game ended I can only guess that members of mine and the enemy team reported him and a instant notification came up saying &quot;a punishment has taken please thank you for blah blah&quot;  so obviously the Zed has been reported and punished, however I have now been punished and that is extremely unfair, the Zed obviously reported me out of frustration AND because he was reported and banned I believe that my punishment shouldn&#039;t go through. \r\n\r\nONeill: Minion block Op\r\nONeill: that minion block\r\nONeill: gj\r\nONeill: gk\r\nONeill: fk *\r\nONeill: myb\r\nONeill: ali heal\r\nONeill: lol\r\nONeill: 1-3\r\nONeill: feeding\r\nONeill: yeah he did\r\nONeill: lol\r\nONeill: big tough zed lol\r\nONeill: do it then\r\nONeill: beta\r\nONeill: talk the talk\r\nONeill: walk the walk\r\nONeill: LOL\r\nONeill: he just wrote the most retarded thing in all chat lol\r\nONeill: yeah so report zed please?\r\nONeill: ints, afks then toxic lol\r\nONeill: youre the toxic one zed\r\nONeill: going afk is the most toxi thing to do\r\nONeill: gj\r\nONeill: ffs\r\nONeill: trynd youre being such a useless jungler\r\nONeill: 0 kills or assit\r\nONeill: not even denying tjhe ram\r\nONeill: rq lol\r\nONeill: &quot;tell me im feeding one more time and i afk&quot;\r\nONeill: &#039;teaching a lesson&quot;\r\nONeill: zed actually a moron lol\r\nONeill: ffs you pussies\r\nONeill: get the tower\r\nONeill: then dive\r\nONeill: zeds back from rq\r\nONeill: the lesson of you getting banned:?\r\nONeill: big lesson taught lol\r\nONeill: ^\r\nONeill: leave it\r\nONeill: its ocean\r\nONeill: leave\r\nONeill: it\r\nONeill: dont die for it\r\nONeill: ffs\r\nONeill: not smart\r\nONeill: guys\r\nONeill: wtf\r\nONeill: why not just back\r\nONeill: instead feed 2 kills\r\nONeill: if we win this, itll annoy me, bc zed afks and toxic, then comes back and no punishments\r\nONeill: toxic is going afk you scum\r\nONeill: AHAHHAHAHA\r\nONeill: 2-6\r\nONeill: zed\r\nONeill: fuck off\r\nONeill: go afk\r\nONeill: fk\r\nONeill: just got out of y E\r\nONeill: trnyd dont die\r\nONeill: we need u\r\nONeill: all topp\r\nONeill: top ez isnt a troll pick?\r\nONeill: id rather trnd go 1-6 then not afk and be a little bitch like u zed\r\nONeill: 3-8\r\nONeill: &#039;ill carry u&#039;\r\nONeill: hmm\r\nONeill: wowa bigboy\r\nONeill: 1s\r\nONeill: &quot;(","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-17T07:23:21.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you did say the f-word 5 times (even if you abbreviated it, Riot is not that stupid not to know what those abbreviations mean). You also called someone the b-word. \n\nSo, yes, just on words alone, the ban is justified (considering you have had previous chat restrictions).
