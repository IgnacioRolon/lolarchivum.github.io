Zac for example (Just for clarification I absolutely love Zac and his PP skin) his is literally just blue Zac with shorts and a few animations thrown on top, not too much to ride home about. Renekton has had a PP skin since the dawn of time it would seem and since they are rivals and both share a few skins (Galactic, and it may not be the same but Scorched Earth and Infernal are not so different.) and it would be fitting for them both to share a PP skin together. Even all of his MOVES have potential.\r\n\r\nQ - Rushing water around the tip of the pool noodle.\r\nW - Instead of having locust and purple pestilence it could be a bluish colour with fish instead.\r\nE - Have either a sprinkler like system similar to Graves OR have the ground crack open into a geyser of some kind.\r\nR - Enlarge Nasus, Put his glasses down and possibly give a bigger pool floaty instead of a noodle?\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, I feel like this would be a pretty easy feat and I&#039;m sure people would appreciate it, I know I would definitely buy it.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-11T17:00:25.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only if it looks like that in game lol","replies":[]}]}
