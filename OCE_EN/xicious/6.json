Why are they so damn expensive? It provides an unfair advantage to people who own them vs people who are still buying them.

I've decided to systematically by runes for the champs I like. Top lane duelists are the champs I play the most so I'm gonna focus on getting AD marks first. I still think runes are too expensive but ah well what are you gonna do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-20T21:42:16.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Summoner,\n\nTo put it into perspective. Runes are a way in which players can boost their in-game stats. Runes are like an investment. You have to know what are the best runes for the best price e.g. Yellow Armour instead of Red Armour. To answer your question. Runes are expensive because of the fact I previously stated (that they boost your in-game stats). In all honesty, they are not an unfair advantage over those without runes. Because, at some stage (probably the same stage as you are now) they too would not have had any runes. \n\nThe best way to combat this. \n\nFind the champions in your niche and then, instead of buying more champions afterwards, save your IP to create about 4 (or if you don't want to get more rune pages) just the 2 default rune pages that are best suited (across the board) for your champion pool. Once you have at least 2 solid rune pages for your champion pool you should be fine.\n\nJust an FYI. I have 2 accounts with max rune pages. I have a shen rune page that is worth 22k IP. But now I have nothing to spend IP on so I just blow it on random runes and combinations. LF>IP gifting option.\n\nKind Regards,\nlols =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-11-20T14:30:54.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only really need an AD and AP rune pages. Flat AD runes are cheap. Armour seals are used for both generic pages. You can also use flat or scaling MR runes for both pages as well. Once you complete one page, the other one should be very easy to fill.\n\nLong story short, stop buying champions and start buying runes as soon as level 20.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zastarx","date":"2014-11-20T11:58:30.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look at all the runes as a whole then sure, they look very expensive. You just need to be smart which ones you buy. A full rune page might set you back around 11k IP. 2 rune pages is all you need to start with, an AD and an AP. So ~22k IP for 2 full sets This might sound like a lot but really it is only 3 6300 IP champions.","replies":[]}]}
