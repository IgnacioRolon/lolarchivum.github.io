I had a game where the enemy team absolutely destroyed us, and when it got to the point where our nexus was exposed, they didn't bother attacking it. They could have ended the game right there. Instead, they kept taunting us right outside our base, and when our thresh came up he managed to kill their adc and jungler by hook + flay. We all came up and proceeded to ace them, then pushed for the win. The enemy team was so pissed xD.\n\nThis was in normals, so its not as great as it sounds :P","replies":[{"poster":"Nommable","date":"2015-05-02T08:14:07.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great job!\nEvery win's a win, doesn't matter if it's ranked or bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DRAG0NFEU","date":"2015-05-03T03:47:50.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did the same thing.

(With me on the team, I am amazed if we win....lol as I am a hindrance not a help....lol)\nSo just moving on steals their glory killing, which is no harm.   They know they won well, no need to boost their stats or ego's.\nCongrats on the lucky run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-05-02T07:53:22.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats you got a shot of a intentional feeder troll, now just hope @Riot looks at this and goes.\n\"Lets teach this guy a lesson\"\n\nWell, here is hoping anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-02T07:29:44.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No Luden's on Diana?
