Even assassins like Zed, Talon and Akali have to be somewhat careful about how and when they go into a teamfight but not Katarina. Her massive AOE means that just by headbanging the keyboard Kat will almost always get the reset and be able to e out no matter how bad the engage was. \r\n\r\nI personally think that even if fed Katarina should have to be more careful about how she engages into teamfights. I know I would be kind an ass if I complained about this without proposing a solution. I'm not knowledgeable about champion balancing but here's what I've got.\r\n\r\nDeath Lotus:\r\nIf Katarina gets cc'd out of Death Lotus the cc will have 1.75x duration.\r\n\r\nThis makes so that Katarina can't just engage whenever she wants but will instead have to wait for enemy cc to be burnt. If kat chooses to be ham and engage 1v5 she will potentially be cc'd for several seconds almost guaranteeing her death.  I don't know if this changes would fix her or not as I'm not an expert balancer (or whatever the job is called) but I simply want to propose a nerf to Katarina that won't Olaf her.","replies":[{"poster":"Merciless","date":"2015-03-18T08:44:19.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont see what the point of this is. So long as the players are skilled they should be able to CC the kat, and she should be dying even without this. What this does do, is make it so that even in 1v1s she would lose allot more and have allot less damage potential. In other words, she wouldnt be an Assassin anymore. In the end, it still comes down to the kats skill in avoiding the cc and waiting for good chances to engage vs the other teams skill in stopping/ccing her. So... nothing different from the current.\n\nIt sounds like you've had to fight too many fed kats, in which case I point back to the skill factor. Theres a reason I cant remember a Kat being played in proffesional games. Shes a One Ability Nuke, which channels over time and she cant move during it. In other words, in professional/highly skilled play, shes too open to being countered or shutdown.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mui","date":"2015-03-13T13:32:25.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think either katarina needs to be squishier or talon needs to be buffed.
