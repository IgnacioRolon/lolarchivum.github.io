You can get your old summoner name back. Sadly you'll have to wait through the [Summoner Name Clean Up](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-) immunity, which will take 2 years and 6 months to end for a level 30 account.\n\nI recommend you check the summoner name's availability [here](http://lolnamecheck.jj.ai/) for the exact amount of days remaining until the summoner name is available again.","replies":[]}]}
