The intention is to keep laser focused on considering the icon's context (small and square) when painting.","replies":[{"poster":"EverythingllBeOK","date":"2016-02-01T18:00:36.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Tomblade, thanks for the reply!\n\nYes, I thought it unlikely that the icon is a crop of a splash -- but wouldn't it be awesome if you guys use this as a concept and turn it into a full splash? Maybe to promote ocean week? I know I'd find it quite awesome :D\n\nThanks once again for your warm replies!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EverythingllBeOK","date":"2016-01-23T07:40:40.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This Icon:\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/scale_xlarge/public/upload/summoner_icon_article.jpg?itok=n3R6EyNq\n\nWould make an excellent Fizz art!","replies":[{"poster":"oOo0oOo0oOo0oOo","date":"2016-01-24T02:51:09.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't believe that splash actually exists :| Creating splash art takes a really long time and I'd imagine that one was just done as an icon","replies":[{"poster":"EverythingllBeOK","date":"2016-01-25T03:41:20.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, but it would be awesome.
