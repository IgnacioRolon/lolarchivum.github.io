This wouldn't matter in the slightest.\n\nby logic there's a 50/50 chance of this happening FOR you or AGAINST you. therefore, if you lose 2 matches due to afk's, by logic you have an equal chance of winning 2 matches due to afk's.\n\nWhy this doesn't matter in the long run:\n\n**1. These people are often reported/banned, afk'ing is by far the easiest to detect/punish in LoL, therefore these people are removed fast. **\n\n**2. if you have a 50/50 chance of this happening for/against you, it evens itself out, making it not actually affect you in the long run (In the short run, yes, you're going to get annoyed, hate him, hate riot, ect.. but if you play 100 games, 5 dc's on your team, 5 dc's on the enemy team... it evens itself out like that..)**\n**\n3. You are probably in the level-bracket you should be in, if not, this will just be a small-bump into ranking up.**\n\nto explain this:\n\n_a 50% winrate, means that you're going to steadily climb through ranks (just because of how the ranking system works, it actually allows you to climb with a 50% winrate, which imho is rather generous..)\n\na 60% winrate means you will climb regardless of what happens in 1/2 games, until you are at your skill level (at 60% winrate, you gain more LP and lose less, therefore if you play 10 games, comparatively to a 50% winrate, you'll rank up a lot higher.)_\n\n**4. If they refund you LP for games that people afk/dc... then they'd have to remove LP for the opposite... and this is where the main issue lies..**\n_\nIF: they do refund you LP, but don't remove LP for winning a game against a dc\n\n- This adds a ranking shift, making it ever-so-slightly easier to rank up, and further screws up the ranking system_\n\n\ntl;dr they don't refund in order to keep the ranking system more balanced, if you didn't understand any of the points i was trying to make.... that's because i suck at explaining things, i'll try and explain further if you're confused at anything i said.\n\np.s. Yeah it sucks having Dc's on your team, but think back to all the times you played against dc's/afks... it evens out eventually","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-05-18T10:31:11.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a support main right, the adcs I get you'd wonder if we should legalize euthanasia because they are that ridiculously stupid.\nSo im with you, why should we suffer because people wanna be bat schit retarded?","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-15T22:04:28.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Odds are against you in EVERY game, there's not much you can do about it.
