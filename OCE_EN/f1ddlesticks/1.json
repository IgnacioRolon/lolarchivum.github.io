Who’s strong right now in this game? (Remember all the times you died thinking \"WTF how fed are they!?\")\n3. Maximize gold/second individually and on a team-level(objectives) while minimizing the enemy's gold/second\n4. Ward\n**5. Buy and use pink-wards**\n6. Ward clear\n7. Utilize pings when:\n-\tYou know the location of the enemy jungler\n-\tWhen you are ganking\n-\tWhen an enemy goes MIA from any lane (yes it would help if you called MIA for other lanes)\n8.\tCall out used summoner spells (flash has a 5-minute CD)\n9.\tReact quickly: https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime/ is a good website to practice your clicking speed\n10.\tPrioritize getting to a fight (if you can make it in time) > farming\n11. Don't you dare rage and tilt your team-mates if you have the desire to win\n12. Ward the dragon bushes at 1:20 for SC control/info of enemy jg's position and pathing\n_13.\tUse early advantages, snowball objectives off this\nHowever\n14.\tIf behind, options to come back are:\n- Power farm back into the game (if early game)\n- Make picks(if late game)_\n\n**All Game: More Particular Tips**\n1. Enemies are likely to go back after they push/after achieving an objective\n2. When appropriate, upon ward clear, deceive the enemy as to which way you are going\n3. When in enemy jungle kill (with aa) their jump-buds\n4. Optionally, kill the enemy jg just before their buff comes up so you can steal their buff and put them behind\n5. When trying to freeze a lane, wait until the very last moment (i.e. when the aa of your minion is about to kill the enemy minion) to kill minions\n\n**Early Game**\n1.\tTrack the enemy jungler\n2.\tIf your jungler is losing play safe in the lanes\n3.\tEarly game is about capitilazing (killing, punishing, out-farming them (may include zoning them off farm) denying them farm/gold/camps on the enemy and achieving a gold lead)\n\n\n**Late Game**\nWhen doing baron, if the enemy can contest, have someone distract them\n\n\n**Pre-Game; The Game Begins with your Mentality Going into the Game**\n                                                                \n**Pre-Game: Simply**\n-\tUse /mute all always\n-\tRemove distractions\n-\tHave water ready to drink throughout game\n-\tTake a 5-10 minute break after every game: go for a walk, get a drink, stretch outside\n\n**Pre-Game: Mentality**\n1.\tFocus on your own gameplay, not your team-mates\n2.\tExpect your team to feed\n3.\tFocus\n4.\tDon’t lose your temper\n\n**Pre-Game: Strategy**\n-\tThink lane matchups, jungle 2v2 gank matchups, 5v5 matchups, think of how matchups play out\n-\tThink does your team have: \n1.\tHigh/low DPS (damage-per-second) as a strength/weakness?\n2.\tHigh/low sustain/tankiness as a strength/weakness?\n3.\tHigh/low CC as a strength/weakness?\n4.\tEngage tools (cc/gap close)or lack-of as a strength/weakness? \n5.\tWombo-combo ability or lack-of as a strength/weakness?\n6.\tCombining your team’s: gap-close, DPS and CC ability, is your team strong at making picks (picking-off enemies) as a strength/weakness?\n**-\tUnderstand your TEAM’S (don’t think individually, this is a team game) win condition based on your strengths and weaknesses**\n\n**Playing Jungle**\n<<<1.>>> Primarily protect your laners! \n--> Ward jg entries/exit points(helps track the enemy jungler and predict their ganks)\n--> Get scuttle crabs \n--> Ping danger when they're getting ganked\n--> Call MIA for all lanes\n--> Counter-gank, counter-ganking is the best use of your time i.e. of highest priority) \n<<2.>> Maximizing gold/second\n-\tGromp + blue together\n-\tEfficient jungle routing: e.g. buffopposite side Scuttle Crab, other buff\n-\tMove towards next camp slightly while doing camp\n-       Out-path your opposing jungler for the purpose of maximizing gold/second (think of their living camps as a part of your jungle path)\n<<3.>> Ask if lanes are warded prior to ganking\n<<4.>> Beware of counter-ganks, anticipate the possibility (which spots can the enemy jungler be waiting/hiding) and be prepared in your mind to win that 2v2 or 3v3\n<<5.>> Use F2,F3,F4 constantly while: moving between camps and farming the jungle to check the lanes\n-->the enemy just used their escape (e.g. zed w), I may be able to gank them!\n-->bot is about to get ganked and I'm top, I can get rift herald, or if I can kill top we'll kill-->turret otherwise if we can't turret we'll rift after the kill. If you can't kill top and rift-herald isn't up then counter-jungle top-side or gank mid\n<<6.>> Before ganking bot, check if bot laner has a pink, if he does, tell him to use it in-your-route/hiding-brush\n<7.> Kite monsters in jungle\n<8.> Don't AFK farm\nIn high elo when you’re vsing a good jungler you’re probably going to see them early game\n<9.> Be-careful when counter-jungling, think of how you are going to escape\n\n\nFinally, never surrender.\n\n\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"lordsky","date":"2018-10-26T00:45:54.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add these in:\n\n- wave manipulation\n- back timings \n- jungle objectives are objectives\n- trading \n\nfor depth","replies":[]}]}
