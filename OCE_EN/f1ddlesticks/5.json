If you are last pick and you so far have a team that is poke heavy OR situation 2 you have a team that is good at teamfights, what do you go for in each situation, a more of a poke champion or a team-fight based champion? Do you need a diverse team with pokers, teamfighters, ect. or is it best to  have a team that specializes in one or the other? I&#039;d appreciate anything that gets me closer to my answer..","replies":[]}
