I noticed that he is generally an unpopular champion. I think there should be a very small change to twisted fate. The first card that appears when twisted fate presses w should be his blue when you first use w, the second time w is used red card should appear first, and the third time w is used the gold card should appear first. This will give the more experienced twisted fate player's more credit as they will have greater control with twisted fate and will also make him a more viable champion.","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-28T10:19:26.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I noticed that he isn't a very popular champion in high ranks\"\n\nI lelled a little bit at this.","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-08-24T07:16:44.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.\n\nTwisted Fate is a moderately popular pick in higher levels of play, particularly in pick compositions and against mage mids. \n\nWhile his base stats suggest that he is an immobile mage the most popular builds negate this , obtaining constant speeds of up to 470 and allowing more than enough breathing room to pick the best card for the situation.\n\nGood Twisted Fate players know where to position to maximize their impact.\n\nEmploying this mechanic would also take away from his luck based theme, sometimes you'll get the right card and others you won't,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Last Breath","date":"2015-08-11T22:46:10.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"twisted fate is can define in both positive and negative outcomes, i suggest if you main him then it would be best if you have the abilities and knowledge to outsmart players who don't know how to counter him besides he is a cool champion no doubt about that.","replies":[]}]}
