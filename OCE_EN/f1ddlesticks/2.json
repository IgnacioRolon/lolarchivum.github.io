Meaning 924 magic damage from w(passive)-q-e-w. Ignoring electrocute and other runes. This ends up giving 120 extra damage, so... umm... did not expect that... I guess lich bane isn't half bad?\n\nI thought I remembered some pro player talking about how powerful an early void staff is but I guess I should have thought more about it, rather than blindly following advice.\n\nI have no clue what I'm talking about, but I again realise why I'm bronze.\nSomething this math has made me think about was how about investigating haunting guise for early tankiness since at 1 item, 15 magic pen is pretty good for the gold cost, and then move on to protobelt and other items?","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-16T16:20:38.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess they get early void because of the old runes?

The exception is where I am against an ad mid-laner like zed, yasuo or talon and will then rush zhonyas. \n\nSo you think lich bane is would be a good snowball item on fizz? Or in what situations and how early would you get lich bane on fizz? Considering the +7% movement speed it gives you for ganking and assassinating as well as the sustain it gives you due to the +250 mana.","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-17T04:02:53.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol you are talking to the wrong person if you want specific comments or suggestions on fizz.  I can only say statistically the main stream build is either lich then proto or proto then lich. (not considering speciall occasions where u need to rush zhonya/zhonya parts).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
