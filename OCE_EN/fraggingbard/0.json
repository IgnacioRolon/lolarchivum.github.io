He can literally dive turrets and not take a hit.\r\n\r\nYou think silence is bad? Fizz hard counters *turrets*. Or Zed? Zed can dodge all of Ezreal's skillshots, and with all the mobility these days champions like Ashe are kinda hard to play. And by hard I mean she's basically the ranged version of Talon, she has an initiation which denies counterplay and either kills the target or dies because she's not getting away and she's got an increasingly worse chance of being able to kite them. Mentioning mobility creep here tends to go over like a dead cat at an RSPCA convention, but compare, say, Talon to Zed? Veigar to Lissandra?\r\n\r\nFor the sake of argument let's pretend mobility isn't a hard counter to kite focused champions and move on to something everyone can agree with. Fiddlesticks for instance. He has a 2.25s fear, yet a 1s silence is overkill? Really? I can be feared into an opponents turret if I run the wrong way, at least with silence I get to keep running towards my team. Or Soraka? Nice rework, except now she has an *AoE silence*. I appreciate consistency but this isn't it. Or Yasuo? He can hard counter how many ults? And he can do it every 18s... Ignoring how he also has a knockup and can have 100% crit from two items then build tanky making him hard to kill and yet still able to two shot a lot of carries. As opposed to Talon who can dive the enemy team and take one person out, but he won't be getting anyone else.\r\n\r\nBut we're forgetting stuns. Stuns, stuns, stuns everywhere. Brand for instance. Brand has a 2s stun. Why is that acceptable yet a 1s silence not? Annie's is 1.75s and that's an AoE nuke which can kill people straight up. Granted, that's using her ult, but it still goes for .75s longer, is an AoE on two out of three of her skills, and late game does upwards of 800 damage on two out of three of her skills. One of them being a large AoE, the other being a conal AoE. There's a reason she's still viable today and it's not because she's adorable, it's because she can stun entire teams and leave them like that for almost two seconds. Talon can pick out one carry and kill them, he can't lockdown an entire team and possibly kill two of them.\r\n\r\nAnd if you use the argument \"Well it's changed since those champions were introduced\", Kalista's ult grants a 1.5s AoE knockup as well as being a short range teleport which makes the target untargetable, Azir's E can knock up an enemy for .5s while he stays at range, Gnar's W is an AoE 1.25s stun... That's the last three champions, all of whom have harder counters than a silence. If we keep going, Braum has a 1.75s stun on his passive as well. This one needs to be stacked on the champion instead which makes it much harder to trigger.\r\n\r\nSaid no Lucian ever.\r\n\r\nAnd of course Braum's ult is also a knockup, 1.5s in the impact area, .25s around it. Vel'Koz has a .75 knockup on his E, we've deal with Yasuo, Jinx has no hard CC, neither does Lucian, after those it goes Aatrox, Lissandra, Zac, skips Quinn, then Thresh, Vi, Nami. That's twelve out of the last fifteen champions with a form of CC that's harder than a silence.\r\n\r\nHard counters still exist, it's just that silence for some reason cops flak more than a stun does because... Maybe people feel more helpless being able to run as opposed to a stun, where they can just accept their fate? If that's the case then there's a perception problem, not a balance problem and nerfing Talon's only saving grace (Because it sure as hell wasn't his early game) isn't the answer; especially when a silence only affects a specific subset of the champion types. Autoattack champions exist and they have absolutely no problem with being silenced.\r\n\r\nI learned that lesson when I first played Talon and jumped onto a Tryndamere. Talon might be powerful against Veigar but that in no way makes him powerful against an autoattacker who can live through Talon's burst. Yasuo with his Randuin's for instance.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nA Talon/Annie/Ashe/Fiddlesticks player. \r\n\r\n**tl;dr**\r\n\r\nI could play Zed/Lissandra/Vayne/Fizz but my champions are a very specific type which fit both the way I like to play and my desire to match up against other players as opposed to seeing how many times I can get the last hit in on the first three hundred minions.\r\n\r\nThey go in, and they either kill the opposing champion or they die. There is no halfway good Talon, you can either play Talon well enough to survive his early/mid game to scrape out a few kills and dive the Annie to kill her so she can't stun your team or you can't. Unless you started playing today, in which case you can't but that's because he now has a .25s slow on his E while Annie has an AoE 1.75s stun which is probably capable of straight up killing you.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not OP at all.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2014-11-26T21:44:06.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Talon - The Destroyer of Worlds\n> > Deals 10% more aa dmg to champs that are CC'd\n> > Q deals extra dmg on hit and applies a DoT that has a 1 to 1 ad ratio \n> > W slows and has crazy base dmg if hit twice by it\n> > E blinks him behind a target, slows and AMPLIFIES HIS DMG TO THAT TARGET \n> > Ult makes him invis + 40% movement speed and does aoe dmg\n\nHis kit is already pretty dumb, be grateful that they didn't remove his DoT and lower his base defensive stats to truly make him balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Eavsy","date":"2015-03-21T13:55:06.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"talons passive is trash since his an aoe caster and will only aa twice in a combo most of the time, his w doesn't do that much dmg unless you forget to buy armor, his e has a long cd and cant be used as an escape once you go in and the dmg amplification is really weak till you level it up witch wont be till late game, and his ult  is half countered by a simple pink ward or someone like lee sin who can reveal invisible units, his kit is fine people just need to adapt their builds instead of religiously  building the same items every game just because 'it worked last time' like when your talon vs malzahar and don't build a qss first or go vs any decent mage and completely forget about the maw","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-26T15:44:37.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Talons just need to roam more in laning phase.
