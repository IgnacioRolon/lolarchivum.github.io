(And finally transferred from US to Oceanic, the ping difference omg!)\r\n\r\nLooking for someone fun/chill to climb the ladder with as the grind gets boring alone. Please do note, I&#039;m very rusty so I need someone who can handle the inevitable losses in a mature way, while I regain my skills. I can&#039;t guarantee a quick climb, but I can guarantee I never rage, actually ENJOY the game and will always try my damndest to win games.\r\n\r\nI live in Australia (Sydney) and play on most evenings and lots on weekends. If interested please PM me and I will reply with my summoner name. Thank you!\r\n\r\nIGN: Excalipooper","replies":[{"poster":"Pagoe","date":"2015-08-06T08:19:08.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gold, mid main - Pagoe","replies":[]},{"poster":"lotusGOD","date":"2015-08-03T02:07:00.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xiionic1 - ADC main, gold - plat","replies":[]}]}
