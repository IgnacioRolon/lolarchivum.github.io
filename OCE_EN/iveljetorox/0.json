You can use its free license to just clean, and it's pretty good at finding things that are out of order.\n\nHave you tried running the game in admin mode? You can setup a shortcut to always open League to avoid any problems like this in the future, that is if that is the cause of your problem.\n\nAbove all, though, make sure your Windows and its graphics drivers are up to date. Riot always presume you have the latest.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Iveljetorox","date":"2015-03-17T04:17:35.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I usually do all of that on a regular basis, as to my issue it seems to have resolved itself as per usual so I am fine for now, thankyou","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-18T11:19:17.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not really resolved then, per se.\n\nBut if it's just mysteriously, consistently working know, I guess there's not much to be done.\n\nGood fortune!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Saintphoenix","date":"2015-03-13T10:51:40.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My game does that too, once i press i play, but what i do is open it a few times in a row, and eventually it lets me on, a thing pops up saying another instance of lol is running just click ok, rinse n repeat till it works, sometimes its 4 or 5 times for me","replies":[{"poster":"Iveljetorox","date":"2015-03-13T21:48:56.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try this all the time and it never works, but I will do it consecutively to see if it makes a difference, thankyou","replies":[]}]}]}
