It&#039;s just a black square. I remember seeing some error popping up about not copying to a path correctly or something. I should&#039;ve screenshotted it but it didn&#039;t occur to me at the time. I just dismissed it instantly. Anyone else having this problem or is it just me? Any way to fix it?\r\n\r\np.s: I can select them and then preview the playlist and it shows up but it&#039;s annoying not knowing what I&#039;m selecting initially.\r\n\r\n\r\nI honestly hope that I can get some help on this because it is really bugging me right now","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-04T01:13:26.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try re-installing the tool and then re-opening the settings to allow all the files to redownload correctly.\n\nDoes an error appear?
