I updated my display adapter driver, and there was no longer any blue screen of death, and the game become less laggy.\nYou may want to defragment your hard drive as well, this may help the game to run smoothly.\nAt the end the old client will no longer be available anyway, so perform these fixes instead of going back to the old client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trickster","date":"2017-04-12T11:29:01.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On login, Click Region : NA and then it will come back to Login screen, Click Legacy Version and Click OCE it will pop up saying Get Alpha Client..
