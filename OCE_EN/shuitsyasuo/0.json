At a guess, this case was reviewed by the automated system, which identified the term \"kys\" and didn't properly understand the context. I'd recommend submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), who will forward it to the Player Behaviour team for a manual review. Ideally that will end with them realising the system made a mistake and revoking the suspension, though keep in mind that appeals are the \"final decision\" on punishments.","replies":[]}]}
