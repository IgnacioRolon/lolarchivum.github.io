Having a jungler is sub optimal in this mode and it&#039;s only the casuals that don&#039;t realise this , whats worse is when you&#039;re diamond you&#039;re forced to wait 3-20 minutes and still getting unranked - chal players because the ques trash anyway !! , why can&#039;t we premade with players that want to win to and actually take this mode seriously ?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know whats the best part though ... Vsing 3 man premades when you&#039;re forced to solo and have 2 monkeys that are unranked -gold on your team doing happy laps and inting on the map  ^_^\r\n\r\n\r\nDo the ENTIRE 3v3 population a huge favor and revert that horrible decision you made so we can actually play our game , also **bring back the que on Thursdays and Fridays too **, People have lives and most of the time they go out on the weekends causing the que health to go down even more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the bronze and silvers about to flame in the thread ...  on behalf of diamond + players we don&#039;t want to play with you either :)","replies":[{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-11T09:46:32.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Remove support meta first.

It's too hard for people to play morg bot max w with a materializer and not int ... they'd rather play yasuo or camille and afk shove endlessly and die over and over .\n\nThis ALWAYS happens too , it's not like a 1 off thing either\n\n\nPlaying meta isn't boring  , you're literally out rotating the other team  thinking of ways you can starve the enemies gold supply, with jungle it's literally clear 3 camps hey look i don't have camps for x amount of time lets go pay bot a visit .. oh that didn't work ? my camps are still down lets try gank them again ... \n\n\nWhy should players under diamond only be able to premade ? , If we're being 100% honest NOBODY is playing anymore since Gehirn killed the mode.\n\nAll the diamonds are playing 1 game a month , all the masters and chals are playing decays and we're all logging smurfs from bronze - plat and ruining  your lives anyway with little to no  que wait either ... \n\nThe diamond player shouldn't be forced to play non meta, just because someone who's gold feels they don't want to ... Do that in summoners rift and you get banned ( points to support singed with smite )\n\nDiamond + is ALL of the ques population , anyone else is a casual player that plays 1-10 games and leaves , 9/10 the people you see in bronze - plat playing meta are the diamond +'s on smurfs.\n\nthis que's literally dead to everyone who enjoyed it , cherry ontop we only get to play it on weekends ...???? Because people don't have things like lives to live on a weekend","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"L9 DEFORMED ARAB","date":"2018-06-09T11:14:15.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if your sick of losing just win LOOOOOOOOOOL {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{champion:48}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{summoner:13}} {{summoner:1}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
