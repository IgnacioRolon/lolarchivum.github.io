People still aren't interested in watching you 1v1 people as zed in normals. Here's some more constructive feedback for you.\n\nOveralll your editting is pretty high quality. I like that aspect, but the plays you're highlighting are not exciting.\n\n1st kill, 2v1 double kil early lvl vs a teemo and zyra... in a normal game... who cares?\n2nd kill - ulting the zyra thats already behind 1v1...who cares?\n3rd kill - ult the same zyra again (She's now 2 lvls behind) 1v1 ... who cares?\n4th kill - ulted a lvl 6 jungle teemo as lvl 9 zed .. really who cares?\n5th kill - another 1v1 ult on zyra\n6th kill - another 1v1 on teemo, this time you didn't ult! You were lvl 11 him lvl 7 ... he nearly killed you\nINTERLUDE showing 101K points for zed\n7th kill - simple 1v1 vs underlvld teemo\n8th kill - a 1v1 vs Zyra, you're fed and ahead, with ult and hp but you barely get away with your life, and thats only because Zyra didn't shoot you with her spike thing. Embarrassing.\n9th kill - finally what appears to be a ranked game, but its just a 1v1 vs yasuo.\n10th Kill - for something different you've ulted and killed Yas 1v1..... wow the plays are so stronk!\n11th kill - music change for the 1v1 ez, but thats ok cos its only the intro to the chase scene - +1 this was actually funny and fun to watch. GW.\n12th kill - the kill on Xin while they take your nexus and you lose the game. - at least you didn't show only wins....\n\n\nTLDR - one normal game of you killing the same two scrubs over and over, one ranked game showing 1v1 plays, an escape and your loss.\n\nGreat editting, bad plays, montage the shit out of some triple kills and pentas etc.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkDerma","date":"2016-03-10T06:49:24.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen high elo montages where they put simple kills but if thats the problem then I can put Much better plays just watch out for my Lee Sin montage. Also my first zed montage features a couple of triple kills and outplays so you can watch that here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEnWVUq5-V0\nWhat you said first wasnt really constructive but ur second comment was valid enough for me to take seriously so thanks for the feedback :)\np.s the kill on xin... we won that :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-08T07:53:47.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are in BRONZE 5.\n\nOk?\n\nIt makes YOU look bad if you hate comment it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-07T10:16:52.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> even then you're still just silver\n\nComing from B5, ok.","replies":[]}]}]}
