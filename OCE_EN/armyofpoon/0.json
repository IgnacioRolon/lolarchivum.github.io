Yet another lose for something I could do nothing about. They really need to do something to stop shit happening that makes a lose that is not your fault.","replies":[{"poster":"ArmyOfPoon","date":"2016-01-26T07:17:58.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even thats not a bad idea. just something to stop people loading prior. get everyone to have to click a button to test before queing, if its shit they cant queue","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-01-26T08:10:38.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ANYTHING is better than the current crop of shit I am facing. What we really need is to implement a system that gives LP based on your personal play. I decided last game to go support, something different, Vayne in the meantime won't stop farming for CS and was behind all game, when players ganked our lane, she farmed CS. When someone tanked the tower, she farmed CS.\n\nFunny though, she was behind all game in CS. There is no way we can stop these players playing, Riot will always let anyone join, but we need a system that puts the shit with the shit, not just a win lose situation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
