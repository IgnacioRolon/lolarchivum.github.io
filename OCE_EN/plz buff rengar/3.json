If you are gone too long too often, you will have to work through the low priority queue like everyone else. If you don't deserve it then you won't get any more because you don't leave any games. Otherwise, you're going to get more penalties next time. If you have recurring issues then you need to get them fixed before you queue up. Riot will not remove the penalties regardless of your reason, because it is ruining the match for other players no matter why it happened.\n\nFor more information on Leaver Buster, read here; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
