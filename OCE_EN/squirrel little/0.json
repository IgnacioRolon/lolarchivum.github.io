I think his gimmick is chasing, that huge close range healing, the lockdown and his simplicity. I don't want him to lose this identity but I feel he could be updated a bit. Such as making his e an active ability rather than a passive and buffing the movespeed so that he can only activate it when a nearby enemy is low hp and then he can activate his hunt for like 110 mana revealing them and granting alot of movespeed but only towards the hunted target. Improving his q animation and whilst we're at it, at 2.5 atk speed warwick's animation gets buggy. I feel his ult might want to be changed too since it's cool that he has cc but the point and click nature of it makes it really annoying for someone like say vayne.\nI feel rework warwick should keep his passive, basically the same q maybe turn it into a aa buffer where the next aa heals him like his old q did. W should stay attack speed cause it's useful in a teamfight and I quite like it for rushing objectives like towers, dragons, and baron (warwick's specialty). New e grants alot of movespeed and his ult's range should be shortened and made into like a nidalee pounce that then surpresses the enemy like old warwick did, giving a little more counterplay and skill required to choose when to use it, reduce the cooldown since it's a bit weaker and shorter ranged requiring him to put himself in a little more danger and then done. Alot of small changes to make a warwick that's basically the same but less of his gameplay issues and slightly more skillcap whilst still being beginner friendly (I feel rework warwick won't be beginner friendly for new jungle mains and that makes me sad).","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-09-12T08:20:13.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point and click is great, since its one of the only ways to kill Vayne and the only useful thing about WW\n\nBut yes I agree he is a very \"niche\" champ and it is objective control. He sucks at teamfights bar his ult, and while he can duel well i feel that Executioner's Calling counters him really bad. He can get kited easily even when his W is active. \n\nIn general, he just needs to be dusted off and updated to the current standards of LoL. Back then, sure, it would pass as a 1st 40  but now with all the new tools in champ's kits, he needs to catch up.","replies":[]}]}]}
