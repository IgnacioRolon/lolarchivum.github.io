The tooltip read It should heal for 160 + whatever the multiplier is for missing health. \n\nOnly ended up healing around 100hp.\n\nThis didn&#039;t change after buying a spirit visage either. The heal wasn&#039;t taking into account the full base value (110) or any of the items I was buying. \n\nI&#039;m way too tired to look into it but could a Rioter get onto it pronto? Sona is my favourite waifu\n\nI should note the heal was working fine on myself, just not on others. It didn't matter who I healed either, this effect happened the same on all my team.","replies":[]}
