IGN: QuackCocaine\n\nSo here's the thing, I have some people I know (a couple challengers) who asked me if I wanted to play in their team however I'm not totally sure if they will end up getting a full roster together so I'm looking around just in case. (I know that's kind of a 'on-the-fence' position). Anyway, if you want to add me and play a couple of games or whatever. Like, even if we don't end up playing together for this tournament, it doesn't hurt anyone right?","replies":[{"poster":"Redcoat","date":"2015-07-23T12:10:32.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah no worries.
