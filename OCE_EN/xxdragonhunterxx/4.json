You'll miss out on a lot of gold for killing the large mods in the camps. I follow these 2 routes, it depends on wether you're tanky (slower attack speed, more health and sustain, less autos) or assassin (lots of autos, low sustain, squishy).\n\nTanky route is: Leash on Gromp, smite as soon as he spawns. Move to wolves, kill them, pop a potion if need be, save smite. Move to red, smite red only when you get down to your last box, go all out with abilities here. Return to base, pick up Machete T2 (I like to go Skirmishers because I find a lot of JG's lack the gapclosers necessary to gank), buy a pot, the other camps are now easier so kill them until you're ready to gank, this varies on champ by champ bassis.\n\nAssassin route is: Leash on golems, fight red, use both potions if need be, go all out as you want this dead and to be at least over 25% hp. Now go fight chickens if you're 25-40%, or move to wolves and then base with 450~ish gold. Continue as above until you're ready to gank.\n\nOnce you hit gank phase it's important to NOT GO TO GANK IF IT'S NOT READY. Ganks are ready when the opponent is pushing your teams lane, or is low enough to score a quick towerdive. DO NOT go for a gank on an opponent at full hp that is in middle of lane by yourself or without some form of CC handy, as they can often just blow a gap closer in their QWER kit, and you've wasted your mana/time. Communicate, ping that you are on your way, and let your team know to go in when you ping the target. If your team is pushing their lanes, kill Rift Scuttlers, ward river bushes, watch for enemy ganks and stop them if you can. Otherwise, keep farming as you do nothing by wasting 30 seconds walking to bot lane to gank Graves when he can just W and e away, even Q'ing you for 25% of your hp and leaving you vulnerable as you go back to river.\n\nIf you go to gank, and they flash away, you MAY take some minions as a \"gank tax\". This is a common practice, but communicate that you will do this while you're all moving to lanes. Nobody likes to lose CS for no real reason. A blown flash/ghost/heal/exhaust is a successful gank. A kill for you is a better gank, and a kill for your lane is an EXCELLENT gank. You dying is a bad gank.\n\nFinally, fight dragon around level 5-6. By this time you should have finished your enchant, and should have at least a {{item:1053}}, or enough sustain. Ping for assist from your bot lane if need be, but I like to solo dragon ({{champion:254}} and {{champion:19}} jungle 4 lyfe) as the fact that you're a jungler hides your position from the enemy team. Smite the Chickens on your way, so that you can check for wards. If you're clear, smash dragon, as almost NOBODY outside of Gold+ goes for dragon until 20+min. It's silly, but it's true. Early dragons give your bot and top lanes a decent power spike, and it puts the enemy team on the back foot. Always hold a lane if you can when your laners leave for base. Nothing worse than being ahead 20-5 and having lost because you didn't defend towers.","replies":[{"poster":"Snek boi","date":"2015-05-06T04:19:49.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at lvl 14 i understand why you solo dragon, but if you're in high elo (gold +) people ward dragon pit. If you want to get dragon by lvl 5-6 make sure you get a gank off bot for a double kill or at least a back so they cant compete.","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-05-06T04:44:26.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why it shows that i'm level 14, but here's a little attachment showing i'm max level. \n\nI jungle often, I know what i'm doing most of the time, and what I said still stands true. Nobody below gold wards or even fights dragon before 20 min mark, and if you smite chicken or take scan trinket, you can ensure that you can get away with a solo drag kill, and at the 13-14 min mark (i'm pretty sure that's the time drag spawns, I could be wrong), it's a pretty decent power spike for your lanes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-05-05T09:34:09.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Gank shit, don't feed, buy a ward.\" - Sky Williams","replies":[{"poster":"8000000","date":"2015-05-05T21:17:43.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHHAHAHA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XxDragonHunterXx","date":"2015-05-07T07:28:35.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a lot guys!\nBy the way, I main Hecarim. {{champion:120}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Snek boi","date":"2015-05-06T04:16:48.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"main {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-05T12:34:38.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/user/foxdropLoL/featured","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-05-05T12:08:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try and clear the buffs on your first plow through the jg, if you can clear all 6 camps that's great. after that buy towards your first jg item, buying the full machete before anything else is ideal as you get more gold for clearing and your healing stats and dps is also increased. \n\nYou may also want to try clear from bot lane up to top then gank after clearing to buff near top lane to try get first blood.\n\nClearing either gromp/krugs first depending on your team (krug for blue gromp for blue) to gain that fist level to help vs the buff, this also gets your allys to lane faster. Gromp blue red gank top is effective route for red team as you can smite the bramble back to heal before you gank, this also gives you slow increasing chances of success. This is the same but opposite for bleu team. You want to be clearing Gromp/Krug then both buffs to get the max xp out of your first jg run as xp is reduced per lvl compared to the jg, so going gromp blue wolves red will actualy get you 6% less xp in the long run.\n\nWhen your level is sufficient try to do drag as early as possible, enemies rarely expect this as most players am for dram around 13 min. Amumu, Yi, Vi, Fiddle sticks and sej can do this around lv 3-4 (advise 4-5) and most other junglers around the lvl 6 mark, this gives you approx. 2 min 23 seconds head start advantage. \n\nif you are not going to focus ganking pre 6 buy Ranger Trail blazer ({{item:3713}} to help with your camp clear, this item is also very very effective for early drag clear. I usually swp out trail blazer if I turn to ganking afterwards. But there are a few champs that its better to keep it on, such as maokai being a great example. He has plenty enough heavy cc and heavy slows to not need it, but his jg sustain is pretty slow and he runs out of mana very fast, taking trail blazer on him is ideal to keep him healthy for his ganks (which should be quite often on such a ccc heavy champ). But there are some champs like amumu who you need the mana on really early, having high costs but a low pool make him reliant on trail blazer early, unless you are game enough to get a chalice (which I sometimes do because its fun on him) then by all means go Stalkers blade; cinderhulk ({{item:3709}} ) and a chalice, that's one annoying doll I tell you. \n\nYou should be able to have 2 stacks by the time you end up back at drag after a full run of the 6 jg camps, allowing you to enter with a smite on drag (only if you can confirm enemy jg is not in southern jg) and then t finish it with another smite, this amounts to about 900+ damage for early clear, if you can also get an ally from bot to help for even faster eradication of the drag, either to pretend to back and double back around to drag or to detour from their already backed position and to come help before returning to lane.\n\nAfter drag it is priority to start giving heavy lane pressure via ganks, this is most usually most successfully achieved at level 6, I advise to get stalkers blade ({{item:3706}} ) for ganking costing a low (225) gold to exchange at level 6 allowing your ganks to be more successful more, often.\n\nIf I can think of anything else to help you ill be sure to add it ;)\n\n____\n\nIll put my mumu build when im bored and looking for fun. \n{{item:3709}} {{item:3174}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3143}}{{item:3110}} and if you want you can swap {{item:3143}}  with {{item:3001}} depending on their ap/ad team if they have 2/3 bursty ap id swap for the abyssal  scepter  Because its fun ^^. I know it looks stupid, but it is really fun if you can land your q. But taking the {{item:3001}}  will reduces your hp to 2600 exact (with scars and juggernaut masteries) from about 3176, but your armor/magic resist will be around 312/197. But on the other hand with {{item:3143}}  your armor/mr is closer to 400/120. Still 100% fun. Your Bandage Toss CD drops to Urf Amumu CD :P I love it.\n\n\nKK well hope the tips (not the garble bout fun doll builds, but nice if that helped 2) helped","replies":[]}]}
