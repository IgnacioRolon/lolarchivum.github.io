Why should anyone want to spend 40+ minutes on a game just to have a player who has a habit of leaving games just to lose? If you have issues then I suggest playing during hours of which issues rarely occur. If this still constant happens then this game might not be the game for you. Sorry but ya. Gotta think about the others who play rather than you. Don't get me wrong it's always family > games but if riot takes it easy on these types of afk'rs then it'll just be abused.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxDragonHunterXx","date":"2014-12-12T09:41:56.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Please respond!\nI really want to know more about LeaverBuster.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2014-12-12T10:03:59.963+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XxDragonHunterXx,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MYjkiysP,comment-id=,timestamp=2014-12-12T09:41:17.544+0000)\n**> I left loads of games \n**\n**> I left loads of games \n**\n**> I left loads of games \n**\n**> I left loads of games \n**\n\nMaybe think about other players and any IRL events before you play?
