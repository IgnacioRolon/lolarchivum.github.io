Chances are you will be placed in bronze. If you are lucky and very good you might get silver. I recommend playing soloq over playing with a friend because when you play duoq two things happen. 1. The system automatically gives you worse teammates than the enemy to compensate for the fact that your duo'd, because you have the advantage of communication. 2. You will often both gang up on team mates and 'coddle' each other and blame the rest of the team even if it you made this mistake. When this happens your skill level decreases rather than increases. I would only recommend duo'ing when you are above silver 3 so you can some what use it to your advantage and coordinate with each other.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tilterella","date":"2015-06-11T09:17:22.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pray to the league gods, and do it soloq.
