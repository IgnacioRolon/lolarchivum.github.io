Within the past three to four years, the emphasis on coaching and analyzing has increased significantly in League of Legends. Through Season 3-7, each team had an in-game leader, and players discussed picks and bans among each other. Now, professional teams all over the world look for coaches and analysts to help support the players and teach them to make the correct in-game decisions. It&rsquo;s not easy, and my own path has been littered with plenty of ups, downs and confusion, but it&rsquo;s one of the most rewarding experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had. I learned to be much more flexible when predicting picks and strategies to employ, and to always have multiple backup plans ready. Watching League games is something I absolutely love to do, specially the Korean and Chinese proscene. Watching the top Korean teams duke it out is, to me, much like watching a high level game of blitz chess with a 0 timer. All champions, and game mechanics, are restricted to a predetermined set of rules and moves as such. But if you play it right you can play it beyond the moves your opponent can comprehend and respond to fast enough. Watching teams like SKT T1 K play vs KT Bullets isnt as much a game of which one (Faker or Insec) can pull the most flashy moves, but rather which team can out think the other in the grand scheme of things. \r\n\r\nDifferent regions and their respective styles tells alot about what kind of teams and players they have. It is always interesting to see how another region thinks the game should be played, and trying to figure out why. To quote Madlife: &quot;Just because a team plays in a different way from us is no reason to think &quot;that&#039;s the wrong way to play&quot;&quot;. If the game ever becomes sterelized to only one way of playing things have gone wrong somewhere. I currently believe that OCE lacks this, but with me I can bring a whole no aspect to league of legends meta game.  \r\n\r\nThere are numerous things that a game analyst can do, and it definitely isn&#039;t a specific job, it depends on the team&#039;s needs. During my time with random organisations and alot of solo q players I have extensively taken care of noting all relevant data from scrims and matches, and analyzing it in whatever method I see fit or is requested. This includes basic data as far as KDA, Pick &amp; Ban phase, GPM and goes deeper as far as preferred moves, looking for patterns exhibited by players and so on. This covers both teams of course, your own and the opponent it faces, because you need to look at ways to help your team improve if it has problems in specific scenarios or versus a certain type of opponent (i.e. an early aggression team, a late-game oriented team).\r\n\r\nI look for patterns and do the best that I can. It isn&#039;t as easy with eSports as it would be with typical sports, since it&#039;s harder to define a team&#039;s form in a way. Most of the time when it&#039;s for a specific team, I gather information that the team tell me to, so they can then work out the best strategy based on the team we&#039;re facing. Online media doesn&#039;t accentuate this enough, but I think that a lot of the really solid work is done by coaches that have both the in-game and LAN experience and the game knowledge, while analysts like myself are there to put in the needed hours and effort that are too much for one human being to handle. Such as 8-12 hours a day.\r\n\r\nI have many, many more about myself and also have a resume. If anyone is interested please do contact me on analystdejan@gmail.com or my ign Scarlet Crusader.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time.\r\n\r\nFree lance analyst, Scarlet Crusader","replies":[]}
