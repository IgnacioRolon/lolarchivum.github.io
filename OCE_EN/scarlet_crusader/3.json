It is an amazing place to get to know people, joke around, or even just listen to some music while you play some league of legends. This discords community is growing by the day and it&#039;s got a pretty good reason why it still is growing. When you join you will get assigned roles that represent you! How awesome is that, these roles indicate what rank you are and you will receive access to channels to those of similar skill level. Additionally you get to choose what faction you wish to belong too which I think is pretty awesome since Demacia is obviously the best. ALSO if you want to show off your skill level you will obtain a tag to your name which indicates that you reached 100k or above on a champion, gives you ever right to boast unless you&#039;re a filthy teemo main. Not to mention that the team behind the discord server even has a rioter and a freelance analyst for that extra icing on the cake.\n\nOf course this discord is absolutely amazing but sadly there are a few rules in which you much conform to. \n- Don&#039;t be obnoxious\n- Don&#039;t start arguments\n- No discussions about controversial issues\n- No promoting youtube videos or twitch streams\n- No posting porn/hentai (instant ban)\n- No advertising servers (instant ban)\n- Must play on the oceanic server (instant ban)\n\nSo since the annoying rules are out of the way here is some extra juicy information: \n\nYou gain 1 point for referring a Member to this server. Gain 10 Referral Points to unlock the @Top Member role. If you were referred by a user, please contact @TᖇIᑎ to mention who you were referred by.\n\nEvery so often we will hold a League trivia competition in the #trivia room for the @Nerd role. \n\n@Baron is a bot with multiple League of Legend commands. Whether it&#039;s searching up statistics about champions or players, it has it all. All commands must be used in the #commandschat channel, and a list of all the commands can be found in the #commandshelp channel.\n\nYou can level up by chatting. Type t!profile to see your profile.\n\nI recently asked Trin ( the owner of the discord ) why did he make such a discord and his thoughts on its progress, he replied with : &quot;My primary reason was because all the oce discord servers were dead and had hardly anyone in them. Pretty sure this is the largest oce only server now. It&#039;s also a way just to get together with mates, it&#039;s easy to make friends in online communities. The progress is good. a little over 2 months and we&#039;re at 882 members.&quot; Clearly it is seen that lovely Trin cares about the league community and hopes increase the discords popularity.\n\nSo what are you guys waiting for?! Come join us and have a blast at : https://discord.me/leagueoceania\n\nHope to see you summoners there, \n\nFreelance analyst Scarlet Crusader","replies":[{"poster":"Tweak","date":"2017-04-12T00:31:40.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will be the most toxic chat if the in-game chats are anything to go by.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LETHALITY ABUSER","date":"2017-04-07T09:03:27.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"XD {{champion:20}} {{item:3047}}","replies":[]}]}
