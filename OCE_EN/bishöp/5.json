I think we actually ended up winning that game because the enemy wasted all their time trying to deal with the cancer that is a splitpushing lvl7 zilean. I would also do dicky things like splitpush and then use my outrageous movespeed to join teamfights for an easy 5v3 before the enemy could get back to the fiesta that is all mid.","replies":[]}]}
