You will only improve facing people who are better than you.\n\nIt's a part of the learning curve.\n\nIt's a *horribly* jagged curve.\n\nBut that's League.\n\nEnjoy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-14T23:16:52.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a smurf yesterday.

As such, the lower playerbase results in having less people for the matchmaking system to work with, and this can sometimes result in the skewed teams that you play with. I understand it can be frustrating to play against people who are much better than you, but there's always going to be someone in your match that is the \"best\" of everyone there....although I do agree that if that skill differential is massive it can be demoralising. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-14T17:06:49.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much what he said, you just have to take in to account that due to our low player base if we didnt match-make the way we do we would have to wait up to 15 mins for games sometimes\n\na good comparison for you to wrap your head around, California has more players than the oce community combined lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OG Wiz","date":"2014-12-14T10:51:22.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, i've said it before and i'll say it again, i've said it before. :)\n\nNah but seriously now, i'm pretty sure the people you play in normals has to do with the same kinda thing as ranked, if you win more than you lose you'll be placed against better players, vice versa. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solanthus","date":"2014-12-14T10:44:40.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm, seems strange. Only thing I can think of is that the system is pushing your rating higher since you went in as pre-made, while your other team might be full of higher ranked solo'ers to compensate.\n\nThere's also the thing where even though players may have lots of games won and experience, it will still match based upon their perceived rating/mmr. So its not too uncommon for people with lots of wins to be paired against more relative newcomers if your score to date has been favourable (since I don't think win #'s count at all in the matchmaking)","replies":[]},{"poster":"xWeecheex","date":"2014-12-14T10:25:39.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i agree.\nI always go against people that have hundreds of more wins than me, im like a noob to them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kwang is God","date":"2014-12-15T01:26:36.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's OCE, why is it surprising? the MM is %%%% since day 1","replies":[]}]}
