I roll my eyes and sarcastically retort.\n&ldquo;Yes Rakan, it looks fantastic with you around&rdquo; I trace my hand upon his _Gleaming Fey Feathers._ I know he had promised to take me back here, but never thought the feeling would be so magical. As Rakan starts humming _Ancient Vastayan Folk-Hymns_, my heart sinks into the feeling of being at home once again,  with my body pressed against his, how could I not? Rakan embraces me tighter. His eyes, the hue of sapphire&#039;s enchant me, leaving me breathless. Our eyes lock, Rakan edges closer, leaning in for a kiss. Our lips, just inches apart. I close my eyes and... \n\nThe land shifts... the earth roars. The cracking sound of the ground splitting between Rakan and I. The destruction covers the land in a purple haze, replacing the lush green grass with a rocky abyss that stretches for miles. Rakan stands, wobbling as the disruption of the _void rift_ cracks beneath us. &ldquo;We can do this, _we&#039;ve done it before_. I&#039;ll be the distraction, I&#039;ll make my _Grand Entrance_. Just be there okay? Remember_ ten breaths_&rdquo; I nod, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; my voice shaky as he dances into battle. He turns and yells &ldquo;Hey, you said what we had _was greater than some human word_!&rdquo; He puffs his chest out, adjusting his feathers he winks and makes his way to the centre of the rift. \n\n&ldquo;One...&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Two...&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Three...&rdquo;\n \n&ldquo;Four...&rdquo; \n\nMy palms become sweaty as I watch Rakan jump into the air. I try not to become distracted by him making his _Grand Entrance. _\n\n&ldquo;Five...&rdquo;\n\n &ldquo;Six...&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Seve-&rdquo; \n\nThe ground begins to shake violently as the chasm that was engraved into the earth shifts back into place, closing the rift and creating whole land once again. The disruption of the transmogrify causes a rustle above me. Looking up in haste and worry, a boulder, directly overhead tips on its edge and begins to fall. I throw myself out of the way, landing face first on the rocky ledge behind the waterfall that Rakan and I were just so peacefully caressing each-other. I yelp in pain as the boulder, lands on my wing. I look up, my breathing intensifies as I can&#039;t see Rakan. A tear gently finds its way out of my tear duct, and my heart stops for a moment. &ldquo;I missed my _ten breaths_&rdquo; I look down at the ground, disappointed in myself. I let this happen. At that moment, Rakan&#039;s Quill&#039;s catch the light, gleaming. _&ldquo;Look I&#039;m a Distraction!&rdquo;_ Gazing up at him I smile, wrestling to push the boulder off my wing. As I edge the boulder off, I jump up excitedly _&ldquo;Coming Love!&rdquo;_ I yell, eager to get into the fight. \n\nAnd at that moment, I saw it. The same familiar purple that had been etched in veins through the stony ground, and coated the sky in a thick haze. I stare, breathlessly as I watch a Plasma Fission reach Rakan as he is airborne. The purple bolt of plasma tore through the sky in a fiery rage. Destroying everything in it&#039;s path, and splitting the sky in two as it disperses into halves. The void rift comes to a close, in a blinding light. I shield my eyes with my wing, looking away. &ldquo;Rakan!&rdquo; I yell, arm outstretched. In the heat of the moment, I run, no matter what danger ahead, I must ensure Rakan&#039;s safety. I make my way in leaps and bounds, I have to get to him no matter what. My speed blurs the vision of my peripherals. Rakan comes into my view, laying, lifeless on the ground. I lock onto him. He is all I see. And I swear, I can hear his breathing. The rustling sound of the leaves as I make ground, but yet feel miles away. I&#039;d say that tears fell down my cheeks at that moment, but the thought of living without Rakan made tears stream down my face, a current more powerful than the _Aphae_ itself. \n\nThe moments felt like years, but I could have sworn I was in Rakan&#039;s arms only an hour ago. However it feels like a lifetime has passed between lying together at the Aphae Waterfall, and standing here, looking at Rakan&#039;s lifeless body on the cold-stone floor. I just stand there, in disbelief. No tears, no noise.  I kneel, slowly, tracing my fingers upon those once gilded, golden feathers, now cold, and drained of colour. The world stopped. The wind no longer rustled in the leaves of the trees, and not a single animal was in sight. They were all mourning the loss of Rakan, the most Charming being in existence. \n\nI lie down, in Rakan&#039;s arms once more. I take his arm with mine, and wrap it around me. I pull his wing across to shield me from the pain, hugging it tightly as it covers both our bodies, encapsulating us. I pluck a discoloured feather from his wing, I tuck it underneath the skull that resides upon my shoulder, so he can always be me. We lay together, I feel just as lifeless as Rakan. A final tear trickles down my cheek.\n\n&ldquo;_I thought..... I thought you said you would live forever&rdquo; \n_\n\n\n\n\nEnd\n\nAuthor&#039;s Notes\n\n&#039;One Day&#039; written by me, Monique (Hes MY Santa) on 18 March 2018, is a tale about Rakan and Xayah that takes a turn for the worst, written for the Void Writing Competition. The piece consists of 915 words and includes a lot of references to the game including quotes and abilities, all of these are placed in italics. The Title itself &#039;One Day&#039; comes from their previous experiences in the Puboe Prison Break, it states that; &ldquo;Rakan tells me to be careful as he wanders away, looking at the sky. Every time he leaves, my heart sinks. I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t be the last time I see him. Although, one day, it might&rdquo; As it is the day that Rakan dies, it alludes to her lore as it is the last day she will see him. Other things that allude to lore or quotes include:\n\nAphae Waterfall\nGleaming Fey Feathers (This intertwines Rakan&#039;s ability Gleaming Quills and Passive Fey Feathers)\nAncient Vastayan Folk-hymns (These were sung by Xayah&#039;s Father, and Rakan was also heard singing them upon their first meet)\nwe&#039;ve done it before (Alludes to when the Shadow Acolytes in Puboe Prison Break)\nGrand Entrance (This is Rakans W ability)\nten breaths (Alludes to: &ldquo;But you have to be there in ten breaths. &ldquo; written in The  Puboe Prison Break)\n&ldquo;was greater than some human word!&rdquo; (Quote from Xayah)\n&ldquo;Coming Love!&rdquo; (One of Xayah&#039;s &#039;On my Way&#039; Pings)\nPlasma Fission &amp; void rift (Vel&#039;Koz&#039; abilities)\nCharming (He is the Charmer)\n&ldquo;I thought..... I thought you said you would live forever&rdquo; (One of Rakan&#039;s Movement voicelines he says &ldquo;I&#039;m Gonna live forever!&rdquo; )\n\nAs you can see I have put an immense amount of thought into this, including the use of quotes, abilities, and character style which has been used with Xayah placing Rakan&#039;s feather underneath the skull that is on her shoulder. This heart-wrenching tale is sad but I think I have stuck to the guidelines and created a tale that could be well loved. I give a big thank you for taking the time to read my short story and my Author&#039;s notes. This means a lot to me. Thank you.\n\nMonique. _","replies":[]}
