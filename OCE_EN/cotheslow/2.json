Don't get me wrong I love the Tristana rework and i feel it fits her but Poppy is/was the closest to her looks wise, so i feel this gives us a rough outline of where they will take her. I half think Tristana's outfit got more revealing so she didn't look like poppy (two yordles in full armor with similar skin tones ..... yeah it just doesn't seem right). \r\n\r\nI just hope Poppy is still Poppy after her rework, I want to be able to distinguish her from Tristana, because even though they look rather similar their personalities are polar opposites. So i just think this will be interesting to see.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-14T23:04:31.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tristana and Poppy weren't originally Yordle hence why they look different to them, but one day Rito said \"duh fk it\" and included all the tiny champ into 1 category, the Yordles.\n\nNow they're trying to rework them so they actually look like Yordles.\n\nThat's what I heard at least.\n\nI hope Poppy can remain her serious face to match her original design tho.","replies":[{"poster":"CoTheSlow","date":"2015-01-15T02:58:22.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know they weren't originally Yordles but my point was that they looked very similar to each other (besides hair). So since we can see Trist as the direction they want to take the former merglings we can get a pretty good idea about what Poppy will be like. \n\nYes i also hope Poppy will be able to keep her personality after her re work but we will just have to wait and see i guess.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-15T02:34:39.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"REMEMBER THE MEGLING GENOCIDE!","replies":[]}]}]}
