So i built that instead, and it felt pretty good to use. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, is it worthwhile to build it? I know it is helpful and should probably be a third pick up (depending on who you are against) but it does seem to have some drawbacks (less turret time compared to ohmwrecker ect.). So what are your thoughts on it? Is it worht it? Should i bother? Is Heim not a great champ to use the item?\r\n {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} {{champion:74}} For Great Science!","replies":[{"poster":"Divoid","date":"2015-01-21T09:36:17.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3512}} {{champion:74}} \n\nThis new item is great for Heimerdinger, but it will never be core.\n\nPROS:\n1/ Heimer has the highest health regeneration in the game; this item DOUBLES it and gives Heimer very decent magic resist and armour.\n2/ The speed buff near turrets works for ALL turrets, even though the Voidlings only work for lane turrets.\n\nCONS:\nits REALLY expensive, and by the time u can afford it, most of the turrets should be down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-17T04:00:38.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's explanation of the item was to build it on tanks who have to deal with a splitpusher. They can put a portal down and TP to their team for a fight so the splitpusher has a harder time pushing OR so the wave always pushes in their favour in a \"neglected\" lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-16T23:36:57.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it is really good on singed\nI haven't used it effectively but.\n\n\nsinged can clear waves super fast, he only lacks tower damage as a splitpusher.\nAnd the portal fixes that. \n\nStats are still good on him too.\n\nBtw, i dont think it worth getting it on jax/yi/etc, because you could of used that good on better damage item.\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-16T17:18:39.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So far I've used it on Sion and Taric. ({{champion:44}}  best split push champ OCE)\n\nIt greatly improves one's ability to split push, and take out towers etc.\nI do not see it as a useful item on {{champion:74}} .\n\n\n\nAs for the item itself, I feel that they \"over-balanced\" it on the PBE, the minions it spawns don't last long enough for you to place the portal in a safe area where it wont be prematurely killed by the enemy team. So often you need to put it just out of reach of a potential opponent while you either split push or team push a lane.\n\nI can see {{item:3512}} being very popular on any split push orientated champ. {{champion:24}} {{champion:11}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:77}}","replies":[]}]}
