Then i read Galio's lore and found myself really impressed. \r\n\r\n\"Then, one nondescript day, a sad but determined yordle girl carrying a mighty Demacian crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest. Hidden in plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn yordle. She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden. As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia. This encounter lit a spark in Galio's eye.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a champion interaction that not only furthered both characters but even made sense. It is this kind of lore that i love and had loved to read about in League, it's subtle and unless you bothered to look you may not catch it but once you see it you can come to like some champions a little more. (as you could probably tell i wasn't Galio's greatest fan). \r\n\r\nThis is what i would like to see in the newer lore, using them to not only develop the character it is about but showing their interactions with other champions as well. It just helps make the whole LOL universe take a better shape.","replies":[]}
