My botlaner forcibly took jungle from my mate, he and the top laner proceeded to int my game whilst flaming me all game, i proceeded to flame them aswell but no more then anyone else does. I believe a 14 day suspension is more then enough  and no where near a perm ban, the player proceded to message me on league and discord flaming me constantly after the game screaming at me in chinese, please change the perm ban to a 14-day atleast.\n\nHis summoner name was [REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]\n\nThankyou for taking the time to read my post","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-08T13:41:52.789+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wish to appeal a punishment, you can do so via Player Support: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nPlease note that a punishment will only be removed or reduced if it was issued or escalated in error.\n\nAs for the punishment itself, there isn't much for us to comment unless we know why you were actually punished. The easiest way to accomplish this is to post your reform card (visible when you open the client) and a rough timeline or prior punishments and what they were for.\n\nYou can find general information about the punishment system here: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-\n\nThe two points that sound most relevant to your case would be these:\n\n>**Punishments generally follow a basic escalation path:**\n\n>* First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n* Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n* Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n* Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nAn account will always receive at least a 14-day ban prior to a permanent suspension (with exceptions for things like cheating), I can only imagine that you have at least relatively recently received a 14-day ban on the account, hence why this punishment is now a permanent ban.\n\nThis shouldn't have been a surprise, as the 14-day ban reform card explicitly states that being punished again can result in permanent suspension.\n\n>**Why was I punished when the other person was worse or started it!**\n\n>* Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior. An argument between two players can easily create a negative experience for the rest of the players in the game with you. Regardless of the other playerâ€™s actions, this does not justify your own behavior. You alone are responsible for your actions within the game.If you encounter a toxic player like this, the best option is to simply report their behavior and move on.\n\nGenerally speaking, \"they started it\" just isn't a valid excuse for bad behaviour. To be clear, defending oneself is fine, retaliating or firing back is not. Particularly when you consider that there are other uninvolved parties now stuck with more bad behaviour as well as that of the initial offenders.","replies":[]}]}
