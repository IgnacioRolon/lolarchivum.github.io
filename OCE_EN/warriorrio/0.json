Support won't do anything","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, happy fun times for me.  Tried to log in for the first time in a few years. My account had been permabanned for use of third party programs. Great, so I went to support, explained the situation to them. \"You were using 3rd party programs and were banned as a result.\" Tried to explain that's impossible as my computer had died, and I was at work during my most recent games. \"Nope, still banned. No compromise has been found.\"\r\n\r\nNow here is where things get juicy. I managed to get my account data and noticed a few strange things. Namely logins from south Australia, china and Vietnam. Now for a little bit of background info: I live in victoria. I've never been to China or Vietnam.\r\nCan someone please explain to me how these logins are considered \"no suspicious acitivity\"?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[]}
