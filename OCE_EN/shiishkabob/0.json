Good luck to all my fellow League players that have been unjustly banned for financial gain. \r\n\r\nIf you need a sample letter, I have also included that for you below to make changes as you fit. \r\n\r\nHello my name is XXXX XXXXX and the video game League of Legends by Riot Games is my hobby. What I enjoy most about the game is the entertainment and funny interactions that it gives me with my fellow gamer&#039;s. I have been playing this game now for over a year and a half without any incident. One day when I was normally playing the game and chatting with my fellow gamer&rsquo;s, all of a sudden my account was suddenly suspended for no reason and I was kicked out of the game. When I wrote about my account having been suspended, I was really surprised and taken back by the quality of customer service I received about my concerns. Since my initial contact with Riot Games, things have become abusive and my valued account has started to get suspended much more frequently. After having been first notified of my suspension, I took numerous steps to sensor myself. I started by keeping cross chat communication with the opposing team off. This meant that I would be unable to read or write messages to the opposing five member team and vice versa. Further action on my part had been to also mute 90 percent of my games. Having taken such extreme steps to censor myself, I was floored to find out that my account had been suspended again recently by Riot Games for no reason.  My reason for filing this complaint today is to bring attention to what Riot is doing to me and to prevent this from happening to my fellow gamer&#039;s.  I have received over 500 positive praises on my account from other gamer&#039;s. This contradicts any reason why they would suspend my account for 14 days. I find this type of practice unacceptable to high paying valued customers of the game. Thank you so kindly for listening to my concerns and I hope that we have a resolution not only for me but for future gamer&#039;s.\r\n\r\n\r\nA service is meant to be enjoyed and it is not for us to be restricted and controlled by the people that own it for financial gain. What Riot Games does is they go after established players accounts that are worth a lot of money to them by finding excuses to label the players negative and to then ultimately cause the account to get suspended, to which they encourage the same player to open a new account and start paying from scratch all over again thus making them additional revenue. This practice is a revolving gaming ponzi scheme and should not be tolerated.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-01T21:14:31.625+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi.
