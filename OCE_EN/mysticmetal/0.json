And Im lazy so why not ctrl C + Ctrl V\r\n\r\nOk, many players have quit playing league of legends due to the leaver buster being to strict, And I was and currently close to being one of those people again. And before you condemn me for leaving games, I don&#039;t do it on purpose, it is due to shortage of power In my router, I dont need any of those &#039;&#039; how to fix your connector &#039;&#039; bullshit. I just recently finished my 20 minute timers and I have gotten another one. Ive played many games before hand my recent timer and i get another 20 minute. All I ask for is to make the leaver buster less strict. I have a few suggestions. \r\n- Each time you complete 5 games of 20 min timers it goes back to. 5,10,15 and back to 20. etc \r\n- It goes away after a certain amount of time if the account is currently inactive. For example, each month it resets. \r\n- In order to trigger leave buster, you need to be inactive for at least 1/3 of the game, and if you win even if you were afk, the charge gets a bit lighter. \r\nI&#039;m not asking you to remove my timers, i know you don&#039;t do that. But I am so close to losing my shit with this game and to quit all over again. I have paid tons of my money for cosmetics etc, and all that is going to waste if I quit in anyway. Most of the time its due to this bullshit called leaver buster. And yes I am very upset at the moment so wish for a reply that does not give me bullshit I don&#039;t know.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T10:15:17.467+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is unfortunately no response we can give that it seems you aren't already aware of. In the end it comes down to the fact that, intentional or no, you are still ruining the game for 9 other people.\n\nSupport tickets tend to be reserved for direct issues, rather than feedback on the state of the game or the systems within it which is why they suggested you post your feedback here. You're welcome to discuss as much as you'd wish here, though I doubt anyone will be able to help you directly. \n\nYour best bet is as you have said, to fix whatever problems your router is having, but I imagine you would have already done that if it were feasible. Sorry i couldn't be of more help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-10T10:08:35.407+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to hear you are having issues with your connection and Leaver Buster, but think about your teammates; for every minute you are absent, you are causing 4 minutes of problems (1 minute of agony per teammate), and up to 5 minutes for the enemy team (just because the game is easier doesn't mean they enjoy it).\n\nIf you are unable to play a complete match, please do not inflict your issue on all those other people. Leaver Buster isn't there just to punish intentional leavers, but to inhibit the damage people with bad connections are doing. If you don't want to be penalized, you'll need to do something about your power issue, and refrain from playing matchmade games until then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-10T23:40:47.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Low Priority is based on how often you're not part of the game, so if you're disconnecting or AFKing much more than you should be (which is never or close to never) your punishments are going to stay as they are. \n\nLeaverBuster punishments need to be strict to dissuade people from ruining the experience of 9 other players each game. If you can't stop yourself from disconnecting then you shouldn't be playing or you should play a mode that isn't affected by LB (Bots/Customs). Unless you get your connection fixed nothing's going to change with your experience.","replies":[]}]}
