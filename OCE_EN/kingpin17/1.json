I&#039;m thinking robots as the soldiers who are black and red and have like electric looking spears and have azir looking black and red looking like a robot and also thinking about his q and e with a red trail coming from its back and the auto attack animation when hitting having a red splash look and the r looking like the soldier robots holding big red and black mech like shields. I just really thought this would be a cool skin and would look really dope in game, it just came to me now that it would look really sick in game. with a skin like Battlecast the theme being (red and black) which would look great on robot soldiers (azir w) and his r and Azir&#039;s character model itself.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-25T13:33:16.854+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I cant really say no to more Azir skins <_<\n\nIm not the hugest fan of battlecast as a skin line, yea its a classic, but its also pretty corny.\nI wouldn't say no to a batttlecast Azir of course, but if I could choose a robotic one, personally id pick something a little more streamlined. More along the lines of this 'Age of Ultron' Azir:\n\nhttps://how2play.pl/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AVENGER-Azir.jpg\n\nBut I must admit, a battlecast Azir turret chugging out clouds of thick smog from multiple exhaust pipes would look damn cool!!\n\nAzir has some pretty solid skins though, so i'm very thankful for that.","replies":[{"poster":"KingPin17","date":"2018-01-26T07:48:10.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like all the azir skins at the moment and all I want is a robot like azir skin so this age of ultron azir skin is a good idea I don't care if it is battlecast or not I just want a cool looking robot skin for azir because the soldiers and turret and ult and azir's champ model itself would like pretty dope with it all being robotic like. But I guess I should've just stated in my writing and the title that I want a robotic skin for azir.","replies":[]}]}]}
