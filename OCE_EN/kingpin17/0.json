Another thing Is you can&#039;t Shurima shuffle that well any more or make outplays with q because of how small the q range is.. I really hope Riot understands this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-27T09:19:25.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wont comment too much here as Im still in the early days of testing it and will likely make an essay on it later.\n\nBut from what little I've played so far, it really feels like they tried _(and failed)_ to make him a diver.\n\nWith the reduced range you can no longer be _partially-safe_ when poking _(like Xerath and Lux and old Azir can)_. You are at the full mercy of most assassins/burst mages when in that range, so poke isn't much of an option anymore. So the only way you can win fights is to get that 3rd soldier on the field and get the AS boost! But to do that you HAVE to hit that E on a champion, _(you don't live long enough to get the 3rd soldier any other way)_ . The problem is, to hit the E, you have to dash headlong into the fight, which is not something that Azir is equipped to survive.\n\nThey changed the shield to scale off AP thats true, _(which tbh is more of a bug-fix than anything else, because they weren't fooling anyone with that max-hp scaling they had before, it was just as useful as no shield at all)_.\n\nAnd the one thing that could have helped Azir work in this kind of diving situation _(the impassable wall)_, they just flat out removed!\n\n\n_________\n\nSo what Azir is now is a ** squishy poke mage**, with **shit range** and who is rewarded for **leaping headlong** into the enemy team with almost no defence.... What kind of backwards kit is that?\n\nIt's like giving a support a heal that gets bigger with the more health the target they are healing has... it kinda defeats the whole purpose.\n\nBut in fear of rambling on for hours, thats all all say for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-09-28T05:44:13.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you get literally squads now, why have 3 when you can have 5 or more?

Admittedly I build him with a lot of utility rather than just straight glass-cannon AP, but still, that seems a little high from what I've seen.\n\nHe does a lot of damage it's true, but it requires a fair bit of setup, and then some time to actually auto attack as well, so theres little chance he would be able to out-damage champs like Zed or Ryze in a duel, champs who have access to their entire kit from the get-go.\n\nBut I'm still trying it out and testing him, so ill refrain from any concrete conclusions just yet.\n\nMy first impression is definitely negative though, mostly because of the Shurima Shuffle range decrease. and the random red crap that pops up when you get your AS boost...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-10-06T12:19:26.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So azir currently has janna syndrome with his massive flopping winrate of 55-56%, he still need those buffs?\n\nAlso doing reduced damage to secondary targets until level 9 isnt really most of the game and the 1200 shield was on the 1100 ap azir with his glorious 2.2 attackspeed\n\nbut yes it is annoying how when he has 5 soldiers he needs to take 1 step forwards to use them to attack, as they dash 15 units out of his range","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-10-04T01:09:12.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey look\n\n> Azir - Is looking pretty strong, though for the first time his performance isn't extremely skewed between average and high skill players which is a good sign, since that suggests mastery as him and mastery playing against him may be scaling appropriately together.
