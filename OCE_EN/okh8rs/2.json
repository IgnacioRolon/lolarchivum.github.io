By using a bad player as bait sometimes you can still win the game (as what happened).\n\n3) Don't give up just because you or someone else is doing badly. Focus on improving at the game, not climbing. Constant surrender votes when the score is roughly even does not help team morale. If you are going badly or even if you think the team is going badly, knuckle down and let others carry you (e.g. Vi and Sivir in that game). It's one of the [common misconceptions of soloqueue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JEWjxDSUIQ) that you HAVE to carry.\n\nGood luck in soloqueue!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Julez","date":"2017-08-13T11:24:36.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what rank are you? ?XD","replies":[{"poster":"okh8rs","date":"2017-08-13T11:27:47.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver 5 58Lp","replies":[]}]}]}
