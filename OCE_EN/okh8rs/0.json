Something has changed on OCE over the last 10-12 months. I'm not sure what it is, but the average player is a LOT worse than they used to be. Solo Queue is a fucking NIGHTMARE. June-July last season I was Plat II on my way to Diamond for the first time, took a short break from ranked, came back and players suddenly didn't know how to draft a good team comp, couldn't lane safely, and their macro was horrible. And it's only gotten worse since then.\n\nThe only time I can get a decent game nowadays is Flex when I duo/trio queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-08-15T10:24:40.128+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a combination of factors. Let's list them, compared with, say, Season 5.\n\n* The ability to level up to 30 quicker without really understanding the game.\n* The fallout from dynamic queue boosting in Season 6.\n* The increase over time of boosters in the game.\n* The ability to select positional roles in champion select without learning something about all roles (and hence the game) !\n* The fact that smurf accounts are cheap as chips, and prices are dropping further with the removal of rune costs.\n* The increase of late night toxic foreign players that have been banned from their own servers (not naming who or where from).\n* The increase of new players into the player base, all learning bad habits (this includes toxic behaviour) from other bad players.\n\nI'm not going to go into Flex Queue, which is all over the shop, but what you say is pretty much on the mark. OCE does not understand macro, it's absolutely hopeless. It's better in challenger, but still only at the top levels (just watch IWD's, Big Swip's or Chippy's stream to see).\n\nBut the same thing has happened in a lot of regions. NA soloqueue is worse, according to LS. He said that basic lane assignments and late game understanding is worse than when he last played there.\n\nIt would be good if the tutorial actually spoke about the basics of the game. i.e. how to efficiently get gold, what are the different classes of champions, and what experience is, because newbies have no idea. Alternatively another solution would be that players need some arbitrary number of wins in normals before they are allowed to rank. This would definitely help the skill gap, but might be counter intuitive to revenue policies :)\n\nI've watched some of my Bronze replays from Jan 2015 and players were way better in Bronze at the simple things (not talking about mechanics here) than even in Gold these days.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2017-08-16T13:20:37.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Making it more difficult for new players/smurf to jump straight into Ranked would be nice. Honestly, back in the day I was just lucky enough to have friends that straight-up told me no to play ranked for a season or two. People just have selfish mindsets nowadays. They jump straight into ranked at lvl 30. They only play one role, or one champ, and sandbag your game if they don't get it. Hell, even when they do get their main role/champ they neglect cs, they play lane as though kills mean everything and don't know how/when to play safe.\n\nOnce upon a time Ranked was sacred. People only queued up for it if their net was fine, their computer was fine, and they had the skills and game knowledge to not be a burden on their team mates.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-15T01:30:32.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much the reason ive played 1 game all week.\n\nI got to the point were i was killing my lane opponent everytime they came back to lane but lo and behold botlanes feeding and we have a hybrid shaco ,i got to a point were i was like fuck this.

The player base is smaller but not small enough to warrant the skill level of roughly plat and below to differ from the NA plat and below. Higher elo I agree, but low, no, not at all.

Generally OCE has better ping than NA and I feel like OCE culture is a bit more troll at least in the higher ranks although that could be disputed. \n\nIf you think gold in OCE is a shithole, you will think gold in Korea, NA, EUW and EUNE would be as bad if not worse (unless you're being biased) due to the addition of language barriers in some scenarios. \n\nAs a side note, I've played in NA for a couple of years (before OCE was a server) and now in OCE and they're as bad as each other from my experience.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-15T00:44:54.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played since early season 2, back on NA (before OCE existed).\nI've found the complete opposite, NA was far more toxic.
