I just transferred my account from NA ( where I was gold 4) to OCE so had to replay placement matches. I currently got placed in bronze4 and looking to climb up quickly. I main adc and mid but can also play as supp if required. \r\n\r\nMust meet below criteria:\r\n\r\n+ Must have at least 1:1 ratio of win/losses in ranked play.\r\n+ Must cope well under pressure aka no raging/flaming others.\r\n+ Decent personality.\r\n\r\nIf this looks like you please add me in game and we can chat thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"OccamsTaser","date":"2016-05-22T02:14:41.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Similar situation. Although 1:1 ratio is not nearly what i have (thank bronze 3 for 11/3 caits at 15 minutes, every single lane losing, etc), i transfered from EUW where i was S1/G5 for a long time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-22T00:41:19.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! I was in Bronze about a month ago when I relooked at the game with a fresh mindset and climbed to Silver in 3 weeks, improving my win rate to 54%. I learned to not tilt in the face of losses and I think it helped.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XxKarosxX","date":"2016-05-21T10:32:35.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is Silver 5 okay?","replies":[]}]}
