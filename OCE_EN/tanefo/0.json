Whenever i try to open Lol client, i can&#039;t. It just gives me an error that says &quot;Pvp.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working&quot;.\r\nI tried running the patcher as Administrator and it still doesn&#039;t work.\r\n\r\nAnyone knows how to fix this? :/","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-05-30T03:45:37.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply here, but I actually just encountered this error at home and found a way to fix it. I hope this helps you as well. First off, I encountered this on Windows 8.1\n\n* Go to the installation folder for League (Mine was Riot Games -> League of Legends) and right click on lol.launcher, select properties\n* Click on the \"Compatibility\" tab\n* Check the box for \"Run this program as an administrator\" and hit Apply\n\nNow rerun the launcher, mine opened up without the error but took a while to launch. There was a small progress bar underneath and when it was done updating, the launcher opened up and began patching. \n\nI hope this helps you out, please post back with any news.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-31T06:09:58.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But he said he was running it in admin mode anyway and it still wasn't working.

For me it worked by flagging Admin. I don't pretend to understand Windows 8.1 :D","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-01T04:51:05.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha, I understand man. I don't even want to dig into its configuration because of how convoluted and confusing it's become, especially since the Metro interface has its own, separate configuration, but both exist in the same environment.\n\nWonder how Windows 10 will fair. Is it up to the responsibility of the program developer to maintain compatibility with the new OS, or is it the OS's developer to maintain compatibility with the program?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Quickfreeze","date":"2015-05-30T13:05:29.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

Usually, you don't want the driver packages that come with your OS updates, so try finding them yourself from your graphics card's manufacturer's website.","replies":[]}]}
