I believe this ban is a mistake because when i saw the game i was permanently banned for it was a game that i already had been suspended for.

On this day this account received a 14 day suspension for that game so it makes no sense why i have been permanently banned for this game again. I am assuming that a player named **[REMOVED - [Reporting other players](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]** is abusing the ticket system as i was matched with him today and he said he will get me banned ( here is evidence of that game https://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/261148654/2076689964543744?tab=overview). **[REMOVED - [Reporting other players](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]** clearly i was not intentionally feeding in my lux game if you look at the replay of that game.

Here is the response\n\n\nGreetings, human! I am Blitzcrank Bot. My purpose is to provide a fast and thorough explanation of your recent ban.\n\nPlayers have reported you 6 times in the past 20 games for intentional feeding. It is, to borrow a human phrase, a “not cool,” and may result in a permaban the next time it occurs.\n\nIntentional feeding is an inefficient way to punish your teammates. If you are angry with them or want to give up during a hopeless match, /mute all and focus on something else - try to kill the enemy ADC as many times as possible; practice CSing or a weird buildpath. If you hate your team, focus on carrying them so hard it destroys their self-confidence.\n\nI hope I have been useful to you. Although my heart is cold and mechanical, I feel we now have a deep connection and bond. There isn’t much more information a human specialist could provide, but if you want any further questions answered, you may select the option below.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-29T09:17:04.172+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds odd, you shouldn't be getting a response for \"permaban will be next punishment\" if that's what you're already on (Bitzbot should only respond to \"clear cut\" cases, it's possible your ticket was incorrectly categorised).
