And can this Be lifted?","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:35}}  My account was banned when i logged in this morning, and the reason being after talking to Blitz Bot i had Been reported for Intentional Feeding in 8 of my past 20 games but as you can see theres no way that i have been inentionally feeding for 8 games. this is a bug i believe on the reporting Programming or whatever it is.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: there was 1 single game i didnt try as hard as i could, but my midlaner banned away shaco when i had it Highlighted and told me he was nt having shaco on his team. but regardless We won that game. If this single incident is demmed feeding at least its one offence and give me a shorter punishment.\r\n\r\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=P0rnstar%20Shaco","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-22T05:48:32.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it looks like you only inted 1 game on purpose, you have a history of games with a lot of deaths. Some people report that because it shows that you don't seem to care about dying so long as you maybe get a kill for it. A lot of people think that is not worth, and if you do it often, they'll report you because in their eyes, that is inting. \n\nI think \"there was 1 single game i didn't try as hard as i could\" is a MASSIVE understatement. You fed, plain and simple. Choosing bad sums is 1 thing, going 1/21/6 is another thing, buiding AP on a champ that has literally one spell affected by AP, and making yourself quite useless to your team is again another thing. Those things add up and there is no way you cannot say you were not inting there. \n\nAlso this is ranked. It is a game mode for taking the game seriously. Purposefully trying to lose the game in any way should be punished. I get that you were upset because your own team banned what looks like your main champ. You had 2 options for that game. Dodge and lose 3LP and maybe go get a drink while you wait to queue back up, or play something else. That is what people do who only play 1 champion. I ban Neeko in every single ranked game I go into, regardless of whether or not someone had it hovered on my team. That is because I simply do not trust people at my elo who play new champs right after they come out. I don't want that champ on either team, simple as that. I've had people probably report me for \"griefing\", and I'm ok with that, because in my eyes it raises the chance for a win. Until I see Neeko being played decently in my normal games, I refuse to take that chance in my ranked games. I don't need to dodge every time someone picks Neeko if I can simply ban it away. \n\nWhoever your mid laner was, it is very possible he has had a very high percentage of negative experiences with Shaco and therefore bans him in his games. You may not think it's fair, but it's not JUST your game. And you clearly made it difficult for the other 3 people who had nothing to do with the argument at all.","replies":[{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-30T05:02:28.828+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, there's a reason there's a minimum number of champions required to play ranked. A player that got into say challenger as a champion that someone else may have considered broken isn't undeniably as good as a player who got into challenger being able to play a variety of roles and champions that can survive the bans and picks of every patch.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-29T09:21:21.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember you p0rnstar shaco, I was someone who was in your one of your last 20 games as fiora. I think you were pretty cool that game, so I went and checked your match history.\n\nOut of the past 20 games, not including remakes, you have 9 in which your KDA has more deaths than kills. Just looking at these without a chat log I've came up with a decent conclusion.\n\nLets look at those games:\nGame A - 0-6-10 shaco.\nSo I don't know what went on in that game but I'm guessing you went shaco support seeing you have thief and exhaust? In that case 0-6-10 isn't actually that bad of a score considering shaco actually has to actively place his boxes, command his ult, and get upclose and personal to get any damage in, so unlike alot of other supports getting assists as shaco isn't as easy.\nINT OR NO? -> No\n\nGame B - 1/21/6 yasuo... jungle?\nI mean come on, you started with amplifying tome, smite and cleanse against a potential neeko/swain/brand mid opponent. Turns out you weren't jg cause you had evelynn but whatever your team did they didn't deserve a 1/21/6 yasuo with smite cleans and tome.\nINT OR NO? -> Yes\n\nGame C - 10/12/18 shaco\nI was gonna say you carried but it was a game that lasted around 50 minutes, so everyone had similar KDAs. You weren't doing particularly bad for this game? I mean your vision sucked and you got carried by kaisa but overall I don't think you've fed\nINT OR NO? -> No\n\nGame D - 0/4/1 teemo... smite again?\nLike seriously? I think you went teemo adc that game cause you have a fiora and a rengar for the jungle and top roles, either that or mid, but then why would you bring smite?\nINT OR NO? -> Yes\n\nGame E - 0/6/6 shaco\nYou did poorly this game but what I think happened, since your draven was 14/12 Ace, was that your bot lane got fed but you kept dying so they reported you along with the 2/10 yasuo. and illaoi, who was 4/9, not wanting to be blamed, also reported you. You did come 10th this game though.\nINT OR NO? -> No\n\nGame F - 2/7/4 warwick\nYou came 10th this game again. Did they ban shaco? is that why you shifted from your main? I don't see any direct evidence for feeding without looking at chat,so I'm going to go:\nINT OR NO -> No\n\nGame G - 1/4/1 Annie mid\nYou came 9th this game. Against a yasuo that's a bit sad, but you were only 1/4/1 so I wouldn't call it feeding. Kayn was the Ace so he probably reported you along with the rest of the team for inting.\nINT OR NO -> NO\n\nGame H - 6/9/4 Rengar\nAgain you went 9th, but you have the 2nd highest number of kills in your team so I wouldn't say you've \"inted\"\nINT OR NO - > NO\n\nGame I - 1/4/1 Kaisa\n10th place. \nINT OR NO -> NO\n\nConclusion:\nEverytime you got autofilled, or if someone bans shaco, or if someone tilted you, you do so badly and just completely tilts into 9th or 10th place.\n\nYou've literally won all but one of your shaco games in your match history. I'd love to duo with you from your skills, but, that being said, I would hate for you to start tilting and go smite just cause you got a reason to do so.\n\nVerdict: Deserved or No?\nYes, you deserved it. Take time off to think about what you've done. No one wants a 1/21 yasuo in their game, no one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-22T07:57:13.413+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A ban will not be lifted (or reduced) unless it was made in error. GIven you have already talked to support and they have provided you with more context, not to mention what has been brought up here, it seems very unlikely it was made in error. \n\nIt's also worth noting that false intent feeding punishments are extremely rare, because as it is the system is slow to punish specifically to prevent people from being banned for just bad games.\n\n'Intentionally feeding' also doesn't necessarily mean \"went 0/20\". You could be 15/5 but if you intentionally handed those 5 deaths to the enemy, that's still intent feeding. Realistically no-one on boards is going to watch 20 games worth of replays without a substantial reason to doubt the judgement call that was made.\n\nPunishments typically follow a 4 tier system:\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n* 25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day ban\n* Permanent suspension\n\nUnderstandably gameplay offences skip the chat restriction tiers because those punishments would not be relevant. There is no lesser tier for gameplay offences because there is practically speaking no ambiguity there. Unlike chat where people have differing perspectives on what should or should not be acceptable, gameplay is pretty straightforward. It's pretty clear that intentionally feeding is a bad thing to do, hence you only get one warning that such behaviour can and will be punished.\n\nIf you still wish to appeal your punishment you can do so through player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you demonstrate good (or at least neutral) behaviour for a long enough period of time, your account will drop back into good standing, though it is not by any means a fast process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-12-21T23:49:54.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1/21 Cleanse, smite.
