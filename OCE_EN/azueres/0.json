I have 140k ip just sitting there and nothing to spend it on. So I was just wondering if you could make them cost IP instead of RP","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-26T22:56:15.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-26T05:18:13.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like this, but the idea of these icons is that 20% of the proceeds go to the team, whereas the other 80% of the proceeds go to other LCS stuff.
