Yeah that&#039;s not on. If you want to see the problem solved, why would you encourage it to grow?\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is why your comment is being deleted. Please be aware that any future attempts to encourage people into subverting punishment systems will also be removed.&quot;\r\n\r\nI want to see the problem solved correct, however im not complaining about your chat system, its about the game play system, that has been neglected and as a result the chat system is over tuned in an attempt to compensate, &quot;yeah that&#039;s not on&quot;. As far as my comment that was deleted is concerned, the problem i wanted to see solved was the trollers and flamers who screw you over first and you retaliating and you getting punished for reacting to them in any way slightly negative. And so if you are not allowed to react to them, &#039;cause quite frankly, what you (riot) sees as negative, seems to be normal communication in a negative *context*, i was giving a way to get back at them without you getting a punishment. If you guys actually worked on the game behavior side of oce league games, maybe you wouldn&#039;t be so backlogged with tickets as to why people are restricted or banned, because for the most part, no one enters a game &quot;looking&quot; to be negative, however you will have people entering a game, wanting to troll because of many different reasons (that i&#039;m willing to elaborate if you want me to). Whats&#039;s funny is you have little to no game play systems in place to catch these guys (from personal experience), however you have an extremely overturned system to catch anyone with negative behavior, however severe. So i just gave a way for people who get flamed or have (for example) gotten into another que with the guy who trolled them  in a previous game a way to get back at them by abusing the system at the same time. Go ahead, ban the comment, ban all comments that show you a way to subvert your out of whack system, instead of actually using those comments as constructive pieces to try and balance your system so you won&#039;t have people finding a way around it. \r\n\r\nThis post is more about the fairness of the systems. You have people breaking the summoners code first, in ways that you can detect, but your scared of its accuracy so you wont implement it, yet your punishing the retalitors because &quot;you can just mute them&quot;, little do you know they are trolling game play wise and you have not a single thing in the game that can stop that player from screwing you over, but who cares about context right?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-07T07:22:54.245+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So because the gameplay systems aren't perfect we should neglect to punish negative chat in the meantime? We should allow people to say shit like \"kys\" because if someone ints it'll take too long to catch them? I fail to see how those are related.\n\nAt any rate, looking at the deletion notice and the comment deleted it was removed because you were explicitly encouraging people to intent feed and telling them exactly how to do it, supposedly without getting caught. \"Getting back at them\" isn't justice, it's revenge, and it doesn't solve the problem, it just doubles it because now you're intent feeding as well.\n\nRegardless of the accuracy of your claims, encouraging people to intent feed with the promise of no consequences isn't ok, and *really* doesn't help anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-07T08:10:11.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I did not say it should be neglected and i have this feeling you didn't even read what i said. Not once did i say that chat should be neglected, its just over tuned to compensate for the lack luster game play system. Please sometimes when i see you reply to people its as if your in a fantasy world where you read what you want to read not what is actually said. You do this to a lot of people and i don't know if its ignorance or if you seriously take things out of proportion because you truly believe that is what you read.

If I misinterpreted I apologise, but from that comment it sounded like you feel that chat punishments should be reduced to be on par with gameplay punishments despite the fact that gameplay punishments aren't where they should be.\n\nI am unaware of how the two are meant to be related, and I personally don't feel that the chat system is overtuned, which I imagine is where the confusion came from. I'm not sure how punishing someone being abusive in chat is relevant to someone else intentionally feeding, so I am also unsure why you feel that the the chat is overtuned because of the gameplay.\n\n>Your paraphrasing needs serious work Seras\n\nI paraphrase to the best of my interpretation of meaning, not with the intent to \"put words in people's mouths\". If i've misinterpreted your meaning it's because I have a different perspective, which often is the case when responding to the kind of threads I respond to. Noone is perfect, and as much as I might wish I'm psychic sometimes, I am in fact not. I miss the mark sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-07T09:10:26.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"In short the game behavior system is not doing its job, lots of people get away with trolling, and so this creates a lot of negativity. You can mute people but can u mute people who are coming to your lane, taking your cs just to spite you? picking u up in tahms mouth and taking you to the enemy team? So people respond negatively, not even toxicly, just negatively and the chat system is picking up this negativity in riots attempt to say \"hey we are trying to make oce less toxic\". The problem here is people are being negative in response to trollers and this negativity wouldn't be there if the trollers were caught in the first place. That is the imbalance and that is why the chat system is over tuned. You can't exclude context when one side of the player behavior system is seriously out of touch.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-07T09:17:50.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's certainly an argument there. I don't wholly agree, but I definitely understand it. Those who start the negative experience not being picked up quick enough (or in some cases at all) means those prone to continuing it are more likely to do so. I don't think it's really a proper justification, nor do I think getting back at them is the answer, but I get the feeling we have different opinions of where the line between negativity and toxicity lies so I doubt we'll agree on that note.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-07T10:28:47.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'm trying to exploit it in hopes of riot pulling their finger out and actually doing something to fix it, i have read many threads and posts and the typical response lies in riot cant guarantee accuracy in the game play aspect of the system and i understand that. What i'm proposing is that if there is something done, the amount of people who submit tickets due to inaccurate restricts/bans for game play issues wouldn't be as much as the amount asking for chat reviews. If they were to implement something that would help them, its group reports for starters. If someone was reported by 3 of his team mates for griefing, to me that sounds like there is a high chance that player griefed. If there is a premade, just count their report as one otherwise it would get messy real quick. Just add a strike to their name like they would have gotten if they were toxic.\n\n\nOn another note i know 2 wrongs don't make a right but, getting back at someone makes it bearable. Yes it doesn't help toxicity in oce league, but it might make the player who instigated that reaction to think about it twice, rather than laughing in the post game chat knowing the person who responded negatively to their trolling got penalized.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-07T12:23:20.843+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scottez, did you fail ethics something fierce?","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-07T12:40:38.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Elaborate","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-07T13:15:40.841+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't get over this idea that you're meting out justice. As Seras mentioned, it's just retribution - something not conducive to a just society/community.\n\n\"Getting back at someone makes it bearable\": ethics fail.\n\nKeep this scenario in mind.\n\nWife comes home late from a party on Monday. Husband comes home from a party on Tuesday. Wife berates Husband. Husband says, \"But you were late yesterday!\" This doesn't change the fact that the Husband was late. It does nothing to address the Husband's lateness. It's a red herring and, if that was the end of it, it's a massive fail for justice.\n\nYou're doing something wrong and then saying it's correlated to or caused by someone else doing something wrong. That may be true, but the test is: is your transgression a transgression on its own merits? And turns out, it is! Whether you're doing something wrong to someone who has wronged you, or doing something wrong to someone who hasn't, it's still wrong. If it's the former, there's a motive for your \"crime\", but it's still the same crime.\n\nYou rob someone for robbing you. You're a motivated thief.\nYou rob a stranger. You're a thief.\n\nI feel I've done a shit job of explaining this.

However if there is an induced motive for said act, the punishment differs, that is my point from the start...\n\nIt was never about right or wrong, it's about actions being induced. We are human, not robots, we respond to trollers and unfortunately the system for game play offenses is super lack luster, and so the chat system is picking up player frustration in regards to the game play system\n","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-07T14:31:50.808+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Scottez,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=NNvHiElO,comment-id=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-07T13:49:13.990+0000)\n>\n> We are human, not robots, we respond to trollers\n\nI am human.\n\nI do *not* respond to trollers/griefers/feeders/flamers/what-have-you.\n\nWhat exactly is your point?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
