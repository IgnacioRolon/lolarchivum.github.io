Saying almost everyline was an insult or was used to belittle team mates in game 1 is a huge over exageration. Half the game i was trying to make sense as to why i was being attacked by my team instead of them trying to get malphite to play properly, furthermore all the malphite references past the very start of the game were replies to teamates asking me questions or telling me to do stuff and im giving them reasons as to why i cant (being malphite). Yes there were some things that were passive aggressive and maybe, 1 or 2 lines thats insulting, but they are minor insults at that. Game 2, same thing since when is asking for a report and calling out people inting, when they look like they are inting in your game, is all of that bannable? even chat restrictable? I have not insulted them, i have clearly just stated what it looks like they are doing to me, it has no affect on their gameplay what so ever. Its like saying when people make bad plays, thats not bannable is it? For game 3 there is one minor insult and i requested the ff once that game. Yes i called gg early on, but is that not a general reference to a bad team play and the game is pretty much over cause of that?","replies":[{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-09T16:47:11.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Scottez: 9x malph thanks\nScottez: dude is salty\nScottez: he fucked up\nScottez: and now hes taking cs and actin like a child\nScottez: cant be bothered\nScottez: with malph\nScottez: what a child\nScottez: can u guys\nScottez: pls report malph\nScottez: he should be in bed\nScottez: not ruining our games\nScottez: dont have ur shitty attitude\nScottez: go on\nScottez: since ur so full of ideas\nScottez: god im gonna report u too\nScottez: u clearly\nScottez: patronizing me\nScottez: how?\nScottez: i have malph following me around\nScottez: taking all my cs\nScottez: and inting their adc on sight\nScottez: and u have to audacity\nScottez: to ask me if iwant\nScottez: a report\nScottez: thats stupidity\nScottez: at its finest\nScottez: i said what ur doing\nScottez: is stupid\nScottez: not you\nScottez: are stupid\nScottez: but take it as u will\nScottez: im not afk\nScottez: im clearly at my keyboard\nScottez: whats negative\nScottez: u dont unerstand\nScottez: a single thing do you\nScottez: do u have a laner\nScottez: running around taking ur cs\nScottez: and inting\nScottez: so why are u\nScottez: acting like that\nScottez: your clearly\nScottez: acting oblivious\nScottez: to the malphite\nScottez: there is no way\nScottez: no single way\nScottez: you can be serious\nScottez: or else there is a mental hospital\nScottez: i advise a check up\nScottez: i worry for u\nScottez: sigh i dont udnerstand bronze attitude\nScottez: i can see the adc has a support following him and taking all his cs\nScottez: and inting the enemy\nScottez: lets trash talk him\nScottez: not tell the supp to get his head i nthe game\nScottez: and make the adc\nScottez: who actually was playing\nScottez: the game\nScottez: suffer\nScottez: great idea darius\nScottez: your not thinking\nScottez: retract that\nScottez: ur literally\nScottez: not thinking if you want to make me suffer\nScottez: im amazed no one\nScottez: no one at all\nScottez: has told malphite to play properly\nScottez: when hes the one\nScottez: let me do a quick\nScottez: op.gg\nScottez: on u and ori\nScottez: ok silver 2 with a negative w/r\nScottez: and gold 5\nScottez: with a negative w/r\nScottez: not surprised u guys\nScottez: are backing the guy who griefed ur game\nScottez: yes you clearly are\nScottez: not once\nScottez: did u tell him to get on with the game\nScottez: yet u had the audacity\nScottez: to talk shit to me\nScottez: no\nScottez: u clearly\nScottez: dont listen\nScottez: ur silver dude\nScottez: thats fact\nScottez: its not a good one\nScottez: yeh good one\nScottez: how about i come mid\nScottez: and follow u everywhere\nScottez: take all ur farm\nScottez: then u tell me im contributing\nScottez: its the end\nScottez: u fool\nScottez: 9x malph thanks\n\nI took out parts that I didn't think were negative.

However what annoys me is the fact that the system does not take reform into account. I, whole heartedly tried to reform, i did not swear at anyone, i didn't put anyone down in any significant way, i even said that i worried for the guy i told to visit a mental hospital for a checkup. My last reform card and even the previous ones were way worse than this and i copped them on the chin because they were generally toxic (the 14 day ban one was questionable). Another problem is riot putting a game where i was trolled as one of the games on the reform card. They took out all context so it looks like im just shitting on someone *for no reason*. Whats worse is everyone had almost nothing to say about game 2 and 3, the only other 2 significant games. I had people saying i spammed which is completly untrue. I said gg and ff once each game, called people inters once each game. The malphite game looks spammy because im replying to the team mates either asking me what happened/questioning what im saying or telling me what to do and im giving them reasons as to why i cant. This in my opinion is super controversial. Im now among 0.006% of league players that are toxic enough to get perma banned, tell me, does this look like 30% of league games (especially the one that i got trolled in) or 0.006%?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-12T10:02:29.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"To give you Riot's official policy on 'they started it'.\n\n> #WHY WAS I PUNISHED WHEN THE OTHER PERSON WAS WORSE OR STARTED IT\n\n>  Simply speaking, retaliation is not an acceptable or justifiable behavior.

If you are telling me i cant show my concern for someone who clearly has gone out of there way to screw someone over and direct them to a solution for a problem (you cannot deny trollers have a problem), then i understand why i got banned, because the people who do the banning have made an *automatic* system based off blatant subjective (not objective) rulings. Your literally telling me that what i said is wrong because its not a *positive* reality, rather its the \"negative\" reality and apparently that's not allowed. If *the reality* for a case is negative, that is how it is, there is no changing it, however you are subjectively looking at it and calling hate speech because you don't know any better and want to put people (me in this case) on a cross for stating how the situation is, and preaching how the situation could be in a *positive* way, which in this case, there is no positive, so it should have never been said.

Constantly calling for reports on specific players doesn't help either. Generally it's best just to ask once and leave it at that (either the other players will or wont report, but \"demanding\" it of them makes them less likely to do so). Also, it's possible the use of the term \"b!tch\" in game 2 may have contributed (generally a term used as a directed insult, not often used in an indirect manner).\n\nIf I had any advice for you, I'd recommend you try to focus on what *you* are doing in games. If someone else is doing the wrong thing, just try to play out the game without stooping so you can report them in the post-game lobby. Mute people if you feel you need to, you could even move the chat box off the side of the screen to keep it out of view. I know it can be difficult to deal with people who are like that, but ultimately it is better that you focus on you and keep a cool head, at least until you can take a break, so you don't get dragged down with them.\n\nWith that in mind, it might be a good idea to take a break from LoL (even online games in general) and focus on gaining control over how you react to these kinds of situations. Even if the ban isn't revoked (which doesn't seem likely, as I stated earlier) you have the option of starting anew with a fresh account, but that wont help the situation any if you're still behaving in this kind of manner, so it's better you take the time if you need it.","replies":[{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-03-14T01:56:05.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While re-reading this comment, especially the 3rd paragraph, i don't think you realize that the more you report people the lower your report is regarded in riots system, i think i only got 4 instant feedback reports that someone was punished for over about 2500 games of league, which nearly every single game, i sent at least one report (just an avg). so about 4 or 5 instant feedback reports in 2500 games seems like either the report system isn't working, or constantly reporting bad behavior, weather it be in game behavior or chat behavior doesn't work because of that stupid system that makes ur reports worth less the more you do it. Point is, people are this negative in the game ALL the time, its not rare, it is literally every 1/3 games at least, reporting does nothing, especially when people like me, who didn't send one significant insult get banned and others that literally say stuff like \"f* your mom\" and \"you suck so much shit\" don't even get a look. SO if i record every single game from now on, and send every negative piece of behavior to riot, will all of those guys get a chat restrict or suspension? will they get punished at all? Or is riot going to just pick on the few who actually made a significant mistake in the past (like i did with my first suspension last year) and leave them gaping for something so trivial?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-14T06:13:17.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing to keep in mind with the IFS is that it doesn't notify *everyone* who submits a valid report. Last I heard, it only notifies those who were the *most recent* reports prior to punishment (such as being in the game that triggers the punishment), so not receiving the notifications doesn't necessarily mean they were ignored, invalid or that the player wasn't punished, it just means that, if something did happen, you, personally, didn't receive the notification.\n\nGenerally, Riot wants people to report *any* behaviour they believe shouldn't exist within the game, it's those kinds of report that help shape what is and isn't acceptable in-game. As I understand it, the validity of reports is generally considered on a case-by-case basis, rather than based on the reporter's history with valid reports (though I imagine that players with an \"extreme\" amount of invalid reports would be treated as unreliable). If that's not the case, it doesn't really make sense for people to be reporting something they're not sure of, after all.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-09T05:39:21.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NP\n\nI might take a closer look a bit later when I'm not feeling so f*cked (been out most of the day, definitely feel like I need a bit of time to relax) and see if I can find anything else that may have contributed.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-03-09T09:56:08.516+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just some information on game 1, while it might look like i did alot of typing and no playing, after looking at my op.gg, i had similar dmg dealt to champs to another member of the team (not including malphite who trolled). equal 3rd most wards placed and the farm was so and so because well you have the chat logs.
