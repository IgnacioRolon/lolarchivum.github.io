I wish it wasn&#039;t that way...\r\n\r\nI&#039;d always wanted to have a drink with rumble... And maybe dinner with Lulu... Maybe not actually, I might be dinner if I say the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nYou know?.. I wanted to be one of them... but it&#039;s just a dream I guess...\r\n\r\nAs I hop up from my seat and close my book on runes, watching the Yordles go about their business, I decide to grab myself A Grysill berry shake.\r\n\r\n&quot;Hey Huiess&quot; I called out to the vendor as I approached.\r\n\r\n&quot;Desmon, You been avoidin&#039; me?&quot; replied he as he set about grabbing a few berries from a rough material sack which I knew hid behind the counter.\r\n\r\n&quot;Of course not.. But coins hard to come by these days, all of it goes to education, I&#039;m eating toe jam on toast&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;That&#039;s gross Desmon, But I hear what ya sayin&#039;&quot; he replied solemnly, &quot;I&#039;m Thinkin&#039; ah movin t&#039; demacia&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;No way..&quot; I cried, this news struck me hard, Huiess was a close friend of mine, his shakes were the only thing keeping me up at night when I needed to study. &quot;You can&#039;t go&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I ain&#039;t got no choice, just not enough money in Bandle these days... All the money makers are out there in the big cities.. I&#039;m barely scrapin&#039; by, I got a family t&#039; support... I&#039;ll miss ya buddy..&quot; he said, placing a wooden mug of Grysill berry juice on the counter, despite me never having asked for it..\r\n\r\n&quot;You know me too well Huiess... here, i&#039;ve-&quot; and I paused, his hand pressing on my shoulder as I fumbled the last few coin&#039;s I&#039;d had.\r\n\r\n&quot;It&#039;s on the house..&quot; he said with a shallow smile and a nod..\r\n\r\nI sighed, but if I contested it, he&#039;d get moapy... I guess maybe it really was goodbye..\r\n\r\n&quot;Remember me, when you&#039;re in the rift..&quot; he said to me, a subtle croak in his voice.\r\n\r\n&quot;You&#039;re not leaving today are you?&quot; I asked, concern thick in my voice.\r\n\r\n&quot;Ehh. waiting around here is costing me money, I&#039;d really only been open the last couple of days hoping to catch you to say goodbye.. You&#039;re my best customer..&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;You shouldn&#039;t have..&quot; I said as I shook my head, sipping at the usually sweet drink that&#039;d been made especially for me... It was bitter with disdain and a garnish of impending lonliness..\r\n\r\n&quot;Dont worry about it... I...&quot; and a sudden Crash, the building we stood beside exploded outward, jagged timber and stone looking to crush us both..\r\n\r\nMy runes.. everything I&#039;d been studying up to this point... My hopes... My dreams... My friend... It was all for nothing..\r\n\r\nNo...\r\n\r\nI put my hand out and mumbled the words under my breath as fast as I could... I had one shot... No mistakes... \r\n\r\nEverything around me was both quiet, and loud, the crashing of the stone and wood seemed dulled and slowed, like hearing it all through a pillow..\r\n\r\nHuiess had his arms wrapped around me now... He was afraid... As was I...\r\n\r\nThen everything was silent... I didn&#039;t dare open my eyes...\r\n\r\n&quot;Desmon.. Did we die..&quot;\r\n\r\nAt that moment I didn&#039;t really know... but with the sound of a skuffle nearby, I had to find out.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and the energy bubble had protected us from being crushed... But it wouldn&#039;t hold forever... \r\n\r\nI concentrated as hard as I could, in order to make the bubble explode, sending debree in all directions and freeing myself and my friend.\r\n\r\nAnd that&#039;s when I saw it, saw her... POPPY!\r\n\r\nShe was exchanging blows with an elder cinderhulk, which had unceremoniously set a few piles of debree on fire as it rampaged through the square.\r\n\r\n&quot;Go!... Huiess Go! Run home quickly, get your family and go..&quot;\r\n\r\nhe released me from his terror filled grasp and started bounding off...\r\n\r\n&quot;Wait.. What about you?&quot; he asked..\r\n\r\n&quot;This is my chance...&quot; I said as I started channeling another rune spell in my hands.. &quot;Today I get to be a hero..&quot;\r\n\r\nThat was the last time I remember seeing him... The smile he gave me was burned into my retina... It has forever given me hope when I needed it most.\r\n\r\nI fired the spell from my hand, and the electricity bounced from the giant burning creature, to poppy, then the creature once more, and then finally back to me... I&#039;d flinched something fierce when I saw my own spell rocketing back towards me... but when it struck me, I did not feel pain... in fact.. I felt empowered... Did I do that?.. I think I might have overcharged that spell..\r\n\r\n&quot;Hey!.. That was a good shot!&quot; called poppy out to me from across the square, her hammer was ignited in a beautiful elecric blue light, and that giant cinderhulk creature turning to face me, i&#039;d barely scratched the surface, but it seemed like that had warrented a retaliation &quot;Here, catch!&quot; poppy called, her eyes gathering this information as well.\r\n\r\nAnd with a hammer sailing towards me, far too large for me to even hope of weilding properly, and a creature looking to crush me with a closed fist, I had realised that perhaps today was not a good day to be a hero.\r\n\r\nWhen the hammer struck me I was sent sailing backwards, barely missing becoming a yordle pancake, rolling to a painful halt against a bench. &quot;Ow... Hey.. I can&#039;t use this!&quot; I called out to poppy, shouted as hard as my lungs would allow...\r\n\r\n&quot;What.. Are you sure!?&quot; she asked, seeming to be in disbelief that I wasn&#039;t able to use a weapon as large as I was.\r\n\r\nBut by this time the cinderhulk was reeling up for another strike... I scaled my mind for something, anything, I had to get out of there.. \r\n\r\nI raised my hand and pointed off towards poppy, mumbling, praying, hoping I&#039;d remembered every runeword correctly.. Something wasn&#039;t right... it wasn&#039;t working... And the cinderhulks arm was cascading towards me at blinding speed, he&#039;s going to send me off into the stratosphere... \r\n\r\nI closed my eyes tightly and hugged that hammer as if it was the link between life itself.\r\n\r\n&quot;That was cool.. you&#039;ve gotta teach me how to do that..&quot; said Poppy, like she was right next to me...\r\n\r\nI heard the swooping sound of the cinderhulks strike shatter another building, but it sounded pretty far off...\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes.. And I was across the courtyard beside poppy, quivering like a fearful idiot... And when I realized this, I hopped off of her hammer and offered it back... \r\n\r\n&quot;Ahh, this is yours..&quot; I said, holding it out for her, well, leaning it towards her because I couldn&#039;t get it off the ground, and she claimed it with one hand, like it was nothing at all... \r\n\r\n&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked, sounding unsure herself, and a little disheartened that I did not, and could not take that which she&#039;d offered me..\r\n\r\n&quot;Yeah..&quot; I nodded with a sigh, looking off towards the creature that was searching the debree for what I had assumed was me..\r\n\r\n&quot;Hey, chin up.. Why don&#039;t you help me with this?&quot; she asked excitedly, nudging my shoulder with her fist and flicking her head towards the metaphorical Gigaphant in the room.\r\n\r\n&quot;Bandle could always use more heroes..&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:22:04.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's refreshing to read a story told through the perspective of a 'civilian', rather than a hero.
