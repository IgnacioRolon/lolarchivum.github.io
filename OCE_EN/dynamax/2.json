But it seems like every time I play him, the enemy lanes get super fed and wreck us. Even when I build loads of tank, they still delete me. I just feel like I can't hold out the game long enough to get super fed and carry. Any tips for me?\r\n\r\nAlso; regular baron buffed minions take 3 Qs from a 800 stacked Nasus with triforce to kill. So op.\r\n\r\n{{champion:39}} {{champion:75}}","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-27T10:21:28.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frozen heart and Spirit visage are core on him, sheen item is situational and mostly a late game item\n\nIf against AD, rush {{item:3110}} \nIf against AP, rush {{item:3065}} \n\nThen build tank depending on the enemy team, and finish off with a triforce/iceborn gauntlet.\n\nNasus is kited easily and since triforce is such a big investment early he just dies due to not being tanky, never rush iceborn gauntlet, the aoe pushes your lane making it harder to cs, and the aoe creep kills don't count towards stacks.\n\nAlso once you reach 400+ stacks start grouping and just getting stacks whenever you can.\n\nExample late game build: {{item:3110}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3265}} {{item:3078}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-27T08:28:36.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't ever build IBG. it's trash, just don't. you're better off getting a FH and triforce.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-27T05:37:50.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some things i've learned form playing Nasus a little last season:\n\n1. Don't get greedy for stacks. 300-400 is more then enough to take towers with, so don't sit there stacking every creep as your team is constantly dying.\n2. Nasus is all about creating pressure. Threatening to take towers and forcing the enemy to chase you is a lot better then the enemy constantly killing your team.\n3. Sometimes grouping is the answer. Most Nasus' get stuck with the idea, \"im Nasus, I splitpush and kill towers\". Sometimes you just gotta group and help.\n\nAlso if you think Baron minions are tough, try Q'ing that damn scuttle crab after he's been killed 5-6 times already LOL can 2-hit blue buff, little crab takes 5.\n\nSituational Advice: Swap with bot lane if they are feeding. If the enemy has a short-range ad, Nasus can farm under tower pretty safely 2v1 and can bait a dive with his Ult which can usually mean he gets 1 or 2 kills before going down.\nThis is situational though and only works if all the towers are still up, you are level 6, and you already have a Frozen Heart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-27T04:26:56.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nasus isn't just to build completely tank and call it a day, Sheen related items give him a huge boosts too.\n\nWhen you play Nasus you look for these stats:\n1. CDR\n2. HP\n3. Armour/Resistances\n4. Avoid buying Sunfire at any cost.\n\nIf you're ahead or even with the lane opponent you can consider getting perhaps an {{item:3025}}, or just a {{item:3057}} for {{item:3078}} later on.\n\nOtherwise, {{item:3110}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3026}}, are your buddies, go get them (value the situation).\n\nFarm and farm, and get big.","replies":[]}]}
