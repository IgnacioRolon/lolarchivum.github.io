It seems pretty silly to me to be honest, it&#039;s not like leaving a CUSTOM GAME will set back your team or anything. I got stuck like this for a long time, and I went and did other things, but I couldn&#039;t play LoL.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Riot, please allow us to leave customs games.

Thank you.\n\nYou can leave custom games under 1 condition(there might be others but this is the main 1 i know) all PvP Summoners leave game (playing ones not spectators) Spectators will just get kicked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-29T06:05:45.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yeah i remember you in that game.\n\nPretty sure you were raging or something.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-30T00:15:20.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because his stuck in a game with idiots","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-29T07:39:20.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you choose who plays and who doesn't, doesn't mean you should be allowed to abandon team mates and enemies.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-29T08:54:59.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What it does mean is that you can dictate when those team mates and enemies can leave the current game and play another one.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-29T09:00:56.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AN58KqiA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-03-29T08:54:59.017+0000)\n>\n> What it does mean is that you can dictate when those team mates and enemies can leave the current game and play another one.\n\nYes, but that's if every player doesn't want to play anymore.
