I was in the client, updating my game, and I was looking at the free champions for the week as you do. Varus is apparently a marksman/mage? I mean, he can be a mage, and he has ap scaling but... It makes it seem like he's meant to be built as a hybrid.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ryze is a mage/fighter? I'm going to check this properly once my game updates and go into the champion section of my profile, just to check it isn't a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-02-26T06:31:14.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AP varus is actually quite powerful, his burst is way higher than you would think, but it isn't instant you need 3 W stacks on them for any real damage, thats why he isn't played AP so much, people prefer the annie type burst (hover the cursor over the enemy and run your fingers across the buttons)","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-26T06:08:32.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the definitions and technically they are those things. Mage doesn't necessarily mean AP, and fighter doesnt mean AD.\n\nFighters are close range combatants that possess a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. While they don't have as much utility as a tank or as much damage as an assassin, a fighter's damage will add up over time to make it a major threat.\n\nMages are mostly ranged champions who prioritize powerful abilities over basic attacks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-02-26T06:10:06.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mm, I guess you're right technically, just seems a bit out of place to me, that's all.","replies":[]}]}]}
