Twitch was AFK for the first 20 minutes then came back and went like 1/15. WW was AFK at the end, and that's not the worst part.\r\n\r\nRight at the end of the game, we had an amazing 3v5 teamfight where we aced them, with me, Tryndamere and Sona ult and we were pushing hard down mid. As we got their inhib we had about 20 seconds, and I knew we could end with our pushing power. But then, bloody Tryndamere decides to go top and farm, as full build nonetheless.\r\n\r\nWhen they respawned and killed me and Sona, trying desperately to finish off the nexus, which was at half HP, they pushed back and won.\r\n\r\nI don't wanna blame, but if we had Trynd with us, we could have easily won the game.
