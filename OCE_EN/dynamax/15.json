I'm not going to say I was perfect at all in my games, but there's so much shit I have to deal with it makes it hard to play.\r\n\r\nOne game we were so far ahead then Yasuo and WW decided to fight over nothing all game and went afk. We had a first time ADC bot, like really. She played Cait and just stood there auto attacking all game, and ulted when she was right on top of enemies.\r\n\r\nAll people want to do in this game is fight and argue, and I just can't calm anyone down. I don't belive in \"Elo Hell' or anything, but the amount of people that just throw games for no reason is appalling.\r\n\r\nI ended up 1/9 in my promos. I'm not saying I deserved to win them all, but I'm saying that there's never any GG. I can't remember the last time I had a great game, where I had fun and the game was fair.\r\n\r\nI know now why people avoid ranked, people are just so stupid, saying they want to win they yell and cry and rage all game and the smallest things. I'm not saying I'm better than bronze, because I just don't know what rank I truly am.\r\n\r\nThis has been an angry blogger, signing off.\r\n\r\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[{"poster":"ghost cat","date":"2015-01-30T16:14:23.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't let a set of numbers and words define who you are and what you can achieve.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-29T13:33:12.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 tip, don't play ranked when the sky is dark.\n\nBonus tip, calm yourself and set yourself as an example, if you just do that with minimal typing sometimes people would just cease arguing together, it's not the best tip in the world but it's something.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-30T06:23:49.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=pT3lLn6z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-29T13:33:12.737+0000)\n>\n> 1 tip, don't play ranked when the sky is dark.\n\nIve found the majority of the time, 3pm-12pm has the most consistant players. Anything after 1:30am consists of people who are too tired to play any good and dgf about feeding. from 1:30am to 9am is just a No Go Zone.","replies":[]}]}]}
