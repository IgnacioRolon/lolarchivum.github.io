I was just doing my own thing, and then riven ulted and killed me while I was invisible. I assumed there was a pink nearby or something, but I tried again. I placed my own pink, checked everywhere and she kept doing it. She always seemed to know where I was too. Can someone explain the logic? I KNOW some of those places weren't warded thanks to my pink. Pls. I must know what.","replies":[{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-02-22T21:14:56.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, if you were in lane, maybe you were too close to minions and she saw you go invisible. Maybe she did have a ward and it expired just before you placed your pink, or had a ward just outside of your pink's range that you passed by and she guessed where you were. If you were sitting right on top of a pink or close to it, it might have been a giveaway, especially if she saw you heading in the direction of your ward. Or, maybe she was just guessing because you had a predictable pattern of play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dec3mber","date":"2015-02-22T03:45:30.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were probably incredibly obvious as to where you were hiding","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-02-22T01:31:06.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you think of a way, other than haxs, as to why? then incorporate that into your play style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-21T10:55:49.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hax logic","replies":[]}]}
