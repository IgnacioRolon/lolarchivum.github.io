She was supporting, and as far as I could tell, playing seriously until her adc died, and she started flaming. Then she pretty much stopped caring and messing around.\r\n\r\nI don't encourage trolling, but it was norms and she was being pretty funny so I started running around with her doing stuff. Just having a good old time.\r\n\r\nAfter the game, she mystery gifted me, saying 'teehee'. I thought this was really nice, (although it was a heimer skin) and added her, to say thanks. Immediately, she said, mind my language, \"f*** off g** c***\", and unfriended me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: She just re added me and hasn't said anything yet. I dunno, weird person I guess.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2: Said \"that heimer skin is cool lols\", and unfriended me.\r\n\r\nWeirdest person I've met on LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-02-07T07:56:45.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You got reverse scammed.\n\nThat makes you the scammer.\n\nYou should probably turn yourself in to the police.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-02-07T07:27:18.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"must be an autist","replies":[{"poster":"Problematictroll","date":"2015-02-07T07:48:12.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wumachine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=I9x8rtfo,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-07T07:27:18.796+0000)\n>\n> must be an autist\n\nNot an unreasonable suggestion.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-07T14:18:17.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually thought this was my friend that started trolling in a game as anivia, but then i thought \"no wait, he wouldn't mystery gift people\"","replies":[]}]}
