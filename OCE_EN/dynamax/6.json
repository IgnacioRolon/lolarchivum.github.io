I know everyone says go in with the mindset of 'I must carry my team' but it seems like I'm the only one with that goal in mind.\r\n\r\nIn one of my games, we got invaded and they didn't even get anything from it, but our Udyr was getting mad at us for some reason.\r\n\r\nI try to be a great guy in ranked, I congratulate people on kills, make jokes in champ select, apologise for any mistake I make. Even with this, everyone just gives up.\r\n\r\nIt's nothing like this in norms, people just don't care. One of my games was 1-38 kills.\r\n\r\nI had 1 death and 1 assist. Everyone just argues and cries, and no matter what I say I can't calm anyone down.\r\n\r\nAnyone got any suggestions for me? Looking for any advice.\r\n\r\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-28T12:41:54.941+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"sharing kills with your team helps them to stop and calm down, if you can get people to listen to you then you can lead them, there has been multiple times where i have lead a team that was sure to defeat to victory just cause we stopped and we teamed well, took objectives and shared the kills. also if you have tips on any champs people are playing then advise them on it, you always going to get d*ck heads who think that everyone is bad and he is just the best and rants, you just ignore him and try and get the rest of the team to team together and win, also when other lanes are struggling and you are dominate in your lane, go help the other lanes out, share the wealth of your success and let your other lanes get fed as well. OBJECTIVES ARE KEY. dragon buff is very strong now and to have 5 stacks of it will do your team wonders, and take towers whenever you can. but in bronze you tend to have people who couldn't care less and just troll but there is nothing you can do. and also, HAVE FUN, its a game, relax have fun, when you are more relaxed you play better, just keep being nice in the comity of ranked and you never know, someone might just take on your way of being nice and become nice, we have a toxic community but together one by one we can make this community better and less toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-01-28T12:37:54.716+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm on the verge of giving up on the people/game.

Do focus on your own game, do focus on improving and learning from every game. If you can do that winning will come as a side effect.\n\n* What's the main point of solo queue for you? Personally for me its all about being the best player I can be. How can I improve and climb the ladder till I am happy with my current skill level? It's all about **learning**. How do I die less? how do I impact the game more? how do I pressure the map? how do I control vision? how do I do everything better? The focus is on myself. It's all about doing everything in my control to impact the game positively and learning what else I can do to impact the game more. If you learn and improve from every game and find enjoyment from that then win or lose it doesn't matter as much. As long as you're improving every game! Winning will come as a side effect if you have this mindset\n\n\n* One thing that has helped me the **MOST** in changing my mindset to purely focus on myself is to look at my own KDA ((kills+assists)/deaths) every game. Personally I have a mind set of \"If I don't get **X** KDA then I did not impact the game enough to win (I wasn't good enough there is more to learn)\"\nFor me right now that X is 4, if I don't get  a KDA of 4 or more I heavily review why I died so much or why I didn't get assists or why I didn't get any kills. Why did I not influence the game enough?\nIn your 6 losses I would say you *should* have won 2 (see below image)\nhttp://puu.sh/fabrR/e53f20c58c.png\nYou only had 2 games with a KDA of 3 or more. Maybe go back and think about what you could have done to make more positive impact on the game (more kills + assists, less kills)","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-29T06:36:07.253+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey bro, thanks heaps for the wise words :D\n\nI'm gonna have some more practice, and try to improve.\n\nOn the bright side, if I get bronze, I'll have a fitting name\n\n{{champion:39}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-01-29T00:00:25.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good KDA doesn't mean you should win imo, im noob though.","replies":[{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-01-29T00:01:36.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or if it does can you look at my kda in last 10 losses please and give me proper compensation(IP wise) for those losses.

What was trying to say is that it is a great indicator of the type of impact you are making on the game (enough impact for a win?).\n\nIf you look throughout anyones KDA history (I wish there was a tool for this) you will notice that more often than not it looks like this:\nhttp://puu.sh/fancp/51ebd1d61e.jpg\n(green dot is a win, red dot is a loss. The higher the dot is means the higher the KDA was for that game. The lower the dot is means the lower the KDA was for that game. See how most of the Red dots (losses) are around 3KDA or less and most of the green dots are around 5+ KDA)\n\nAs you can see if your KDA is around 4+ (probably closer to 5-7) you will win most of your games. (Image is taken from this [Gbay99 video](http://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc))\n\nIn your last 10 ranked losses you didn't have any games over 4 KDA. You did have 3 games with 3+ kda which is pretty decent Badluck on those. So in the other **SEVEN** losses I think you personally could have done a lot to impact the game more. \nhttp://puu.sh/fanD3/25e3c5304c.png\n\nMy quick analysis would be you should really look at why you're dying so much.\nYou even have what looks like a troll Vel Koz game, try not to do that -_-.","replies":[{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-02-15T05:14:41.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game against you and you rekd my team with your sexy vi skills.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-29T00:29:54.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that pic helps. he says he had a game of 1 to 36 or smt. and he went 0-1-1 he said...but in none of them did he get close to that...lol","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-29T06:32:03.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was 0-1-1 ish at some point in that game.

Sometimes just holding your own lane and not leaving it can be considered carrying as you are forcing the opposite team to send resources to you. \n\nIn norms, people don't take things that seriously, in rank however, everyone thinks they are LCS pros and expect big plays. However, they tend to forget that everyone has their own play style and don't often sync. \n\nYou have a more mature mindset and perhaps, you need a likewise duo partner to help you ease some pressure in game.","replies":[]}]}
