Don't try to blame anyone for anything that was my fault. So I never understood the whole 'elo hell' thing. But today I was playing with my friend, level 28 but he hardly plays. My god, down there it is ROUGH. people go like 0/12 in lane alone, and keep trying to 1v1 people. It isn't 'noob teams', it's more, people just don't know what to do when they're behind, so everyone snowballs so hard. Not sure if everyone is like my friend, who hates criticism, and doesn't take the game seriously whatsoever, or if people just don't understand basics of the game. What do you guys think?\r\n\r\n{{item:2010}}","replies":[{"poster":"King Kliftos","date":"2014-12-04T07:22:17.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. I pretty mediocre player (lvl 30 for a while now, over 300 normal games) so never tried ranked, so I thought elo hell referred to bronze 5 people trying to move up.\nBut I agree there is a lot of bad play and bad players in normals, deliberate or just bad I don't know.\n\n It is so beautiful and fun when you get 5 half decent players who call sensibly at start, work together and just wanna have fun. Even if you lose it's not a bad feeling. But this is only about 1 in 5 games.\n\n At least 2 in 5 games have afkers or bad conxns, and the other 2 in 5 have toxic or trolls or just so bad they feed and will not listen, Only yesterday I had a game where someone wenr 0/22/2 and still insisted on leaping right in every chance they got.   We  need a tribunal and we need a 'remedial class' these people can be banished to for 6 months or so.","replies":[]}]}
