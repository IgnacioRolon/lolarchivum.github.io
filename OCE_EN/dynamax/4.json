But when those people instantly give up and go like 0/11...\r\n\r\nIdk I just feel like down here, people give up way too easy. Games could be turned around easily if people didn&#039;t give up. I didn&#039;t do too well last game, but I came back and ended up with a half decent score. I wish there was just some way to make people not give up.. :(","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-30T00:28:29.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's annoying but it happens. Try to up their morale with one or two positive comments  like \"bot is ahead, they will carry\" or something similar. Don't spend to much time trying to convince them though or it will start to distract you from the game. Sometimes you can identify people who are more likely to give up or flame just based on their manner in champ select (particularly people who main snowbally champs in my experience), so it might be in your interest to put more effort into making sure they dont get behind.\n\nAlso remember there are 5 people on the enemy team who also give up easily, even if you don't notice it as much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-05-28T13:15:05.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I love the insurances you made at the start so you don't get flamed by some a**hole.\n\nA lot of people overdo being a troll because they have given up in general, though my last norm game was a bit extreme :/\n\nthe whole chatlog was flame at me from like 5 minutes to 17 and then it was just ffs surrender after that (I did the best on the team :/)","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-29T05:09:41.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That moment when someone calls you bad when you are 5/8/2 and they are 0/13/5 xD\n\nI agree with the poster, people just give up way too easily. It seems that people always think the first turret or kill of the game determines the outcome. All it takes is a good team fight to turn a game around. Heck, I remember one game where we were 20k gold behind and were 20 kills behind with 3 dragons compared to their 5. They went to Baron, we stole it, cleaned up, aced them, pushed mid, and won. The entire 60 minute game turned around in 3 minutes of gameplay.\n\nI reckon people should just stick to it and chill out. #teamworkOP","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-05-29T02:59:25.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cuz irelia brags about how useless garen is and how good she is, then goes 0/15\n\nits bronze, I want to give up trying to make peace between people, only like 2/15 people actualy listen to me and calm down, most the time they give up and fight all game","replies":[]}]}
