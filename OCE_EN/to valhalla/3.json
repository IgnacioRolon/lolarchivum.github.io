Fucking disappointed. And now it seems I met another person acting as a girl or maybe is actually a girl. And what really seems suspicious is that she doesn't have Facebook or Instagram, hmm kind of suspicious. So what's your thoughts guys? Would you believe that she's a girl","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-08T17:41:24.097+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur getting baited by boys and u like it ","replies":[{"poster":"TO VALHALLA","date":"2015-01-08T23:58:57.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldn't it be gay on his side acting as a girl?","replies":[{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-01-09T01:01:26.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They probably just get a kick out of it.. it is pretty funny though.
