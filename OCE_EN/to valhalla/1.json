I usually play on 38 ping with no interruptions BUT NOW my ping is suddenly 120 ping ON EVERY SINGLE GAME. I can&#039;t play with this bullshit and I&#039;ve already lost many games including ranks due to this. Yes I&#039;ve turned off my router and my computer is wireless not wired. Is their anything that riot can do to fix this? Or something I can do.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-23T11:32:24.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably the servers. Wait a bit and see if they improve.
