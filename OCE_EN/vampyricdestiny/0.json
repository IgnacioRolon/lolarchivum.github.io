Can play co-op ai or normal. Preferably lower level (10-20 : although anything really - it looks like most people on here are lv 30)\r\nAt time of writing this I am lvl 11.\r\nPlaying on the Oceania Servers. I don&#039;t mind what position I play - I need to learn them all anyway.\r\nPlayers who just want to have fun (and hopefully win) and know that it is just a game and not life an death.\r\nThanks all","replies":[]}
