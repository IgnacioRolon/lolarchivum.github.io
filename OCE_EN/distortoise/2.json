I asked for a gank for my bot lane and he told us to &quot;shut&quot;&quot;the #### up&quot; in 2 messages shortly after each other, the Zoe mid lane also admitted to account sharing after the game and I doubt she was punished for that. It was a very difficult game to last through when our Gragas who was clearly purposely trying to throw the game and starting dancing in our base letting the minions kill our nexus and the enemy Zoe just kept feeding more and more kills then flaming our bot lane. (_Not to mention the 11 ganks on our bot lane_)\r\n\r\n I believe this ban was pretty unfairly received seeing I haven&#039;t received any kind of formal invoice that they have been punished, clearly being the ones in the wrong. I constantly see this truly toxic behavior going unpunished now when others are punished for merely banter between each other. I know now from my constant reports and everything I have probably been moved to your ignore list which I know is a real thing that exists, but it is all true I encounter this toxicity daily and I can&#039;t stand to see this behavior go unpunished when all I do is lose my cool and use the word &quot;garbage&quot; while I get practically inted and griefed by half of my team. What you are doing is not enough, you need proper peer reviews and to stop trying to punish victims of those subjected to this kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nThat is all I have to say this post, please respond I would like to have a discussion. Here I go trying this again...\r\n{{sticker:sg-poppy}} \r\nThis is unbearable though, please wipe the ban and give my account a clean slate. I have never been punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Assault","date":"2018-01-24T09:05:31.064+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like this chat ban isn't fair. I was in the game when this happened and immediately after asking for a gank from our jungler we were sworn at making the game even more infuriating as the enemy jungler was trying his hardest to make our lane difficult and to top it off our team was not even trying to play a game we were still trying to win, our Gragas was dancing at our nexus turrets while they were being destroyed and our Zoe finished the game off with 21 deaths after making no attempt at all to help us win the game. It isn't right to bait a reaction out of someone and then ban them for it.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-24T13:09:28.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing you can do but be thankful that it was only a chat restriction regardless of what was said.

Just because you didn't receive one doesn't mean there was no punishment.\n\nRegardless, you are judged on your behaviour, which is why you are only shown your logs. If shown all the logs do you think you would be looking at your behaviour, or simply justifying it by what others said first? Everyone gets frustrated, especially when you have toxic players on your team, but being toxic back only makes you just as bad as them.\n\nYou mentioned you looked at your logs and realised what you said was pretty bad, that's the idea here. Remember though, that a chat restriction is essentially a warning. It's to make you take a step back and really look at the kind of behaviour you're demonstrating in game. Majority of players after receiving a punishment never see another.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-24T11:37:08.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"screenshot chat logs pls not sure if bs see this stuff alot but this has also happened to me when i was communicating with my team riot support basically shoved me away","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T00:02:07.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"“I believe this ban was pretty unfairly received seeing I haven't received any kind of formal invoice that they have been punished, clearly being the ones in the wrong.“ \n\n\nYou think you have the right to know when other people get banned...... read riots policies please, no players accounts details will be shared with anyone..,and anyway you won’t find much luck here on boards so best to submit support ticket no matter how slow but even better just take the chat restriction and learn from mistakes :)","replies":[]}]}
