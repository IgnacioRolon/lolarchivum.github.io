Riot are the result of their own downfall... and they'll have to deal with the repercussions in a few years.\n\n\nP.S: This forum is full of Riot nut huggers - so they're going to give you some generic reply justifying your ban; they're as toxic with their lack of contribution to society, and are too worried about getting other players banned as their sole kick of satisfaction in their lives.","replies":[{"poster":"çasper","date":"2018-06-13T10:58:28.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"im glad im not the only one that thinks riot banning system is corrupt. allowing anyone to report me. even if its a meme, i get banned","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-14T09:36:44.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Reports don't mean anything if they are invalid. Vast majority of the time if you hadn't done anything that broke the guidelines you wouldn't have been punished. False positives are rare.\n\nRiot doesn't give out information on other people punishments (be that the what, why or how) for the sake of privacy and to encourage reform/prevent witch-hunting.\n\nAs for your own punishment, we can't tell you anything beyond the extremely basic without knowing why you were punished. If you want community feedback on your ban I'd recommend posting your reform card (or at least your chat logs). Whether or not you have had any previous punishments also determines a lot and is very useful information for feedback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aesseus","date":"2018-07-06T03:31:51.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have a lot of vested emotion into a game that's supposedly trash.\n\nThis is the problem with angry people such as yourself, you can never self criticise and take responsibility of your behaviour that's why you were banned.

The toxic people/inters that I report do get banned. So the system does work and it isn't all that bad. However, there were like 2 inters who are yet to be banned. If you int in the game and don't say a single word, you don't get banned (for whatever reason). ","replies":[]}]}
