But about 3 days ago I started getting what is said to be 35-60 but it feels nowhere near that. I have tried this website: http://deepfocus.io/lol_ping.php and it says I&#039;m getting about 100 but fluctuating wildly. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried using a VPN and it is the same issue even if I use servers from all around Australia. \r\n\r\nThat makes me think that *I* am the issue, but when I use the Telstra speediest I get 10ms ping to Telstra every time (unless I select a server in Melbourne or something). \r\n\r\nMy connection feels super fast for everything else. I&#039;ve tried disconnecting literally every other computer, I&#039;ve tried enabling and disabling QOS on my router. \r\n\r\nCan anyone offer any ideas? I really can&#039;t think of anything it could be.","replies":[{"poster":"deceit1520","date":"2018-07-18T10:20:28.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um did you not get the memo where Telstra said they had failed to provide us with top internet?jeepers even new Zealand has superior internet....let that sink in ppl,nz has superior internet","replies":[]}]}
