Perfect well needed for the game again works beautifully. But I feel like the Tribunal system.. Doesn&#039;t even punish a single player at all.

One report will see the game reviewed, and any valid report will either mark the account (if the behaviour was not severe/consistent enough for immediate punishment) or will trigger a punishment.\n\n> nothing happens at all\n\nRegrettably there is a severe lack of report feedback right now, there is only one notification that someone has been punished that very few people see, and it is very unclear what actually prompts that notification to show (the theory is that it's the last games worth of reports that trigger a punishment). That said, that doesn't mean people don't get punished, only that there isn't good visibility when they do.\n\n> the whole tribunal system\n\nThe tribunal system (player based review) is not currently implemented, and in fact never has been on OCE. At present it is an automated learning system that is backed by manual (Riot based) review. New tribunal is coming 'soon' which will improve the speed, efficiency and community values of the punishment systems, however we have no specific timetable on it's release (my guess would be fairly soon after the new client replaces the legacy client).\n\n> Doesn't even punish a single player at all\n\nI would recommend looking through the player behaviour board here, you will find plenty of example of people being punished for their behaviour, be it cheating, boosting, toxicity or anything else worthy.\n\n> But that it? chat ban?\n\n[**Punishments generally follow a basic escalation path**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)\n\n** First Offense:** 10 Game Chat Restriction\n**Second Offense:** 25 Game Chat Restriction\n**Third Offense: **Two Week Suspension\n**Fourth Offense: **Permanent Suspension\n\nExcept in extreme cases such as hate speech and death threats (or consistent gameplay abuse or cheating) they will be received in order.\n\nIt is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behaviour in the game. Excessive negative behaviour or behaviours like intent feeding will result in a Two-Week suspension (or higher if truly excessive) at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-08T01:30:09.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah I just find it annoying, you can't really play a single game without flaming people and when you do mute them they ping you every second and keep going the whole game and you can't mute their pings","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-08T02:45:39.594+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"It is understandably frustrating, so I would like to suggest something. Try creating something akin to a game diary, there is merit in focusing on your gameplay here but I want you to consider trying something a bit different. Mark down every player in the game (use their champions, not their summoner names, you want to be able to let go of negativity not hold on to it) and put next to them positive, neutral or negative.\n\nNegativity is a lot louder, and much more readily remembered, but by writing it down this way, after a few games I think you'll start to see a pattern. Namely that there are far more positive or neutral players than their are negative ones. It may seem insignificant or you may think \"I know that but it doesn't stop the negative players from affecting my games\" but it's a _**tangible**_ piece of perspective, a visible representation of what is the majority. It may just change the feeling you go into games with, if only a little, because it sounds like at the moment you go into games dreading the inevitable toxic, when that isn't quite the case.\n\nAs an extra, it may also be worth noting why they were negative. Were they frustrated at the perceived incompetence of others? Were they trolling for shits and giggles? Were they playing badly and tilting? The percentage of the community that is consistently negative is very small, and the percentage of those that go into games with the sole purpose of ruining it for others is _**tiny**_. Again, it's all about creating that tangible perspective.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-08-06T02:40:56.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito be like \"THEY DINDU NUFFIN MANE, THEY DINDU NUFFIN WONG\"\n\nThus, nothing will  happen","replies":[]}]}
