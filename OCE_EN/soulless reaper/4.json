I must say, I am very impressed. It&#039;s amazing\nThe detail is stunning, you haven&#039;t rushed it. It seems weird to use, but that is simply because I&#039;m use to the original client.\nBut Riot Games. You have made an amazing Client.\n\nAll give yourselves a pat on the back! All of you deserve it. Keep it up Riot Games!\n\nKind regards,\nSoulless Reaper","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-06T23:04:08.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i personally think the interface is too much like dont get me wrong looks awesome but less is more imo its interesting but i prefer the current client now","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-11-07T01:21:58.795+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea.
