But I&#039;ve had roughly 20-30 games and I haven&#039;t got a single Key frag, I get heaps of S- and above. I get roughly an S- every 5th game. I am winning games but I just seem to get nothing out of it. I get chests but I don&#039;t get a single Key fragment. Now this is going to be typical cause I bet yah after this game I will get a Key fragment. Knowing my luck.. :D.. ?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-16T00:49:48.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHere is the information I currently know about the key fragment drop system.\n\n**How does the key fragment drop rate work? Will you ever add a way to achieve a key or key fragments?**\n\nThis is how the current tuning of the drop rate works:\n\n* It is possible to earn enough key fragments to open every chest you find in 4 week period.\n* You have to win to earn a key fragment. Performance does not factor into the drop rate outside of this.\n* You can earn key fragments in any mode that yields champion mastery points.\n* The drops are somewhat based on luck, but it’s weighted such that after a certain number of wins if you didn’t get a fragment we’ll just force a drop to avoid being screwed by RNG.\n* Getting enough keys to open 4 chests in a 4 week period is hard and requires a lot of play, but anybody can do it if they play enough.\n* We don’t have any plans to add additional ways to get key fragments atm, but it’s something we may do in the future.","replies":[]}]}
