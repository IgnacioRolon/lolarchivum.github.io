But it&#039;s just not fair that someone can do that, and then report, he was a complete nuisance, and the game was unplayable and really depressing. Guys like this need to be permabanned, with ip traced and all. Riot pls.","replies":[{"poster":"deathmaths11","date":"2017-11-10T06:16:57.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really hard for riot to do what you say. l think it will be better if you provide evidence. otherwise, he or some random dude can say the same thing about you or other people. if this happens the next time and it really bothers you, screenshot it or record it, then show it to riot. maybe that can make a difference","replies":[]}]}
