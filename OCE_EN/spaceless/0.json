Im level 117 and im still struggling to play the game due to wanting to try out new champs but i just cant because getting blue essence is such a pain in the ass due to the amount you get is on an RNG basis. It pisses me off having to make alt accounts just to get enough essence to try out a new champ because getting a champ at high levels is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nAll i ask is a new, more consistent way to get BE like better paying missions, maybe get a small amount for going up in mastery score on champions etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-16T08:10:59.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're playing 6-8 hours a day, how are you not rolling in BE?","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-06-17T00:57:48.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exarch Leona,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=FXv3bJ4N,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2019-06-16T08:10:59.984+0000)\n>\n> If you're playing 6-8 hours a day, how are you not rolling in BE?\n\nbecause you could have between 6-12+ games in that 6-8 houra playing and after level 30 it takes somewhat 20-25+ wins to get 1 level so no he would not be rolling in BE at all BE is way to hard to get if you didnt have champion shards max when ip got removed. i understand they have these BE missions almost every week but its not enough when its 1 mission with a reward for 300..either champs should be free tripple on rotation or they bring out a battlepass for the full season with massive BE rewards ect","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-06-17T02:28:43.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I intentionally burned all my BE once IP was converted (roughly 800k BE, down to 0), yet I manage to sit on an average of 73000 BE. \nWith all the free shards you can get, there is 0 reason you wouldn't be rolling in BE. \n\nOnce an event ends, and you don't wanna waste the currency/tokens/whatever, craft champ shards, you can easily make a good minimum 10k BE that way. and with how often the events occur, you'd be piled up fast. \n\nAnother idea of how easy it is is I just burned 100k BE on random icon chests (didn't manage to finish buying all the chests sadly, wasn't home enough) and in the span of a few hours, ive gone from 900(just over)BE to almost 11k.\n\nOR, you can complain about doing nothing and expecting freebies...........like you just did. \n\nI seriously, have 0 idea, how you aren't able to farm BE so easily. \nIm level 201 and find it a breeze, happy to give yall tips on ez farming, but I have a feeling you'd rather just want a bigger hand out.","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-06-18T00:07:57.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Exarch Leona,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=FXv3bJ4N,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-06-17T02:28:43.002+0000)\n>\n> I intentionally burned all my BE once IP was converted (roughly 800k BE, down to 0), yet I manage to sit on an average of 73000 BE. \n> With all the free shards you can get, there is 0 reason you wouldn't be rolling in BE. \n> \n> Once an event ends, and you don't wanna waste the currency/tokens/whatever, craft champ shards, you can easily make a good minimum 10k BE that way. and with how often the events occur, you'd be piled up fast. \n> \n> Another idea of how easy it is is I just burned 100k BE on random icon chests (didn't manage to finish buying all the chests sadly, wasn't home enough) and in the span of a few hours, ive gone from 900(just over)BE to almost 11k.\n> \n> OR, you can complain about doing nothing and expecting freebies...........like you just did. \n> \n> I seriously, have 0 idea, how you aren't able to farm BE so easily. \n> Im level 201 and find it a breeze, happy to give yall tips on ez farming, but I have a feeling you'd rather just want a bigger hand out.\n\nif you started playing before the ip change you today currently struggle with BE drop outs you don't get a lot of free shards outside events you get 50% chance each level and each level outside of 30 takes quite a few games. when it comes to events you have no excuse not to get a lot of be I could have yielded over 50k from the trials event from tokens but chose to buy loot orbs instead and i do not regret it but im 5 gems off getting poppy so I will be saving all my be from today onward for the gem next emporium","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-18T06:03:31.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get more BE per game played now than you did IP in the past.
