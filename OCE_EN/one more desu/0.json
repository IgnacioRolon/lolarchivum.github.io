He's 0/8 for the season so far. His no english duo partner didn't have a record too much better (5W10L).\n\nBut in all seriousness, how did the system decide to place someone with a 100% loss rate with ~S3? S3 was higher than his last season's max bracket.\n\nI'm not amazing. I have a long way to go. There is no elo hell, but this is why it's a rough climb.\n\nQQ Salty asf.\n\nOur Jax was also 2W18L from his last 20. pls riet. pls","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-11T04:46:44.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"137 cs on Draven, all of my what.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-10T16:42:53.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what was is season 4 ranking?","replies":[{"poster":"One More Desu","date":"2015-03-10T17:29:49.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze S4, Silver S3","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-11T02:00:59.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm.... idk then lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
