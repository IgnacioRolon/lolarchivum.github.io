This isent a problem when holding shift and right clicking but when u right click manuelly and then right click to leap and repeat the process it seems to not leap half the time. I dont know if this is a problem with timing her basic attacks but this never happend to me before the new patch rolled out. Anyone else having the same problems?","replies":[{"poster":"Cobrwah","date":"2015-01-17T00:52:25.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same thing is happening to me.\nMaking me mad that i can only leap half of the time, it is really frustrating.\nMessing my gameplay up so so much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T17:08:40.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want to try the newly buffed kalista so badly, but sadly can't even play a single game due to the firewall error lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Burillion","date":"2015-01-16T03:42:30.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even the pro player Sneaky says that Kalli is bugged so i guess im not the only one having the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-16T03:17:15.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too sure, I'll get to you once I fix my client.
