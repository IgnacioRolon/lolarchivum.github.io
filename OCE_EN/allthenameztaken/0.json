Even when the average queue time is at 1min~1:30, it takes me at least 5 minutes to get a game going and this is excluding the time the game gets dodged during picks. \n\nI wondered what the reason was and first thought it might be because I am unranked and the system tries to match people with similar ranks?\nBut although I don&#039;t play ranked now, I used to until last year and I should have mmr of at least high plat or diamond 5. And back then I had no trouble getting a queue as they were either at around the average wait time or lower. \n\nDo I have to play a bit of ranked to get myself into ranked just to get a better queue time or is there simply less people in OCE server?","replies":[{"poster":"Ertytheqwerty360","date":"2016-10-21T21:26:59.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im lvl 7 (Im new)\n\nIt takes 10 seconds to find a bot game\nWhile I have to wait 30mins for a game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im a CAT","date":"2016-04-04T00:13:04.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the time, I find it queue times after 1 am for aram is a long wait probably 10 minutes . After the 10 minute wait, I typically just play with the same group of players that was in my aram game.  ( Btw I was soloing)   But if you don't want to wait, playing in the evening and afternoon is much more faster since more players are usually on around that time. \n\nI was Diamond last season too and I am pretty sure mmr doesn't affect who you match up with in aram but norms may be another matter. Since norms, I typically get matched up with people that placed the same as me last season or higher.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobayashi Maru","date":"2016-04-03T06:49:43.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the time I'm getting queues of 30-40 min.

You don't need to get ranked as normals MMR and Ranked MMR are unrelated.\n\nTo speed things up a bit, I would suggest[ joining a club](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) so you can always queue as a premade 5 (you also get more IP, mastery points and hextech stuff).","replies":[]}]}
