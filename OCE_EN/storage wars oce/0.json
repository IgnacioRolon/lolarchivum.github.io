I have sent...we&#039;ll say...many...requests to my email - but nothing.\r\nWhy I thought? What is going on?\r\n\r\nSo after not getting any luck with Riot&#039;s password reset function, I opened a ticket. On Sunday. It is now Friday Afternoon and I have yet to receive ANY email from Riot regarding this.\r\n\r\nConsidering all my billing information is on this account, this is worrysome at best from Riot. What the fuck is going on?\r\n\r\nHelp me for fucks sake","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-01-22T01:45:26.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI tried to find your ticket but had no luck.

But thanks for replying back, I found it with that info.\n\nSorry for the wait. Our account recovery tickets are fairly backed up right now due to a lot of holiday scams. Your account looks to have fallen prey to one of these scams and had it's email changed, which is why the password resets weren't working for you.\n\nI'll follow up with you in the ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Saeko24","date":"2016-01-22T03:57:14.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry... you guys are doing great.\nSeems just like a usual salty dude. :|","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
