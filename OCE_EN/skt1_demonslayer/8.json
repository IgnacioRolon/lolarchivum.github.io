The players we have at the moment are nice and have good attitudes. We communicate a lot and we spend time to make team comps and organize picks and bans. I wish to make this team legit as in be in diamond for r5. At the moment we have a plat 1, diamond 5, plat 5 and a plat 4. In saying this players must be at least PLAT LEVEL IN RANK.\r\n\r\nAlso I would require players who do apply to have had previous rank 5 experience. At least a gold level team that they have played on. Please you must be available at 8pm on weekdays, weekends are a bit hard to pin point exactly when we will play but if you communicate to me when you think you will be home that would HELP. You must be 18+ ( this is because I am done with dealing with trolls).\r\n\r\nWe are a serious team, I am easy going and if people upset you I do deal with it. You won&#039;t be raged at, you will find we are a group of boys who are good mates even though most of us met over THE NET.\r\n\r\nPlease have skype and add me my ign is skt1 DemonSlayer","replies":[{"poster":"Picasso","date":"2015-09-18T01:20:29.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have added you im going out now so ill play later tonight if you accept me into your ranked 5s","replies":[]}]}
