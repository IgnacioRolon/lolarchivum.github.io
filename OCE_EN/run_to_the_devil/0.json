So I now have a 14 day ban because they reported me and I didn&#039;t report them because I just decided to ignore what someone said to me on the internet and not go crying to riot. \r\n\r\nSurely if you are reviewing the chat logs you should review both sides and not just the side of the one that cried report?","replies":[{"poster":"GrubbyGhost","date":"2017-10-13T09:25:54.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roit is trying to kick off all players and it doesn't concern the problem from themselves.

You always have the option of being the better person and muting the flamer and continuing to play the game out to the best of your ability before reporting them at the end of the game. If you stoop to their level and start flaming back, it makes you just unsportsmanlike regardless of who started it. \n\nI know that as soon as you are out of a game like that the last thing you want to do is to hang around lobby and that you just want to move on, but if you want a player to face punishment for their actions then you **have to** report them. It's the only way to give them what they deserve.","replies":[]}]}
