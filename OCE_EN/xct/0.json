So frustrating, also getting loading issues on the client too. On one occasion i couldn&#039;t champ select or change my summoner spells. Another time the client wont load, the home screen doesn&#039;t load, i get Errors when trying to play a game, says client needs to be restarted? i tried everything i have found on the internet, Repairing, Re installing. what else is there i can do? A week ago none of these issues occurred.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nToby","replies":[{"poster":"DYN4M1T3","date":"2017-12-24T13:11:33.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive been having some similar problems. My ping is 15-20ms but would occasionally spike to 70+. I tried running a trace route from command prompt. Did a test to google.com server and ping was fine but as soon as i did one to league servers i got timed out... not sure if its my new router or ISP","replies":[]}]}
