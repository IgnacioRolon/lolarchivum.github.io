Increasing her next instance of damage by 15%.\r\n\r\nAdditionally nearby enemies (750 range) are revealed by a small green light over their location 1.5 seconds beforehand.\r\n\r\nQ - Seismic Crush (Frontal Cone AoE). Deals Physical damage in a cone (similar range to Cho&#039;Gath&#039;s Feral Scream). Enemies in the cone are knocked up for 1 second. \r\n\r\nW - Nitro Boots (Passive Buff &amp; Targeted Active) - Passive - grants 1/2/3/4/5% increased movement speed and can move through units. \r\n\r\nActive - Dashes to a target. Slowing their movement by 40%. If a unit intercepts the pathing between Alex and her target, she will stop at that target instead. Can target allied or enemy units as well as wards. Cannot move through terrain.\r\n\r\nE - Force Gauntlet - (Narrow Linear Skillshot) - Alex punches the air dealing physical damage to all enemies in a line, stunning them briefly (0.25 seconds) and pushing them backwards 100 range). \r\n\r\nR - Force Gauntlet Rocket Formation Zero (Auto Attack Bonus) - Alex next auto attack will launch her to her target. Once she arrives to her target she begins a barrage of strikes. The target is suppressed for 4 seconds. Each second she strikes the target dealing attack damage plus on hit effects. As she lands each attack she disappears and reappears clockwise around the target (her beginning points is say 12 she then moves to 3 &gt; 6 &gt; 9 back to 12). While she has disappeared she is invulnerable for approx 0.2 seconds. Each attack she will complete the attack animation. Can be cc&#039;d/targeted once she reappears. Can dash over terrain.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nGood CC\r\nGood Mobility around enemies.\r\nProvides quality information with Passive\r\nSemi Targeted CC on ult can be used to shut down key targets in Team Fights. \r\nHas CC on Q, E and R. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nLow survivability\r\nLow mobility outside of combat\r\nPredictable movement within ult, can lead to her being targeted down.\r\nNo reliable poke\r\nRelies on items to increase damage/survival. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFeedback/suggestion/number suggestions appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-22T10:47:00.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i am inspired by this and plus im bored so i will create my own champion Idea...\n\ni will reply to my own comment the full thing when i am finished","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-23T09:00:45.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might be a little broken xD but meh i doubt this will ever be accepted \n\nArgus\nThe Celestial Guardian\n\nStats:\nHp: 580 (+80 per level)\nMana: 320 (+35 per level)\nAttack Damage: 53 (+3 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.682 (+1% per level)\nMovement Speed: 330 \nHealth Regen: 8.752 (+0.82% per level)\nMana Regen: 6.246 (+0.40% per level)\nArmour:30 (+1.5 per level)\nMagic Resist:31 (+1 per level)\n\n\nAbilities and Passive:\n\nPassive: (Celestial Markings)\nWhenever Argus basic attacks a Minion or Champion he applies a stack of \"Celestial Markings\" (Max = 5) Apon reaching 5 stacks Argus's next basic attack or \nability will cause all stacks to detonate dealing 20 (+10% of Argus's AD)(per stack) in True Damage and slow by 40% for 3 seconds.\n\nAbility 1 (Q): (Sacred Grounds)\nArgus converts the ground in a 650 Unit Radius into Sacred Grounds damaging all enemies that remain in the area by 60(+50% of Argus's AP) as magic damage\nper second for six seconds. If Argus is inside the area of effect he will be healed 30% of all the damage that enemies take within the area.\n\nAbility 2 (W): (Eternal Follower)\nPassive: Argus permanently gains a Minion follower that will attack any enemy Argus targets or is damaged by. Minion has 400(+25% of Argus's Max Health)\nas health points. Minion has 40 (+40% of Argus's AD) as AD. Minions share Argus's movement speed. Argus gains another minion at lvls 6/12/18 Max number\nMinions is 4\n\nActive: Argus can order his minions to follow Target Ally Champion or minion untill Target dies or Argus leaves the Radius (1250 Units) if Minions that\nare following Target Ally kill an enemy minion or Champion the gold and score go to the Target Ally, additionally ally champion will be healed 50% of minion's\nmax health when they are killed.\n\nAbility 3 (E): (Through the gates)\nArgus places down a portal in an area of 300 Units which will teleport everything that walks on it to selected structure (e.g Red tower or Blue inhib: Nexus\nand nexus turrets cannot be selected) after Argus or allied/enemy champs go through the portal they gain 60% increased movement speed which rapidly decays at 5% a\nsecond. If selected building is a turret the turret will be unable to attack and will become untargetable for 3 seconds.\n\nPassive: Argus permantly gains 10% spellvamp per point in this ability\n\nAbility 4 (R): (Gift of the Ancients)\nArgus sacrifices 50% of his Current Hp and gives it to an Allied champion or minion. this ability will channel for 2 seconds before complete. both Argus\nand targeted ally champion will become unable to move during this time and every enemy within 650 Units will be snared. The %hp that Argus gives to an allied\nchampion or minion will become a sheild which will last 8 seconds before Rapidly decaying.\n\n\nIf you would like a lore for this champ plz let me know","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2015-10-19T03:13:26.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea of the champion and I think they would be an enjoyable champion to play.\nHowever, there are a few things I think that you could just polish off to make them even better.\nFirstly, the 4 second suppress on the ultimate is simply too high. Having such a long cc duration on a 'targeted' ability makes it way too easy to get a pick or setup a kill for your team.\nAlso, the W ability feels a bit lackluster. The movement speed is not too much to behold and it is essentially just a dash. Maybe giving it a little more movement speed (2/4/6/8/10% maybe) and also giving the active an enhanced auto attack on top of the dash? Maybe it could proc the 15% bonus damage from your passive?\nLastly, I love the idea of the passive. I think it is very helpful to not only you but also your team and can change how a game is played. 10/10 passive.\nOverall, I thought you've made a very good champion and I would love to play it if it is made.","replies":[{"poster":"Taric Main","date":"2015-10-19T20:14:06.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback! Much appreciated!\n\nI was thinking a 4 second supress would be a bit too long. How I want it to work essentially is she can be interrupted during the dash to the target stopping it, as well as she can be CC'd during the animation of the attacks - maybe a 1.5 second supress however each attack lands over the 4 second duration. That way she can at least get one hit in with the ult - and gives people a chance to counter the remainder of the ult with defensive a etc (eg flash into your team to have someone in range when she reappears for the next attack.\n\nAgreed I think W is a bit lacking - the enhanced Auto Attack is an idea, I didn't want her to be a Vi replica haha - I think that giving her something even like a second cast where it enhances the auto right after it's been cast (like an AA reset). \n\nMaybe even like W - increases movement speed by 1.5/3/4.5/6/7.5% and the active - dash remains the same but can be cast again to reset the cool down on the passive. \n\nGlad you like the passive I wanted it to give some utility with a team rather than just being a cc bot - I did the next instance of damage so you actually have to think about it being up and not blowing it on AAs but also because I'd want her to have low base damage to make up for her CC heavy kit. The damage boost allows her to possibly trade in lane etc.\n\nMight do some tweaking tonight and upload a sketch I did of her","replies":[]}]}]}
