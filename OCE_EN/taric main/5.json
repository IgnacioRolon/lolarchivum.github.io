My question was legit &quot;Why&#039;re you building that if you have no on-hit effects?&quot; The response I got was &quot;stfu&quot; and &quot;stay bronze %%%&quot;, I digress. I further stated to this player that Trist doesn&#039;t really have a natural synergy with the item other than her AP scalings now. \r\n\r\nAnyways , irrc Tris has no innate on hit abilities to make use of the sated rageblade, and the cost/cost efficiency at 0 stacks seems to delay her spikes even possibly costing the game. The only way I can see it being useful on her is with BotrK/Wits End/Nashors tooth and a full on hit build which I assume would be suboptimal? \r\n\r\nDo people find that players don&#039;t want to take this feedback/advice on? {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"FrickingLasers","date":"2016-05-05T05:34:38.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He obviously didn't want your advice, so why give it?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-05T14:50:41.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What kind of comment is that?

Especially after new patches where not many people actually read patch notes and are stuck in their old habits. \n\nSome people that play Tristana are still building Guinsoos not for the \"Guinsoos Rage\" passive, but for the stacking AP,AD and AS. \n3/4 of Trists abilities have AP scalings, with her ult being a 1:1 scaling and her E & W scaling at a 0.5 ratio.
