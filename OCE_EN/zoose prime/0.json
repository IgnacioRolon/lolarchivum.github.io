(Have an old account with lots champs)\n\nThe reason is, I&#039;ve seen unranked to Diamond streams, but never from the OCE region. Let me know if you guys are interested.\n\nI would try fun builds and keep the commentary educational, while still entertaining.\n\nI've seen a few posts mentioning they are trying to improve, and this may help those who need it.\n\nCan also duo with viewers.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-04T13:52:08.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds interesting enough, people will probably ask you to carry them XD","replies":[{"poster":"Zoose Prime","date":"2016-07-04T13:55:52.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, thanks for the reply.
