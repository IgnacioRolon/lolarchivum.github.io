In ranked","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay okay, so  i understand that some people think this game is 100% lost... And i completely understand that, sure they want to surrender but i have one of those mind sets in RANKED, that you never ever surrender no matter what. Ranked is more competitive and the aim is to win, so why surrender? Okay they might have a 18/2 Caitlyn or even a 21/3 Kat but to me that does not matter. As soon as I see a surrender vote go up for my cursor instantly moves to the NO button. I feel really strongly about this because (especially in lower elos) the winning team will easily start to throw, whether is be from being out of position or our team just having a positive mind set, but seriously surrendering is simply giving up and saying there is no way to win...\r\n\r\nR.I.P DFG","replies":[{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-28T22:12:46.816+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep, there's always a chance that the enemy team are gonna throw.
