DONT play ranked unless u can play all positions honestly... U get the person that has to support which might be 1st or 2nd pick because someone was way to ignorant and just being a douche... it seriously makes me angry... And then theres the next stage... \r\n\r\nOnce in the game they go \"I never really play...\" (insert position here) that is okay... but its when they say \"I never really play.....(insert position here) so im just going to feed because I didn't get to go where i wanted\" This is possibly the most annoying thing in the world... Then they dc....\r\n\r\nSo please can we just all share this and say \"DONT play ranked unless you know all positions to a level or degree which is decent.\" \r\n\r\nMaybe RIOT could introduce (JUST thinking here) when someone leaves the game another person can join with the same skill set as the one that left... Just a thought idk how they would pull it off but just thoughts...\r\n\r\n~I may not be the best but i will sure try to be~","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-08T02:18:53.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"Only supports ward\" -Bronze2k15\n\nI don't get what's so bad about supporting.","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-02-08T05:09:30.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People dont like it because apparently its boring and you cant really carry at team as support..
