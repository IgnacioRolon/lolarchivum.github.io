These delays may last between 1 second to sometimes up to 10 seconds. Not only is this annoying but does cause deaths in game which is very tilting. My ping is a constant 32, and after multiple internet resets i have ruled out my internet being the issue.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a fix, or is anyone also receiving this weird lag.\r\nchrs","replies":[]}
