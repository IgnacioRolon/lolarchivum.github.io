What that does is hold down the command keys for you, and waits until you press them again. The click would only turn red if you're holding down Shift while clicking, with the default key configurations.\n\nGo into your Control Panel, and disable all shortcuts set to automatically enable accessibility options.","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-03-26T10:03:16.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm..

Seems to be somewhat connected to opening the shop by key and closing it with the mouse. Spamming the shop open and close commands in various ways fixed it for me. It might just be a ghost shop staying open but invisible, which is ultimately a bug.\n\nWe can't really make a bug report about this because there's no way to consistently replicate it. Hopefully they'll spot it out.","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-03-28T11:39:26.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GOT THE ANSWER\nMAC USERS!!!!!!\n\nWhen this happens tap shift and enter a couple of times it should go away..\nReally Really weird but it works","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-29T04:36:59.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Mac feature any global shortcuts that involve Shift?","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-03-31T04:19:55.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does if you press Shift and Enter simultaneously it opens all chat Don't know if its the same for Windows","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-31T06:05:54.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No no, I don't mean game-commands.
