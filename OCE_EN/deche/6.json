And I want to thank Rito for that. This might be because of the large player base or maybe the queuing formula that is very efficient. But I question I would like to ask is: Is it really necessary.\r\n\r\nNo before  everybody jumps on and answers that I want to talk a bit more about Leagues vs MMR. At the moment we use both systems. The League system was adopted from StarCraft and is one of the fairest ranking systems. MMR being adopted from the Chess raking system would be the other one.\r\n\r\nBut as everyone knows Riot uses both. \r\n\r\nThe reason I believe for this is because it creates a the best user experience to the group of users as oppose to individual users, it also allows higher ranks to speed up the match making process allot - Let me explain.\r\nThe MMR is used to gather team mates and opponents so you have a similar MMR as the opposing team. Therefore trying to make it as even as possible. And coupled with the Leagues system which choses only opponents in the similar league, unless you have been in que for a while, it makes it mathematically a very fair system. But that is where it ends. Mathematically. I do believe tho it has some flaws in real world matchmaking however. And this is where the unrest starts.\r\n\r\nThere is a upper buffer for players to pass to advance, but no lower buffer. To advance to the next division you have to win 2/3 games. Or 3/5. But lets just work with 2/3 for now. If you lose your promo's it takes about 1-3 games to get back. Lets say 2 (Most of mine was 2). That means if you win 2 (to get back in promose then win another and lose 2) you have a 60% win rate over the 5 games, but your mmr still rises even if you don't win in the leagues. Meaning if it continues to that you can be Plat MMR yet play in Silver. But that barrier does not exist so if you Have a 40% win rate you will end up in bronze V no matter what. Now there is sort of lower limit MMR to each league. Mathematically there is  a mmr that you just can't get without being demoted but I am not going explain it here since the math is tenuous.  \r\n\r\nBut it creates a scenario where people don't get placed in a team they are not suppose to be in. This flaw is also found in the MMR system. This system is more balanced the MMR system believe it or not, but can be improved upon -->\r\n\r\n> So here is the suggestion: Get rid of MMR and just let it be league. Simple your placement can only be picked by what division you are in plus or minus one. Except for when at the barriers of your division IE Silver V and Silver I can't be paired with Bronze I's or Gold V's. Because if you win 60% of your advancement matches you deserve to advance to the next division. It means you are capable overcoming your division. But ofc some people can get lucky. So rather than 5 matches move it to 7,9 or 10. Allot of players won't like this but it does eliminate luck.\r\n\r\nIn the short run the current system is better, providing a better user experience to the masses. But in the long run the pure League system will offer more of a correct placement at the end of the season then people currently has.\r\n\r\nTeam mmr at the start might look somethig like 1450 - 1890 (if it was still around but not used). And that is because the better players are in a division they do not deserve to be in.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the season there will be allot of carrying going on and might be Chaos, but is it really worse than it is now with the soft reset? And at the end of the season the sorting will be allot better and accurate, because those that got carried will be pushed down.\r\n\r\nBut if this sounds so good why isn't it implemented yet? Because this system would increase Queing timtes.\r\n\r\nMixed System\r\nPro's:\r\n* Better queuing Times\r\n* Better Initial start to season\r\n* Generally a better user experience for the majority\r\n\r\nCon's:\r\n* Takes longer to get to deserve elo\r\n* Final rankings are not presented as accurate\r\n* matched up against higher skilled players is more often overall.\r\n\r\nPure League\r\nPro's:\r\n* Matched with players close to your skill overall\r\n* Luck is less of an factor.\r\n\r\nCon's:\r\n* Longer waiting times\r\n* Start of season will be rough overall unless placement matches are improved upon.\r\n\r\n>Now to get back to the first sentence. Riot has really good queuing times and when starting off to make the game a success as it is, this was crucial. But now I think the users are willing to have a longer queing time, but be placed with people close to their respective skill cap. So here is a question for the users in a poll.","replies":[{"poster":"awsumlad","date":"2015-01-25T11:21:06.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe in the situation you are saying where someone keeps losing promos but their mmr is rising is people completely skip promos and instantly go to the next division. I also think its correct that you can skip divisions entirely and go from say gold 5 to gold 3 if your mmr is high enough. Without the mmr system as well as the league system then people will find it much more frustrating in losing promos since they have to be won to advance, where right now as I said you can skip them if your mmr is high enough.","replies":[]}]}
