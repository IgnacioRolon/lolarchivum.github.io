I don't mean to come off as rude or anything like that, this is just an honest, perhaps brutal, analysis.\n\nHis passive is awful. Absolutely awful. First off, it makes him *literally* unhealthy: he has less and less health as the game goes on. Not only is this an awful idea in general, as a hyper carry character will likely be building only damage items and not more than one, maybe two, survivability items if behind, but it makes him susceptible to the same issues that plague hyper carries like Yasuo or Yi: a single dose of CC and they're dead. The only difference here is that while most hyper carries can sustain at least one hit, giving them enough time to try and eke out a win or an escape depending on the situation, at the late game assuming he ends up with 2000 health naturally he's going to be sitting at 1000ish. And the less max natural health he has the lower that will become, until he's essentially useless in teamfights. The rest of his kit more than makes up for this passive, but that doesn't mean he has a weakness, if anything it just shows that he's too strong. A champion's passive is supposed to *help*, not hinder them, but here it's just being used as an excuse for making him overpowered.\n\nThat Q is an interesting concept, using a poking damage ability to apply stacks of a specific other ability, but honestly it's just lazy at this point and all it will encourage is Rean to sit back and farm under turret or wait as long as possible in teamfights to jump in and mop up while throwing out stacks of true damage.\n\nE needs to be better defined, although it doesn't really work well in the first place. You have made no mention of how to actually proc the stacks outside of his W and his ult, and have no upwards limit on how many stacks a champion can be debuffed with. Plus, this opens up a route for him to be played as a tank, stacking higher armor to make up for his lower health (Frozen Heart would essentially remove any mana problems he has assuming he's a mana champ and not energy) while still doing insane amounts of damage by building up stacks on people before going ham.\n\nHis W is a cool concept, but it's clearly designed solely to make his plays look flashy while actually removing much of the skill from this kit. Considering how incredibly easy it is to get stacks on people, especially if one were to build CDR or attack speed as focuses, he would be able to cast this infinitely depending on the mana cost and his own mana regen/mana total through items if it isn't energy based. Having the stacks fall off independently after a certain amount of time doesn't change that in a 1v1 scenario he would ALWAYS have stacks on an enemy, making him practically impossible to duel, and in a teamfight scenario he could hop around like some demon child of Yasuo, Kalista, and Katarina, making him almost impossible to lock down with CC save for point and click abilities, which is just BEGGING for bugs as there's no telling what would happen if he's about to be hit with point and click CC but uses his W to go somewhere else the moment it would have hit. Not to mention that at max range this would completely outrange pretty much every point and click, and even most skillshot, CC in the game, meaning that his half health passive is, yet again, not a true weakness. The cooldown being so long at max level is NOT balance for how incredibly overpowered this is in most scenarios, because it takes almost no skill to get Curse Mark stacks on someone. The only way to balance something like this is to have it state that he can only jump one time each to one each person time he's in combat, or that there's a time limit to how long it is before he can jump to that person again, but that essentially just makes him Yasuo but AP. \n\nHis ult is just plain broken. Considering how easy it is to get stacks, and how there's no defined upper limit or other balancing idea for this aside from their own inherent time limits, he could get five to ten stacks on someone with almost no effort and effectively delete anyone from the map. Especially if this doesn't consume stacks, which since you explicitly state his W does I'm going to assume that this does not. So he would be able to jump to one target, which is an awful design flaw considering that hyper carries who are dive heavy require some form of defensive ability in their kit, and completely remove them from the game during each teamfight. And as a side note, I'm not entirely sure how you're getting that he can deal 400 damage from the math you listed there. You've essentially failed to define the actual mechanics on this ability aside from \"it hurts someone using the neato passive effect I just half copied from other champs\". Is it dealing an additional 10% per stack, so with 5 stacks would he be dealing 50% of a champion's health in damage to them? If not, then why is the max listed as 400 AP+10%? Is that the maximum bonus you can have? If so, why even bother saying it's a stacking ability when a single stack puts you at the cap for the percent health damage. If the stacks don't apply to the percent health( you REALLY do need to word that more definitively) and only the magic damage, you would need so many stacks to make that damage relevant that it'd be insane. Assuming he builds nothing but AP and ends up with, just for sake of ease, 1000 AP at the end of a match that means that unstacked his ult will deal a whopping 25 extra magic damage at .025 per AP. You get 4 stacks on someone and it becomes at least a little better, dealing 100 damage, but if he's a hyper carry his scalings shouldn't be that low. Instead what you have here is an artificial weakness (\"Nuh uh, he's balanced cuz you have to get stacks to do damage\") but all it really means is that this character is built to get stacks incredibly fast, as he would *need* to in order to make the most of his ult. He'd need at least 8 stacks just to get the scaling to even BEGIN to matter, and even then he'd only be sitting on 200 additional magic damage. This means that his E is actually far more powerful than his ult, as you could spam it in a teamfight almost endlessly so long as you can keep stacks up which, judging from the way this ult seems to work, is incredibly easy to do. And how does it actually work? Is it a targeted jump? Is it a distance nuke, where he can sit from the backline and pop someone like a grape? This ult is incredibly lacking in detail, and feels like calling it half baked would be overestimating it's concept.\n\nAll in all, this champion design is sloppy. It's nigh impossible to balance, either the game around him or him around the game. No champion's stats should be fighting counter to the gold investment a person tried to make in them, which this champion would if you tried to build him as a tank and run off of just his high percent damage capabilities and you know people would. His passive is just... awful. His Q is just Yasuo, his W is Varus but with true damage, his E is Katarina, and his ult is so incredibly lacking in definition that it could be either overpowered or entirely useless. He lacks the tools that hyper carries need to be effective (some form of escape or defensive mechanic) while he has abilities that make him able to play as a hyper carry without having to build like one. He effectively has either no weakness or the world's worst weakness depending on whatever limit, if any, his stacks have and how hard it is to keep them up or get them stacked high enough, but even with that it only limits his teamfight potential, leaving him basically impossible to handle in the laning phase. There's no point in labelling someone a hyper carry if they're actually at their *weakest* during the end game, which this guy definitely would be in spite of how massive his damage potential becomes at that point.\n\nHonestly, all this looks like is you wanting to come up with a champion who can utterly stomp people and sound all cool and edgy while doing it. The concept for this character is something I would expect from bad roleplayers online, or people creating versions of themselves as escapism on DeviantART. There's a fine line between creativity and regurgitation, and this is definitely the latter. You want to make the champion that you would enjoy playing the most with no actual originality in his kit, no unique feel, a dried out and overused theme, and while being entirely binary. Most of the elements of his kit are copied from other hyper carries, but none of his kit contains what makes the hyper carries able to do their job while giving him access to mechanics that let him do his job better than they can. You've somehow managed to make someone who's binary even for a hyper carry, as there is absolutely zero difference between weakness and strength in this character's kit due to the stacking mechanic and it's interaction with his other abilities. So either he's going to be completely and utterly untouchable or he's going to be completely and utterly stomping people into the dirt.\n\nTo be frank, it's a bad concept. I commend you for trying to come up with someone fun, but you focused on someone who's cool to you personally instead of someone who fits into the game itself, and you gave him everything that you would want on a kit to make him overpowered so that you could feel like a great player while using him. He's essentially an AP mix of Katarina, Yasuo, Yi, and Varus with no *legitimate* weaknesses, plus more than enough strengths to make that weakness negligible, while requiring almost no skill to play, and that just plain doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-02-03T05:52:55.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry but you did not read his abilities at all, so I understand  the confusion. Let me go through all his abilities and explain things a bit better for you.\n\nPassive - This I admit can be lowered to say 0.5 per minute. But this works on the average game time Which is around 40 minutes. Very rarely will I have a 50 minute game. So lets say the game goes for about 50 minutes as you did above and we are using the 0.5 % passive instead of 1. Then he would have lost 25% of his maximum health. Making him 1500 health instead of  1000 like you suggested. Compared to a champ like Yasou 1912 at level 18. His passive is meant to push him in a certain direction, not to help or disadvantage him in this case. It just stops people Building tank like you suggested.\n\nQ - I don't know where you read it will do damage. It does no damage. So how you will farm with this is beyond me. Plus if you build max CDR then you can at maximum have two stacks on a enemy with ur Q alone, because the timer on the stacks does not reset when the number on the stack is increased. And only with max CDR can you do this at max level, even then it is a small opening a little less than a second. \n\nPlus Yasou's Q is a line ability, this one is like the second active on Riven's ult - A ARC/wave  ability.\n\nW - Is not a active. It's a passive, like teemo's E. And you will only get stacks on a target you Q'd or is auto attacking. And having such a squishy auto attacking at melee range is just asking for a stun and melt. Just take Jax, Irelia, WW, Darius, Vayne, leblanc, fizz and more. His not hard to counter. All you need is distance, cc or burst damage. His W is meant to help him out in lane and finishing off enemies.\n\nLet think for a bit. If he had no other attack modifiers it would take him the following amount of hits to kill a target at the repective levels 14/10/8/7/5 with his W, Assumung you don't use your E,R or Q in the mean while and that not 1 of the total stacks on a target. Meaning he will have to deal all those hits within 3 seconds. Since after 3 seconds you lose 1 on your total stacks, because this ability does not reset the stack like most other champions in league does. Plus it does not count as a on hit effect.\n\nE - Again you didn't read the ability. At one time you can max jump six times (5 enemy champs + 1 other target), assuming it is within 3 seconds because that is the amount of time it takes to lose 1 stack. Why because \"Cursed Mark\" stacks only apply to enemy champions. Meaning if he jumps to a target that is not a enemy Champion with a stack then it goes on cool down. And lets say you build Max CDR then you will have a 15 seconds cooldown, which is longer then some Champion Ultimate cooldown without CDR. It will be the longest defensive ability cool down in game and you will be able to engage on Rean without any fear because he has no cc or other escapes. \n\nYou were saying that he needs an escape, so here it is.\n\nAs for the stacks if you have 3 stacks on a target, you use your E then it takes 1, leaving 2 left on a target.\n\nR - His ult is like Kalista's Rend. To get stacks is not as easy as you might assume. As for the damage you read wrong AGAIN:\n\n> Deal 5%/7.5%/10% + 0.025 AP as magic damage (maxing at 400 AP/ + 10%) for each stack of \"Cursed Mark\" on a enemy, consuming all the stacks.\n\nMaxing means it cannot fo further. That means if you have 400 AP you will deal as much when you do when you have 100000000 AP. You can only have, Assuming you have 400 AP, 20 % Magic Damage per stack, meaning if you have 5 stacks you will not be able to 1 shot a enemy because of basic MR. So minimum you must have 6 stacks on a target to kill him with your ult alone.\n\n\nPlease Read more carefully before making a judgement on a champion.
