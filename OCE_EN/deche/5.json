Funny how the title says get rid of smurfs huh? Anyway throught my games I was amazed to see how many mechanically advance players there were, which were definitely smurfs. In fact in almost all the games.\n\nIn all honesty it is ruining the game for newer players, since in fact older players are also allot more toxic and does tend to be mean to newer players making mistakes.\n\nSuggestion to fix it: Binding an IP to an account, a account without a valid IP bound to it cannot play. Since most have only one PC you can assume they will only have one account with a valid \"bind on it\". But you can still log in to other computers with a already bound account.\n\nProblems and fixes to those:\n\n* Skin/IP/RP loss: For a month you can send over all your skins/IP/RP to another account.\n* Proxy servers for IP: Most people won't do it, so it will have a major impact on the current smurf population.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-03T12:59:59.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"what if the person has to share a computer? also who only owns one computer. it's 2014+1, they're cheap as %%%%.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-03T13:15:12.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KfQAnZlb,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-03T12:59:59.941+0000)\n>\n> it's 2014\n\n2015*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-03T22:17:48.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what happens if you get a new computer? will I have to start again from lvl 1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-03T13:18:08.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's nothing wrong with smurfs. It's not the fact it's a smurf account that makes a person 'toxic', for lack of a better word.
