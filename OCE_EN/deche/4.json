But there comes a time when in a persons life when responsibilities become too much and one has to change his focus to more important things in life. That time has come for me. I will be giving up league to persuade work and studies. It really has been a good run. I have allot of good memories and some bad ones. But generally they were good except towards the end now. Also I have a special message for Riot at the end.\r\n\r\nBut as a parting gift I would like to give Bronze and Silver players some advice on how to climb, since that as where I spend most of my time until landing in gold last season.\r\n\r\nBronze Players - Honestly the key escaping bronze (And I tested it again this season by getting my brothers B5 account to S5) is to master a role and a champion. Play any champion you like constantly and continuously.  You won't always get the champ you want so pick a secondary role and champion. Usually in bronze support is open and if you pick champions like annie, karma and other high damage supports it is easy to win almost every game.\r\n\r\nSilver Players - Silver is by far the most Toxic section of the game you can imagine, so being kind to your team mates goes A VERY LONG way. In saying this the main way how I got to gold is: Focusing on objectives rather than Kills or farm, Mastering item builds (Build to counter the enemy team), getting good at farming (100 cs every 10 minutes is the aim), and most importantly:\r\n\r\nListen to what the team needs {\r\n\r\nIf they are grouping - group with them.\r\nIf the team needs a tank - go tank.\r\nIf the team needs wards - buy a pink.\r\n}\r\n\r\nHonestly having a good attitude can just make the game so much better for yourself and your team. There is nothing as helpful as saying to a mid that is feeding: Hey man, I know you are having a rough game - but I believe you will carry ;0\r\n\r\nThere was a game I played with the 3 nicest randoms I have met to date. beginning of the match we had a dc and 15 minutes in we didn't have a kill and they had 17. But we started to get picks after they got really cocky. The enemy team started raging at each other and they did not play as a team. We did, we grouped, warded and helped each other and not once the game call out something mean to the other. We ended up winning the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIOT:\r\n\r\nThank you all for such a wonderful couple of years. It has honestly been great playing the game and I would like to thank you for all the great content and work you have put in. You keep the community very active and appreciate it very much. You guys honestly deserve a pat on the back. But as a final note, the negativity in OCE (NA is so much nicer) did help me to give up league for good now. I really do think it is time to either get a Tribunal in OCE or just implement a simple strike system. 10 reports and it's a ban. Simple but very required.\r\n\r\nEither than that Greate Work Riot! You guys and girls were beast!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmI_Ndrxy14","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-03-15T18:04:01.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice and all the best!","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-03-15T09:09:25.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck persuading your work and studies :^)\nGood luck in future pal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-15T07:35:07.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tears will be shed brother\n\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-03-15T23:23:49.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You and me both......\n{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-16T01:26:25.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either you are leaving for other commitments or because of the community. \nDon't confuse the two.\nIf you are unhappy with the community work actively to change it.\n I see no reason why you can't balance work and hobbies. \nEven if it's the odd game on a weekend, why quit all together?","replies":[{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-03-16T21:41:30.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Community is great, especially on the forum.
