It might even take up to a month of following and practising this guide. This guide will not work for some, but for the other 90% or so, if you follow this you are assured to get out of bronze. I am by no means a top player. But I am a very methodical one - I see what works and I remember/expand on it. The aim of the guide is to make you a better player which will result in you getting out of bronze. I myself got put in bronze V and had to fight my way out and this is how I did it. I have reached Gold and now awaiting the reset. If you have missed my escaping bronze guide here it is:\n\n[Escaping Bronze Detailed Guide](http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=60990)\n\nI have received 24000+ views on my bronze guide, and hope this one will be the same.\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Mindset**\n\nIf you have not read the mindset section in the Escaping bronze guide go read it... Nothing has changed.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Transitioning into Mid and Late**\n\nA bit of lane mechanics helped me at the end coupled with some good gameplay decitions like attacking tower while team is fight. But from silver V to II the best thing that helped me is learning how to transition into mid and late game. This took me ages to learn and can't believe no one ever told me it. I had to spectate Diamond/Challenger players, watch LCS games on youtube, take notes and finally it clicked. When it did... Well I'm gold now ain't I?\n\nSo without further a due lets start.\n\n*Laning to Mid*\n\nThe transition period is not as simple as it seams, tho I have finally got proficient at it, my game can still use allot of work. But there are a few rules you can follow, these are general and I will do role specific under it:\n\n1. Know when your laning phase is over \n~ This usually happens when either you or your opponent destroys a the others tower. The first tower to be destroyed is the start of transition period. \n\n2. Get other Tier 1 towers\n~The goal then is to target other Tier 1 towers in other lanes. Roaming, getting ganks and finally push lane for towers or taking dragon once you have gained an advantage.\n\n3. Don't lose your own!\n~ Once I began roaming as adc I did indeed get ganks off and did help mid and sometimes top take tower, but what really hit hard is I did not monitor my own lane and the enemy team would take it. The way I got around this is fairly simple and these are some general rules for each lane:\n\n- Don't leave lane when your opponent is in lane (Only applies to mid in some cases).\n- When out of lane and your opponent is between his tower and brush, head back to your lane. If you are past mid then ask jungle or mid to go protect your lane and you can protect mid if thats the case.\n- Try to avoid heading back through river unless it is warded - wards win games.\n\n**Roles specific**\n\n>*TOP*\nRegardless: Head down when your team is about to dragon. Get TP as a top laner. Works wonders.\nWon lane:  Keep pushing or gank other lanes.\nLost lane: If your opponent freezes lane then go gank other lanes. If he keeps pushing then just defend and call for gank if you can't 1v1.\n\n\n>*MID*\nWon lane: GANK GANK FARM GANK GANK, unless you are pusher like zyra and malz then only GANK PUSH PUSH GANK. Seriously mid is so good for ganks.\nLost lane: GANK FARM GANK FARM GANK, unless you are pusher like zyra and malz then only GANK PUSH PUSH GANK. Seriously mid is so good for ganks.\n\nAs you can see they are pretty similar. But if are behind the best thing you can  do is gank other lanes to cathup. If you are infront use that ganking power to put other lanes infront. Just don't lose your towers against pushers and junglers.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: Follow your laner, since ganks are so powerful from a mid it is esential that you keep track of your opponent, because if he ganks and you don't follow then they can even tower dive. Only reason you are allowed to not follow him is when the jungler is in the lane being ganked and you are 100% sure everyone knows she is there. IE calling mia.\n\n\n\n>*JUNGLER*\nThis segment was writen by Ezreal God - A diamond 5 jungler:\n\nt1pz n tr1kz for junglin\n\n1. New SR Jungle heavily rewards efficient clearing of the Jungle and well timed ganks so try not to focus on being a farmlord Udyr or some nonstop gankmachine lee sin.\n2. FOLLOW THE META.\n3. You're 100% responsible for warding the enemy Jungle and objectives. Buying wards (Including pinks) every time you base is what you wanna be aiming for since knowing about (ganks/roams/junglers location) is key to all ins, tower dives and counter ganks.\n4. Gank timing is something you learn overtime but if you're really not sure on what you should be looking for then I suggest starting off by ganking each time you level up.\n5. Try your best to stay away from taxing lanes after you fail a gank because that's a quick way to get an AFK.\n6. Mid laners are your best friends so try to always be there for them when they need it.\n7. Bot lane is somewhere you wanna go if you feel like taking a drag or picking up assists but keep in mind that bot lane will be warded 90% of the time and 100% of the time your team won't tell you where those wards are.\n7. Top laners are usually grumpy old men who want you off their lawn unless you gift them kills and don't tax at all so steer clear unless you can guarantee them a solid lead.\n\n\n>*SUPPORT*\nReally you are what makes the difference in transitioning. A good support has such a big role in this stage of the game, so get comfy:\n\nWhether you won or lost lane your job would be the same in most cases. Here they are:\n\n1. Ward objectives\nTeam is ahead or even: once lane is over you have to start warding aggressively. In lane you are warding defensively --> dragon, tri, brush ect to ensure you don't get ganked. But since you will now be roaming and helping other lanes you have some free wards. You should still ward dragon and a few crucial  brushes but now you should also start warding shallow in the enemy jungle. At their blue/red, brushes or jungle entrances. This will ensure more vision control and decision time with objectives planning.\n\nWhen Losing: Keep warding defensively -> dragon, river, tri... but also start warding entrances to your own jungle. Since you are losing the chance for a invade is very high. With a warded jungle you can see invades and possible catchup b catching enemies in your jungle with wards.\n\n2. Baby sitting bot and mid AT THE SAME TIME!\n\nWon lane and opponent freezes: Usually you and your adc will then go mid to take tower.\n\nWon lane and opponent keeps pushing: Stay in lane with adc. Kill them if you can. Call jungler if you can't. They don;t have a safe tower there anymore. Use it as an advantage.\n\nLost lane: Go mid, the opponents will usually go mid, so go help mid while your adc pressures bot. If they don't go down let your adc take their tower then come mid. They won't be able to kill a support and mid under tower as 3, might be able to push the tower down tho so call jungler or top if that happens.\n\nLost lane and opponent keeps pushing: Let your adc freeze lane and play safe while you gank mid. If they come to close to your tower bot then go gank bot ask the jungler to help. They are pushed way up and will die against a 2v3. \n\n\n>*ADC*\n\nWon lane and enemy freezes: Take mid, as an adc you probally have the best pushing potential on your team\nWon lane and enemy pushes: Call jungler for a gank if you can't 2v2.\nLost lane and enemy goes mid: Push tower, it's free, plus your support and jungler can go help mid.\nLost lane and enemy pushes: Let your support go mid, you just play super safe, get what cs you can without getting to close. They will either stop once they pushed in far enough, in which case just freeze until you know where they are. But if they keep pushing then call your support/mid/jungler and get ganks for days. Fairly simple.\n\n**Transitioning to late**\n\nBy this time all the enemies Tier 1 towers are taken and the game feels like there is not much more to do either than farm for late, but that isn't always the best choice. Here is what you should look at, btw supports are special and get their own little extra piece to read (everyone should so they can tell their support to do it):\n\n> Judging your team's strength\n\n* If your team can win team fights then group and push or take dragon. Here are some pointers to see if your team can win team fights:\n  ~ You are ahead in kills\n  ~ Ahead in Gold/Items\n  ~ Your team composition -> is your adc better at the moment than the other adc, lots of cc, wombo combos ect.\n  ~ The enemy team is not grouping... 4v5 is usuall easy to win.\n\n* If your team is behind then it is better farm-up for late game where you'll be more equal unless they have a hyper carry .\n ~ However if they group to take towers then everyone in your team goes, unless you are 100% sure that they can't 5v4 under your tower, in which case:\n ~ You should split push while 4 hold the towers\n\n* If you are equal:\n~ Farm\n~ Get dragon (This will make or break the game in most cases)\n~ Get picks -- Lanes will be pushed so laners will go into their jungle or over extend. Get the pick then group as 5 and take a objective or two.\n\n> Supports\n\nIf you are behind keep warding your jungle and objectives.\nEqual then just ward river and jungle entrances or see below if you are feeling risky.\n\nWinning: If you are ahead then you go for deep wards. You want to know everything that is going on in their jungle. If gromp poops you want to know. Why? Because knowing where every person on their team is will ensure you can get easy and safe picks. If you get a safe pick it will allow your team to: Take Baron, take towers, take dragon, win game and finally farm (jks don't farm if it's a 5v4, thats silly).\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n**Lane Matchups and Counters**\n\nThe second part that really helped me is learning the lane match ups, who counters who and why. Tho I don't expect you to learn all the lanes just learn your specific role.\n\nLearn when your champion is the **STRONGEST **then learn when your champion is the **WEAKEST**. This will help you make the decision as to playing safe and going for the kill. Then learn the most popular match ups and **WHY ** you counter them or they you. There is nothing more frustrating than a support picking {{champion:412}}  instead of {{champion:89}} if the enemy picks a {{champion:25}} .\n\nExtra:\nNow for those that don't know {{champion:25}} counters {{champion:412}} because his Q is negated. While leona's does not do damage she still grabs on and can just stun the unshielded person or {{champion:89}}'s e doesn't get cancelled when there are multiple in a row. However {{champion:412}} counters {{champion:89}} because he can just flay her away on engages.\n\nNow the above is just an example showing that one should know the match ups. You can usually find a description in Diamond and challenger guides that talk all about your champions match ups. Go read it, it's there for a reason.\n\nAs a general guide there are three main arc types: Sustain, Kill and Poke.\n\nA sustain lane does short engages, retreats then heals up.\nKill lane just engages whenever to get kills.\nPoke lane deals safe damage from a distance and avoids engages.\n\nPoke > Kill \nKill > Sustain\nSustain > Poke\n\nlearn what type of champ you are playing and what they are. This applies heavily to bot lane.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n**Power Spikes and your Champion**\n\n>Sun Tzu ~\nKnow yourself and you will know your enemy\n\nPower spikes are a brilliant why to get ahead in silver. Because nobody respects them, I learned this the hard way.\n\nI was playing {{champion:236}} against a {{champion:67}} and was stomping her in lane. The support went mid and I was defending tower, tho a bit pushed. Being far ahead and {{champion:236}} with {{item:3031}} I thought it would be easy like before. But vayne got {{item:3153}} just before and when she ulted she destroyed me. I was no match even tho I was ahead in farm and 3-0 kills. I did not respect her power spike and I got destroyed 1v1.\n\nSo here are power spikes you can use or be careful off:\n\n~ Engaging level 2 while they are level 1 (the gap is small so be prepared)\n~ Engaging level 6 if they are 5  (May be small gap, be prepared)\n~ After finishing a core item\n~ Getting a core ability\nLearn what your champions power spikes are and use it.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Item Builds**\n\nIn the bronze guide I talked a bit about about counter building for as a added note, in this guide I will talk about the items in detail and what they are used for. I am asking higher ranking players to give advice on items I might be using wrong. Most items are only what you should build to counter. I have left out most champion specific items.\n\nThe Items: \n{{item:3001}} : Get this item if the enemy team has allot of MR and you have allot of AP on your team. This is also good for duelling AP vs AP. Note only get this on AP characters.\n\n{{item:3174}} : This is a good item when you are a mana hungry poke AP champion. The main part is giving mana regen. Getting {{item:3028}} as your first item is powerful if you are up against a burst champion like {{champion:105}} and {{champion:7}}, giving you allot more survivability early game.\n\n{{item:3050}}  : As a support this is a good item if you have multiple auto attack champions apart from your adc like {{champion:11}} , {{champion:23}} {{champion:114}} ect. But only get it when atleast 3 champions can benefit from it. Either than that there are better items for a support.\n\n{{item:3102}} : This is a great item if you are a carry and you are being targeted by the enemy team's assassins OR they have moderate CC and AP. It makes you much more durable as well as having a awesome spell shield.\n\n{{item:3153}} : This is the Item you get for your auto attack and assassin champions. Assassin: For the active's damage and duelling potential. Auto attack champions you get this when the enemy team is tanky 2+ tanks. So if you have to target a tank you won't waste your time.\n\n{{item:3128}} : Rip\n\n{{item:3508}} : Honestly I feel as if this item just does not give as much as {{item:3031}}  or {{item:3072}}. But if you are a caster ADC and you feel as if team fights are long and extended, then get this item. It gives you survivability as well as a fair amount of damage due to better cool downs on your abilities.\n\n{{item:3110}} : If your enemy team has allot of auto attack/attack speed champions then this is a must for your tank/support in team fights. Reduces the enemy teams damage output by a huge amount. Good item.\n\n{{item:3022}} : This item can be used either for kiting of chasing. The slow it gets is extremely helpful and gives damage + durability as well. So if you feel that the enemy team is really fast or they have champions like {{champion:43}}, {{champion:15}} or {{champion:3}} who can speed up the entire team then this is good item to have. Either for helping adc kite or chasing opponents.\n\n{{item:3026}} : Good on squishy carries that get jumped on allot. If the enemy team has a well balanced AP/AD/CC team then getting this will help you allot since you probably will die. I do not recommend this item on tanks or supports.\n\n{{item:3025}} :This is usually build on tanks but can be build on adcs if they require more tankyness and damage. But for adc's there better items that do the same like {{item:3078}}. For tanks build this item if they a balanced team. This will give you allot if benefits like cd and more damage.\n\n{{item:3031}} : Highest damage item of  auto attack champions. A must for most adc's.\n\n{{item:3035}} : If they have 3+ champions building armor get this. If they have only 1-2 get {{item:3142}}  instead.\n\n{{item:3151}} : Get this item against Tankier teams. 3+ tanks.\n\n{{item:3190}} : A standard support item that works well against AD and AP (because of shield). Get it if the enemy team has 2+ AP champions that can deal damage.\n\n{{item:3156}} : Great item if the enemy team is low CC but high magic damage. \n\n{{item:3139}} : If they have high magic damage and moderate-high CC. If you are up against a {{champion:238}} , {{champion:8}}, {{champion:429}} that deals heavy damage as a result of their marks on you then this is a good item.\n\n{{item:3222}} : One of the best support items. Good vs CC heavy teams.\n\n{{item:3165}} : Build against teams with allot of sustain. Meaning champions like: {{champion:37}}, {{champion:16}}, {{champion:267}}  ect.\n\n{{item:3042}} : Build on auto attack champions if you know they won't be able to kill you.\n\n{{item:3056}} : Good item against teams with allot of wave clear or good with split push comps. Makes pushing tower easy.\n\n{{item:3115}} : Build on AP champions that have on-hit effects already.\n\n{{item:3046}} : This item works well against slow teams, giving you heaps of kite and damage.\n\n{{item:3116}} : Build this item against teams with allot of speed, similar to frozen heart.\n\n{{item:3800}} : Build this item against poke team comps. Gives you a better engage and slows them as well.\n\n{{item:3143}} : This is a great item against auto attack champions. Build this when they have 2+ auto attack champions that deal damage. Care not to build frozen heart with this item.\n\n{{item:3065}} : As a tank build this against AP heavy teams or if you can gain from it's other effects.\n\n{{item:3048}} : Build on mana hungry champions if enemy team has high burst.\n\n{{item:3072}} : If you need a bit more survivability and damage.\n\n{{item:3075}} : Against heavy AD teams.\n\n{{item:3135}} : Against heavy MR teams, get this if the opponent has 3+ enemies with MR.\n\n{{item:3083}} : Build this if they have low damage in their team.\n\n{{item:3091}} : Good item for bruisers if they have allot of AP on their team AND you need more damage.\n\n{{item:3060}} : Good for split push comps.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Farming Extended**\n\nYou have to perfect this and he is a few tips to help maximize your farming:\n\n~ Standing closer will help you get the last hit - be careful of being poked, especially if it's the seigh minion.\n~ Tower takes 3 shots to kill a melee minion, attack it after the second shot.\n~ Tower takes 2 on ranged. If you only have dorans or long sword attack it once before tower hits and then after.\n~ Don't attack the minion that is taking the most damage, if you do you'll most likely miss the cs due to auto attack cool down.\n~ Don't Attack a minion that is lower than half health.\n~ If almost all your minions is attack a single one use your ability to get it. The timing is hard on minions that are being killed fast.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Learn to trade**\n\n1. Learn your champions trading combos. For example if {{champion:67}} auto's before he Q she does more dps in the long run because after Q she has to wait for the cool down on her auto which can take too long and allows her to get more damage before she E's them away.\n\n2. Poke your enemy if they come in to CS. This is tricky because it requires you to come in closer and can result in you losing farm and health. \n\n3. Don't try to trade if your minions are low on health. Rather stay back and farm.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-15T22:23:23.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"t1pz n tr1kz for junglin\n\n1.
