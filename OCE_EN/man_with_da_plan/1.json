We will be spending time together doing normal games, arams, customs, vods of our game prepays, and if within close location we can meet up for in-house lan sessions and extra curricular activities.\n\nIn the future we aim to get this team to challenger and have a goal set for 12 months once we have a first roster started. We also have plans later down the track for coaching opportunities, both for our team and transitioning our team into an organisation that provides coaching for lower ranked players and hosting teams of lower ranks within the organisation. Also quite possibly later down the track we might implement a guide system for our organisation to share mechanics of champions with players across the world that players within our team would have wrote themselves, this should help each other in the team with mechanical skill and mechanical awareness and anyone else in the organisation or persons with access to where we will store the information.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this kind of ranked team, If you are, shoot me up an add on league of legends and I will chat with you soon.\n\nThankyou\n\nIceagle.","replies":[{"poster":"N 4","date":"2015-09-10T23:23:09.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OMG do not join a team with GoW russiandan he is possibly the biggest sook I've ever met. I said lol and then he started abusing me and calling me Imature, spoilt, a brat, a child, a little bitch all because I said \"lol\". His last team which I was on all decided we had enough of him so we kicked him out so we didn't have to put up with his short temper and constraint complaining. If you decided to join his team then best of luck but I highly advise against it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FiddleMeDiddle","date":"2015-09-10T00:49:19.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey im an adc im d5 currently. ign:rundibaaz\n","replies":[]}]}
