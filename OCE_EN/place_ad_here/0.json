So in league, I have a goal to get all the runes, including tier 1 and tier 2.  I was very excited to see the 1 IP tier 2 rune sale but while I was purchasing these runes, I eventually got an error that read: \r\n&quot;An Error Has Occurred\r\nYou have attempted to purchase or already own more than the maximum amount for this item.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis was a very upsetting message to receive as now my dreams of owning all the runes has been destroyed.  I hope that one day Riot will increase the limit to allow us to own all of the runes so that the collectors among us can complete their collection.","replies":[{"poster":"NoMatterWhat","date":"2016-05-19T15:18:50.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel you .. i did the same , and i got the same problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-19T05:31:19.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its why I am only going for all of tier 3 because the limit allows you only enough to completely buy out 1 tier","replies":[]}]}
