This is probably the second best gamemode since I have been born, coming in real close from URF (Which I hope you bring back by the way) {{summoner:31}} And I hope that these pictures of pizza cats will help you in your stressful journey of making a great game an even greater game. Once again all I need is 42 RP which wouldn't be very hard, right? As a 3 year old League of Legends player. I have always heard of legendary stories of people getting small amounts of RP, but have never done it myself. So please just this one time I beg.
