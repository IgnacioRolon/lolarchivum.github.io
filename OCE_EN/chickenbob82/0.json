The first time the lock in screen did not appear, and therefore I dodged, receiving numerous server errors. After the 5min penalty, I queued again and dodged again as a result of not being able to click a champion to ban. I now have a 30min penalty and probably lost 2 placements already. Any suggestions?","replies":[]}
