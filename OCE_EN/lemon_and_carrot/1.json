Some youtubers see games as an income, some serious players see games as a life, how do you see LoL? \r\nI&#039;ve met enough spoilers, they ruin your games right? \r\nThese days, people playing normals are mad. Someone calls a lane, but some people fast-locks a champion without a word, then we see him as a random lane based on their champion and spells, but in the game, they just take the lane they want, like 2 mids. \r\nSome people is like, more &quot;aggressive&quot;, calls a lane later than the other player, then doesn&#039;t think about others feelings, either duo mid/top or feed/afk. How do other players feel?\r\nDear gamers, i&#039;m not a pro or anyone, i&#039;m just myself, i can&#039;t force you guys to do stuff, but please remember, the world will never stop spinning because of you, don&#039;t mess with other players feeling if your unhappy, we don&#039;t want it, keep it yourself. People that always need others to give them patience won&#039;t success. Who do you think you are? Yes, your like me, nobody, everybody is fair, we are humans, not your toys to play or blame.\r\nHow do you guys think about aggressive players these days? Getting quite bored of them huh?\r\nGaming for fun, always with pride.","replies":[{"poster":"Lemon and Carrot","date":"2015-05-23T02:42:25.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well not mainly about picking spots, but it's about how players react to themselves","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-05-22T07:42:29.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol normals are a joke... only play normals if you meet this single condition\n1. you main jungle/support/adc... why might you ask? supp is rarely taken, jg is easy to type really fast and hit enter (not many ppl like to play jungle anyways) and adc is also really easy to type in and hit enter... \n\nif you main top or mid, sorry but you have to learn these champions in bot games or go into normal queue and spam mid/top or feed then instalock...\n\nto avoid going into normals and spamming mid/top or feed I recommend watching the pros use this champion as well as spamming intermediate ai games...  just to get yourself familiar with its mechanics.\n\ni would avoid learning the following:\nLb\nKat\nthese are 100% pick ban in low elo\n\ntop laners are** rarely banned.,**.. most banned top laners include Riven Gnar Cho\n\ninstead learn to use:  \nAnnie\nSyndra\nXerath \nZiggs \nCho","replies":[{"poster":"Sunlit Earth","date":"2015-05-23T02:26:17.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tip: Type what role you want to play somewhere, hold down the shift button, press the arrow key to highlight it then press ctrl+c (copy), ctrl+v (paste).","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-22T07:53:25.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Samurai Jin,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EuEBBGYA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-22T07:42:29.474+0000)\n>\n> lol normals are a joke... only play normals if you meet this single condition\n> 1. you main jungle/support/adc... why might you ask? supp is rarely taken, jg is easy to type really fast and hit enter (not many ppl like to play jungle anyways) and adc is also really easy to type in and hit enter... \n> \n> if you main top or mid, sorry but you have to learn these champions in bot games or go into normal queue and spam mid/top or feed then instalock...\n> \n> to avoid going into normals and spamming mid/top or feed I recommend watching the pros use this champion as well as spamming intermediate ai games...  just to get yourself familiar with its mechanics.\n> \n> i would avoid learning the following:\n> Lb\n> Kat\n> these are 100% pick ban in low elo\n> \n> top laners are** rarely banned.,**.. most banned top laners include Riven Gnar Cho\n> \n> instead learn to use:  \n> Annie\n> Syndra\n> Xerath \n> Ziggs \n> Cho\n\nCho & annie are banned in low elo no doubt kek","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CorruptedScythe","date":"2015-05-22T09:28:09.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you play blind pick normals, why not try out team builder?
