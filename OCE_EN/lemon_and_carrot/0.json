I just want to enjoy a game, but people are all rushing in and feeding, loses and blames the back row doing nothing xD\r\n\r\nI&#039;m Plat 4 and teammates keep playing bad forcing ff@20, then i get put to low ELO playing with bronze and silver that instalock carry lanes eg. mid top. They just feed first-blood in less than 3 mins into game. If u guys don&#039;t trust me feel free to search &quot;Lemon and Carrot&quot;  match history and check every lost is because of some one feeding. Putting a plat against bronze and silver is hard to carry riot. Planning to quit league since riot system is broken.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any good games to play? I&#039;m tired of league, gonna switch a game before i spend anymore $$ for Christmas bundles.\r\nNot gonna spend too much time on league, not suggesting it to friends due to unbalanced game play.\r\n\r\n**Either fix or quit. Riot**","replies":[{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-01-01T04:27:06.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd take a long break (a week or so) and then come back.

If you're good, and your team mate is also good, you can carry that game. If you bring in 2 friends, that is 3 people on your team who are **guaranteed** _not_ to be trolls. This brings down the chances of seeing a troll down by a hefty **_60%_**.\n\nAs for calming down, just take a break after each game. Playing after a frustrating experience will make you perform worse. Have a snack, ~~do some stretches,~~ watch a youtube video, get a drink.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-12-22T12:55:30.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need help.Killing yourself over a game?...........\nyou need srs help bro","replies":[]}]}
