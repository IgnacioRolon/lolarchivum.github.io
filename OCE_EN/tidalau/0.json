A fully setup run page can be important on every jungler. I play people who aren't meant to jungle as jungle sometimes, and my runes and masteries let me survive better than you did as Master Yi.\nHowever, you are level 14.\nDon't rush getting your runes until like 20, is the first point. You want those tier 3 runes, baybee. Running a good mastery page is pretty much just as important and, in some cases, more so. What you probably want to do is get some of the defence you plan on using for level 30 masteries before the offence, as taking less damage may benefit you more for those early clears.\nWhat do I suggest you do though? Even though Master Yi is one of those easy junglers, he is squishy and his early clears can be difficult to complete without the proper runes and masteries. He has inbuilt sustain on his meditate, but that isn't working as well as it could for you. \nGo into custom games with a friend, just one is all you need. Get them to leash your first camp for you (I assume you know what that is? If not, that might be part of why your first clear leads to an execute) and test out your clearing potential from there. Once you are done practicing (it can only take 5 minutes), you can just leave. Steer clear of your friend leashing you as someone who can shield or heal you though, as you aren't always gonna get someone like that. That way, you can test what masteries are going to let you clear the safest. Its what I do when I want to test jungle stuff. \nWhen you back for that first time, if you have the gold, you can buy more healing potions if you must.\nAnother good thing some people will before they have the proper runes and masteries is take heal/barrier in place of flash. Flash is, quite arguably, a much better choice. However, if you need one of those to finish your first clear or two, take one of them. After all, Master Yi has his ult and his Alpha Strike which allow him to get in out too. \nAnother thing you can do is try other junglers. Some of them are just more forgiving for people who do not yet have the right setups. Warwick has a lot of self-healing which he gets from fighting the jungle monsters, and so does Fiddlesticks. They are both reasonably cheap, I believe (I could be wrong) and easy to learn champions. Warwick specifically, once reaching level six, has some of the easiest ganks.\nI hope this all helps you to some extent. I would say more but I don't play much jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"TidaLau","date":"2015-01-29T10:29:09.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for your help.\nI will try out your suggestions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-29T09:58:35.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is %%%%ing hilarious, q when the red buff attack u and smite red buff when low hp","replies":[]}]}
