The IP / MP icons would have ample room where the chatbox currently is, and vice versa for the chatbox. I think the old client had the chatbox right and the new client has the champion stats right.\r\n\r\nAlso I think the runes look great in the collection menu but the store sidepanel&#039;s drop-down menu is tedious. The store&#039;s sidepanel should be more like the collections sidepanel, the less clicks the better! Maybe copying the same text selection or simply having coloured icons to click?\r\n\r\nOther than that, I like a lot of the changes and new features. The new rune and mastery pages are a huge improvement! Keep up the good work!","replies":[]}
