Maxing E may be preferred if you get ahead though but even then is a risky strat since you miss out on fury Generation and Waveclear and it is your primary tool for trading/fighting/clearing the jungle.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-16T13:18:50.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i added you in game im happy to teach you :D","replies":[{"poster":"HextechEkko","date":"2015-11-17T11:19:59.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY for adding.
