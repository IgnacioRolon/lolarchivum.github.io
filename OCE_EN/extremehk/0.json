First thing you should try is launching it in Admin mode (either rightclick and select run as administrator, or go to the c:/riot games folder and select the admin launcher.\n\nIf that doesn't work, go to your c/riot games/league of legends folder. Inside the folder called RADS, there will be another folder called \"Lol_air_client\"\nDelete it, and relaunch the admin client. It will patch and redownload the file, usually fixing your problem.","replies":[]}]}
