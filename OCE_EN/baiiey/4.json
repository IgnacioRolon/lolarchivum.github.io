As of yet I&#039;ve only got straight forward ones such as &#039;TT OCE&#039; or &#039;OC3&#039;. So I&#039;d like to ask for your thoughts/ideas.\r\n\r\n**What is the best 3v3 club name you can think of?**\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re interested in joining the club, or even just the discord feel free to add me in-game,\r\nSummoner name: Jirah\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any responses!","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T22:11:11.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you like Dirk Gently, then 'The Rowdy 3' would be appropriate (note: there's more than 3 of them).","replies":[]}]}
