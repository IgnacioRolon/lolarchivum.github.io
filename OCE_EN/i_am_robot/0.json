How is she so broken? Is she, or am I missing something? I mean I thought champs that went tear&gt;catalyst were supposed to be sacrificing early game power, but as soon as she hits level 6, there is literally 0 counterplay if you don&#039;t outrange her in some way or aren&#039;t playing something like Zed with a super duper strong all in, i.e. except very specific matchups, skill really has nothing to do with  it anymore, she just walks up and uses two (essentially) point and click abilities. If you get close, it makes it easy to land a stun. You still took her down? Nice, here&#039;s another health bar. The base damages are just absurd. Makes sense if she has to land her Q, but she doesn&#039;t. You do not have to land your Qs to play an effective Anivia. \n\nSo what&#039;s the deal here? People&#039;s thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-20T21:41:00.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do have to land Q to play an effective anivia, if she misses her Q then she is forced to use her R to proc her E damage, once she has done that (sure it takes a chunk of your health away but a R/E combo cant 100-0 something so youll still be alive and with all your abilities) she legit has nothing left to hit you with for at least 6 seconds, and any half decent mid laner can kill a defenceless squishy in well under 6 seconds.\n\nThey key thing to do is not be scared when her E crits, i play anivia a fair amount, and when i crit E on someone, they shit themselves and run away, which exactly what she wants you do to because she's out of tricks after that, the only thing she has left is a wall.","replies":[{"poster":"I Am Robot","date":"2016-01-22T08:57:12.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except other mid laners also have cds., with one rotation not being enough to 100-0 someone early to mid game.\n\nThere's also the issue of taking creep damage. Since anivia is ranged (and she can be shoving the wave in as she's chunking you to half) she doesn't suffer a lot from minion aggro. There's also the fact that she has two health bars :^). People don't just turn and run away, they hit back  but a guaranteed half hp combo  at level 6 every 6 seconds is broken so it's much more difficult to out trade than it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-22T09:38:24.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia is an incredibly vulnerable champion. Sure her E does a butt-ton of damage but as Sesshomaru said, what then? If she can't hit the Q, or is out of position to wall you into her R for long enough for a second E she's got nothing. Champions with ANY form of mobility present a pretty hard counter to Anivia, her Q is the slowest projectile in the game, and AoE or not, is very hard to engage with. She excels in teamfights, not so much in lane.\n\nAnd even mid laners without that mobility can counter Anivia effectively if you know what to look out for. Brand out-ranges Anivia with his damage, and his AoE is MUCH easier to hit. Annie has an on hit or an instant stun, take your pick, whereas Anivia's Q will only stun you if it detonates on you. Syndra has a much longer range stun that is long enough to make it in with ult, and enough burst to kill the egg (which isn't a whole nother health bar as it has massive Armour/MR reduction, and is also on a 4 minute CD). \n\nThe list goes on, but Anivia is actually quite weak unless you really know what you're doing, and the enemy doesn't. I would argue she's harder to play that Cass in the current state of the game who typically is considered to be one of the hardest mid laners.\n\nYou also mention creep damage, but that's about all she's got going for her pre-6. Melee mobile assassins like Zed, Talon etc are hard counters to Anivia, because even if you drop your ult on yourself, chances are they're going to kill you and jump out before you can even hit your E, and you're rarely ever going to have an opportunity to land your Q. Though I will say Kat is pretty easy to counter as Anivia, the wall interrupts so you can just drop it on Kat's ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-22T09:33:51.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with you, and I think it largely comes down to experience. Anivia doesn't show up much, and hasn't in a good long while, so there are plenty of people who have never played her and have only rarely played against her. It's all very well knowing theoretically how to counter someone, but without the experience of actually doing so it only goes so far.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrisfa","date":"2017-04-03T08:45:06.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anivia has been my main for many many years, going on 6 years now and no changes have ever been made to her until recently and tbh with you, she has gotten nerfed quite significantly. her E does not do anywhere near as much as what it used to and her R must be fully charged to even do any damage and by that time anyone with half a brain has already left the area of effect. If you said she was broken as in \"bad\" then yes I would 100% agree with you","replies":[]}]}
