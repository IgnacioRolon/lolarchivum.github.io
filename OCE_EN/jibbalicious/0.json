I built {{item:3071}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3742}} like in the video Phreak showed but it seems crap. I feel like she needs sustain but it's difficult to itemise for usefully.\n\nMaybe Iceborn would be better but even then I don't think it suits her style when top laning, because it's way more utility and duo lane effective on her in bot lane as a Support.\n\nNightblue3 (NA Challenger) plays her in the Jungle with Warriors, Cleaver, Deadman's and Randuins but I tried her jungle too and again she feels sorta weak - he takes Grasp of the Undying though and I've tried that and fervor in top lane but taking Grasp of the undying in bot lane makes her nasty late game and taking bond of stone can be great too - but I think if you do play her bot lane, your duelling with grasp of the undying makes you almost impossible to peel because you are sustained and you provide so much utility that taking grasp of the undying instead of bond of stone, along with your shield and the shield and healing mastery with the movespeed in river mastery and the points in offense like ability damage, double edged sword, vampirism and oppressor make her a complete menace.\n\nMaybe I just need to practice her, but it seems like she has a crapload of utility but not a lot of duelling power until late game and when she hits late game, lacks a gap closer so I feel like she belongs in bot lane as a support because she punishes so many people with her W and locks them down with stun and slow at the same time, plus her ulti completely smashes people. (flat AD Reds and Quints, Armor seals and MR Glyphs).","replies":[]}]}
