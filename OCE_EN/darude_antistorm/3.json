Casting Threaded Volley converts the area into worked ground for a few minutes. Additional Threaded Volley casts over worked ground will yield just one rock projectile.\r\n\r\nNow this I&#039;m ok for the most part I feel like it&#039;s going to limit her options when in Laining phase \r\nOther than that nice\r\n\r\nW: SEISMIC SHOVE\r\nTaliyah marks a target location. After a brief delay, the ground erupts, knocking up and damaging all enemies caught in the blast zone. Taliyah can recast Seismic Shove before it erupts to throw the victims in any targeted direction&mdash;even over walls.\r\n\r\nOk first off I don&#039;t like the delay if you watch the video it seems very easy to dodge and I feel like that&#039;s her only power is a knock up which is silly\r\n\r\n\r\nE: UNRAVELED EARTH\r\nTaliyah scatters boulders onto the ground before her. Opponents who dash through the fractured earth take damage from an explosion. After a few seconds, any remaining rocks in the field erupt, dealing a second wave of damage.\r\n\r\nI feel like this just doesn&#039;t fit with the rest of her kit that&#039;s all I really have for this one \r\n\r\nR: WEAVER&#039;S WALL\r\nTaliyah briefly channels before summoning a massive wall of spiraling rock that tears through the Rift in a target direction. Taliyah can reactivate Weaver&#039;s Wall while channeling to ride atop the wall as it emerges. Taking damage or inputting a move command in any direction will cut her ride short.\r\n\r\nThis is a wasted opportunity creates a wall it just seems dull it&#039;s only going to be used as a quick way to lane and I hate that this ability could be so cool I just feel like it doesn&#039;t live up to the champ\r\n\r\nSo I feel kinda disappointed but I can see where there trying to go I just hate to see another {{champion:420}}  cause I feel like she is underplayed as well \r\n\r\nSo this is what I think but hey I&#039;m just a malzahar main {{champion:90}} \r\n \r\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-06-12T12:26:56.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her Q and W are alright thematically and aesthetically (though it needs to work more like a Rumble ult so you can just click-and-flick).

You've got to put the champion in context though. You mention Illaoi, but in actual fact Illaoi is *the* reason Taliyah is so underwhelming.\n\nIllaoi was a nightmare to play. She is incredibly complex in her abilities, and knowing when to time everything and use her abilities takes some significant effort. And that's not even including which items to build on her. Jhin had already been fully planned, and although he's slightly less complicated, still has abilities where you need to time them specifically and optimise your build path to suit his passive. Players inevitibly began to complain about the increasing complexity of the champions Riot was releasing.\n\nAnd thus we have the next two champs we see today. Aurelion Sol and Taliyah. Aurelion is incredibly simple to play and build. It goes back to the good old days of champions. The same is true for Taliyah. Simple abilities and easy build path. I think it's great that Riot has released two easy-to-play champions, where new players can pick them up and be workhorses with them easily. Sure they're not going to completely dominate in the sense a mechanically complex champion like Zed or Lee Sin can, with their multiple ability paths and work arounds, but they can be a good, sound champion that can have impact on a game.\n\nI do agree that her E is a bit strange. With her only other damaging ability really being Q - which gets weaker if you use it in the same spot - you would think that her bombs would explode on movement, not just dashes. It's too similar to a Ziggs ult, and the graphics/layout of the bombs just look strange. I would've preferred something else.\n\nHowever, Taliyah's ultimate is amazing. I haven't seen what it's max range is, but if it's just as long as I've seen, it's still a serious game changer. Sure you can use it as a quick way to get around, but the point is that it's a WALL. A wall you can't move through. Think for a second. Enemy trying to escape from a gank? Blocked. Team about to stop you from finishing off Baron or Drag? You're sealed in and they can't get you now. Or alternatively, you can seal them in if they're taking it and pop down that Ziggs/Gangplank ulti. Team sieging your base and knocking on inhib turrets? Sealed. Play it well, and your ult is just amazing. I haven't seen what happens when it hits a minion or champion, but if it displaces, that's amazing (if it stunned, it'd be sweet too!).\n\nSo overall, while yes Taliyah is a bit underwhelming, she is what the game needs at the moment, and will still have significant impact.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-07T00:28:37.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"zed isnt mechanically complex... its legit ult maybe w e q aa, dont even need to hit q to di anything. he is a one trick pony who kills most champs without any need for actual skill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darude AntiStorm","date":"2016-05-05T23:39:17.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree however ilaoi while she wasn't simple she was not really viable in the current meta if that makes any sense","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2016-05-07T00:10:22.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like how they didn't overload her kit with tons of mobility but god damnit another map utility ult really bugs me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-05T22:48:20.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think her kit looks pretty good actually,\n\nHer W has some real play potential with the ability to force an opponent out of position or even cancel channeling like Katerina's or Nunu's. Imagine being able to push away an assassins like Zed or peeling the tank away from the ADC. Gotta admit shoving a garen or maokai away or a volibear can make a huuuge difference.\n\nHer E detonates on dashes, well if you can land your W you can push them onto her E which counts as a dash. Furthermore Jhin's W also has a similar delay but it's still very easy to avoid if not easier, yet is still a very strong ability. Also building Rylais on her makes her Q use the full effect of the slow so it's much harder to escape her E at that point and avoid the W while doing so. \n\nHer R is a bit interesting in that it gives a lot of mobility but not only that it creates an actual wall that functions like terrain. Now I'm no real expert but I do play Anivia and that wall is very potentially game changing in itself in the hands of a skilled veteran. I feel Talia would either function as a mid roamer or an actual jungler in that the ability to divide and conquer while outright cutting off escape in team fights can be game changing.\n\nHell I imagine there will be an off tank build just for her somewhere down the line where she'll be used specifically for team fights. \n\nAll in all I think this kit offers a lot of possibilities. I think it's unfair to dismiss her especially since she only hit the PBE recently.
