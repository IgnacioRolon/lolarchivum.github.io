Having an issue? That's the *first* place you look.\n\nDid you just ask support if you could transfer from NA to OCE, or did you actually ask if there was a reason you couldn't from EUNE? I find it hard to believe that support would tell you that transfers from EUNE weren't possible, since the only regions that are transfer restricted/locked are Korea and Garena.\n\nSupport might be able to help you get to OCE without spending more RP since you only transferred to NA with the express purpose of making it to OCE, but they have no _obligation_ to, so I'd strongly recommend being **polite** about it. \n\nFYI transfers are also unavailable on patch days until both servers are on the same patch.","replies":[{"poster":"LRIG Tama","date":"2018-11-01T02:34:22.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, there were no exclamation marks on the NA or EUNE client :( And I was only on the OCE client to briefly look at their region transfer section, but by then I'd already transfered to NA.\n\nSorry for being short (? that the word ?) with you.

They get a lot of crap they don't deserve and I got defensive, but that's no excuse so I'm sorry for that.\n\nOutside of regular maintenance these sorts of transfer issues tend to be very short notice (a change that shouldn't have affected transfers was made and did, or the proper people weren't notified in time that a change might affect transfers, something unexpectedly breaks etc.), so communication to other regions isn't always the best (since it's *technically* just an OCE issue).\n\nMy point about support being able to help you still stands. Once transfers become available again, if you contact support and explain that there was some confusion with the articles that resulted in you purchasing a transfer you didn't need, in the hopes of getting to the server you wanted, they may be able to do something for you (but again, they have no obligation, don't go in expecting a yes).\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf you have any dramas come back to boards and we can usually point you in the right direction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-11-05T07:36:28.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As your thread has been marked as solved, I'll be closing comments here shortly.
