Note this is still a Work in Progress\r\nAny critique is welcome, if any thing is unclear feel free to ask.\r\n\r\n**Isabella, the Stage Queen**\r\n*Overview*\r\nIsabella is base on the idea of a dancing champion.  This is a very unique style based being a bit of a dancer myself.\r\nThe question of what role Isabella should fill was difficult, I chose to make her more a mage/marksman due to the idea that what makes a performance look good is the combination of moves strung together.  This has been the ground work for Isabella's design, combining her basic abilities is to feel very rewarding and make her feel like her dance combos together.  I envision Isabella a bit more down the Latin styles, as they can be combined with a Vuuduu identity\r\n\r\n*Lore \t\t\t\t \t\t\t*\r\n[WIP]\r\n\t\t \t\r\n*Stats*\r\n[WIP]\r\nHealth \t\t\t\t\r\nHealth regen. \t\t\r\nMana \t\t\t\t\t\r\nMana regen. \t\t\t\r\nRange \t\t\t\r\nAttack damage \t\r\nAttack speed \t\t\r\nArmor \t\t\t\r\nMagic res. \t\t\r\nMov. speed\t\t\r\n\t \t\r\n*Abilities*\r\nPassive; Spirit Performance\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\r\nIsabella cannot have the Cooldowns on her abilities reduced.\r\nCombining Isabella's basic abilities and basic attacks in quick succession generates **admiration**.  The abilities become more powerful based on how much **admiration ** she has.  While not activating basic abilities Isabella's **admiration ** depletes.  Using the same ability within 1.5 seconds reduces the amount of **admiration **produced by 25%.  Basic attacks generate 10 **admiration**.\r\nThere is no limit on how much **admiration **Isabella can have.\r\nUpon activating an ability all others go on a 0.5 second cooldown.\r\n*Note that using the ability four times in a row will produce no admiration, using it a fifth time will deplete it*\r\n\t\t \t\r\nQ; Inline Turn\t\t\t\r\nCost: +20 Admiration{space}CD: 1 sec{space}Range:200\r\nIsabella uses a turn pattern to dash in target direction, during the turn Isabella lands a basic attack that deals 50/60/70/80/90% damage on a nearby enemy and is then able to attack immediately after the dash that deals (1AP per 10 admiration) bonus magic damage (lasts for 0.5 seconds).\t\r\n\t \t\r\nW; Break forward\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r\nCost: +20 Admiration{space}CD: 1 sec{space}Range: 600\r\nIsabella does a Rock step or Body Roll to allow her to fire a simple blast of spirit energy in target direction, dealing 10/20/30/40/50(+0.1AP)(+0.1Admiration) Magic damage to the first enemy hit.\r\n\t\t \t\r\nE; Syncopate\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\r\nCost:\t+ 20 Admiration{space}CD: 1 sec\t\r\nIsabella's next auto attack will strike twice in quick succession, the second dealing 25/30/35/40/45% less damage.  Any on-hit effects are only activated on the second auto attack, any damage dealt by the on-hit effect is amplified by 100(+1 per 10 Admiration) %  \r\n\r\nR; Finale\t\r\nCD: 60 Sec{space}Range: 500\r\nIsabella performs her grand finale healing her allies for (1.0 Admiration) and stunning all nearby enemies for 1.5 seconds.  Isabella's admiration is depleted back to 0","replies":[{"poster":"Merciless","date":"2015-01-19T19:47:41.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see your reasoning with her identity, but I think she sounds a little op. Or allot. Maybe a hell of a lot. Or maybe not at all. I cant really tell. Shes all over the place.\nWhat I think the first thing you should do, is define whether your making this person as an ADC, or a Caster. The weird middle point shes in at the moment leaves her with great possibilities, but no real strength to back it up. I cant see any reason to build her caster with her weak ability scaling off of AP. Particularly when her W, the poke part of her kit, has such small scaling and miniscule base damage as well.\nOn the other hand, Admiration having no limit, abilities and autoattacks build it up, and some damage scales off it as well as a heal? Thats kinda asking for trouble from the start if she has NO upper limit on the possible damage applied by her adoration. Especially if every ability (apart from the ult) has a 1 second CD. How do you propose the depletion system? And the time between ability usage before it stops having a reduced effect? Does that time count individually for each ability?\n****\nNow I'll get more indepth with it and explain my thoughts and why; \n**Q) Inline Turn**\nThere are some points that I find confusing. Particularly, Bonus Magic Damage = (1AP per 10 admiration). Do you mean it scales more off AP if you have more Adoration? Or that it does (+0.1 Adoration) as Magic Damage? Other point is (Lasts 0.5 seconds). Is that how long the Dash takes to do? Or how the Magic damage is applied over time? Its not quite clear, and for a dash thats only 200 range theres no real point if it has that long a time, you would basically move the same distance with upgraded boots anyway. Moving on, my thoughts;\n\nWhile not incredibly OP due to its shorter range, imagine vsing it. Its like a shorter Vayne Roll or Lucian Dash, with a 1 second cooldown and does a weakened Auto before the dash as well as a stronger one after the dash. I dont really have problems with the damage on this, but will point out that thats basically a bonus magic damage for every AA and  but the entire role of an ADC is that they do constant damage but need peel/protection as theyre squishy. \nA 1 second Dash goes against that because I can just imagine someone abusing it as much as they need to in order to survive if the tables turn on them. its almost like chasing a Yasuo with shorter Dashes but doesnt even need minions to dash and can do it in any direction. If used skillfully 200 range is more than enough to dodge any skillshots.\n\nA possible balancing mechanic could be that, like Vaynes Tumble, it wont go on cd until the charged Auto has been used. That would make it keep its utility in teamfights, but not become an unstoppable escape mechanic. Of course, it would still be powerful in fights for its utility, but atleast its not overly powerful, it would be more like a slower Kalista Passive or a shorter and weaker but more rapidly usable Vayne Tumble. \n****\n**W) Break Forward**\nTo be honest I dont know how to feel about this. It feels kind of underwhelming or out of place when combined with the rest of her kit. I can imagine it, a sort of body/hip roll where she might flick out an arm that in turn shoots out a energy blast, or something similar. Maybe not the arm, and the flick comes from her hips, or something along those lines?\n\nIm imagining it like a Karma Q, but with a smaller or no AoE. What I mean by underwhelming, is the damage, which i find ironic considering my worries about her power.  But 10 damage per level? Thats nearly non-existant damage. With (+0.1AP) thats still literally 10 damage for 100 AP. Still miniscule. And (+0.1 Admiration) sounds, well. 30 auto attacks and then a W would do say (320 admiration = 32) damage. Still miniscule. Counting in the enemies MR, which tend to be around 30-52.5 base MR before items\n\nIt would really depend on how you used it. I can see it fitting a very tight playstyle where you deliberately hold off ulting, avoid on building damage and purely build Attack Speed to build max Admiration. Otherwise this ability is underwhelming on its own. \n\nBut when you keep in mind that 0.5 second gap between other abilities, you could use it to say, get constant weak harass off between Q escaping. But thats still all it would be. Constant, but extremely weak. If anything, I think it should have some sort of very short, very weak cc, say a 0.33 second (10/15/20/25/30%) slow for example. Enough to give it utility for more interaction with other abilities, and increase its usefulness, while still having a small enough effect individually to not be op.\n****\n**E) Syncopate**\nFirstly, i think you misstyped. \n> the second dealing 25/30/35/40/45% less damage. Any on-hit effects are only activated on the second auto attack, any damage dealt by the on-hit effect is amplified by 100(+1 per 10 Admiration) %\n\nNow, with how ability leveling is typically written,  that would imply that the higher the ability level the higher the percentage of less damage it would do, or in simpler terms the higher level the ability the weaker it would be. Now im assuming you either meant 45/40/35/30/25% less damage, which would be fairly reasonable, or 25/30/35/40/45% more damage, which assuming it works like a lucian passive would be pretty op as a bonus shot steroid as it would not only be stronger but also have a 1 second CD. As its more reasonable, im assuming you meant the first. Another point needing clarification is, does the damage reductiong (provided thats what it is) also apply to the on hit effects? Im assuming you didnt mean it like that\n\nWith those assumptions, I actually think it sounds semi-reasonable ability in some ways, and absolutely broken yet again in others. Though the On hit effects only count on the second shot, it still does (+1 per 10 Admiration)% damage. On a BotRK, that sounds reasonable. But when you look at other items, you start to realize how it could abused. Sheen-built items for example, like a Trinity Force, would deal **TONS OF DAMAGE** (Had to say it). But it is true. I'll chuck some numbers at you so you can see my point. \n\n ** Warning, this is math heavy. I'll box it for clarification purposes**\n> Lets say you're an average ADC, its typically pretty early. You have around 100 base AD, Infinity Edge for another 80, and Trinity for another 30. That comes to 210 AD, and 30% Crit with +50% crit damage. Seems like a fair build. Now Imagine using the E. First hit does the 210, maybe it crits, maybe not. Now, because E's an ability, your Trinitys Spellblade passive activated. Then in comes your second hit. What do you get? \n>\n> + Auto = *(210 - 45/40/35/30/25%)*\n> + +Spellblade = *(210 x 2)* for the trinitys Bonus Damage = *420*\n> + +Syncopate Effect on on hit effects = *the 420 x 100(+0.1 Adoration)%* \n> (And dont forget the E usage = +20 Adoration and just did an Autoattack for +10 Adoration, so even from 0 you now have 30 adoration or 103% bonus)\n> **Which, if you've kept up, is**\n> = Auto + 432.6. Remember that 30% Crit chance? If you just crit well congrats, with your Infinity you just did 250% of that since spellblades bonus applies on the auto which can in turn crit. So just casually (*2.5). I think that starts to get out of hand.\n>  But Wait, Theres More! Thats from **0** base adoration. \n> \n> Lets say you sat in lane Autoing for a while, purposely stacking up adoration. Lets say you get 1000 adoration. Sounds big, but remember its +10 per AA so even without abilities its just 100 Autos. And then try E. 852 damage anyone? Sure, why not crit off that 30% chance for 2130 damage\n>** Thats just 210 AD**\n> \n> If you had, say, a Bloodthirster, Merc Scimitar, and a Ghostblade *(Cause why not? who needs a protection item when Damages so OP? You have a cleanse and ms active, and can still bring boots incase your feet get cold when walking over their corpses. Low? Ult! Run wild!)* you have 210+190 = 400 AD, 45% crit chance, and +20 Armour Pen. I'll save myself explaining the math, you can figure it out if you really want, but with the 1000 adoration (which I dont think is that unreasonable if you were focusing it, which you most certainly would with results like these; \n>\n> + 400 Damage Auto \n> + +Spellblade = 800 bonus\n> + +Syncopate (with 30 Adoration) = 24 bonus \n> + +Crit Chance (45% at x2.5 result) = Possible x2.5 (= 2060)\n> **OR**\n> + +Spellblade = 800 bonus\n> + +Syncopate (with 1000 Adoration) = another 800 bonus\n> + +Crit Chance (45% at x2.5 result) = Possible x2.5 (= 4000)\n\nFor this abilities sake alone, I hope you're extremely careful with Admiration.\n****\n**R) Finale**\nIts a perfectly fine ability, except it instantly counters all engage on her in a sizable radius, heals her and allies for what could potentially be an enormous amount, and essentially when combined with the Q's Dash means that shes literally just about untouchable. Oh, did I mention that her Q range combines with the range on this can be used to essentially reach just about any champion, assuming your in an aa battle with them as an adc or trying to get into if they're a Caster? then you can stun, and E, and well.... theyre dead at that point. Oh, but it heals, meaning it fixes any damage you took getting into range. Did I mention ADC's are supposed to be killable and need peel?\n\nPS. Ive hit the character limit, but thats the basics. I like the concept, and the particular thought put in the moves, but you need to define her play style more, and run numbers to see expected damage with certain item combinations. Also, whats her AA's? ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-27T01:16:23.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, that's a lot of information.

As a general rule I recommend ignoring the numbers as without sufficient testing it is hard to determine, they more of a starting point and used to demonstrate scaling, I’ll address each based on each ability.\nI decided Mage/Marksman after I finished the abilities as I didn’t want the abilities to be dictated by her role only to find it wasn’t what I was after.  I was actually leaning more to a support, but decided against it once I made her first ability and passive.  The weak scaling is more to at least put some sort of balance on her, I know Karthus might have better scaling on his Q but remember Karthus also has mana.\nThe admiration having no limit is to give her a reward for combining abilities and AAs while staying relatively safe, maybe having the abilities hit will raise the admiration will give her some better counterplay or having “if she is hit admiration is lost”.  Actually I wanted to give players rewards for combining abilities in particular orders, but decided against it because that would mean playing against the game and having to remember combos.   The depletion is mentioned in the passive, suppose rate not mentioned, MB.  The reduced admiration is for each individual ability.\n\nQ\nIt is more AP scaling with more Admiration.  The “lasts 0.5 seconds” is how long you have the bonus damage on your next AA.  \nVayne’s dash is 300, as well as a cooldown only slightly higher and her bonus damage proc lasts for 6 seconds, While Kalista has a dash at the same rate as her AA and again is probably further, so I should have it slightly higher.  \n\nW\nDude, please keep it PG, she flicks it out of her hands.\nYea the damage seems pretty low but again no resource cost.  I hear what you are saying the AP could be higher but then again It’s not hard to get AP, I’m just concerned about it being abused.  The Admiration scaling is low for the same reason and again for no utility.\nThis more to be her long range poke, so I might be able to increase the range while giving her a small Attack range (around 500 I think (Morg’s is 450), what ya think?\n\nE\nArgh, cheers for picking that up will correct.\nThe damage reduction does not apply to the on-hit effect.\nI see where you’re coming from, I’ll relook at this, might need a clean up on the passive, again the numbers are more of a demonstration on the scaling, TBH I was struggling with this one.\n\nR\nOne name Janna.\nI just realised I messed up forgot scaling on this, will fix (might increase the CD while I’m at it).\nShe is unable to heal herself, I might need to make that clearer.\nThe original idea was to make this some  sort of explosive finishing move, honestly I don’t know why I went for a heal and stun it seemed right for some reason.\nMight relook at this and figure out why I chose this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shroom","date":"2015-01-20T00:38:55.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a bit long dont you think, who is gonna read the whole thing","replies":[{"poster":"Merciless","date":"2015-01-20T12:48:14.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=gfasifffqwafgyed,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=WTYmuEhw,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-01-20T00:38:55.718+0000)\n>\n> a bit long dont you think, who is gonna read the whole thing\n\nWell its my opinions.
