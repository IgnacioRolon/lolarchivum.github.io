Every night he would tell her stories of action and bravery from the demacian forces in the rune wars, to legendary monsters and creatures that roamed rune terra. Seyanne was captivated and could wait nothing more then closing time of her father’s bookshop where he could tell her about the wonders of the outside world. Her father; Jaed loved seeing the look of wonder on his daughters face and decided to unearth some books at the back of his shop that he had been keeping for a long time that would create the ultimate story no book has ever told. This he believed would be what would fill her heart with the most beautiful joy he could think of, ancient artifacts long forgotten and he knew for her it was his legacy to create these. Each day and night he worked tirelessly to create armor from the ancients, swords that breathed life into it’s surroundings. However time went by, Seyanne was growing up and people were beginning to notice her foreign ideas about the world, influenced by the different perspectives read from Jaed’s books and the stories told at night. Whispers floated around demacia about someone poisoning the values of the young, teachings that were said influencing children to reject demacian’ ideals. These words reached the ears of the authorities and a hunt was started, informants in neighborhoods and schools in order to find the source of these rumors. Finally when Seyanne turned 21 Jaed had finished his life’s work, a wingsuit of ancient design he called paragon’s flight accompanied by a sword he called the arm of justice for which he planned to show during her birthday/nameday (I don’t know how birthdays are treated or called in demacia). Unfourtunately the demacian authorities got to him first, just before he asked her to come see her surprise. Seyanne, before the authorities came back for her, saw the fate of her father and the gifts he had left for her, before the heavy burden of loss would come over her, without any idea how to use the wingsuit she donned the armor and took off, much to the surprise of the demacian enforcers and her neighbors. No one had seen her or known where she had gone until 5 years later when she joined the league of legends, to open the freedom of knowledge without punishment to all the nations of Rune terra   \n \n \n \n  \nStats \nHealth 400 (+ 45)\nHealth regen. 1.2 (+.2) \nMana  10\nMana regen. 0  \nRange  145\nAttack damage  62 (+3)\nAttack speed  0.61\nArmor  44\nMagic res.  22\nMov. speed 340\n  \nAbilities \n\nPassive; Focal strength:  Seyanne doesn’t use mana, instead she uses insight which increases upon hitting an enemy with an ability up to a cap of 10. When hitting that cap her abilities are boosted but she cannot gain insight for 15 seconds. Upon hitting an enemy with an ability, another ability she uses on the same enemy within 6 seconds amplifies that ability\n \n  \nQ; Runepowered; Runepowered causes Seyannes next basic attack to deal 5/10/20/40/60 (+55% bonusAD) bonus damage as well as influencing her other abilities. \nAbility chain bonus; A flashier attack animation (+60% AD instead of +55% bonus AD) \nInsight bonus; Runepowered deals splash damage (3/4 of her attack range) on her next basic attack and gives a perminanat health shield based on 40% of Seyannes missing health\nCost: +1 insight if struck CD: 5/4/3.5/3/2.5 Range: On hit\n  \nW; Study for weakness; Seyanne targets an enemy for 5 seconds in her vision causing their armor and magic resistance to be reduced by (10% of their current health). \nRunepowered; Their armor and magic resist are instead reduced for (8% of their total health) and their movement speed is reduced by 5%. \nAbility chain bonus; Seyanne gains the armor and magic resist that enemy loses minus 40% for the duration. \nInsight; Instead of an armor and magic resist debuff, enemy champions now take 10% more damage from all sources, runepowered + insight bonus; their movement speed is also reduced by 15%\nCost: no insight CD: 15/12/10/8/6 seconds Range: 400\n \n  \nE; Take wing; Seyanne dashes (using her wings) 380 units in a target direction, dealing 60/70/80/100/125 damage (+10% of her movement speed) if she hits an enemy champion or neutral monster, as a secondary effect she vaults over them to travel 200 units further in the air. \nRunepowered; Seyanne instead of vaulting slams into enemy champion or neutral monster knocking them back 175 units that deals the same damage except scales with (+80% bonus armor).\nAbility chain bonus; Seyanne’s dash is increased to 425 units (this scales with her vault as well increasing to 250 units)\nInsight; Seyanne vaults over an enemy for the same distance of the dash, she also gains a 50% movement speed and a 40% tenacity bonus for 5 seconds upon landing (If Seyanne does not hit an enemy with insight ready then it will not consume her insight stacks) \nRunepowered+Insight; Seyanne stuns an enemy champion or neutral monster upon collision for 2 seconds as well as knocking them back, Seyanne also gains a shield for 1.95 seconds based on 60% of the damage dealt\nCost: + 2 insight CD: 20/18/15/12/8 Range: 380 (425 if chained)\n \n \nR; Growing prison: Seyanne channels for 3 seconds causing runes to form in the earth around her covering more ground for each second of the channel, all enemies on the rune field are rooted in place for the duration of the channel. When the channel is finished Seyannne blasts all locked enemy champions to the outer edges of the rune field. The rune field lasts for 4 seconds after the channel and boosts Seyannes Move speed by 40%, attack damage by 20% and armor by 30% while she is on it\nCost: all current insight CD: 90/70/60 Range: 400 (increases by 100 each second) \n \n \nQuote: “To make a crime out of learning should be a crime in itself” Seyanne\n\nAlly Tips: - Don’t be afraid to spam your q early to gain full insight stacks as soon as possible\n- Chaining e+q for extra damage output when chasing leaves you with no escape when things get hairy, you have many ways to give chase so plan it out.\n- When Building Seyanne it is important to picture her as a jack of all trades, get a good balance early on before pursuing full AD\nEnemy tips: - when Seyanne targets you with her w, she only needs to have sight of you to keep it going, so watch for wards and other enemies when trying to break it.\n- Seyanne can close gaps deceptively fast, however can be easily punished for overcommitting.\n- Don’t go toe to toe with Seyanne unless you have backup! When she chains her w with her q she can provide some frightening damage output","replies":[{"poster":"Alictron","date":"2014-11-28T06:21:55.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man \nSoz haven't got round to reviewing will do this weekend promise","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broccoliman321","date":"2014-11-25T12:00:42.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure on specifics but i was thinking how about a champion that is nidalee's brother, he uses a karambit knife and each of his abilities has a different bonus effect?\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WAOBX8BJyc\n\nthe knee slices could slow on first cast and immobilise them for a brief amount of time on the second?\n\nthe neck slice could cause a bleeding effect like darius bleed.
