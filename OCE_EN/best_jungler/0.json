However I feel Warwick has been defined as a champion by certain abilities and features and of which I feel it best to include the following in the rework, as they define Warwick for me:\r\n\r\n* The Blood Scent ability kept in some way\r\n* A suppression ultimate of any kind\r\n\r\nWith Everything and anything else changed, he would still essentially feel similar to the current Warwick. What I wouldn&#039;t mind seeing in a rework:\r\n\r\n* A skillshot\r\n* An ultimate that needs to be channeled\r\n* A stun ability (not ultimate) and a potentially unique, different (non suppression) ultimate\r\n\r\nAlthough Warwick has gotten me to Diamond (and still climbing!), I feel he is well due for an update, and can easily become a champion enjoyable to all, with not just freaks like me who love to play the most basic champion over and over again. :D\r\n\r\nAlso, check out my [**Warwick guide here**](http://www.lolking.net/guides/361994) if you&#039;re looking to gain some elo!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-30T11:35:12.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly i doubt Warwick will see much of a rework any time soon, for the single reason that he is required in his current iteration to keep mobility creep down with his ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"Best Jungler","date":"2015-09-30T13:46:40.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=OLcFRAw0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-09-30T11:35:12.341+0000)\n>\n> Honestly i doubt Warwick will see much of a rework any time soon, for the single reason that he is required in his current iteration to keep mobility creep down with his ultimate\n\nTo be perfectly honest with you, I have absolutely no idea what you are on about?\n\n > mobility creep down with his ultimate","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-02T16:13:56.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are too busy giving Riven more buffs pls wait next year","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-30T13:52:04.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Point and click spells keep the game from being simply based on how much mobility you have.
