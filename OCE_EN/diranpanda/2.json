After a brief moment I hear a noise and minimise and re maximise my League to see an error that says the following. \n\n&gt; **Unable to connect to the server. Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to your game.**\n\nThis is happening every single time I load into a game and I can&#039;t enter, the only way I&#039;ve been able to connect to my games is by connecting to my mobile phone hotspot. But as you can imagine this chews threw a lot of my data and I can&#039;t keep this up for extended periods of time. Since just yesterday I chewed threw half my data usage.\n\nHas anyone else had this issue and if so, **did you fix it? What did you do?** I would like to get this sorted so that I can continue playing. \n\nThanks.\n\nEDIT:**_ I tried Howling Abyss and Twisted Treeline and both of these maps work fine. It's only Summoner's Rift that's not working._**","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-25T07:52:52.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat definitely sounds odd, could you try [switching to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) for me.\n\nCould I also get you to [download WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/) and run a traceroute to the following IP's (Allow this to sit for 5-15 minutes)\n\n>103.240.227.5\n>103.240.227.25\n\nExport the results in a text file and attach them in an email to **oce-wrenchmen@googlegroups.com**, please also include a link to your thread in the email.","replies":[{"poster":"diranpanda","date":"2016-02-28T05:13:33.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This error has been concluded and I'm being faced with an entirely new issue, I posted it with more information within this same sub-forum","replies":[]}]}]}
