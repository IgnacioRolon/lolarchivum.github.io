Not straight away, but say in 5 weeks time of the feature being released. Make it so that it is a requirement for a person to Master a champion from each respecting role. So that when someone queues into a ranked game they can't use the excuse \" I don't play support \" or \" Mid only \". This would not only \r\n\r\n**1 - Limit the amount of people that join ranked with the sole purpose of just wanting a challenge, by doing this going the only lane that they want.\r\n2 - Bleed out the people that unfortunately do not / have not quite gotten the gist of what the games objectives are and what you have to do.\r\n3 - Breed people that wish to play ranked with a much higher understanding of the game and what each role has to offer within the League of Legends.**\r\n\r\nHaving said all of that, there will still be your common few that are going to say they will only do a specific role or feed trolls. But this is where if they want first pick enough, they can go in the chance for it by Mastering more champions. Starting from the top, the person with the most champions Mastered will be first pick. As ultimately their knowledge of the game would out-weight the people that say have 5-6 Mastered where as another person may have 12. \r\n\r\nAnyway that's my 5 cents on the subject, let me know in the comments any thoughts or any other ideas that people may have.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Ignore this if you wish, just selfish self promotion :P\r\nCheck out my YouTube channel and my first video xD\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wToNC1At5_8\r\n*League of Legends - League of Lee Sin***","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-03-24T19:49:50.520+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who ever is first pick is random.\nBut even still, as much as I do agree with some points, but I don't agree with who ever mastered X champs is higher.\n1, you get points by playing the champs.

Since you then refer to Mid I can only assume you meant *Positions* (being Top, Mid, ADC, Support, Jungle). Other than there being no real way for Riot to implement such an idea without enforcing the META (which is a community creation by the way) it seems you're under the impression that experience is directly proportional to skill. I know it's already been mentioned but just because someone has played more doesn't mean they will be more skilled, that's why you can find people in bronze V with 2000+ ranked games played.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not fully against some more strict requirements in order to play ranked but what you're suggesting has some big flaws.","replies":[{"poster":"diranpanda","date":"2015-03-27T10:43:22.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree with you that it does have flaws, I just believe that something needs to be implemented for loss prevention. I don't think that if someone leaves the game they should be completely banned cause obviously some people disconnect. However I do believe if someone disconnects the ammount of IP loss should be lowered if not taken away completely.\n\nOn other news, maybe no so much lane mastery, since what you said is true, people did indeed create the meta. But maybe if there was a mastery system that made it so you had to master 5 champions. Instead of just 1 of each role. It would again give a basic understanding of the game. Maybe not, but I feel that Riot could take advantage of this implementation to the game.","replies":[]}]}]}
