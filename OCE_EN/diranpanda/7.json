On most of the time.","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey all, I'm looking for a ranked duo partner to get into Gold with. I'm currently at Silver 5, but over the past week I've been Silver 4 and 3 multiple times. I can play all roles, but I usually try and get into Mid or Top roles. Jungle is my weakest role but not because of ganks, just because I don't keep track of timers and things like that usually. I usually do quite well, you can look me up on lolking and see my ratios are quite good, there are a few games that were bad, but only because it gets to the point where I'm just trying champs I don't usually play as an attempt to get LP.\r\n\r\nAnyway if it seems like you'll be interested, add me.\r\nIGN: diranpanda\r\n(no capitals)","replies":[{"poster":"BurstFire301","date":"2015-03-25T03:28:30.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me in game- i play about 6-10 games per day- ive played about 3.5k ranked games over the past year and i can teach u stuff :) It will be way easier to climb if i have a duo partner- better yet atm im silver 3 as well- so elo will b similar. I play at high gold/low plat level (got g2 last year playing mid) Ive started maining adc (reason for drop in elo) and started winning- looking for someone in silver who play every day at least 4 or 5 games so we can get good together. :) msg if interested","replies":[]}]}
