Look below as to why.\n- First of all they rain from the sky similar to how hail does in real life.\n- The hail is big enough to form a shadow on the ground for a brief moment before hitting the ground. Each hail smashes into the ground within quick succession of each other. In other words, a champion with plenty of mobility would easily counter this.\n- I see how you see the similarities of gangplanks ultimate and Kahn's Q however it doesn't do anywhere near as much damage, it's easily dodgable and it's got a much small crash zone.\nOther then that, I don't want to change the fundamental aspects of Kahn, he is a Storm Warrior, which I already have some sort of idea as to what I'll do with his lore. I like him being a Fighter Tank, so changing him to a mid mage isn't what I want. I think if anything, I might make him a Mage/Tank which is more appropriate considering he using magic.\n\n>2nd of all, kahn's W is more or less a replica of galio ult. i know it is differen't and i know this champion is inspired of galio. but this can be a repetitive spell and one champion will get neglected. your q is already an aoe. and if you have noticed a very rare few champions have more than one aoe ability in their default Q/W/E abilities.

It's again not like Galio's ultimate, reason below.\n- You can escape it by mobility.\n- You're not forced to attack Kahn.\n- It doesn't last anywhere near as long.\n- It can be interrupted by team mates.\n- It's a cone, not an AoE\nSorry if it's not explained clearly above.\n\n> since you already have a passive on w you can change e entirely by making it a skillshot. since Riot Games wants to implement more skillshot related champions. it will become a good hit.\n\nIt is a single target skill shot, changed the information to make it more clear.\n\n>  since this champion is water based make it a medium range skill shot that shoots a small tidal wave that knocks enemy champions to the side (Like Dravens E Which Might Cause Change) that scales ap. and if it kills a minion you gain attack speed for a small amount of time (Opening A Window Of Your Active W And Can Make The Champion More Skill Based) you can work out the scalings cause im too lazy :3c / 4th of all,\n\nAgain, not a water based champion, maybe you want to create you're own champion concept? I mean you've changed practically everything in his kit. What you have described is a more overpowered version of Draven's E to which is a carry, Kahn is not.\n\n> the amazing ultimate, lets make it a water based tide that circles Kahn slowing Kahn's movement speed by 30% that Makes enemies that are caught in the Tide they are slowed and take damage, and if enemies are on the inside of the circle near Kahn they take no affects and do reduced damage to Kahn by 35%. when the ability wears off or Kahn dies the tidal wave will do a final gush knocking enemies airborn and will deal 200+60% Ability Power. \n\n\"the amazing ultimate\" that you completely changed. Also why would a mid mage have damage reduction. Considering Alistar's ultimate reduces damage taken by 50% this for a mid mage with high damage is way too strong.\n\n> Now Kahns Passive will need to be reworked. making him more of a glass cannon mage since his ult now gives him a damage reduction. so how about Kahn's Ability Damage Is Increased by 0.3 for ever 20 missing health. this will encourage players to build rod of ages, rylais, haunting guise and maybe a defensive item. and with kahns ultimate if people are going to be focusing going into the centre and focusing him he could use his q and stand in it as a measure of counter play. his ultimate is a good way to disengage. \n\nThis passive is very very similar to Olaf's passive, which gives him bonus AD. \n\nI appreciate your attempt at constructive criticism, I'm not sure what I did to you to receive such an insulting review. You changed basically everything in kit and even the role, said I had abilities similar to other champions then when you did change them, you made them a duplicate of another champions abilities, some even stronger then others.\n\nSure I understand I need to make changes to the champion concept as it is quite new, but completely changing everything about my champion is another thing. I'm not sure if this was about what I said on your post about your Death Blossum Riven post, I was just being honest, I didn't change a single thing. I just wanted more information and more information about what else you had in mind.","replies":[{"poster":"CJ Entus The Shy","date":"2016-03-01T01:40:47.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"O.o i didn't mean for that to be an insult. i had no idea you would take that negatively. i guess it turned from me trying to help out and to fix around with it to making a whole new champion. i didn't mean for that to sound bad and i don't mind your feedback on death blossom riven. i know death blossom riven will never be made. i am sorry for sounding bad and making you read cancer","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CJ Entus The Shy","date":"2016-02-29T04:59:21.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it. it makes teamfighting more all in. he should be used as a disengage, or an engager. the burst needs to be reduced since he is a tank, so ap scaling should be weaker to reduce the armor spike. but it's a good idea cause league needs a viable ap tank right now. thats not malphite the broken %%%got. check out my Death Blossom Riven. i want Feedback on it","replies":[{"poster":"diranpanda","date":"2016-02-29T07:26:40.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I need to change him a little bit, I've just been really busy with Uni. The reason he has reasonable damage on his abilities is because when I was comparing him to a champion I was partially inspired by {{champion:3}} he had high AP ratio's on his abilities.

The one ability that I need to scale down is probably his E + R. \n\nAs far as kit wise, do you think it's okay? \n\nHe is a Fighter/Tank which is more like what Darius is, he has the option of going tanky or as a bruiser.
