(Normals)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For a while now I&#039;ve only been playing Ranked and been using the new champion select, so far I&#039;ve really enjoyed it and it&#039;s removed a large portion of the toxicity going into a game. No longer are 3 people fighting over who goes Mid or Top, or someone said it first so they get it first. I&#039;m not entirely sure if anyone else has been enjoying the new champ select as much as me but I think it&#039;s become really good.\r\n**\r\nHowever** - _Why have we not recieved the new champ select in normals?_\r\n\r\nI understand Blind pick and why it was created, but why not just make it the same game wide. If that&#039;s not an option then why not just input the Primary/Secondary Role part into blind pick? So that people get the roles they want without crying and abuse and toxicity. Surely a multi-million dollar company would notice these things? And if Riot is planning to release it to the normal games as well, then why wouldn&#039;t you mention it. \r\n\r\nI understand new people may not understand it, but slowly you&#039;re making it so horribly painful for new players and even players who&#039;ve made other accounts to play with friends so unwelcoming, there is no motivation to do so.\r\n\r\nI would enjoy hearing from others what your opinion is about the new champ select as well, so leave comment down below.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-02-25T23:54:19.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a chance that we will be getting this in norms, as stated [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html)","replies":[{"poster":"diranpanda","date":"2016-02-26T03:31:11.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Princess Yaia,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lEb2A24I,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-25T23:54:19.781+0000)\n>\n> There is a chance that we will be getting this in norms, as stated [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html)\n\nThanks, question answered.","replies":[]}]}]}
