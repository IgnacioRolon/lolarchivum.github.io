I don't see why its so hard to just give them high base damage and shit scaling.

Also Poppy is a big offender, I don't know what you're talking about, she actually has an aggressive kit and base damages, but you've obviously never seen triforce titanic deadmans poppy, because she will murder an out of position squishy whilst also being tanky.\n\n At least Ap malphite and Ap/ad sion are squishy when they go full damage. SInce with ap malphite or ap sion, the playstyle is vastly different from the other forms ( with sion, tank focusing on being up the front of the fight, full ad acting a bit more like an assassin, and ap acting like a mage) in terms of playstyle and positioning and even skill order, that the itemisation cannot be halfway. When you play ap sion or lethality sion, you don't take a half measure, since otherwise you don't have a role and kit to offer your team. Half ap sion is neither tanky nor offers the ranged poke of e spam. Half lethality sion isn't an engage, but also doesn't have the cheese oneshot. Half ap malphite can't 1shot like ap malphite, but his cooldowns aren't short enough for off tank, and isn't tanky enough for frontline and make use of w and sunfire.\n\nAp sion is squishy and has alot more weaknesses than most other mages trying to achieve the same thing. Ad sion is generally less reliable than tank and tank bruiser variants of sion, and has a much higher risk of falling behind, since alot of ad sion's gameplay involves cheesing and surprising, but doesn't have the same level of utility, target access and catchup mechanics of an assassin.\n\nAlso tanks need their base damages to deal with bruisers. Whilst bruisers do counter tanks, it shouldn't be an autolose lane, and since bruisers have alot of hp and some resistances, tanks need scaling base damages to be able to fight in close range. The counterpoint for this is shield and utility supports and cc. Trying to engage upon and kill an adc when they have their support, or another tank or bruiser or mage with cc with them should generally end badly for a tank on equal standing. But with exceptions of tank killers like vayne, an adc shouldn't be 1v1ing a tank.\n\nAlso I don't get alot of the league community, adcs aren't supposed to win fights in close range. Yes adcs are tank shredders, but the adc vs tank matchup should depend on frontline and positioning. This isn't a melee bashing fest. If you wanted that play Olaf or Warwick. The Tank tries to get melee, the adc tries to kite. The tank should win if he can keep you in sunfire range.\n\nAdcs are the kings of teamfights, they're the most important members to keep alive, but with the exception of shield supports, they should also be the worst class in 1v1s. The idea of building full damage without someone to defend you is untenable, in a moba a dps needs a tank or party. \n\nYou're a glass cannon, you blast through shields from a distance, but if a shield smahes into a glass cannon, the glass should break. I always felt that sometimes adcs should have an item that increases movespeed away from foes when auto attacking to make kiting defensively a little stronger though. Since adcs tend to get run down alot without chance to kite if their support isn't doing a good job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T05:18:52.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tanks cant farm early, low tier skill level (lcs and under) cant play well early. somewhere between s02 and s03 ppl started thinking the game didnt start till lvl 4 like it was a no rush treaty on.","replies":[]}]}
