And for the surrenders outside of 20 mins make the proper majority rule so 3/5 that&#039;s still more then half the team its unfair that people have to keep playing when 1 or 2 people don&#039;t want to end  especially in normal games","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-16T03:13:06.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you think a game is unwinnable or not worth the effort doesn't mean the rest of your team does. I agree that when people are purposely prolonging a game it can be frustrating, but maybe it's the last game they can play that day and they want to get the most out of it?\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to deny a surrender vote that aren't in any way related to trolling or trying to piss of your teammates that do want to surrender, just as those that try to surrender as often as possible can be annoying but can have a valid reason for doing so.\n\nIf they're obviously trolling then report them, but if they just want to have fun and play their game then they have a right to that choice same as you do. If the vote was 3/5 it'd be way to easy for trolls to lose people games, whereas there isn't really any harm in having to play for another few minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"ranga In Õrbit","date":"2017-11-16T09:19:35.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because you think a game is unwinnable or not worth the effort doesn't mean the rest of your team does.\" No. what im saying is if 4/5 people want to surrender we should not get stuck in the game just because one guy wants to keep playing 4/5 not 3/5 4 players out of the 5 in the team want to end","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-16T09:25:07.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Games at 15 minutes can turn around very quickly, which is why it has to be a 5/5 vote. If in five minutes the games is still completely unwinnable then so be it, but that 5 minutes can make a huge difference, *especially* in ranked when it is more than just a single game on the line.\n\nThe 15 minutes surrender was introduced to help alleviate some of the pain of complete total stomps, it wasn't designed to let people run from games early because they aren't immediately going their way.\n\nIt's an argument that has both sides. There are people who think that the 3/5 15min vote should be enough, but on the other extreme there are people who think surrenders should be removed as an option entirely, and of course every opinion in between. You literally cannot please everyone here. There will always be a significant chunk of people who think it's too harsh or not harsh enough. \n\nThis is the best middle ground we are going to get that satisfies the most people. It'd be nice to everything the way *we* want it, but you have to be realistic here.","replies":[{"poster":"ranga In Õrbit","date":"2017-11-16T15:11:06.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant argue with that","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-15T13:53:48.950+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it that difficult for you to wait 5 minutes for the 4/1 vote?","replies":[{"poster":"ranga In Õrbit","date":"2017-11-16T00:14:10.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what you just said proves my point, you're one of those trolls that keep players in games because you \"want to still play\"","replies":[{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-16T01:48:38.173+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see how playing late game champs automatically equals to trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"ranga In Õrbit","date":"2017-11-16T09:18:19.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"has nothing to do with that","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
