Can you tell me please?\n\nI am curious, if you know you had a bad game being 0-5, then why don't you surrender? You may think of having chance to come back or win, but have you tried to come back?\n\nSome players think they can come back when they are 0-5, then they went 0-10 after they \"tried\", and still not going to surrender as I think they should have already known that the game is gone, and they should also know that sometimes the enemies are just much better than us.\n\nI think people should play this game with some brains or knowledge on the game.\n\nIf you look at my recent games, I played a Nautilus support on April 17. The Leesin and Jax, if you had the access and time to watch the replay, made so many blunders. Below are some examples:\n\nAt 14:30, leesin (full hp with ult) and jax (half hp without ult) dive the tower trying to kill Renekton (1/3 hp with ult) then got double killed by Renek. Then our first tower gone.\n\nAt 17:40, jax got solo killed by Renekton (half hp with Teleport ready) while we were doing infernal drake (still have 5000+HP). Leesin missed the smite when drake had 500 HP and then got killed by caitlyn. I have been pinging signals of falling back during the entire fight, but leesin did not listen to me at all.\n\nThen I just pointed out that this fight was a mistake. Leesin came to insult and blame me for not tanking for him. Come on, the drake had 5000 HP and we were 3 vs 4 at that time (Leblanc in bad state with half hp and no ult left). And it was him that missed the smite. Why did he blame me???\n\nAt the very last of the game, we won a fight 3 vs 5. But leesin stood in the base watching all.\n\nThose mistakes made by Leesin and Jax, as I think, are intentional. I pointed out, trying to tell them those mistakes. They did not listen but came to blame me instead. How absurd is this???\n\nLessin's name: abcdefghijklmnop\n\nJax's name: Oliver Cat","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-04-15T02:52:37.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Suffer pretty much","replies":[{"poster":"MadManPotato","date":"2019-04-15T02:57:43.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe in that people should be responsible for theie behaviours in both games and life.
