The most recent one where I was told to \"go die in a hole\" and I'm a \"f#%@*^! scrub ass c#^&\". Submitted a ticket with a screen shot and all. You think anything happened? Nope, same guys is still playing today without a chat restriction or anything. I very much doubt Riot does anything and the only action taken is when it's processed through the automated system.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-05-31T01:10:59.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it occurred during the game or in pre/post game chat, you can report players in the end game screen under \"hate speech\" as well as provide a note in the box provided stating which part of the chat it was (pre/post game chats are manually reviewed so punishment can take a lil longer than the in-game automatic detection). \n\nIf it occurred out of game, [please send in a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot detailing exactly what happened, and any evidence you may have.\n\nPlease keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week).
