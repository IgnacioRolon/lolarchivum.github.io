Seems most people that have no games have a higher success rate in ranked in my experience. The people with 100 normal games and that are unranked always stomp the games, maybe its a secret hidden buff to accounts with no games, but I&#039;m pretty certain that you are only allowed one account, if so that mean majority of the community are cheaters. Should we all join the band wagon?\r\nCan anyone elaborate?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-10-15T03:57:40.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure most people have more than one account.. anyone who is even half decent in raked usually has another smurf account I have found...The only problem is .. you have to play like a ton more games just to get back to level 30 and then you have to buy runes and more champions .. and it really isn't as fun as you would think.","replies":[]}]}
