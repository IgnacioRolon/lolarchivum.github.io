Seems most people that have no games have a higher success rate in ranked in my experience. The people with 100 normal games and that are unranked always stomp the games, maybe its a secret hidden buff to accounts with no games, but I&#039;m pretty certain that you are only allowed one account, if so that mean majority of the community are cheaters. Should we all join the band wagon?\r\nCan anyone elaborate?","replies":[]}
