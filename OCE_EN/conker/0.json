As I was playing my placement matches I won 2 and I was feeling good about ranked. Then I lost and lost and lost and went 2-8 in my placements. The three games after I have also lost. Why does every match feel like everyone on my team is terrible? We all get stomped in our respective roles and all the games are very heavily favored to the enemy team. It doesn&#039;t seem like something that should be happening, but is nonetheless. It is rather frustrating because as soon as i go back to normal queue I seem to do fine, the teams are well balanced and the games aren&#039;t as one sided. Has anyone else had this happen?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-25T10:49:07.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season, I got into Plat. Once I hit Plat, I think my record was like 3-27. Couldn't buy a win. At one point I think me and my duo partner had an 0-17 record. We lost so much my Duo friend actually stopped playing for the rest of the season.\n\nThese kinds of things happen. Just have to play through them and hope you don't ruin your MMR in the mean time.\nI know for me, the fact that my record was like 0-10 or so got to me and once we got a little behind I thought \"oh great, another loss\" and probably played worse because of it.\n\nWhat helped was, taking a break for 10 mins after the game and actually breaking down what happened. What happened in lane, should I have played more aggressive, why did we lose this fight, why didnt we get drag here etc etc.\nSometimes the simple answer is: \"the enemy was better\" and you move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-25T21:28:59.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The enemy was better\"\n\nThat's the hardest thing to say.","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2016-03-26T00:49:49.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously. Sometimes I know a game will swing towards one result because the enemy are simply better than us. We haven't even got a bad score or have fed, but the enemy are just outplaying us individually, and moving as a team.
