It just doesn't update until you post something (as opposed to constantly checking and updating everyone's levels). Your boards level has updated now, so you should be able to post on Team Recruitment :3\n\nIf for some reason it still doesn't let you post, try logging out of the website and back in.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"TheWarLegend","date":"2016-02-06T04:23:30.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that response, very informational and helpful.
