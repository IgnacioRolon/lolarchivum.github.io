In general, these two punishments are enough warning for you to take a step back and evaluate your behaviour. \n\nEven if your teammates are feeding/ being even more toxic towards you, what matters here are YOUR actions (you can report teammates after game for toxicity (btw, not warding and generally being bad are not reportable) and they will get punished according to their actions). During testing times, you have to step and be the bigger person, mute your teammates and continue to play to the best of your ability. Any other actions would simply be contributing to the toxic environment, and ruining the game experience for the other players. \n\nIf you get permabanned, Riot will not refund any of the money spent on your account, as technically you don't even own the account.

Their stance on toxicity has been in the spotlight for years, so much so that still believing it is accepted behaviour within this community is sorely mistaken.
