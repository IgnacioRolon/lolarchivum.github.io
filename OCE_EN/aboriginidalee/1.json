Try the steps in it and let us know if it works. If not we can see if there is anything else we can figure out.","replies":[{"poster":"Aboriginidalee","date":"2016-02-08T06:28:53.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello K.A!\n\nThanks for your response. I have had some progress although it turns out to be a different issue to what I originally thought.\n\nI tried everything in that link to no avail, however I decided to try a different internet provider. I currently use a Vodaphone dongle (surprise! Vodaphone works rather well in my area and I am unable to get a permanent internet connection, hence why I am with Vodaphone).\n\nNow LoL works fine on this connection however the store wasn't working, and I also noticed the \"versus\" box in the bottom right of the client was blank.\n\nI decided to connect using my mobile as a hotspot (Telstra), and voila! shop and the versus window work!\n\nNow my question is: Why, if my Vodaphone connection runs LoL fine in game, am I not able to access the client store, however changing to my Telstra phone as the internet source works?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-08T06:30:21.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds to me like it's possibly a DNS related issue.\n\nCould you try [switching to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) and reporting back.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
