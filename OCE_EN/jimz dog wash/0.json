Long story short he keeps being toxic to everyone, gets in my head making me angry and not wanting to try anymore. Just a really bad game of League of Legends where you don&#039;t even understand why you still play the game. \nThan you remember the other players that were nice and calm, and you think why can&#039;t everyone be like that. \nDecide to add the guy in the friend list to see if we could get somewhere, thinking that there would have been a minimum of maturity; I was wrong. He instantly paste something he wrote I&#039;d guess [[SCREEN SHOT][REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]] wishing death to my family cancer to my parents (which one of them does have, 3rd stage, but we are very positive :thumbup: ); the usual stuff, you know it better than me.\n\nThe thing that hurts me most are not his words but the influence that people like him have on themselves and others, in game and outside the game.\n\nThis are the people that want to create problems to others cause of their own failure and low self confidence.\n\n&quot;Some people just want to watch the world burn&quot; cit.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think??\n\nThanks for the attention","replies":[{"poster":"Devoida Talent","date":"2019-01-23T18:11:05.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"jimz, the best thing the developers ever added were the mute options, unfortunate that they are so regularly needed, this community is incredibly toxic! if someone is being toxic negative or just looking to blame someone, don't feel bad for hitting those mutes and continue doing your best and help your team, something I have learned from this game is when someone is doing badly and they are getting tilted and shot at by other team members is to simply state \"continue what you are saying and I will report your behaviour\" usually they will begin taunting you, however if you're like me you will have already muted them and the focus is no longer on the person having a bad game (we've all had those) and they continue typing away to no one, makes me laugh sometimes! they just want someone to target. being support main I've had my share of people having a bad game (me included) saying \"great shot\" \"bad luck\" \"don't worry it's just a game\" can have a turn around for them, if not then gg next game and forget. a truer statement for this game \"Don't feed the trolls\" was never written.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-23T22:58:20.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"1) do you know what a mute button is?\n2) Why do you care what people say, like, Words do nothing (as the saying goes, sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me)\n3) Toxic players aren't going away, you don't like it, don't play online games it doesn't matter what you play\n4) get over it\n5) best of luck to your family","replies":[]}]}
