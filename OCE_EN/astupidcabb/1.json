I feel like since Elise is already a really hard and weak champion that nerfing Morrelo made her even weaker because it takes a while for her to reach her spike, even if she gets fed the nerf to Morrelo makes a difference. She has to get up in their face as spider form to deal damage but her attack range is so tiny and she&#039;s so squishy she&#039;ll die instantly to someone like Sejuani who got ridiculous damage buffs. \r\n\r\nAlso for Rakan, while nerf his damage speed and armor? He&#039;s already squishy enough and his R, Q combo was iconic. He can still do it but his character model looks super messed up and sloppy. \r\n\r\nThese two are my mains\r\n\r\nThanks Rito      {{champion:497}}     {{champion:60}}","replies":[]}
