Level 3 he flashed on me and insta killed me so I bought double cloth armor and 4 pots, I teleported to tower and walked up to the lane because he was freezing and he still managed to kill me after I q and e pooled with phase rush, he managed to still catch me after I flashed ontop of that then he  stunned and ate me then I died. He had swiftness boots and dorans shield. I walk back and he still has those two items and I call my graves with challenging smite and a caulfields hammer. He 100 to 0s me and then manages to tank both my empowered q and fully charged e while my graves was whaling on him. He then turned with his e activated and killed graves with his shield. Swiftness Boots and a DORANS SHIELD ? How do I counterplay when I had a seekers armguard and double cloth armor ?","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-11-04T22:09:11.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As early game Vlad, you should be sitting under your tower farming until you have 1800 gold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2019-11-04T02:05:57.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tahm's early/base damage is more Magic damage, it isnt the autos.
