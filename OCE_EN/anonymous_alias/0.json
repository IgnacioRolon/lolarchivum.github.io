Those kinds of people basically have no interest in \"special\" skins on the account, so even if we don't consider the fact that it's a serious breach of the rules (and, technically, illegal), there's no value on things like Hextech exclusive skins most of the time, so no real point (or worth, for that matter) selling when you could just use it yourself.\n\nEDIT: That's not even considering that the account would likely get hit with a ban for being sold/traded in the first place, either.\n\nI think it goes without saying that I certainly don't condone selling/trading accounts, I have a pretty strong opinion on that, and I just have to agree that there's no worth in a rank or \"item\" that you've not earned yourself through legitimate means.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-07-13T11:10:22.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=O6gHpQR5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-07-09T04:23:03.117+0000)\n>\n> whilst that is technically true, people DO end up trading accounts on dodgy websites alot.\n> \n> For arguments sake, the estimation would probably be around $15 for a lvl30 OCE account with only the soulstealer vayne skin and half the champion roster.
