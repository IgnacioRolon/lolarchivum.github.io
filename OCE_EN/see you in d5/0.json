I wasn&#039;t raised or even born in the suburbs, I may be white but I was raised in the hood, the woman who raised me was black. I picked up hella mannerisms from her. Everyone I was with growing up had no beef with me saying the &#039;N-word&#039; because we learned that I was from the hood, my skin may not be black but I was still from the hood. So why was I chat restricted for saying a word I have said since I was about six. I cam on League and talk to my team when I call them a %%%%%, they get hella pissed. These kids are white, why are they insulted? If I was like Iggy Azealea and some  trash from Australia acting like I was from the hood then I can get it, but I was raised in the streets. I was raised in East Oakland, how can you even punish me for that? Don&#039;t trip. It&#039;s not like I&#039;m some redneck from Alabama saying it.﻿\n\nYou cannot punish me for being me, riot, your system is garbage. the only black people on this server are aboriginals, and the term %%%%% doesn&#039;t effect them. I offended some white kid, who was mad i beat him so I got chat restricted. That makes no sense.","replies":[{"poster":"M0XIE","date":"2016-01-01T16:52:11.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While that might be the norm where you were raised the \"n-word\" has a negative connotation around the world. When a persons logs into the game they don't immediately know where or how you were raised. You are completely unknown to them. Dropping the n-bomb when a majority of people take offense to it will likely get you in trouble.\n\nTo put it another way, most outlets have power to them. People having grown up around these types of outlets know that while they could probably stick their finger in it, they shouldn't However, X was raised in an area with a bunch of abandoned houses and it was completely normal for X to stick his/her finger in the outlet without being zapped. X moves away from \"the hood\" and sticks his/her finger in the outlet, gets zapped and then gets mad at the people that live there because that outlet has power.","replies":[{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T18:07:22.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not enough bananas in the world.\n\nhttp://i.snag.gy/kdu77.jpg","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"drag66n","date":"2016-01-01T03:39:36.319+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sad days when theres such things as censored words\nsad days when one of those words is hitler\nsad days when thats my father","replies":[]},{"poster":"M0XIE","date":"2016-01-01T19:10:13.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That comic works for both sides of the argument.
