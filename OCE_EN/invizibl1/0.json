I was able to open four (in quick succession) and obtain their respective loot. \n\nHowever, the client was taking a while to open the last chest, so I decided to click elsewhere (the store) in an attempt to refresh it; only to return to the loot page and discover that I had no fifth loot item and both chest and key had been used. \n\nHas anyone else had this problem?\n\nTLDR: Purchased a 5 Hextech Chest Bundle for 975rp, successfully opened four Chests but lost the fifth.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-03-06T07:18:57.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIf you're still having trouble with your hextech loot you're going to have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Player Support, we here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific inquiries.","replies":[{"poster":"invizibl1","date":"2017-03-06T10:54:06.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright will do, thank you very much","replies":[]}]}]}
