As soon as you start tilting, give up ranked for a couple of hours and play normals, if you tilt, you play worse and therefore have a worse chance of winning.\n\nI also had a look at your op.gg: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=VanHelsing\n\nThe number one thing I think you can improve straight off the bat is the ability to cs. Check that checklist I have linked, you need to practice in custom games to get good cs. In one of your ranked games, after 30 minutes you have 140 cs, you want to aim for 80 cs per 10 minutes, if you were following that general number your cs should be around 240 cs. Thats a large gold difference. If you can farm well in bronze, you can carry without making flashy plays.\n\nHave a good night.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-06-15T22:58:41.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Prioritising gold over all else is the way to climb bronze/silver and to some extent gold.\n\nThis includes playing from behind and taking priority objectives. I played a S5 game the other night. Warwick top into GP. Suffice to say the GP got absolutely out of control but he didn't know how to push his lead for his team. So in the end I outfarmed everyone else in the game and they couldn't kill me.\n\nGold = Freelo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-15T09:37:51.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can try and help.\nLet me see what I can find, you might also wanna try looking through these.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XPrqvD8Lfo&list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n\nThey are bronze summoners like yourself, you could very well be doing some of there mistakes.\n\n------- \nChecking you match history.\n\nYou play alot of ADC -Markmsan- and top. ADC is my worst role, but top is one of my best ones.\nYour normal builds actually aint that bad. from a first look anyway.\n\nBut from the looks of you CSing however.\nYou should aim for 80 CS per 10 mins.\nI can see plenty of games where you are not meeting this requirement.\n\nAlso, are you getting objectives? Dragons, towers etc.\nYou need to buy a pink and place it somewhere, anywhere. And maybe upgrade your sweeper by lvl 11-12.\n\nI'm just vaguely going through it all. Maybe try and watch some of those vids, and see what you are doing wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JamieRambo","date":"2016-06-15T07:43:00.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 5","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-15T09:12:24.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze 3 and got to silver 5 in a week. There are many aspects to the game and one of the most important one is knowing the enemy's summoner time. This applies to me alot because I play jungle in ranked and once I burn a flash or so from the enemy laner, I camp that lane and make sure I abuse the fact that they do not have summoner spells for the time being. Warding, warding can save your life or even your team mates life, make sure to ward at spots where the enemy jungler usually goes. Last but not least. objectives, objectives in bronze,silver and sometimes even gold are not properly prioritized, most bronze and silver goes for kills instead of better objectives like towers or baron. Now that there is more than one dragon, sometimes instead of going for a dragon like \"Earth\" dragon or \"Cloud\" dragon you can go for towers instead but if say \"Ocean\" dragon is the one available then you go for that instead of towers since it is more beneficial. There are many more aspects and I recommend you go watch videos on how to climb elo or maybe search up a player who is really good at a specific role or a specific champion. Have a good night/day :).
