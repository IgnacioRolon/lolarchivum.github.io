Simple. Even if you are the mid laner build at least 1 tank items. If you are the engage, thats a no brainer tbh. Don&#039;t be that 1 guy who is 4/12 who can 1 shot the adc but don&#039;t like long enough to. You&#039;re damage is more the longer you survive. Just look at the tank meta. trust me. Selling a 1 of the 6 yoummus you have for deadmans if they have AD, Spirit Visage if they have AP And Omen if they have crit. Don&#039;t be suborn. This is a way to start improving game. Also don&#039;t asume just because you are fed 10/2 in the early game and you are the main engage means you can go full AD. You&#039;re team will start hating you for that and you WILL loose the game. Don&#039;t bother flamming that 1/900 Support, waste of time. tell him what to do that is gonna be helpful to win the game. And don&#039;t be afraid to be the shot caller. If you know what you&#039;re doing and you are right, there is no reason for them not to listen but in true bronze fashion they won&#039;t so don&#039;t start flamming them. just tell them why and it should be fine, cause like you, they want to win the game and get out of bronze 5 into bronze 4. Dont be that stingy bitch who thinks he is the best and does what he wants than dies and blames team for no follow up. And for that 1/900 Fiddle support, ffs don&#039;t go full AP what are you stupid? Go at least 2 tank items including a zonyas as you are probs the main engage.  ( I&#039;m gold 3 ) Want more just say, Hate it well tuff luck nerd CY@","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-01T14:30:22.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a Gold 4 friend, and I have discussed this with him (he hasn't dropped a division since bronze so he knows how to climb. The only difference between me and him? Skill? Nope. Game knowledge? Nope. Decision making? Nope.\n\nThe reason he is Gold and I am bronze, (besides me not playing ranked ever), is that he knows how to carry when hes fed and he knows how to get carried. \n\nI could do everything right in a game and it could be \"the team's fault\", but he knows that as long as you queue 3 man or higher and have good communication, your chances of winning go up. I am perfectly capable of doing dank plays, but that's the thing.\n\nThe reason you see bronze players trying to be all flash and then completely fail, like if a Gragas flash ult Es and then dies or something, is because he watches that somewhere when a challenger Gragas is fed. Lets analyze the differences.\n\nIn challenger Gragas's team is much more likely to follow up, land CC and dodge enemy CC/stop disengage. In challenger the enemy is more likely to get on you quick, but at the same time you can dive their backline since yours is protected. In challenger Gragas is a lot more fed and can tank a lot more damage before he dies.\n\nSo basically, mechanical skill and game knowledge don't mean rank. Challenger's only look so damn amazing because they invent knew combos and interactions. These things are basic, even bronzes can do them. Eventually you see these plays become meta and they will look to use it whenever possible.\n\nI mean I have won many games when the enemy team and our team has 3 or more platinum players. They aren't much better than me in decision making and mechanics and game knowledge, what they are better at is working as a team, knowing what their team can do, knowing how to utilize other member's strength.\n\nIn bronze people just think of their and the enemies champions, and see their team as their team. They see every ADC the same, and don't think about these things.\n\nSo you are right, the hard part about getting out of bronze isn't getting better, it is actually climbing out. My friend was bronze and low bronze for two seasons, and he hasn't gotten any better and still gets outclassed by me in many cases, but that doesn't mean I'm worthy of Gold rank.\n\nIt's about every individual game, and bronzes need to stop trying to do stupid and crazy shit. Save that for higher ranks.\n\nThe first step to getting out of bronze is admitting that you are bad, and learning to criticize yourself. One of my friends (and many many random players I see), are too thick skulled to take advice. Whenever I tell them how to do something better or that they are doing something wrong, they label me a flamer and say \"I'm new to this champion\" or \"I don't play ADC stfu\" and it's like YES THAT'S WHY I AM EXPLAINING HOW TO DO IT.\n\nIn short, if you are better than bronze and know how to carry/get carried with simple plays then you will be on your way. I'll have to start playing ranked again since I don't think I have played ranked in around 300 normal wins (480 games) because I wasn't good enough back then.\n\nBut yeah I totally agree, don't be stubborn to building tank. Speaking of Gragas I had one that refused to go Tank just because he won top lane with first two items as AP. If he went tank it would have been an easy game as I was 18-2 Cass mid at the time, but he just kept building AP and missing ults. (He was plat though).\n\nI'm going to end my comment here, dear future silvers, just play simple champions or tanks and focus on outplays and mechanical skill down the road in higher ranks.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-08-01T23:05:36.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offence but i how you try to flatter yourself by saying \"The only difference between me and him? Skill? Nope. Game knowledge? Nope. Decision making? Nope.\" But then again who aim i to judge, every bronze player thinks they deserve higher anyways. And about Dynamic queue...sure it's an easy way to get to higher elo but not everyone will respect you and those from that Elo might not even treat you like one of them. and i highly doubt even when duoing with your friend that you would be facing Plat players. The gap between gold 4 and plat 5 is a big diff, even as a gold 3 player the best i meet it plat 4 and not very often even.  And i know this is mean but, if you think you have characteristics of a gold player you wouldn't be in bronze, even when 1 of em is missing...I made a second account because i wanted to and i don't see myself playing against bronze in norms...mostly silvers and low gold, and i hardly loose my lane, so yes it mechanical skill and game knowledge does mean your rank. Again, flattering how you think you are equal to gold and plat players, really it is.  And this is bronze, your first priority is to get out, seeing as how stubborn bronze players are team comp won't matter as much as trying not to trigger them by saying to pick something they don't know how to play. Rather pick any champ they are comfortable with and just build items needed for that game. And no, the hardest part of bronze is not climbing, it's getting good. You can't climb if you aren't good, you just simply won't be allowed, How can you fight when you have no skill? you can't just fluke it, one way or another you will fall back down and if you don't know the right skills it takes to get back up you're gone. And from the descriptions hear , i can tell you don't advice people properly. Tell them firm and get to the point, don't elaborate or call them anything. If support fiddle has no zonyas and it's 40 min tell him nicely and explain briefly ( Eg. Fiddle go zonyas you are our engage  ) If they don't listen just ignore it, you can't do anything lol, the best you can do is focus on improving yourself, sure they might be bad but it's not like you are stuck with them for the rest of the season. In bronze it's simple, play champions that they hate because they don't know how to counter pick, don't be afraid to pick off meta champs, they are bronze warding is already a problem for them. Sorry if this reply sounds really aggressive i'm kinda trying to be less toxic :P but be passive aggressive enough to still be an asshole. It's kind of a win win situation","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T01:02:09.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am bronze 5 support main and I have bronze 5 decision making, bronze 4 game knowledge, garbage 6 mechanical skill, I also play support because I can't cs worth a damn no matter how much I continually practice.\n\n I came here for genuine advice for improvement and I already understand building defensively, warding and vision control and taking objectives>kills. I'm still working on and understand my weaknesses in playing around enemy resources and cds, I play simple champions, i am studying positioning and I try my best to analyse game footage from higher tiers and why they make certain plays at certain times and what factors they need to consider before making that big move.\n\n I also have my pre-session csing practice and I study enemy abilities and I'm practising learning unlocked camera and minimap awareness.\n\n I am just looking for ways to improve because all my friends are High Silver to Low Platinum and have been playing since season 2 and they don't want to play with me even in normals because I'm so bad at League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-02T00:13:01.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see how you could misunderstand. I was not saying that I am as skilled or more skilled as him, and am not really speaking about me but collectively.\n\nWhat I meant is that the transition from bronze is gold is primarily the transistion. I know many people who could easily get to gold like my other friend, but they try to pretend to be high elo while picking hard champs, trying to do good combos and solo carry on champions other than Yi.\n\nWhat I'm saying is while I am able to do the same stuff that a gold could and have beaten gold players, there is a reason I am not gold and that is because the conditions are different.\n\nIf I was good enough to be gold, I wouldn't be sitting here playing normals. Getting to gold is an acheivement especially in Oceania but I don't think I'm wrong to say when you were bronze you had very comparable skill to yourself now, minus some things gained from experience.\n\nIt's easy to get out of bronze if you really want to they should just get a 5 man or something and play easy champions. But it's the same shit in silver so I don't really get why players want to. \n\nI agree with your methods on most of it but yeah you are really passive agressive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-08-01T10:13:40.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no magic trick to getting out of bronze. Just play your own role consistently well, but you do have to try to carry. That said, don't be like the rest and think you have to carry when you're 0/3 and have lost your lane, play passive if there's a chance at all that your teammates can pull out some magic or have late game potential.\n\nIn the end it's pure luck whether your team or the enemy team has more mental invalids on it. Even the most unskilled Yasuo can dominate you if he has a 10 kill lead and gets close enough to Q you.\n\nMy biggest tip is, if you're jungler, don't try to help lanes that are losing. Gank the winning lane(s) and don't just leave after the enemy champ dies, break towers, push lanes as HARD as possible. It will force the other lanes to leave and let the losing lanes cs and get their gold farm up.\nChances are that if you do this a few things could happen;\n- If no other lanes come to help stop you and whatever lane from smashing their towers, that lane will tilt.\n- Team will tilt anyway because they're bronze and that lane failed hard and fast, or that lane will abuse jungler, tilting him and he won't gank for him.\n- You will get an early gold advantage from breaking towers, especially if you do this fast with the new first blood tower bonus.\n\nHonestly, this still works in silver too, just not as often.","replies":[]}]}
