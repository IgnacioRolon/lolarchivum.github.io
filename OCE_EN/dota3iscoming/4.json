You've had enough bad games recently you've been hit by tier 1. So where does your account standing go from here?\n\n[With 3 months of good behaviour](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000) your account will drop back into tier 0, so if you get punished again it'll only be a 10 game chat restriction instead of a 25, and sometime soon (more than likely within that 3 months) you will get hextech crafting rewards back.\n\nContinue the behaviour that got you punished however and you will be hit by tier 2, then tier 3, then 4. The 3 months of good behaviour will only drop you one tier, so please be aware of that. If you make it to permanent suspension, you won't be getting your account back under any circumstance excepting that of a system error.\n\n>However, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behaviour in the game. Excessive negative behaviour can result in a Two-Week or Permanent suspension at any time without having a chat restriction on the account.\n\nWhen they say excessive, they really do mean it, but be aware.\n___\nOk so the specifics of your situation.\n\n>at least show the whole fucking chat for the game i was in\n\nThe whole chat log is reviewed by the system, and if others in the game were reported their behaviour was evaluated as well. That said, the system is designed to encourage reform, not hate circles. What's important to you and your behaviour is your chat log and noone elses. You're meant to be reviewing **your **behaviour, and realising what **you ** said that was unacceptable, independent of any other factors.\n\n> There was an AFK troll in my team...\n\nIt sucks. Yeah it really does. But retaliation is not an appropriate answer. Defending yourself, or grumbling about it is fine, not necessarily helpful, but perfectly ok. That changes the second you cross the line into toxicity. \n\nEveryone defines that line a little differently, determined by whether they report you or not, and if someone else was toxic first the line might be a little further away, but think of it this way: Would you report someone if they said what you did? That's a good place to start at least.\n\n> i could just mute him but what kind of Beta does that.\n\nContrary to what you seem to think, being the bigger person and muting them makes you, funnily enough, the bigger person. More importantly as far as the restriction is concerned, it makes you the bigger person that your other teammates don't start cursing for a terrible experience and waiting for the chance to report you.\n\n> Someone punches ur friend and u just gonna sit there and fucking watch.\n\nYour situation is more like someone was yelling at you across the room and you yelled obscenities back and you both got kicked out of the _insert establishment here_ because this is a community that doesn't appreciate that kind of behaviour.\n\n> Like honestly if ur gonna be so butthurt, just stay the fuck of the internet.\n\nSee my last point, take your own advice and take it \"outside\".\n\n> Yea sure \"Autism\" and \"Bronzie\" were so hurtful.\n\nBringing disability into a conversation is no bueno, under _**any **_ circumstances. Bringing rank into it is almost always a pain point, and \"Bronzie\" is an insult whether they are in Bronze or not the way you're using it.\n\n>  i know what i said showing me twice isn't gonna make me \"Less toxic\" I'ts just gonna piss me off by not letting me see what the others also write cause they sure as hell weren't clean\n\nIdeally you'd be looking at what you said without the influence of what happened in the game itself, and realising that it wasn't ok, hence the restriction. It doesn't matter if they were clean or not, the system will judge them just as it did you, and if they were punishment worthy then it will punish them just as it did you.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-06-25T02:38:05.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About the Hextech craft thing, i really don't care about chest and all that cause i'm a 1 trick so its not like i haven't got 1 for my champ anyways does that include Lv 6 and 7 tokens???
