On this acc i only and strictly play 3 champs, Yasuo, Diana and Viktor, how the fuck you gonna give me 15 key shards and no chest, i&#039;ve earned the 3 chest from playing good with them and thats it? You give me shit to open chest with and you don&#039;t give me more ways to earn chest? I am a 3 trick player how am i suppose to get this any other way??? That&#039;s like giving someone free are keys but no cars to unlock them with... The point is make this chest more accessible through in game i don&#039;t wanna have to buy stuff of you just so i can use what i already have...Also i feel like playing some champs cause being a 3 trick is kinda limiting tho i do have a 75% win rate =L So Straw poll","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-17T01:59:17.095+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having only 1 chest per champ is to add variety into the game\nBecause otherwise people would only play Yasuo etc (which funnily enough is exactly whats happening here)\n\nSomeone who can play all champions to a high level is a far better player than someone who can play 3 champions to an extremely high level.\n\nI can tell that you don't give 2 shits about what champions your team is picking and what champions the enemy team is picking, because if you did you would have a variety of champions so you can change champions to augment their team comp, rather than pick whichever champ you happen to like and expect your teammates to deal with it. \n\nSo think of hextech crafting as a way to break you out of that cycle.\n\nPicking Yas and then complaining that no one picked a knock up for you, is a really selfish way of playing. (I'm assuming you do this, because almost all other 1-trick Yasuo's do... In fact even the non 1-trick ones do too..)\nBut seeing that your team has no knock ups but lots of damage, you might choose not to pick Yasuo (even though youre good with him) and pick someone like Lissandra or Galio, so that you can add some much needed CC to your team, which will help you win MORE than just picking a champ you're good with.\n\nLets put the shoe on the other foot, if you picked Yasuo, and i was jungle Kindred, would you rather i switched from kindred to Malphite? Even though I'm better with kindred than with malphite. You would wouldn't you! because i don't need to be pro with mal to ult into a 5 man and give u a pentakill. So even though I'm not as good with Mal as i am with Kindred, picking Mal actually makes our team better.\n\nSo use hextech crafting to learn to champs that you can do this with.\n\nThe game is NOT structured for you to play only 3 champions, so stop moaning that you don't get the benefits that other people do when they actually play the game properly.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-17T02:05:35.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well at least vote someone from the straw poll also i don't relay on anyone for knock ups, The most reliable knock up are ones from yourself and you are right only playing 3 champs does limit me thats why i was stuck in gold but its so fun and i could try to play other champs although it wouldn't be guaranteed that i would do good on them. The 6 champs on that straw poll is champs that i am interested in but since with the limited IP i can only play one of em at a time so i can actually have a feel at them so it would help if you voted someone. :) Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-17T02:23:41.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok done, I voted Kha'Zix because he is the one I have the most fun with, but also the most versatile (can go jung mid and top)\nhes also pretty interesting","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-17T02:26:03.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks i'll definitely try him out :)","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-17T03:39:45.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see what Riot is trying to do with the key and chest reward system, Unfortunately for me though, I having been experience painfully one sided games when ever I play non carry champions.
