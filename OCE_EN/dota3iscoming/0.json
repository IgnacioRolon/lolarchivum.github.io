It probably wasn't intended, but it did come across as a little aggressive. \n\nAs someone who has done some coaching in the past, i took a look at some of the replays just quickly and i couldn't find any ranked games to spectate. \n\nJust from your scores, it appears you're averaging a high number of deaths per game. Wards and watching the minimap are critical to gaining elo. I know a lot of high elo players say that, but i literally gained a whole tier when i learnt about how critical these things are to win the game. \n\nRemember trading 1-1 as a ap or ad carry usually isn't worth it. Your team is relying on you to stay alive for as long as possible, and deal as much DPS as possible. \n\nHope that was slightly helpful. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-08-04T08:57:53.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback, i have't played league in about 2 months and recently just got back as my old account was banned, i played normals as i didn't want to risk rank after not playing for 2 months, as a Gold 3 player on my old account i feel like a lot to work on especially after taking a break for 2 months","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-05T11:44:10.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I took a break from league for about 6 months around 2 years ago. \n\nIt can be hard getting back into the swing of things, but the only advice i can give is dive headfirst and give it a shot! :) Remember you're more likely to win games when everyone on your team has positive attitudes.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-08-05T15:39:26.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But what if i don't get back to the elo i was in?

I was winning my lane consistently, doing well in fights, having a low death count- and my win ratio was still barely above 50%. \n\nHonestly it is a grind. They'll be more games where you have to go 20/0 and carry then games where you get carried. Unfortunately it's the truth of the matter.\n\nJust remember use your game knowledge to your advantage, as your mechanics might be rusty. Remember to rotate, focus on objectives, and maintain vision control, and you'll be fine. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YaThatWasABanana","date":"2016-08-02T20:20:59.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, you expect someone on boards to be good enough to coach you? hahahaha... \nYou expect someone good enough to coach you to do it for free? ... \nyou expect someone to take AT LEAST 30 minutes of their time to watch a game you've played, assuming you were smart enough to record a game long enough that actually showcases your flaws.\n\n\nWatch coaches on youtube, even when things don't apply to you they can help you understand the game..
