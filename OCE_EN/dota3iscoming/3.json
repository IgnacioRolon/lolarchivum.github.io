No i&#039;m not gonna mute my chat cause what is a team game without communication...dumbass riot... and sure muting all chat but lets be honest, I&#039;m gold elo the people who tilt you most is yourself, and the people who tilt you second most is your fucking team mates..so muting all chat is not a fucking solution K? So anyone got some tips that would be great, if you are one of those &quot; OH SO GLAD I SEE RIOT IS BANNING TOXIC PLAYERS LIKE YOU HAHA&quot; Yea you, take your whiny ass out to the oven and stay there, cause you my friend are a silly fucking sausage and you deserve to get burn. I&#039;m sure like 20% of you guys reading this actually have shit in mind for solutions, the rest of that 80% gtfo i don&#039;t need your shitty comment about how i deserve it, you are the reason Tilt exist you silly sausage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPCE","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-07-15T08:57:30.159+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk maybe stop being a c**t ?","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-15T09:29:53.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea real smart buddy, it's like someone asking you why they have cancer and how they can live through it to not have cancer\n\n\n\nJimmy : \" I have cancer, how can i cure it \"\nKnuuckles: \" Idk, maybe try not having cancer? \"\n\nYou idiot","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-15T11:02:40.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it isn't. If you are toxic and can't stop going on to your team / flaming them, that is your fault. Don't even try to make a comparison. Riot punishes you for been so goddamn annoying, they aren't gonna put you through a rehab program how about you just stop been a jerk?\n\nSeveral people I love die from cancer, and I'm sure it is the same for you. They didn't choose to have cancer, you choose to be a butthurt moron in games.\n\nAnd btw, I have \"/mute all\" on every single game I play, and if I'm playing ranked with friends I will at least have \"/mute enemy\" on. It doesn't restrict communication, because 1. The new pings pretty much cover everything a player could do, and 2. If you are toxic the majority of what you type isn't communication.\n\nIt isn't Riot's job to reform for you, you need to reform or you can keep getting banned.\n\nAnd yes I am aware that to you it seems unfair because other people in your game probably do the same thing or intent feed or worse, but I can tell you first person that those people need to stop getting so triggered over a random, and that is basically the whole \"he started it\" approach.\n\nIf I may quote you call people who think you deserved to be banned \"whiny bitch asses\" and say that they are \"the reason why tilt exists\".\n\nNope, not even close. You are the one getting banned for been said thing in games, not them. You are the person tilting people in games, not them.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-15T11:30:52.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me correct you on something real quick sir I don't call those who say i deserve to be ban the reason tilt exist. I call people who be a dick about everything they see wrong the reason tilt exist. Oh did i die cause i tried to save your ass from being killed? Don't tell me \"You should have stayed in lane now you died and gave my lane a kill\" Thats the type, those who point out why i deserve on the other hand are cool. There is a difference between Helpful criticism and straight up being a dick and lets be honest this is the league community, more than 50% claim to be of older age than they are so they can make some shitty mum joke and are ironically the straight up dicks i'm referring to. Secondly, if you had read what i said, Enemies don't tilt me, My team mates does, whether they spam pings when i missed something spam pings when i die or even worst literally point out every mistakes i did that game like bitch sit your ass down your 3/6 isn't helping the situation by spamming me pings. 3 even when i go aggressive on someone more than half of the shit i say in chat are useful info, if it be the ss of my laner, ss of the jg or ss of bot lane when i go around and roam. and i don't mute all chat cause i need to see what my jg wants to do as half the games i play the jg is usually the shot caller. and i'm the person tilting people? Bitch where? I ain't the one spamming pings and blamming the jg for not ganking 24/7 cause the enemies jg been bot 30 days in an hour. I'm not the one blaming the mid laner to roam cause i lost lane and i sure as hell don't type in all chat unless i have a shit joke that i want everyone to cringe at. When i see a flame in chat i tell them to sit their asses down and play the game but no, this community seems to have more younger audiences that the fucking teletubies that instead of listening and agree to disagree they agree to disagree on the agreement of disagreeing. And let me get back on that ping system, why the hell would i need to know my team mates ss when i can see that shit on the score board, I'm in gold elo i have already pretty much memorised al the ss and i'm pretty sure having to know the enemy ss so i can time in for when i roam or get ganked is way more important than knowing what i already have info to.  Oh and i didn't know the gnar telling lies in all chat about how i instalocked in all chat and called him a kunt pre game in champ select because i didn't roam to his lane when he was 0/4 was my fault. Pls explain. and stop being a jerk?? I'm not the one telling others to commit suicide over a game i get mad at or telling them they are adopted and saying that they were never loved by their parents. If all it takes is 1 bad game to get 2 weeks ban then i sure as hell shouldn't see why people who Int, Feed, Or tell people to \"get ball cancer so they have an excuse to commit suicide because no one loved you anyways\" Should have a waaaaaaaay worst punishment than i do. And butthurt? Since someone clearly died of cancer in your family \n( No disrespect ) wouldn't you also be butthurt? I mean you already are since you wrote like an essay full of stuff about me comparing this with cancer. Also what does a bronze know about avoiding toxicity, 80% Make up the toxic community on league anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-15T13:17:52.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright I skipped most of what you said because you haven't given me any context prior to now and expect me to know the circumstances.

I don't want to get into another argument about golds calling bronzes trash when it is a completely unrelated topic.\n\nYou admitted you are toxic and made a stupid post because you can't be bothered reforming? By \"mechanical skin\" I'm assuming you meant to say skill.\n\nYes you are right, my game knowledge is very high but I am not mechanically skilled. Gold is an achievement, I've been to Gold 1 once, but that was when OCE was new and everyone sucked.\n\nRanks aren't the topic of this conversation, and I don't need to bust out my ego not only in rank but in game when you apparently flame people.\n\nBy the looks of it you are a mid lane main, which is very mechanically intensive to play, unless this is a friends account or your smurf, which I am assuming it is a smurf based on the match history and it been unranked.\n\nYou play a lot of games on that account, what is your main then?\n\nAnd as for your comment suggesting I should shoot my self, you could've just moved on and not said that, but because you did you now contradict yourself when trying to say \"I may come off as toxic to some\". No, you are toxic, this conversation has nothing to do with ranks or skill, it has to do with attitude.\n\nYou talk so much s*** down to me but if a diamond or higher came along and started calling you trash for your rank when the conversation was unrelated you would shut up.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-15T16:22:43.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"See that's my problem right there... i don't know how to avoid shit like this... yea i am contradicting i've been told that a lot but i don't know how to stop it... every time i see something to argue about i just go in and i can't seem to stop myself i apologies for the filthy remarks i made and/or will make i just don't know how to stop and what to do to stop i know the last guy below said \" No matter what anyone does to you you still have a choice in how to respond and to say you don't is ignorance \" It's just so annoying how i have to back down against someone especially when after backing down, they will feel like they shut you up and it almost seem like you lost the argument trying to be the bigger person but ending up the bottom end","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-15T16:25:21.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ This is why i started this post i don't care about your rank, rank doesn't show how good you are as a person, look at me i'm in gold and i'm toxic","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T08:55:13.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I've spent the majority of my League career expecting good results and getting upset when I don't get it because I know I'm better than my \"rank\".

Pick champs that Bronze players love to whine about and tilt them by either playing aggro or just straight up farm for 20 min\n\n2. look for rotation. From what i've seen bronze players don't really know how to rotate properly so make sure to see an opportunity to push lanes out. And find out the diff between slow pushing a lane and straight up just shoving it \n\n3. Don't care about team comps, it's bronze half the people don't even know team comp exists, Played against a garen top as diana and he built a Sunfire cape into me rofl, Pick your best champ and just keep playing, Just stay in lane and shove turret, If you are an adc player tell your support to roam to other lanes at 20 min if you are winning lane and stay bot and push, Mid lane? Just sit mid and push but make sure your jg has your back or you have vision. Top lane? I mean thats your job make sure to take TP tho and support? Just stick to your adc till you see that they can 2v1 reliably by themselves and then roam. Jg? Make sure to have drag + Tower control. Here are the objective importance in order \n\nNexus > Inhib >Baron > Tower > Dragon > Kills \n\nThat's kinda the guidelines i personally use to get to Gold","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-15T16:46:22.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, I understand getting mad and feeling the need to completely destroy what they are saying when someone says something that pisses you off.
