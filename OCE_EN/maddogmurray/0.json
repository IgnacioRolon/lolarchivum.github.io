Game crashed at about 25 mins. Would refuse to reconnect. Checked my router and everything in the house internet wise was working fine including my PC. Now when i try to log in i get a message saying &quot;the game has crashed please try reconnecting&quot;. So i click reconnect, it takes me to a black screen then it gives me a message saying the game has crashed, cant reconnect, and it returns me to the &quot;the game has crashed please try reconnecting&quot; again. Long story short i cant return to the main menu no matter what i do. Lol i know thats a bit hard to follow im sorry but i need help.
