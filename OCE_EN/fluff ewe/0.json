She ruined me.\n\nAmong the cliff-side trees of Ionia, I laboured under the art of my craft and the pallid sun, and between the scratch of my pen there came a noise. I looked up to see her perched at my window with all the air of a queen, gaze piercing.\n\n&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the outside like?&rdquo; She was my only source of information &mdash; I was no important person, no longer in contact with my other inventing colleagues that&rsquo;d gradually fallen out of favour in the past year &mdash; though a reliable one. She seemed to unfailingly know everything. \n\nIn response, something wet landed on my desk. She&rsquo;d dropped it from her mouth, though I hadn&rsquo;t realised she&rsquo;d been holding anything at all because it was the same black shade as her. \n\n&ldquo;I noticed that your vase was empty after my flowers died,&rdquo; she said. It wasn&#039;t so odd to only keep the company of a talking cat, I hoped, not in Ionia where magic was abound &mdash; and she certainly was magical, with that one purple eye. &ldquo;As much as you say no one else is welcome, I think you&rsquo;re in sore need for interaction.&rdquo;\n\nIt was, now that I looked closely, moving, alive. It was shifting all over, indiscernible plates sliding. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;There was a merchant travelling between villages.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;So you stole it,&rdquo; I said flatly, and picked it up with my gloved hands. It was a black spherical mass that squirmed between my fingers, though the heat it radiated was unmistakable even through the leather. With the intricacy of its parts, it seemed that it could&#039;ve been valuable to someone.\n\n&ldquo;I acquired it.&rdquo; When my expression did not change, she added, &ldquo;I thought you appreciated gifts. It&rsquo;s too late to return now, anyway. You might as well set up an aquarium in the vase.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;What if that merchant had been penniless? What if this had been a sentimental token? I can&rsquo;t condone this.&rdquo;\n\nHer ears drooped slightly, and her tailed flicked forwards in reluctance. &ldquo;I just wanted to do something nice for you. There isn&rsquo;t much I can, trapped in this body.&rdquo;\n\nShe had never been very forthcoming with her situation, though I&rsquo;d never asked, assuming that it was a sensitive topic. She&rsquo;d merely appeared on my window one day and been appearing ever since, and I&rsquo;d grown to look forward to her visits over the months, and shared with her much of my life as she regaled me with stories of the other villages and lands. \n\nIt was for these reasons that I let my disapproval fade with an edge of guilt. She was my dearest and only friend. &ldquo;I do appreciate the effort... but please, do not harm another on my behalf again.&rdquo;\n\nI never even suspected it to be manipulation.\n\n&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, with clear relief, and instead it touched me to know that my forgiveness meant something to her. &ldquo;Flowers next time, then? I&rsquo;m getting predictable.&rdquo;\n\nI had filled the glass vase up with water and was setting it back onto the corner of my desk. The sphere had gone still, and when I placed it in, it merely sunk slowly to the bottom.\n\n&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s aquatic?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Sure tasted like squid,&rdquo; she said, and had the audacity to give me the equivalent of a smug smile. \n\n&ldquo;Right, right.&rdquo; I frowned at the unmoving, tightly coiled ball in the vase once more, then turned for the door. &ldquo;Food could loosen it.&rdquo; I wanted to please her by interacting with the gift, pitiful as that might&rsquo;ve seemed.\n\n&ldquo;Get me something too.&rdquo;\n\nThe last I saw of her was her delicate form seated on the sill, light spilling around her like a halo, before I made my way to the pantry, choosing fruits, meats, nuts, and her favourite sardines. I enjoyed invention and learning; studying this new creature that she&rsquo;d given me, as disapproving as I may have been of its means of acquirement, was an exciting prospect.\n\nI had to give a return gift sometime. I did have an idea in mind, but worried that it wouldn&#039;t be to her standards. Even if she communicated only through a cat, I imagined as a woman she would have the features of the creature, with high expectations, curling wit, and perhaps even that one purple-pink eye that seemed void of light.\n\nIf I ever saw her as a being like me, I hoped there would be something recognisable.\n\nMy return was filled with thoughts like these, though something stilled me on setting foot. There was a silence to the room, a sense of heavy anticipation, and she was not moving on the window, merely looking outside.\n\nThe gift was missing from the vase, I realised, with sinking finality. \n\nThe food I&rsquo;d gathered tumbled from my arms.\n\nIt was on the ceiling, spreading like hair, tentacles unfurling and twitching, and so much could not have come from a small ball, but dark plates were sliding over each other and it was growing and crawling inch by inch down the walls like creeping fungus towards the window.\n\nI lunged forwards and grabbed her, intending to pull her away from the danger she hadn&rsquo;t realised, but as I dragged her back, her tail pulled taut on something because it&rsquo;d been seized by one of the tentacles, by the monstrosity that was swallowing the room.\n\nWith one hand clutching her, the other scrambled wildly for an enchanted knife on my desk. I needed any form of weapon. She twisted in my arms, was twisting, and I stared into her familiar golden eye. The other, the purple, was rolling madly in its socket like a screw. \n\nThe ground robbed me of my breath as I dropped her and fell back, frozen with horror as she was hauled away and left an oily black trail to be swallowed by the living mass. Above me, something was bulging in the centre of it, something pushing out from beneath the shifting tentacles that were now curling over my limbs, warm like fingers.\n\nIt was a head, a disembodied head, a head not by any sense that I was familiar, but ridged and plated, rotting golden, within it crowned an enormous unblinking eyeball whose gaze I felt as a heat bursting over my body. One of the three smaller eyes staring from above it was being cleaned by a second eyelid, shockingly reptilian, rolling slick and wet, newly returned to its place from where it had lived in the cat I&rsquo;d come to adore.\n\nThe head bore down on me with all the steadiness of a guillotine. The curved cornea of its eye was glistening, flexing faintly with a pulse, catching the light from the window like the edge of a horizon. My skin blistered from its heat. \n\n&ldquo;How could you fear me when I have gifted you the best companion of your life?&rdquo; The voice came from every side, though I hadn&rsquo;t expected it to speak because some part of me refused the notion still, quivering like a rabbit.  \n\n&ldquo;Because you are afraid of knowing.&rdquo;\n\nI wanted to plead. My mouth would not cooperate under its eyes that unraveled me. It, I realised, had been the one answering when I&rsquo;d spoken of my nightmares, comforting me when I&rsquo;d drifted away from those who knew me, encouraging me when I was struck with a new idea. It knew my fears, my anxieties, my passions, my&hellip; friendship &mdash; this enormous, monstrous, creature. \n\nIt must&#039;ve chosen me as a target, a pet Ionian it&rsquo;d isolate to open up as obscenely easily as an overripe fruit to reveal the raw and bleeding human condition.\n\nIts eyeballs turned with the sickening sound of many fingers squelching in open sockets, and it said, &ldquo;I systematically destroyed your bonds with individuals, whether by killing the other party or imitation in your letters to generate hostility.&rdquo;\n\nWith that admittance I burst through my blockade, a dam erupting, a litany of _please-please-please-no-_ and struggling against its bonds.\n\n&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; it said, &quot;but the League summons. What if I do not return? My careful cultivation would be for naught.&rdquo; \n\nI did not know what the League was. I did not care.\n\nA tentacle reached out to cup my face with shocking fondness. Instantly the skin there seared, the smell of burning flesh vivid, and my throat tore open to howl in anguish and betrayal and pain against this crime branded into me.\n\nMy devastation in that moment surged and surpassed a physical weight &mdash; the despair of a realisation, so utter and complete that it eclipsed everything else, crushed me wide open. It split my ribcage at invisible seams. _This_ had been my only friend. \n\nIt should have just killed me. Not taken more than my life.\n\n&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; it crooned. \n\nThe full force of its stare was a torrential roar of light; or that of the dark.","replies":[{"poster":"Metablue","date":"2018-03-16T17:49:22.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Fluff! \n\nI read through your story and I really enjoyed it, the way you describe things is brilliant and really engages the reader. In particular that line where you had the cats eye, \"rolling madly in its socket like a screw\" gave a real clear image that will probably pop up in my nightmares some time, so thanks (and good work =P).\n\nI'm hoping I'll be able to help you improve your story by giving my opinions on it, although I don't know everything so you can be the judge of how much of my advice you want to actually use =P \n\nI'll start with your concerns. \n\n1. I don't think the gift reference is as strong a link to the cat being Vel'koz as the other hints you laid down, although it doesn't hurt the story to keep it. I also didn't realize that the cat was Vel'koz in the early stages of the story despite all the little hints, although when shit hit the fan it did all come together in my head. From the get go I knew there was something up with the cat, it spoke in a weird way and had the purple eye (Nice play on words with the line, \"purple-pink eye that seemed void of light\", although instead of purple-pink violet might be a good word to use) but I wasn't really sure what was weird about the cat. I didn't even realize it was linked to the void, simply because Ionia is a weird magical place with weird magical animal people, so why not have weird magical pets too? In saying that, I don't think the reader needs to specifically know that the cat is linked to Vel'koz, or even the void at the start of the story. Just knowing that somethings up with the cat builds the tension you need.\n\n2. If you're concerned people aren't going to realize it's Vel, a good idea might be to drop his name into the story somewhere - maybe as Vel burns the poor guys throat a single name flashes into his mind - Vel'Koz. When I was reading I didn't have any trouble in realizing it was Vel though, so I maybe get a few more people to read through your story before you decide on what to do. \n\n3. In relation to the third point, I think the issue is more in the flow of the writing rather than the characters being boring, but I'll touch on that later. I was quite happy reading about these two mystery characters talking to one another because of the mystery surrounding the cat - who is it? Why was it this man's downfall? This prevented it from getting boring - they don't have to be champions to be interesting. \n\n4. I think it was pretty clear that the MC was just a random - at no point was I thinking, \"I wonder if this is Ryze?\", so I wouldn't worry about it =)\n\n\nI think the strength of your story comes from your ability to describe things in good sensory detail. The flow of your story is what I'd be looking to improve. Currently there are some bits that could be smoother to read, such as, \"She seemed to unfailingly know everything.\" which could instead just be, \"She seemed to know everything.\" I realize that some of these lines are used to hint towards the cat being Vel, but I think that smoothing out your sentences and writing in that information in different ways will improve the readability of your story. \n\nAnother thing that felt a bit odd to me was how Vel displayed emotion in his cat form. Vel is very much an emotionless being, and I think you've done a very good job of portraying that even while he's a cat, however there was one part where the cat looked sad and it just didn't feel like Vel. This is a bit of a tricky one since the cat is supposed to be manipulating this guy, so maybe it'd be better to just leave it and build on other aspects of your story, but I thought I should mention it in case you had any ideas on how to change that part.\n\nAnother more specific thing that I found didn't make sense was when Vel'koz started talking about the League? It felt a bit random and didn't make any sense in relation to the story. An idea I had was maybe change 'League' to 'Void', as that'd make more sense considering Vel'koz is a creature of the void. \n\nThe last comment I have is in relation to when Vel tells the man that he killed off his social life by murdering his friends and imitating him in mean letters. It felt a bit odd that Vel would just blurt that out before painting the room with guys melted flesh, but at the same time I know you want to tell the reader, 'this is how Vel cornered his prey.' A better way of doing this might be to have Vel go on in a bit of an evil mastermind monologue - not a long one, just enough for him to comment on how he finds humans interesting, especially their bonds to others, then have him say that at first he tried killing off the MC's friends before realizing that imitating the MC in mean letters was a more effective, less messy method of eradicating the problem. \nAnother way to approach it may be to not have Vel mention it at all, instead having the MC realize and comment on it in his thoughts to the reader.\n\nI hope some of this is helpful to you Fluff. Thanks for putting up your story and giving me the opportunity to read it, I wish you luck in the upcoming comp!","replies":[{"poster":"Fluff ewe","date":"2018-03-18T06:08:20.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for taking the effort to reply! \n\nI'm so chuffed to hear you mention the eye rolling (: It was what inspired the whole thing because I thought Vel's eye looked like a purple cat's. And also because I usually do horror/violence/~~everything that's R-rated~~. \n\nAs for what you've raised: I think you're very right with the 'cat looking sad' scene. It seems out of character. I wanted it to be a blatant manipulative move — the cat appears to make mistakes so it seems human and is endearing to MC —, which is why the 'manipulation' line is right after it, but I don't think I made it obvious enough. \n\nLeague is mentioned because I needed a reason for Vel to kill MC, although this is mostly in inference too. Vel would normally wait for him to grow old and keep milking him for all human interactions' worth, but he's being summoned to go fight in the League (of Legends) and is unsure if he'll return, so wants to cash in his human crop beforehand. But you're definitely right. That's too far of an inference, and so it stands out as a weird line.\n\nVel reveals his cards to MC because he's interested in destroying him. (I would love to have added monologue, but the word count literally, physically, beats me up.) Vel didn't even need to show MC he was the cat. He could've just zapped him out of existence, but chose to reveal the facade so he could take everything, mostly hopes and dreams and all that tasty stuff, from MC. I fumbled the execution in the story on explaining that, too, but at least the intent is there >//<\n\nAgain, thank you so much for reading <3 This is my first time writing anything for League. I'm glad I was given reason to write and share it, and that I know it _was_ shared, in being read.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fluff ewe","date":"2018-03-10T21:02:08.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Thank you for getting down the bottom here. If you're thinking of posting feedback, I'm going to put my worries for my story forwards first. They might help you put a finger on your thoughts.\n\nMy major qualms with the story as it stands are these:\n\n*  With the propensity to skim, it’s easy to miss that the cat is Vel’koz/a void construct at the start. I tried to put in as many signposts as I could, with the first sentence, its fur being the same colour as the ‘gift’ (though that’s an obscure one, and only for hindsight), purple eye mentioned twice, purple described with ‘void’, another out-of-thought-stream reminder that the cat is manipulating MC, but I think it’s still very possible it slides entirely under the radar.\n\n*  A more severe version of this would be not realising that the cat is vel’koz even at the end. Its purple eye rolls away, it's stated that the eye ‘used to be in the cat [he] adores’, and everything else refers to it by the end — but if that fact slipped a reader, all the references about ‘this was my friend, sad sad’ and vel’s dialogue just become confusing. Everything becomes confusing. \n\n*  If cat=vel at the start has been missed, the entire first half of the story where two seemingly absolute OCs interact just become boring. It’s just two OCs talking. It loses any manipulative sub-text, and the reader doesn’t care about any of MC’s later ironic introspection/description about the cat. The cat just seems like a Mary Sue. One purple eye/heterochromia? A talking black cat? Smug? Portrayed in an adoring light? Those are all Mary Sue flags, and if it isn’t clear that the cat is actually Vel, it just becomes an dislikable OC that the author is projecting on.\n\n* Reader may be too distracted trying to find out who MC is, thinking MC is a league champion, and miss what the cat is. \n\nSo some pretty major things are contingent on an awareness that I can’t gauge all by myself. Feedback with respect to these problems would be really appreciated. I don’t know what to do ;;;;;\n\ntl;dr: worried people won’t realise the cat is some Void construct/Vel.","replies":[]}]}
