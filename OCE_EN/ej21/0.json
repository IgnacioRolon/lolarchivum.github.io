The role of a support is boring - NO CS, No kills etc. this  30+ minutes of bordem is being inflicted on me, this is game it is supposed to be fun, this role is not and whats worse if you see your ADC getting hooked by {{champion:53}} repeatedly after warding both bushes you can't do anything about it, from now on if I am 5th pick i will tell my team before select that if I have to support I won't and will take cs and pick some random mage and if they want an actual support they should pick it. I have checked i can't get banned for not following the meta. This role is cancerous and last time i check this isn't the LCS this is solo Q.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-13T18:53:14.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play support because of the praise you get.\n\nClearly you just lack the skill to carry you ADC.\n\nAfter all, Supports are like the mother of the team. It takes care, no matter the situation, giving their best to keep their carries alive.\n\nEven if you do all that, then you- oh wait, bronze.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-13T16:15:14.985+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The role is cancerous if you are bad at it, and have no idea overall what a support is meant to do.\nIt's not at all about not taking CS and getting no kills.\n\nSupport exists to carry the ADC into being fed. Supports set up plays though out the match.\n\nIf I play {{champion:40}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:43}}  as a support, I make sure I'm constantly poking, getting the enemy bot lane on low health for that moment to all in with my ADC. Then that carries on to the mid and late game, keeping the team healed, shielded while at the same time poking hard or splitting the enemy team apart.\n\nIf I play {{champion:89}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} I play semi passive semi aggressive as I work in moments to harass and jump on the enemy to CC%%%% them hard keeping that one or two particular enemy champs in the dirt while my team bursts them.\n\n\nAs a support, the idea that you're not meant to get kills is ridiculous, you are one of two major play makers, not a heal bot. Never not aim to kill an enemy champ if you can do it. Assists give gold just like kills.\n\n\nIf you're warding both lane bushes as a support, you're likely doing something wrong here. I like to defensively Pink Ward Tri Bush, and Stealth Ward River Bush and use my two remaining wards to ward dragon and enemy jungle. Keeping vision in the enemy jungle is quite important. (not so important if you never use your mini map)\n\n\nI often find that if I support well my ADC and other players will listen to my suggestions on their builds and tactics. Just like when I jungle well.\n\n\nIt's also interesting to see how players improve if you kill steal as a support.\n\n{{champion:81}} Oi that was my kill, you %%%%ing stole it\n{{champion:37}} Do more damage and I wont be able to...\n\nThat line usually works wonders.\n\n\n\n\nAnd ultimately, NEVER and I mean **NEVER** sacrifice yourself needlessly. If you can get out but someone on your team can't, only try to save them if you can do it without getting killed yourself.\nSupports getting killed in such fashion is never **worth** you are worth gold and exp, and if you are down for 30seconds that 30seconds the enemy team has to capitalise on your team having a lack of shield/poke/healing/CC/Elvis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2015-02-13T23:12:59.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10 Bronze Rant","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-13T20:26:20.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Can't carry as support\" - I have like... a 80% or so winrate as Soraka in normals last time I checked.\nHAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME THOUGH, I GUESS, SO OH WELL, EY?

Its about getting advantages for both yourself and your team.\nAnd look, that's what the support role is meant to do.","replies":[]}]}
