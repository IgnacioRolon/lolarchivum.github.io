All I did in the Yasuo match up was take Q at level one poke him to destroy his sheild and then take W at 2 and max E first and when Yasuo dashes to you W and E him. and same thing with Riven really get them to attack you in your own minion waves let the minions butcher them and then get Seekers and then try and roam bot ..... too ez","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-22T08:29:16.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree that Riven sucks against poke and self peeling champions with escapes, Kassadin can't poke hard enough before 6. Unlike top lane Quinn which rustles my jimmies to the max every time.  Also depends if Riven is running CDR glyphs instead of MR. A neat way to win lanes is to wait for minions to start fighting each other, kill all minions except one hence pushing it and as soon as the enemy laner goes in for a CS, kill the last enemy minion making your wave focus the enemy laner, you go in to do your CC (Riven's stun in this scenario) and you get a lot of damage on the enemy. This is mostly done at top lane.\n\nFor Talon, Kassadin is easy to kill pre 6. What makes it hard for Kassadin to fight back is that he's melee. Minion aggro doesn't put out a lot here unlike against ranged APCs when playing as Talon. Starting cloth against Talon has its cons and pros. Con being you probably can't kill him/you do less damage. Pro being you're more resistant and can build a quicker Seeker. If both players are equal in skill, Talon should win. Flat health seals aren't that good against Talon, I remember reading somewhere that flat hp seals get outdone by armour at level 3 (not sure) or something. As a mid laner against Talon, you always want armour seals. \n\nYasuo is a little different, he has a weakish early game so harassing him is fairly easy.  If he tries to get behind your minions and do a Talon procedure, he can't because he doesn't do enough damage early on to go that ham. Skill match up I believe.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ContactSupport02","date":"2014-12-20T21:42:58.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that's cute fgt","replies":[{"poster":"EJ21","date":"2014-12-21T07:18:16.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U jelly?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-21T03:50:14.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't play Akali anymore, she's my waifu.","replies":[]}]}
