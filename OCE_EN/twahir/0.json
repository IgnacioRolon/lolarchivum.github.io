Think about it, when was the last time you saw anyone use revive for anything but trolling? It may just be me being a typical low elo player and getting salty over the teleport revive trolls in ranked play but I genuinely think revive has seen its day.","replies":[{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-30T06:45:38.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"r.i.p phantoml0rd i cri ery tiem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-01-30T04:48:34.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets see here, the community is 100% against ruining out of meta strats, the outcry when they were going to remove revive was so much that it was kept in the game, Phantoml0rd who is known for his TP/Revive Karthus also had a big influence on revive not being removed.\n\nBut this little OCE poll is going to make Riot change there mind, sure, guess what i'm 100% against ruining out of meta things as well unless its broken as %%%% which revive is not its pretty garbage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-01-30T02:08:49.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shhh. You support Cloud 9. Your opinion is invalid here! jks. Classic banter. \nBut seriously. Revive is not a waste summoner spell. Players just don't see the potential of the spell and are more favourable to the meta of Flash/Ignite/Ghost/Teleport/Exhaust combinations. \n\nAdditionally. If your argument is solely based on the fact that you hardly see Revive. I have to argue that point on the basis that I see far more Revives than Clairvoyance.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-30T04:47:04.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fog,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=A1N4aTt4,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-30T02:08:49.226+0000)\n> Additionally.
