Pitch me your team.","subforum":"Esports","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I&#039;ve been a fan of competitive League of Legends pretty much since the start, but I&#039;ve never really followed the OCE scene all that closely (although still more than most in NA).  I recently moved to New Zealand, so I want to start following and supporting the OPL more, part of that is having a specific team to support.  Tell me why I should throw all my fan fervor behind your team of choice.\r\n\r\nIf it informs your pitch at all, I&#039;m a Team Curse turned Team Liquid fan in NA.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-03-16T03:00:46.332+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think every team has their own flavour. I find it tough to know who I really follow till I watch their games. \n\nHere's my own personal take on the teams (and one of the casters will probably tell me how inaccurate i am):\n\n**Legacy:\n**\nThey started out as the classic underdog story because of the great upset against Chiefs back in 2014. \n\nWatching them you get fiery action and a team that is always improving. Are they really better than Chiefs now? I guess that's what finals are for...\n\nThis is a good TLDR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSHlEruqrPY\n\n**Chiefs:**\n\nKoyotee who works on our team said this best: 'i don't have to feel bad for supporting Chiefs now' because they were winning all the time for so long.\n\nEvery time Chiefs make it internationally I turn into a huge Chiefs fanboy and they hardly ever let you down. \n\nThe exciting thing about watching them is the comebacks. If you look at their record for 2015 you would think they just crush every game, but there were multiple times where they would fall behind and it was poetry in motion watching them claw it back.\n\n**SIN:**\n\nI like the 'SINderella story' pun a little too much. They started off as a scrappy team trying to forge an identity and have dug deep and turned it all around this split. \n\nAlso Juves seems to have almost a cult following. Definitely a team on the rise worth checking out if you like players with lots of personality.\n\n**Dire Wolves:**\n\nI still maintain they have the best logo, but that's maybe because I just think wolves are awesome. They've been around for a while and are usually nipping at the heels of Legacy and Chiefs. \n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if Dire Wolves became the best team in the OPL in a few years.\n\n**Avant:**\n\nThe current Avant roster just makes me think players with hearts on their sleeves. They went through some roster changes and are still in the conversation for playoffs.\n\nThis is the team to follow if you want to watch a team that is all heart.\n\n**Hellions:**\n\nSo much hype coming into the season around their gaming house and bringing talent in from Korea. \n\nTheir games are pretty exciting to watch if maddeningly inconsistent. It feels like if they pull it all together at some point it will be an unstoppable team.\n\n**Infernum:**\n\nThis team is the biggest question mark to me. They have so many veterans and a really solid lineup that they could go really far, but they're struggling.\n\nI find their games interesting to watch because Jakattack occasionally just beasts the entire game.\n\n**Trident:**\n\nThe fact that Trident are at the bottom of the ladder shows why this OPL split is so fun to watch.\n\nThey started off poorly, but the addition of Wzard in the mid lane has turned them into a real threat. They're taking matches of the top teams and upsetting the middle of the packs. \n\nIf the split was a month longer, Trident would be in the conversation for playoffs. This is an exciting team to get on the rollercoaster with.\n\n\nAgain these are just my thoughts and probably way off the mark :)","replies":[{"poster":"KillblowSwaggins","date":"2016-03-16T04:38:45.307+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus, an official Rito response on my stupid post.
