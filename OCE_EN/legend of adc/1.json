Regarding grades, stop comparing yourself to other players in your game playing different champions to you.\n\nIt isn't a set score you need to achieve, it's all relative to how everyone else on the server is doing with the **same champ in the same role**. The system used to grade people is the same on all servers, it just that you get compared to a different pool of players. \n\nFrom Riot:\n\n> It’s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-08-28T12:07:14.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"14 'ands' jesus christ","replies":[]}]}
