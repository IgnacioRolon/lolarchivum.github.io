I was disconnected.\n\nThank you Heartvine for your comment.\n\n\nAnd thanks to Neba - I already went through all those steps before posting here , but I guess we can assume that everyone who posts their problems / issues on the forum hasn't taken any necessary/required protocols to ensure they needn't it forum worthy.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-13T12:35:59.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no need to get so defensive.

It ***DOESN'T*** happen. In order to get hit with LPQ in the first place you need to *consistently* leave/afk in games so maybe you should stop with that \"I've never left a game\" bullsh!t.","replies":[{"poster":"Amnesia","date":"2015-07-16T12:56:16.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-17T03:47:47.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Being reported by 9 people might've helped the situation though.\n\nFun Fact: reports are almost useless to the leavebuster system.

Clearly you were taking a shot at the actual post\nIf you wanted to 'HELP' maybe you could've suggested other methods on how to remove the time ban, rather than call me an \"idiot\" in your first comment .\n\nWho's at fault for being insulted back?\nDon't throw a punch if you can't take one. \n\nDon't be the ass-hole who pretends to be helping but really is either trying to make fun / insult a person.\nYeah I said it, and someone in-game explained why I received the ban. But thanks for your petty argument.\n\nGood bye :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
