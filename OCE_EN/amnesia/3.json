Due to the nature of the millions of people who play this, each with their own situations and circumstances, of course there will be hiccups. The point being, these hiccups are not bias to be against you all the time. It's sure easy to ignore the times it favours you, but when it doesn't it really gets under your skin, and I understand that.\n\nIf you're better than the people who you are playing with, then *eventually* due to the more matches you're winning, you'll rank up. If you find yourself being matched with people who are apparently lower skilled than you, well, they're based off of your mmr, whether they're ranked or not.\n\nThis discussion doesn't belong on this board, however. This is for technical issues with the game. Try gameplay and strategy or even misc.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
