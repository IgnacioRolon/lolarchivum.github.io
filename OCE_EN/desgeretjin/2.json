My mates and i had a team fill of diamonds and 1 challenger and they were diamond flex ranking. We would be lucky to be gold mmr flex rank. They said they were in queue for about 10 minutes. And our queue popped instantly legitimately now even 2 seconds in queue lol.\n\nI would understand it if we were in queue for 10 mins too... but thats what we get for being a low populated server with 2 ranked queue types. \n\nIMO they should have just kept it as solo queue and ranked 5's. Least ranked 5's you tended to go in expecting all sorta of ranks rather than very 1 sided matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-14T23:11:58.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's where challengers flex their muscles before they bring the beat down","replies":[]}]}
