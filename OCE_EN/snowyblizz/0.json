It's about how well he can pressure top, mid and bottom lanes early on. WIth the jungle changes this has actually enhanced his ability to pressure lanes through sheer sustain in the jungle while still being healthy enough to counter jungle and duel the enemy jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-10T02:30:31.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is popular, and people are learning how to play him more now.
