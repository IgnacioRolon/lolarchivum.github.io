Possibly.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that with the new Hextech crafting system, there should be a way to use your keys for something more than open crates. This is why I have devised an idea including this new S rank system. Whenever you get a new key part, you usually combine it with two others for a key which unlocks crates. I suggest that you may also exchange it for a type of essence or energy. Each key part adds 3% (or 2%) to its energy bar. Whenever you now play a champion and get an S rank, a roulette wheel will appear on screen with the energy percentages you have assigned. If you land on the highlighted part, it will consume ALL of the energy and give you a crate which can be unlocked as per usual (or require two keys ETC). If you have not scored an S rank with this champion before and get this free crate. It will give you the S rank chest rather than the roulette chest. These Roulette chests also contribute to your monthly chests that you stack up.","replies":[]}
