I thought Riot support would be able to understand what it feels like to essentially have you account held hostage but was quite surprised to find they genuinely give no shits about the players or their player base.\r\n\r\nI know my suspension won&#039;t get reversed but i find it so unfair and wrong after being forced into something now my account is at risk of being perma&#039;d for virtually no reason yet people committing the exact same offense had 0 punishment simply because KDA.\r\n\r\nhaving just hit honor lv2 after the chat ban and being excited for my season rewards i worked hard for it hit me pretty hard and having gaming as one of the few things i&#039;m able to do in my condition it felt having one of the few things i have taken away.\r\n\r\nOne day i hope riot support will start thinking more empathically about the situation rather than. Dosen&#039;t matter if our system isn&#039;t 100% perfect or accurate you should have blind faith regardless because we are omnipotent.","replies":[{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-01-24T08:41:12.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait your friends threatened to report you? how are they your friends? and those 'other friends' who got banned for not playing along even if thats true they could easily become unbanned if they contacted riot support and explained the situation as the riot employee","replies":[{"poster":"Blamzite","date":"2019-01-24T14:19:00.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Needless to say i stopped playing with them immediately.\nMy friends who tried to appeal basically got the response of tough luck.","replies":[]}]}]}
