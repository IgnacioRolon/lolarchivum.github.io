The OCE playerbase simply can&#039;t sustain that many queues without severely compromising the quality of matchmaking (specifically during the typical school/work day).\r\n\r\nPlease, disable RGMs 9-5/9-3 or make them weekend-only.\r\n\r\nYou guys quote the statistic EVERY DAMN YEAR that a substantial number of people stop playing the game after (AR)URF has been out for a few days and it takes up to a month for them to come back. And every year you still release this god awful gamemode for way too long.","replies":[]}
