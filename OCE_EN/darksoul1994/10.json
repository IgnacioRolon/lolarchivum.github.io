And if i had a magic button that got rid of it all toxic players, i'd press it in a heart beat!\nbut there is a fine line between Justice and Vengeance.\n\nGetting that notification doesn't help the justice system, its just personal gratification so you know _'that the guy who pissed you off before, now suffers! >:D'_, and that seems a hell of a lot more like vengeance than justice to me.\n\nJustice is also about preventing the issue from happening in the first place.\n\nSo in the interest of Justice, I'm curious as to why you get so many death-threats/homophobia/racial-slurs/kys-messages in the first place? Because I've been playing since season 2 as well, and I get almost nothing like that.\n\nMaybe its because:\n\n1. I don't announce my sexuality during game. _(so how can they make fun of my sexuality?)_\n2. I don't announce my race during game. _(so how can they make fun of my race?)_\n3. I don't announce my name or location during game. _(so how can death threats be credible?)_\n4. I don't actively give people a reason to dislike me. _(so why would they tell me to kys?)_\n\nI just get on and play the game _(I'm not even very good)_, but funnily enough, I get very little toxicity aimed my way. \n\nA fire cant burn without fuel, if you don't want people to be toxic, don't give them fuel?\n\n_________\n\nThe league community is incredibly diverse; we have very young kids and fully grown adults. We have christians, and muslims. Black people, white people. Gay people, straight people. Left wing supporters, right wing supporters. We probably even have someone who identifies as a flying magenta iguana that farts rainbows. And it's great that it is so diverse, _(it'd be boring if everyone was identical)._\n\nBut diversity also means that we are all different, we all have our own beliefs and interests, so you will **always** find someone who believes things a different way than you do, no amount of censorship or social justice can change that. The ONE thing we all have in common, is that we want to play League of Legends. So if you want to avoid unnecessary discomfort, focus on the single thing we **all** share an interest in.\n\nSo rather than waiting for vengeful notifications to hear toxic people have been banned _after_ they have been toxic. Focus on reducing the windows people have to be toxic in the first place. Then games are better for everyone.\nIf you are truly interested in having less toxicity in your games, \nthen that would be my advice. ^^\n\ne.g. If you don't want Braum to tell you to KYS, maybe don't make fun of his bad score? he's probably feeling shit enough already. So when you tell him he's bad, chances are, he will lash out at you.\n\ne.g. No sane person is going to give you death threats because you accidentally fed their lane or stole their kill. Therefore, if you are receiving death threats, its probably because you are poking the bear in some way or another.\n\n\n_______________________\n\nLots of people complain on the forums that they get all this homophobic and racial toxicity directed at them.  Well I have never disclosed my sexuality or race during a game of League _(why would I? It doesn't help push my lane.)_, and in all my 6+ years of playing league, I've never been the recipient of a homophobic or racist remark. \n\nCoincidence? I think not.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T13:02:38.505+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's naive to think that just because it hasn't happened to you means it hasn't happened at all, but it is also true that many (dare I say most) of these claims are exaggerated in some way. It's part negativity bias, part sympathy theatre and part straight up frustration. A lot of these claims stem from some kernel of truth, but how accurately that truth is reflected depends a lot on the person making the claim.\n\nI hardly ever see such extreme toxicity, but I *have* seen it, and sometimes there is no poking the bear, unless you count being in the wrong place at the wrong time as poking. Sometimes you feed a kill by accident, or steal a cs and someone will fly off the handle at you. It's rare, but it does happen, and it's unfair to put the blame on the victim. \n\nI'm not saying advertising your race/gender/sexuality in game is smart, because it's not, but that doesn't mean it's ok for people to target that, nor does it mean such advertisement is always present when people decide to get hateful.\n\nJust yesterday someone called me gay (as a negative) because i told him the the special store includes champion cost if unowned...","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-03-18T22:24:46.633+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Oh of course I don't assume that it doesn't happen just because I don't see much of it!\nBut after 6+ years of league playing, if there was as much blatant _hatred_ as everyone makes out to be, I'm sure i would have seen at least a little more than I have. \nIm sure there is a lot more than I have seen, but its funny how the insecure-sensitive people seem to come across a lot more 'intense hatred' than the thick-skinned people?\n\nYes its true that some people fly off the handle at nothing, but that is faaaaarrrrrr from being a common occurrence. \nIt does happen yes, I've seen it myself too, _(in-fact not long ago I was playing a game, and our ADC got a kill during a fight, and our 2/14 Braum blew his top at her for stealing his kill...)_ but even that isn't 'homophobic' or 'racist'. and it certainly doesn't happen very often.\n\nIm not saying the victim should be blamed at all! It doesn't matter what the girl was wearing, nothing justifies rape!\nHowever, if you dress like a prostitute and get wasted at 2:00 in the morning in an alleyway, your chances unfortunately, do go up. _(its still not your fault, and it can still happen to anyone, but it is within your power to avoid putting yourself in dangerous situations.)_\nSame with league, you're always at risk of getting toxicity even if you're as polite as the Queen, but if you start a game with _\"Hi guys I voted yes to gay marriage because gay love is more pure than straight love!\"_ your chances of copping a homophobic remark, go up. You still don't deserve abuse, but you could have taken measures to at least reduce the chances. \n\n\n_______________\n\nThats the weirdest reason for someone to call you gay that I've ever heard? xD \nBut even that isn't homophobic. Its unpleasant for sure, but if they don't know your sexuality, its hardly targeted homophobia.\n\nOver the years the word 'gay' has developed a tertiary use as a word for something thats 'just a little bit shit'. gay people may not like this new use of the word, but that is a way it is used. It isn't a derogatory thing against gay people, its just another meaning the word has developed over time. In fact, originally it wasn't even used to describe homosexuality either, that too is just a new meaning people have tacked onto the word. So It's ironic that gay people get all pissy when you use the word to describe something 'a little bit shit', when they themselves are using the word in a way it wasn't originally meant either.\n\n_\"He skipped down the street as carefree and **gay** as a child with a lollypop.\"_\n\n_\"He came out of the room very relieved, telling his parents he was **gay** had been difficult, but they had accepted it.\"_\n\n_\"Splat! 'Awww **gay**...' came the cry, blown by the wind across the paddock, Lenny s%%%%%%ed, Harry had obviously dropped his pie.\"_\n\nAll are completely different and unrelated meanings of the word.\nPerhaps originally the meanings stemmed from each other. 'Gay' (happy) probably started to be used in conjunction with two men finding happiness, turning into 'Gay' (homosexual). 'Gay' (homosexual) then probably then started being used as term for something that turned out not quite as expected. And now by further development we have 'Gay' (a little bit shit), which has absolutely no connection to the previous meanings of the word, and is just an expressive slang term.\n\nOriginally it probably was a little derogatory, but language is a living thing, and now the new use is so ingrained in everyday language, that it has no connection to the other uses of the word.\n\nE.g. Similarly, 'Thursday' is just a development of 'Thor's Day'. Yet Christians still use the word Thursday, because its new meaning as just 'the 4th day of the week' has nothing at all to do with the Norse God of Thunder. Thats just how language works.\n\n\n\n_____________\n\n**[EDIT]:** The %%%%% out word is 'S n i g g e r e d' a perfectly normal everyday word describing a kind of laughter\nhttp://www.dictionary.com/browse/s%%%%%%?s=t\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-03-18T07:57:04.392+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Clearly this needs to be said *yet again*, the IFS *does not* notify *every* player who contributed a report to a punished player.
