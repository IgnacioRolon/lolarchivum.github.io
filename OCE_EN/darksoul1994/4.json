Or are you guys looking at the AFL clubs as potential team partners if franchising ever came to the OPL? Also, will Wildcard/Play-In region tournaments (VCS, OPL, etc) ever make it to the main LoL Esports website/Twitch/YouTube? I feel like OPL could benefit from some regular international exposure. We&#039;re not the best region in the world, but every bit of exposure is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2018-05-25T01:43:09.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We really are exploring all options - at the end of the day we want build out the best Esports ecosystem for Oceanic players - if this means we need more international exposure then that's what we will work towards.

They clearly had no idea what they were doing at the time that article was written because:\n\n1. We don't have the OPL fan base to fill a stadium - even for finals.\n2. We would probably have to pay (similar to how we bid for FIFA WC/Olympics/Commonwealth Games) for something like MSI or World Championships to come to Australia which is the only way we're gonna fill a stadium.\n3. We need a studio for weekly OPL games in the first place (which they just announced along with their partnership with Riot Games).\n4. Does Australia even have the network infrastructure to host something like MSI or World Championships (assuming we even had an appropriate venue)?\n\nI'm asking beyond this. I'm asking will we have franchising for OPL in a few years? Has the AFL realised how harmful it would be to try to make a Women's LoL League?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-08T05:16:12.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aus already hosted 2015 All-Stars in Melbourne.\n\nI think the biggest thing is with this, the OPL will move to Melbourne and out of Sydney. Which problems means Riot may move their HQ to Melb too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
