OCE just continue to look like the clown region of worlds.\n\nI really don't want to slam anyone as I'm sure they were all really hungry to do well. But there are so many inexcusable mistakes in all their games. Are we really that trash of a region?\n\nFor example Phantiks (sorry just one slam) wandering out of position for cs greed three bloody times. That is just so so tragic. No communication? No map aware? No clue?\n\nEach year there's such a brief opportunity for OCE and each year it's felt completely squandered by such simple mistakes and undisciplined plays.
