That said, it is a really bad promotion. Riot could have potentially given away ~$30k worth of skins this weekend for the promotion. With each giveaway, 1000 people got a skin and then promptly stopped watching the stream (after the first Infernal of the weekend, the collective viewers across YouTube and Twitch went from ~6500 to ~5500).\r\n\r\nThis didn&#039;t do shit to grow the OPL&#039;s fan base. It just lost Riot $30k.\r\n\r\nIf you want to reward the viewers for watching OPL, don&#039;t put the promotion on the front page of the client because non-viewers will come, get the skin, and leave. If you want to reward the viewers for watching the OPL, announce it during the broadcast or put it on the front page of oce.lolesports.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-06-09T09:45:50.017+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't rewarding viewers they are trying to grow it. Although yes the numbers drops significantly after the giveaway, there may be a few hundred people who watch the games and think \"huh, this isn't as trash as i'm led to believe\".\n\nYou also don't have the exact numbers in terms of average viewership and the like for the OPL. OPL sitting on 5k viewers is pretty good considering the the GRAND FINAL last season maxed out at 5,602 viewers on twitch.\n\nhttp://www.twitchmetrics.net/c/46273272-opl/streams\n\nYou're also saying Riot \"lost\" 30k, but that assumes the people who received the skin for free had the intention to purchase. The skins don't have a monetary value if no one was going to buy it in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-06-09T09:52:49.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's at 3k tonight after another Infernal Drake...\n\nSee the pattern?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-06-09T09:59:33.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"again... 3k might be good for the OPL.

(There was about 20 of us watching on YouTube). Last night there were around 750 viewers there. Twitch had around 3,500 viewers at the end of broadcast. \n\nSure there were some people who only tuned in for the skin, but that was about 1/3 of the total viewing audience over the weekend. 1/3 were already viewers (probably less), and the other 1/3 (probably more) actually seen something they enjoyed and continued watching to the end. \n\nNote: By the end of Broadcast there were more than 6,000 skins given away (so everyone who watched for long enough ended up getting one).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2018-06-23T03:57:36.636+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey DarkSoul and others interested in this topic. It's definitely a hotly discussed one internally too and you guys have provided some solid strategies of how to adjust and target different goals.\n\nOur main approach when doing a skin giveaway is to give players who may not currently watch the OPL an opportunity to tune in and have a look. The hope is that some people actually enjoy it and end up following a team / player or just the league. Of course it is also nice to reward existing OPL viewers, but you are right - there are better ways for us to reward current viewers.\n\nOnce again, we do really appreciate the thoughts, it gives us a valuable perspective and forces a discussion on our end.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSoul1994","date":"2018-06-23T04:19:01.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OPL viewership will only grow naturally. That starts with player development and infrastructure improvement (can't watch a stream if your internet is shit). People won't watch OPL if they're looking for quality gameplay (right now), especially when it's in the same time slot as LPL and LCK. You can't bait players into watching OPL with a skin thinking they'll suddenly find it entertaining.\n\nI was around in 2013 during the first season of NA LCS (which is basically where we're at right now). Viewers will care about players, then teams, then the overall strength of the league (specifically in that order) and it's only going to happen naturally as the region starts producing better players and/or players with a bigger presence in the community. I need to have a player I can rally behind. In the short term, this means building up player personalities. In the long term, this means having a higher volume of players with a level of skill worthy of a viewer's attention.\n\nYou can't buy viewers. For the time being, just stick to rewarding the ones you already have.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2018-07-03T00:11:45.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the thoughts DarkSoul and you are right, we do need players and teams to rally behind, and hopefully they're developing into that. I still do think its worth attempting to get the OPL in front of new viewers and running a skin giveaway was one way to raise that visibility, also to provide value to a sponsor who is helping us run the OPL in a more sustainable way.\n\nWe have seen a portion of the players who came to redeem the skin tune back into the OPL, so that's been good - but yeah who knows if that will last.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Plut8o","date":"2018-06-12T07:17:33.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't get my free battle boss brand skin, I only got the brand champion.
