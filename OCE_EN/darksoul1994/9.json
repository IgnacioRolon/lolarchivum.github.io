Essence Emporium 20/11) or start advertising it with the correct date for OCE region. I get that Riot Games is a big bloated company nowadays, but you have regional staff. It seems a bit impersonal to not have things like UK/Australian-English spelling in articles &amp; champion ability names/tooltips and correct dates for regions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-20T14:11:30.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you getting that date from?

Here's my screenshot from a week ago.\n\nBut also, every Champion/Skin sale has the wrong date. Things like 'Ionian Fervor' should be 'Fervour' in Australian/UK-English. PAJAMA is Pyjama in Australian/UK-English.\n\nIt's actually quite a long list.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-21T03:11:12.877+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yep, seems it was published without localisation. \n\nWhat's important to understand is there isn't a big team in OCE since not all that much (relatively speaking) actually goes on locally. They don't really bother with English localisation for things like 'fervour', 'honour' etc because frankly it doesn't really matter and really when you think about the time it would take, it wouldn't be worth hiring a whole person for, nor would the existing employees have enough spare time to spend on something so inconsequential. It's kind of annoying but doesn't really hinder anyone's experience. \n\nAs for the dates, I agree that there needs to be a stronger focus on localisation there, given that because of timezones our content almost always releases the date after most other regions. It used to be much better so I can only assume things are being shuffled around Riot side and it's getting a bit lost in the mix. We can only hope that will improve once things settle down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
