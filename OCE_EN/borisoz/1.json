However, if it does not end up updating after a reasonable amount of time, feel free to send a ticket to Riot Games Player Support:\n______________________________\nAs this is an account-specific inquiry, we can't assist you much further on the boards. You'll need to [submit a ticket to Riot Games Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) regarding your issue. A few tips as you submit your request: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Rioter request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue. \n2. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
