Or if there is a fix? Ever since patch 5.16 its been literally impossible to play. So frustrating because i just want to play a decent game instead of freezing and just dying all the time.\n\n Any help and info is very much appreciated! \n\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"awsumlad","date":"2015-08-31T02:15:40.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I too have been having lag spikes all of a sudden. Wasn't sure if it was just this patch or the last one as well but defiantly 5.16. I made a ticket and they just responded to me by saying run through the standard connection tests on their site.\n\nI was hoping for a comment from them as to if they are aware so many people are getting this happen to them. Almost everyone in all my games recently has been saying they are getting bad lag as well. They didn't mention that in the ticket though.\n\nAnyway I'm going to run all the tests this arv and see what comes of it and let you know.","replies":[]}]}
