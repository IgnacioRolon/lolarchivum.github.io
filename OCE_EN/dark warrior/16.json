Duoing artificially inflates MMR due to a \"possible advantage\" that duos have of using voice chat. \n\nAlso, I would advise against using sites like OP.GG to calculate MMR when you are trying to back up your \"my MMR is this and theirs is that\" arguments. MMR calculators are not accurate as Riot has not released the algorithm they use!
