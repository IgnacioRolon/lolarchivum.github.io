Do players leave their brains elsewhere and only think of winning and not focusing on the game? Just curious...","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-24T01:07:21.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's because people who are bad or new are now playing more and because people who are good are rushing smurfs and alternate accounts. This two current slipstream makes it harder to climb and artificially enhances the disparity between higher elo and lower elo, at least until the rush is over. It's hard to wrap your head around without having some knowledge of population statistics but think of it as taking a standard bell curve and slapping a huge whack on the upper and lower extremes of the population. Compared to simply just adding a bunch of the population evenly distributed, it would actually extend the extremes of each end to a much greater extent. In the end this means that it'll take more games to climb, especially once you hit that upper barrier around gold of smurf accounts rushing for high tier rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-25T03:19:50.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have noticed a lot more noobs in my games lately, not really smurfs though.

I kept playing thinking that \"this will end the streak\", but that never came. Even in my placements this season I went 2-8 and placed in B1.  \n\nIt sucked. I was so close to giving up ranked and blaming everyone but myself for what had happened. I took a step back from ranked and levelled up a new account and learned all I could about match-ups, synergies, creep manipulation, etc. When I started playing ranked again, I was playing in a 5man premade which was a really supportive environment. Eventually this tapered off to duo (which I found to be the best for me) which was still super great because I could have someone there to encourage me and keep me sane. The result was pretty apparent. I climbed from bronze to plat in a matter of months. I'm stuck in plat 2, but for me this is fine as I can redo my anti-tilt steps and hopefully get diamond next season :) \n\nIts a matter of stepping back and evaluating yourself and your skills (honestly). Take a lil break and learn what works for you and what doesn't. Then you can go back to climbing :D","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-09-22T09:59:03.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah I guess this is what I am doing in this account, currently lvl 18 :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-13T10:59:42.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just came on to play a few games.
