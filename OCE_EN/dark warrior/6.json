As for getting a leave penalty, you shouldn't, and I would recommend checking again now that it's had a bit of time to update. If the penalty is still there, contact support and they should be able to help you.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-03-28T15:10:19.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats the point of asking from Support? will they give me my LP back ? lmao no, i just mention this bug if anything happens again with someone they they will realise, there is absolutely 0% chance of me getting my LP back as we all knw how this RIOT COMPANY works","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-28T17:17:22.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if they even can give LP, but it let's them know there might be an issue. They can at least check it out, and if it was the result of something on their end, there may well be some compensation for you even if they can't give you LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-03-30T11:23:30.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't want to try it again and risk it, just to show the proof. I hope this thing happen to someone else so they can report a bug, it is rare case where your game about to start few seconds before 4am and this happen, so i guess it will take a while","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-30T11:52:36.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't have to try it again, if you have a record of the day the game was played (and provide a timezone with the 4am) then they should be able to find the record from the incomplete select on their end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
