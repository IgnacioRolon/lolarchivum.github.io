Little did i know he got it banned for verbal abuse so when i tried to get back on my own account i was massively shocked, Is there anything at all that can be done to get this lifted at all? i mean my account over the 5 years never got in trouble at all and the money i spent on this account now all wasted because of my siblings actions not even my own. I just want to see if anything can be done about this i mean tyler1 got several chances and i would just like one please and if my account is to be banned again i will take full responsibility for it even if it&#039;s not me.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-13T19:19:13.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why couldn't your sibling make their own account?\n\nBasically, this is your own fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-11-13T05:10:46.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just admitted to account sharing so thatâ€™s another reason for you to be perma banned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-13T04:08:28.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I took a massive break from league on this account and let my younger sibling play on it while i was busy with life matters. \n\nAnd that's where you fucked up, you can't share your account with anyone. Since you broke one of the rules that you agreed to when you made your account you are now held responsible. I wouldn't bother sending in a ticket since there's pretty much no chance you're getting it back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-13T03:12:02.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could try sending a support ticket. At the end of the day you allowed someone other then you to access your account so you are technically still responsible. Good luck hopefully support can help you out with a clear answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-13T03:27:54.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"support just sends premade messages, nothing clear about them, they are literally -------- (insert summoner name here) ---------. -------------, ---------- (insert summoner name here). --------- we are deeply sorry, yadda yadda, but (insert summoner name here) will not be having your account back yadda yadda.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-13T03:31:46.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fine. \nShy of OP getting lucky and having a rioter reply to this thread sending a support ticket is the only other option; as far as i understand.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LegitLogicGaming","date":"2017-11-13T03:13:37.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheer bud.","replies":[]}]}]}
