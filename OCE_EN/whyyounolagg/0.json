Why didn&#039;t I get placed higher? I&#039;ve seen that Riot added a new condition that places you in a rank lower than your last season&#039;s rank, but isn&#039;t Placement games suppose to help your early climb up the ladder, not hinder you? Seems unfair that players of higher skill should be placed in tier&#039;s for lower skilled players. (But don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;m not exactly &#039;Profession League Gamer&#039; material.)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-20T07:55:04.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Placement games and the soft reset are to determine whether or not you have maintained your skill level from last season. Vast majority of players get placed lower, that is nothing new, it has always been this way since I've been playing (Season 3/2013). 2 tiers of difference really isn't much, so if you belong in B3 (or even higher) you'll climb back up in no time.","replies":[]}]}
