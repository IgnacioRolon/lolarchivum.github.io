I was just wondering if it&#039;s possible that Nashors Tooth gets a buff as it&#039;s really punishing when a champion build that item. As a kayle main I realize that I get the powerspike when I build my second necessary item which is Guinsoo Rageblade. Unfortunately I cannot skip Nashors Tooth as I need the 20% CDR it gives. Compare to other laners where they can get serrated dirk, tiamat and zeal which gives them a early advantage as they can build it to a one item easily. I&#039;m aware that kayle is a item reliant champion and needs farm to scale well on late game but that&#039;s what im concern with as there may be games where you can&#039;t get your items when a game is finished within the 20 min mark. Again please make nashors tooth cost effecient not only for kayle but to other champions too who needs nashors tooth as first item like Diana then maybe we can see more games played with this champions.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-09-10T07:51:38.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a niche Item thats fine just needs a small buff on base and ap scaling bonus damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-09-10T06:45:30.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the first thing I think of when I hear nashors tooth buff are kayle and the return of onhit teemo mains who don't acknowledge lanes, they do what they want and becoming the most anticlimatic assassin. Imo the item that gets neglected more is wits end.","replies":[{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2017-09-10T06:50:02.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why I provided a new comment of ideas if you have a look what could the nashors tooth buff gets. At build 2 you will see that wits end and nashors tooth got combined.","replies":[{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2017-09-10T06:54:20.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By the way wit's end is also one of kayle's main items usually but get neglected at some time as it isn't cost efficient compare getting blade of the ruined king or guardian angel as last item. The core build of kayle is always nashors tooth > guinsoo rage blade >runanns hurricane.\n\nAs for teemo I don't mind him getting buffed if somehow this item got buffed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2017-09-10T06:45:26.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are one of the ideas I could propose for the item buff/rework change the recipe build which is shown below:\n\nBuild 1(Nashors Tooth Hextech Version): Stinger + Hextech Revolver | Added the passive UNIQUE – MAGIC BOLT\n\nBuild 2(Nashors Tooth + Wits End): Stinger + Negaton Cloak + Dagger | Added the passive UNIQUE: +40 bonus on-hit magic damage and UNIQUE: Basic attacks (on-hit) grant +5 magic resistance and reduce the target's magic resistance by 5 for 5 seconds. Stacks up to 5 times for a total of +25 bonus magic resistance and -25 magic resistance reduction.\n\nBuild 3 (Nashors Tooth + Lich Bane): Stinger + Sheen | Added the pasive UNIQUE – SPELLBLADE: After using an ability, your next basic attack (on-hit) deals 75% base AD (+ 50% AP) bonus magic damage (1.5 second cooldown).\n\nBuild 4 Trinity force for mages: Stinger+ Sheen + Hextech Revolver \n\nBuild 5(Nashors Tooth + Blade of the ruined king): Stinger + Bilgewater cutlass | Added the passive UNIQUE: Deals 100 magic damage and Slow icon slows the target enemy champion by 25% for 2 seconds (550 range) (90 second cooldown).\n\nThis may bring imbalance to the game but hey I'm just giving suggestion to make the item better so we can get powerspike at one item.","replies":[]}]}
