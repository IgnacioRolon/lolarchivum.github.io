I know that you guys are continue to improve this app and that&#039;s one of the checklist you could add. Many games are ported well to handheld devices so I&#039;m pretty sure that a certain software  could manage to spectate our friends to make it possible . Thanks for the app hope you listen to this request","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-06T22:18:10.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't tried the app yet but does it show status like match record KDA and stuff??","replies":[{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2016-03-08T06:37:17.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, it doesn't show anything yet hopefully they will add that system too","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-06T01:08:08.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nLeague is a rather graphically intense game, probably a _bit too_ much for most mobile devices to handle thus making spectating games on mobile pretty much impossible to accomplish.\n\nThe only way I could see this working out would be if a spectating system was implemented that allowed you to watch the game in browser, as a rendered video.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-06T07:39:16.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what he really means, but I'm guessing he meant to have the ingame-stats kinda thing, like telling you what champs you're facing and their stats, rank, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Nickers16","date":"2016-03-06T08:22:50.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well what i really mean is when you visit at certain sites like lolking or op.gg it lets you watch a live game of random people which I wanted to be ported in handheld devices for the lol friends app as when you do click the live game it doesn't work as the batch file need the actual lol client but I'm wishing that could improvise another method so we could watch our live game without needing the live client .
