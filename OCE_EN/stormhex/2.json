Probably every 30-60 seconds for approx 3 second duration. Its quite the gamebreaker for me sadly. I&#039;ve had my last straw with it now, so I need to fix it. Im with Telstra cable with 35mbps down and 1mbps up. Im connected to my router via a powerline unit as the wifi would be too weak. Im hoping its some kind of firewall problem I can fix and no just a bad ISP or connection because of the powerline unit. If anyone could help, that would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-10T04:10:29.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Telstra is not a backbone provider, so it *could* be them. But from what I've heard they've actually been pretty well-behaved when it comes to using the most efficient route to connect you.\n\nIn the massive majority of cases, using Wifi or not doesn't actually improve your speed at all because of how sophisticated the technology itself has become. It's almost always with something else.\n\nHave you tried turning off any and all automatic updates on your system, including third-party ones? Have you tried disabling your anti-virus and firewall while playing?","replies":[{"poster":"StormHex","date":"2015-05-11T23:55:41.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll have a look, but I doubt its automatic updates that would be causing it. Regarding AV and firewall, Im not sure if I have an AV (pretty safe with my browsing) and if there even is a firewall its probably the default windows 8 one. Would this be causing the problem and if so, how can I fix it? Would it be a problem with ports on the router? Getting pretty desperate to fix it now. I never lag in other online games, ie BF4.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-12T06:49:56.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Im not sure if I have an AV (pretty safe with my browsing)\n\nAV is mainly to prevent attacks, which you simply can't alter by not visiting certain sites. But do what you think is best; I'm just letting you know.\n\n>if there even is a firewall its probably the default windows 8 one.\n\nIf you didn't turn it off intentionally, Windows Firewall will be fully functioning. Try disabling it. You can do so by locating it in the Control Panel under Security and Maintenance.\n\n>Would it be a problem with ports on the router?\n\nIt might be. Have you recently checked your current configuration against the user manual? Have the technologies its supported changed since you got it?\n\n>I never lag in other online games, ie BF4.\n\nThat's all circumstantial. For instance, not all online games will connect you to a regional server to play. Some will even tell you to make your own server. Some connect you straight from client to client, no server. Among that there's many other things, so saying you can connect to other games fine doesn't really mean anything in this case.\n\nIf all else fails, try methodically going through [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues). If you need any help with that, just ask.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"StormHex","date":"2015-05-12T10:36:39.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know its to prevent attacks too, I really need to work on getting one sometime!

Sadly this is the only exception.
