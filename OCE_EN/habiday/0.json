Just because someone has a rank of, for arguments sake, Gold 5 it doesn't mean their MMR is at a Gold 5 level, or even in gold. If I'm not mistaken you have to have an MMR an entire division below your rank in order to get demoted which means you'd need an MMR matching Silver 5 to get demoted out of Gold 5.\n\nBased on OP.GG you're where you should be, if not a tier above. Seems your MMR is around 1300, which is what OP.GG calculated and seems is the average for games you've played. In fact a few days ago your MMR was sitting around 1100, which would probably put you at Bronze 1 level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanir","date":"2015-01-23T08:13:35.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I swear people don't understand that with the new system\nyour \"rank\" ie 10 in gold 5 annies captains or w/e\nis actually completely irrelevant because you have to fall so hard in mmr to actually lose a div \nIts pretty much\nOh im gold 5\nbut im losing alot sitting quite often on 0 points but to actually fall I pretty much have to be silver 5 mmr\nif you were sitting low or your mmr was low, you will be placed sigificantly lower than where you ended up before season 5 because you wernt actually there you were way lower mmr wise.\nThis is why you see plats in mid/low gold games (most of the time the higher elo you get the less likely this is actually an mmr problem and more a player supply problem esp on a smaller server like oce.) golds in low silver games etc. etc. etc.\n\nYour actual div/bracket is for bragging purposes only ( to an extent) when you get high up in a bracket ie div 1 to actually get there you have to gain alot of mmr, this is why you can start gaining very very little EVEN 0! now this can happen at any div but its the same principle; because the system is trying to fix ur mmr to be at a level where you should be to get promoted to the mmr number they set as the target for the next bracket ie (bronze>silver>gold>plat>dia>mas) \n\nalso this works the other way\nif your mmr is significantly higher than your bracket you can skip divs after promo games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-22T05:02:22.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Habiday,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=npTXOnPP,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-01-22T02:23:02.391+0000)\n\n> I have been into promos for gold.... but have had some devastating blows and a lot of afkers.... this rally really hurt me.... and then I had some bad games too late last year....\n\nYour MMR was way below what it should of been for your rank because of some \"misfortune\" from last season/preseason.
