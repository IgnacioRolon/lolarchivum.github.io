Runes.\r\nI figure spending IP on runes pre 20 is a waste of time and resources. Am I right in not spending any IP until level 20+?\r\n\r\n2. Jungling route. (Currently playing Master Yi)\r\nFrom the videos I have watched I am guessing runes play a pretty major part in early clear speed and survivability. I was hoping you guys could shed some light on how much of the jungle I should be able to realistically get through before I need to recall and heal up. At the moment I can get through red or blue buff and toad or grugs(or whatever they&#039;re called) before being really close to death. \r\nI go the standard Q&gt;E&gt;W skill route. I see a lot of youtubers not using E when clearing jungle? Is it more beneficial to not use E and keep the passive?\r\n\r\nAny help on these issues is massively appreciated and will go a long way to making sure I am no scrub :)","replies":[{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-20T20:19:40.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try to clear three camps blue or red side, then recall and buy the second jungle starter item. Then you'll have enough damage and sustain to farm effectively for the rest of lane phase.\n\nALSO...\n\nI wouldnt concern yourself with performance so much bro. It's not like anyone is keeping track =D\n\nBeing too competitive while new might ruin the game for you!\n\nYou say you're enjoying yi jungle and it fits your playstyle, but that may change over the next 100-200 games when your aware of and have access to more possibilities. I recommend that you start thinking competitively - champ pool, rune pages, mastery preferences, tactics - at level 30.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-20T20:09:53.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, if you haven't got enough ip for a full rune page, you'll at least need 9 armour seals and some atkspeed marks, the rest of your runes can come later since they help more on clear speed and dueling other champions rather than healthy clearing. \n\nSecondly, if you haven't gotten full runes, start with hunters machete and 3 health pots and with your first clear either get a leash for raptors (alot of higher elo players are starting raptors without smite and then smiting the buff for a faster start in the jungle). Then you'll want to take both your buffs and wolves and gromp. \n\nThirdly when leashing the big buffs try to juggle the camps attacks between you and your leashers by running back and forth so the camp can't get off the full attack animation. Alot of middle elo supports will understand how to do this and will do this as long as you don't just stand still and take the camps attacks to the face. If done right you should be able to clear the camp at almost the same speed and not take any damage, making the rest of your clear just a little bit easier.\n\nToggling your e as yi when clearing is also for a temporary boost to clearspeed but I generally wouldn't recommend using it until you get good at reading the map, since you'll want to have as many cooldowns as possible when counterganking, ganking and invading and unless you can perfectly read the map, you probably won't have a good idea when you will and won't need it, although you can use if you are going to be backing soon after clearing that camp since the 10% bonus ad when the ability is on cooldown will be back by the time you get back into your jungle.\n\nOther Yi tips is that your alpha strike should be saved until the enemy uses a cc ability and then used to dodge it and your w can be used to quickly reset your auto attack by pressing w and then imediately issuing a movecommmand and then autoing, alternatively w and then use attack move. Also in teamfights activate your ult liberally since you'll probably get an assist.\n\nIn terms of itemisation you'll want your obvious items like blood razor (but warrior if you need to put more pressure out against an early game jungler like shaco or leesin though you generally don't want to fight these guys early on anyway because few champions can fight them early), Blade of the Ruined King (this item is great for dueling and has a slow which really helps you stick to a target), Edge of Night (because you'll need a spellshield and this item has better offensive potential than a banshees), Ghostblade (for chasing), ect... but if you aren't confident or aren't doing so well other options like Deadmans against AD assassins, Frozen Mallet if you need some balanced tank stats and you're getting blown up too fast to permit a BoRK, Blackcleaver against bruisers and Ravenous Hydra+Static Shiv if you need to splitpush fast.\n\nGenerally you'll want at least 1 tankier option and maybe a Guardian Angel if you're snowballing but if you are falling behind try adding in a few tank items, Just be careful in taking too many of the tankier options since yi isn't really a tank and you'll find yourself falling off pretty hard if you have more than 2 tank items.\n\nRed Smite is good for dueling and killing people, Blue Smite helps you stick to people and run away. I wouldn't suggest green jungle trinket on yi since Yi is more about fighting and killing champions than map control and utility.\n\nI don't really play yi so you generally want to try watching some higher elo Yi players on how to build and itemise (that said you should always build a little more defensively than most pro players) but I hope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
