While my password is still the same, the recovery email address has changed, I have a bunch of matches in history I&#039;ve never played, and I have rune pages titled in Chinese (I&#039;m Australian with no Chinese language knowledge). I try to login and it still says I&#039;m in a game and to reconnect. \r\n\r\nSo I naturally try to submit a ticket to recover my account. The Riotgames support website doesn&#039;t work correctly. Any link that says &quot;submit a ticket&quot; or &quot;make a request&quot; comes up with a blank body. The footer with the Riot games links, and the headers with the Submenu options work, but absolutely no body, and no way to actually submit any ticket to recover my account?\r\n\r\nLinks tried include - \r\n\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\r\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=38154\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried in Safari using IOS, Firefox and Microsoft Edge in Windows 10, the webpage for submitting a ticket to fix up my account doesn&#039;t function correctly.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to change the password to my account, using my correct email address. But the mechanism to event attempt to request this simply doesn&#039;t work?\r\n\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-18T12:03:48.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So those pages are always a little slow to load, but they shouldn't be not loading at all. Is there another computer and/or connection you could try on?\n\nIt's also worth noting that the ticket category you want is Account Recovery, which requires you to be logged OUT of support, but it sounds like you aren't even getting that far.\n\nAlternatively there is an email you can send a ticket directly (support@riotgames.com) to rather than going through the portal (though they are much slower to process), or you can message them on twitter if you have that: https://twitter.com/riotsupport?lang=en","replies":[{"poster":"Lansharra","date":"2018-10-19T06:49:27.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a follow up - the webpage worked once i downloaded and installed Chrome, and used Chrome to navigate the webpage.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous that it works in one web browser and not others, but that was the way i managed to navigate the ticket request.\n\nPosting so anyone else that has issues at least knows one (absolutely stupid that it comes to this) work-around.","replies":[]}]}]}
