If I attempt to stop accessing Hextech crafting and go somewhere else I am unable to, and once I&#039;ve attempted to access Hextech crafting (and been told it&#039;s unable to access it) I am unable to join games/queues, or access anything, and have to completely close down my client and relog in. \r\n\r\nHowever, as long as I don&#039;t attempt to go to the Hextech Crafting menu, I am 100% fine. Able to shop, make summoner changes, play all games. But Hextech Crafting is completely inaccessible, and has been for quite some time.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve read through the FAQ&#039;s and stickied discussions and nothing in those gives me any overview about if this is an ongoing problem, or any potential solutions to this issue. I&#039;d really appreciate some assistance.","replies":[{"poster":"Latias","date":"2017-05-19T14:40:39.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have more than enough chests and key frags, but when I try to forge a key or open a chest, nothing happens.

Yes I know it's an additional thing recently added for free, but it's a bit silly then getting a pop up saying \"you've got a chest or key fragment earned\" and that part of the game is completely inaccessible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2016-05-01T04:41:05.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same issue! I was about to post something about this. Sometimes I am able to have the screen load up, but the other day when I tried to craft my 10 key fragments into keys, it would show the crafting animation, and then get stuck there. At the same time I would the get status message \"You have been disconnected from PvP.net\". After many tries and not trying to rush through the key animation and letting the whole animation run, I was able to forge my keys. However I am still getting client disconnection problems whenever I access Hextech Crafting and try to do something with it. Also when I try to restart client, on first or second login tries I can't login, I have to restart the client multiple times to log in successfully after getting dc'd from Hextech Crafting.\n\nAlso when Hextech Crafting first came out, everything was fine, it was only until more recently it started acting up.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[]}]}
