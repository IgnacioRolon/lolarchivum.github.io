His kit does have a lot of power, but it's held back by the fact that he doesn't have immediate access to his separate forms, hence the restrictions of his rage meter. His power spikes are very widespread all over the place, and he seems like a hard to play and hard to master champion. Nevertheless when put in the right hands his power can be devastating. I don't think he deserves a full frontal rework/nerf, like say, I don't know, TRYNDAMERE, but he is definitely strong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-28T07:10:34.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He had some changes in the latest patch.

He needs to be gutted to %%%%, reworked, or removed.\njust because he had some recent changes doesn't mean he doesn't need more.\nHe's like ryze top but worse because he gets his tanky stats for free, and he only needs 1 damage item instead of 2.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-28T12:56:38.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You misunderstand haha.
