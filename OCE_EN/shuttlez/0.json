So after a while of thinking, here is what I've got.\n\nP.S, if you are a Riot employee, please consider showing this to the champion design team, I would LOVE it if this was in-game and I would main it hard.\n\nName: Vuur. Alias: The Rabbit Of Fire. Role: assassin. Damage type: magic. Difficulty: 2. Damage: 3. Defence: 2. Crowd control: 2. Mobility: 3. Utility: 1.\n\nBase Stats: Health: 570 (83 per lvl)\nMana: 399 (75 per lvl)\nAD: 59 (2.3 per lvl)\nAttack speed: 0.683 (3.5% per lvl) \nAP: 0 (0 per lvl)\nArmour: 31 (2.1 per lvl)\nMagic Resist: 31 (1.3 per lvl)\nMovement speed: 345 (0 per lvl)\nRange: 150 (0 per lvl)\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive: Explosive flame. \nVuur's basic attacks deal 5/10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50 (based on lvl) (+ 10% AP) bonus on-hit magic damage, and burn the target for 4 seconds, dealing 4/10/14/16/20/15/21/29/37/50 (based on lvl) (+ 5% AP) per second. The timer can stack up to 5 times.\n\nWhenever Vuur basic attacks, all enemies within 550 units of his target have on hit effects applied to them.\n\nAt lvl 10, Vuur's range is increased to 525.\n\nQ: Infernal Dash\nCost: 60/65/70/75/80 mana\nRange: 1070\nCooldown: 12/11/10/9/8\n\nVuur throws a fireball that deals 60/90/120/150/180 (+ 40% AP) magic damage, leaving a marker at the end of the ability. If recast within 1.75 seconds, he teleports to the marker, dealing 40/60/80/100/120 (+ 35% AP) magic damage in an area, he also gains 20/30/40/50/60% attack speed for 7 seconds\n\nW: Infernal Rupture\nCost: 80/90/100/105/110 mana\nRange: 1100\nCooldown: 15/13/12/10/8\n\nVuur summons fire in an area, dealing 80/120/130/160/200 (+ 55% AP) magic damage, and slowing enemies by 50% for 1.5 seconds. All enemies who have any burn stacks on them are stunned instead. Monsters hit take 25% bonus magic damage.\n\nE: Outta the way, they're MINE.\nCost: 100 mana\nRange: 1550\nCooldown: 20/17/15/12/9\n\nVuur thrusts his sword, dealing 70/80/90/120/140 (+ 55% AP) magic damage, knocking enemies aside who are within 1300 units of him, reducing their armour by 20% AP and their magic resist by 10% AP for 3 seconds, and slowing them by 25% for 5 seconds. He roots the first enemy champion hit within 1301 and 1550 units of him for 1.5 seconds and dashes to them. However, if there are no enemy champions within 1301 and 1550 units of him, he dashes to the first enemy hit within the whole range.\n\nR:  Fireball of absolute magnitude and destruction\nCost: 100 mana\nRange: 8000\nCooldown: 120/100/80\n\nVuur summons a massive fireball in the sky, after a 0.75 second delay, he sends it crashing down, dealing 200/300/400 (+ 60% AP), if recast within 2 seconds, he teleports to the center of the impact zone, gaining 20/30/40% bonus movement and attack speed, 10/30/50 bonus magic resist and 20/35/50 bonus armour for 10 seconds.\n\nThanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Acinicus","date":"2019-10-01T15:26:33.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Itâ€™s called eve among a few others that are ap not to mention you can build ap on other junglers like Malph and Amumu and then you have an ap jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuttlez","date":"2019-10-02T06:08:27.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-09-22T09:37:08.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks broken, thats way overtuned, halve the AP ratios and damage on all abilities, remove range increase on passive and halve fireball range, and remove TP aspect altogether\n\nAlso, if you want an AP assassin jg, we have Diana, Ekko, Fizz and Eve, so we don't need another AP Assassin jg","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-23T00:48:54.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=0e7UnTkW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-09-22T09:37:08.568+0000)\n>\n> Looks broken, thats way overtuned, halve the AP ratios and damage on all abilities, remove range increase on passive and halve fireball range, and remove TP aspect altogether\n> \n> Also, if you want an AP assassin jg, we have Diana, Ekko, Fizz and Eve, so we don't need another AP Assassin jg\n\nHow is that different every champion ever released by riot lol? Also, (I'm assuming) this is one person who has put the time and effort into creating this champs basic stats and not a whole team of professionals like riot has. I would be inclined to be impressed by his effort rather than critical.","replies":[{"poster":"Shuttlez","date":"2019-09-23T03:41:28.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I appreciate having someone who likes my idea, I will need to modify those ap ratios, cause they are a bit high, and I am one person.

Obviously it does need work but to put this together from scratch is pretty good effort. The champ itself seems not bad in it's own right but if its relevant for where game is currently at and needing another ap jg I'm not so sure. Still, well done. \n\nP.S. what is Vuurs passive?","replies":[{"poster":"Shuttlez","date":"2019-09-23T07:10:25.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, when he auto attacks, (to put it simply) all enemies in a small area get on-hit effects applied to them such as: {{item:3091}} Wit's End passive, {{item:3115}} Nashor's Tooth passive, and, of course, his passive's burn effect.
