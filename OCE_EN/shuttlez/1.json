A lot of people said that his kit was \"over tuned\" and it \"didn't work at all\", to put it simply. So, I remade him as a burst assassin, who deals more damage the closer his enemies are to him.\n\nBase stats:\nHP: 540 (94 per lvl)\nMana: 420 (67 per lvl)\nAD: 58 (2.7 per lvl)\nArmour: 26 (3.7 per lvl)\nMR: 30 (0.7 per lvl)\nAttack Speed: 0.681 (3.1% per lvl)\nMovement Speed: 340\nHP Regen: 7 (0.5 per lvl)\nMana regen: 5 (0.7 per lvl)\nRange: 125\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive: Infernal Katanas\n\nVuur's basic attacks deal 10/20/40/50 (+10%AP) bonus magic damage, and burns them, dealing 10/20/30/40 (+10%AP) magic damage over 3 seconds. The burn cannot be applied to the same target for 6 seconds. Vuur heals for 50% of the magic damage he deals with his basic attacks.\n\nQ: Disintegrating Flame\n\nMana: 50/60/70/80/90\nRange: 900\nCooldown: 11/10/9/8/6\n\nVuur hurls a fireball in a direction, dealing 70/90/130/170/240 (+65%AP) to 30/50/70/90/110 (+30%AP) based on how for it traveled, dealing less damage the further it travels, to the first enemy hit.\nBlade Rush resets this ability's cooldown.\n\nW: Burning Blade Spin\n\nMana: 60/70/80/90/100\nRange: 300\nCooldown: 15/13/11/9/7\n\nPassive: Vuur gains 10/20/30/40/50% bonus permanent attack speed\n\nActive: Vuur spins his katanas in circle around him, dealing 60/80/120/160/220 (+60%AP) magic damage to all enemies hit, and slows them for 30/35/40/45/50%. Enemies hit on the very edge take 25% reduced damage\n\nE: Blade Rush\n\nMana: 40/50/60/70/80\nRange: 700\nCooldown: 14/12/10/8/7\n\nPassive: Vuur's damaging abilities apply \"high burn\" to all enemies damaged, for 2.5 seconds.\n\nActive: Vuur dashes quickly to an enemy affected by \"High Burn\", dealing 50/75/110/150/170 (+55%AP) in a small area around the target.\nVuur cannot dash to an enemy not affected by \"High Burn\".\n\nR: Back line assault\n\nMana: 100\nRange: 1150\nCooldown: 160/140/100\n\nVuur becomes unstoppable as he charges in a direction, dealing 100/250/330 (+75%AP) magic damage to all enemies hit on the way. enemies in the center of the ability hit by Vuur as he charges are dragged with Vuur as he charges, stunning them for 1.75 seconds at the end. Enemies caught on the sides of the dash are knocked to the side when Vuur hits them. Neither of these effects affect the damage dealt by this ability.","replies":[]}
