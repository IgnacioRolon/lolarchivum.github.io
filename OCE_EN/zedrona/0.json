I&#039;m not sure if the click and drag to selection has been implemented yet, but the response is very slow compared to the current client.\r\n\r\nSecond, in the pick/ban phase, if players are very quick regarding their ban or lock in, no animation or sound is played, which can leave it a little ambiguous. I don&#039;t have a capture device to actually film this, but if someone out there can do it, please chuck it into the replies.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n\r\nZedrona","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-10-15T03:47:14.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Zedrona,\n\nThat's great feedback!
