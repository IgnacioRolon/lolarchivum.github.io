I need to improve i just dont know where, can anyone help?","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T11:12:44.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm bronze 5 as well, so don't take my advice heavily, as it's probably incorrect xD\n\nI think while Kennen can carry, he cant really hard carry. Yeah, he can do tons of dmg when ahead, but he can't really get in their backline and 1v3 the enemy's squishies. That's just an example, but in general find a champion that when ahead can literally solo carry a team of feeders.\n\nPersonally, I main Nasus and I feel like because I'm experienced with him, I can easily solo carry a \"not so good team\" cough cough feeders cough. He, in my opinion, is a hard carry because he has such good damage late game whilst not having to build any damage items.\n\nOf course I could be completely wrong. You could be a Kennen God, who will one day overtake Faker as SKT's mid laner, but your just getting terrible teams. I know that feeling by the way, I too feel like I deserve more than Bronze 5, it's just I get let down sometimes by teammates who just love dieing! Also, something I have learnt is that it's perfectly fine to blame a team or teammate for a loss in ranked, just don't become toxic, because then you will tilt and play worse in future games.\n\nBest of luck with getting out of bronze man, hope I helped :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-06T00:10:46.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel nasus is not really a hard carry since he hasn't got much early pressure and if the enemy team has a teemo, darius, vayne, zilean, ect. they don't have to be good to shut you down before you can do anything. Try pantheon if you want to hard carry, since he has alot of map pressure and he's really good at ending the game pre20min. Riven and Fiora are also hard carry if you can play them properly. I can't because I'm bronze 5 and I have the mechanical skill of a potato but these are statistically the best hard carry toplaners and are the preferred choices of boosters.","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-06T20:02:37.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main mid not top, mid to s far better for carrying as easy roam top or bott","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-06T20:03:17.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Plus i hate tanks by the time its late game generally my team has fed the enemy too much for me go be useful","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-07T01:13:33.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was just saying pantheon since he mentioned a top laner.

I'll try and give you some general tips though. \n\n* Champion counter picks aren't as important as people think they are. Knowing your champion is so much better than picking a counter pick. \n* Play a small pool of champions. Get to know 2-3 champions in the 2 roles you're queuing for. [Feasibly 2 champions in your primary and 1 in your secondary]. \n* Never criticise your teammates. I know you probably hear this one a lot, but it makes a huge difference. Comebacks from behind when people on your team are raging are so small. If your team works together? So easy. \n\nIt appears that your winrate and KDA on Kennen are solid- which tells me you know him really well. I'd recommend just solo grinding him in all your games [It seems like the other champions you play are what is bringing you down].\n\nHope that somewhat helps!","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-06T20:11:59.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i know what you mean, but i have a 2nd account that is silver 4 i play on which isnt too bad, but for some reason climbing out of bronze 5 is hard, which makes no sense to me like i can win lane easy just carrying my team is hard, i can roam and get objectives but its no good when people solo or feed to no end dont farm or ward or communicate etc etc (not saying im perfect, nor blaming them for my losses but they certainly make it harder) \nAt the start of games i mute everyone to save the hassle of toxic people, \nYeah as i said the champions i previously played where when i was probably at a b5 standard as i had little game knowledge and experience, kennen is basically the start of me trying ranked again as i got dis heartened by being b5 but i see why i was b5 \nThank you for advice i didnt know counter picks didnt matter, although it is b5 :') \nBut i generally just go kennen mid as no one bans him unless troll on my team and bans them other than that i just use him to climb out of bronze","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2016-08-05T16:17:18.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you can knock down top tower quick have good cs roam mid and take tower. prioritize the objectives as this is what will put your team ahead and its important that you never surrender","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-06T20:04:18.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main mid not top, but yeah i do roam and take objectives problem is most the time the enemy gets a much great gold lead from other lanes not always but some times","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-08-05T09:01:48.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ill take a look at your games and get back to you.","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-05T09:36:23.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you,","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-08-05T08:35:36.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh also before you get the wring idea, i dont play ranked to win 1v5 i try to help my team out, i want to be more valuable to my team as some game i feel im not helping them enough so we loose :/ maybe im just to full of my self im not really sure hence why im here","replies":[]}]}
