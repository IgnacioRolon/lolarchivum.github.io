Other than that, your cs seems pretty good, maybe a little improvement but not much at all, and i recommend that you play champions that scale well, and work on your mid to late game, as people around your level don't have bad laning (mostly), but bad mid to late game. Just a few general tips. Have fun on the Rift!","replies":[{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2018-04-14T01:44:18.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good point, i guess the climb is gonna be tilting either way then, \nazir does scale well? yeah unsure how to improve my mid to late game shall try to work on it, i do find i play better mid to late than early but that is most likely because im playing azir and well thats pretty much where azir becomes alive, i find im getting around 2 items at 21min plus boots average but if i dont get that its pretty much a loss, ive found they do have bad laning, but so do i so its kinda even, just no one understands how to play to there team compositions, its always group and fight.... no matter if the enemy team is 6k gold ahead just group n fight lose repeat \ni guess ill try stick to fizz and ahri in ranked then cheers for tips","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-04-14T04:37:42.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man have fun, jsut remember fizz and ahri get banned so much you'll be destroyed ahaha.
