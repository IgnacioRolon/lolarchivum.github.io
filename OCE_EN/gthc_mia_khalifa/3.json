XD \r\nSo i played ranked thinking itd help me, instead it made me angry and frustrated due to the way people treat you for trying, so played norms i decided to try and climb out of bronze around August this season, since then i have had a 64% win rate with kennen and i think my azir is back down to 50% atm anyway i have gotten to b4 3 times now then i get demoted i get to my promo games in b5 via a win streak, then start b4 and end up winning one then loosing a few times getting demoted to b4 again etc etc, now my issue? Is my feeding teams!.... Just kidding although it really doesnt help lets be honest. \r\n\r\nI am my biggest issue, but idk how to improve! I have read guides turorials watched ranked games and still i dont know how to carry bronze 5, 4 \r\nI unfortunately much prefer mechanicaly intense champs, i find them more fun which set me back skill wise as i probably focus too much on champion mechanics rather than game mechanics, but i still do well ( generally speaking ) winning lane isnt my problem, its when i get a dbl kill on my mid laner and there jg and i ping my jgler to help me take drag coz free drag why not? Then jgler ignores me and keeps farming jg.... Not that his warding his jg or deep warding just farming... So no drag for team. \r\nMost games i find 1 of my lanes win ( generally mine ) and the others loose.. Hard so i try to help but by 5minutes top laner has 2 kills and more cs due to having empty lane twice. Or i help bott who are feeding also or maybe jgler is feeding coz lee thinks his insect and thinks diving adc and supp under there tower and warding jumping out is a good idea until supp cc the fuck outta him and lee simply all chats &#039; bott lane no help gg &#039; \r\nSo i usually end up further behind than the enemy team either due to having to lane passively till mid game while enemy adc is already 10-0 etc \r\nSo i try to tell team to play safe but they don&#039;t understand that means stand behind caster minions if enemy come close dont stand there walk back, dont extend further than mid lane if you are behind. But no one listens to me when i try to help, i dont flame the first 3 times i ask or advise them XD but them it gets frustrating, they just reply with &#039; stfu you are b5&#039; \r\nI try to get objectives when we can like if bott has backed and my mid laner has gone to gank top, ill ask bott to help with drag ( ill warn top of the incoming gank ofc, i dont follow coz top has given 3kills and has no kills himself so is worth little gold, idk if thats worth but to me makes sense to go for drag as id usually be ahead of my mid laner) \r\nBut no one helps with drag, they very rarely help, and if they get a dbl kill they farm and back or just back they dont get free poke to tower or get free drag. \r\nWarding is ofc very poor in bronze like seriously i place a pink in river near mid and itll last 5-10minutes after mid and jg walk past it! Its funny asf. \r\nBut its bad no one communicates where jgler is, or what there lane if there lane is mia. \r\nI have no idea what im meant to do when bott lane feeds and looses tower at 15min so they come mid and take my cs and die in my lane, THIS IS WHERE I FUCK UP!!! I die to the fed asf adc who is drooling at the free gold they will get when she kills my 3-0 ass (general examples btw just based on games i have endured) so do i stay mid and let my self get further behind? Xp and gold wise due to 3 ppl mid? Or do i farm bott lane and let enemy fuck my bott laners and loose tower? Not worth to me idk what to do :/ coz top is pushing bott has pushed mid is currently 3v3 and im not longer the fed one in lane so what do i do? I have no idea i try to stall game, but team positioning is so retarded like the adc stands in front of the tank out of turret while getting smashed by enemy poke -.- i swear no one picks tanks on my team or picks based on team comp not that you have to in bronze i guess i mean i can jg thresh and carry norms games haha \r\nAnyway, so bronze never listens, always want to group mid and push even when its 10teamkills to 30, or we have got both mid towers they still want to push mid even tho both outer lanes have both turrets up while we have lost 4 or 5 by then so our one pushed lane verses there 3 pushed lanes -.- i am unsure what i should do? Split push? Even though i dont play split pushing champs? Team fight and let them get ace coz we aint gonna beat there fed tank and adc and supp or like just farm lanes? Btw my\r\nCs is average my laning is probably poor tbh like i cant mid lane well on my s4 account but in b5 b4 i will win lane 95% of the time i only loose due to the fact in bronze late game is apparently 15-25minutes there is no mid game getting objectives... There is no early game csing, and late game is just so random like no logical thinking or decision making example we lost bott inhib out top tower is at qtr health and there is 3 waves pushing the tower what does my team do? When bott lane is open inhib and pushing and top tower is almost lost? They go contest baron 4v5 after i tell them no so many times and tell them to defend because we cannot beat the 20-4-7 illoais and her fed team because we are 3 drags behind and many kills lower, but hey i get told idk how to comeback from a loosing game (which is true, but i know that they where going about it completely wrong!) anyway enemy team got a nice 4 kills with a lovely baron on top i cant exactly hold off a fed team 1v4 which seems to always happen to me... \r\nThen they say &#039;azir wtf are you doing help team!?!? Boosted&#039; and blame me for lost team fight... When i stand at back line and poke adc and apc and peeled with ult but stood back so i was out of enemy range -.- then they say why not engage azir? As if im meant to have flashed into there auto range to fight them... \r\nSo with this being the style or general scenario of how my games go, how do i carry? What do i do? Im im behind due to not hiting power spike should still roam? Should i just farm till mid game then help team? Do i stay with them while they run around like headless chooks missing all the cs they come by coz who needs gold from that free wave down bott thats pushed at tower? \r\nIdk i feel like to carry bronze 4 i gotta be gold 4. \r\nI want to try and get better but playing in low elo constantly just isnt helping me improve and i dont know what to do like i screwed my mmr over so much i checked op.gg for a reference to my mmr i dropped it to 890mmr :&#039;) hahaha i got it too about 930mmr now but i just get a win streak get to promos then loose a few then bam dropped tier. \r\nLike how do i stop a fed team from pushing please help, im not good at league been playing a year with 900wins now in norms and am ready to climb! But its so tilting when you do so well but fall behind because no cooperation or coodernation or very poor team comp etc\r\nMy cs per game average is \r\n50-70cs 10min depending on lane match up\r\n100-180cs 20min depending on lane match up (some big gap i know but many variables, but always manage to get 100cs atleast) \r\n200-350cs 30min i will sometimes fall off on cs late game due to pushing, or helping teamfights as in bronze its all about them team fights.... \r\n\r\nIf i am wrong on anything i have said please let me know, I honestly want to improve and learn how to carry these games as they are nothing like higher elos \r\nAnd now im scared soft reset for s7 will just put me in bronze again which will again make me angry for a mistake i made when i first started at end of s5","replies":[{"poster":"deamon2","date":"2016-10-07T06:53:12.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK, so I'm not the BEST person to get advice to people since I'm just silver V ATM, But I considering myself as a experienced player (at least in bronze ) cous I played hundreds of games in bronze due fact that I wouldn't take it seriously, we have some similarities, starting ranks in season 4 was EXACTLY SAME to me (BTW I'm main jungle/top, and some time ADC as well, so we... Maybe don't have similarities?...But  I know how you feeling.... I understand... K just let move on )\nSo enough about me, these things helped me A LOT to scape from bronze, hopefully will help you too.\n\n1- Pick a carry champion with good mobility , like lb, ahri, Kata and room, gank othere lanes too. They're Bot lane is 3/0? Room as soon as you got you're 6 make that 3/1. If you're gank weren't successful and 3/0 became 4/0 leave that lane, gank the other lane , if that wasn't successful eather then stay in you're lane\n\n2-KS ... Yes you read it correctly!!! ...  Ks! Only when you know that you can Carry  them, you MUST carry them cous they are so stupid to carry themselves. CREATE A MONSTER FROM YOU'RE SELF remember: \"monster can be made to fear\" Unleash THE MONSTER!!! XD\n\n3- calling for dragon or baron is you're jungler job, never start them without jungler!!!... Oh and Ward around them when u taking dragon/baron \n\n4- you have to choose! Going up in rank ladder OR having fun! If you the first one then pick easy champs like Annie who both has stun and dmg! (aka noob champs) play with them until you come out from bronze\n\n5- creat a champion pool for yourself, for each role pick 5champs (10 champ at least )and have at least two easy to play champ (for example mine for jungle is: Amumu,gragas,vi , rengar, voli and for adc is jinx, Lucian ,kalista, tristana,jhin )\n\n6- most important thing: this is a team game! So create you're own team: gather some friends in real life (or in game, doesn't really matter) and due with them, you will climb MUCH faster (until new season comes out and rito bring back soloque again)\n\n7-use pings a lot, some people might mute you in chat,but can't mute your pings! Specially when you want to make plays.\n\n8-always look at minimap and Ward around your lane, Ward objectives like baron and dragon, although this is junglers job IMO but if no one doing it, then you should do it.\nAnd a tip to learn from your mistakes: there is a reason for each time you will die, try to find that reason by asking yourself: why?\n\nThat was it! Be victorious summoner!!! XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"GTHC Mia Khalifa","date":"2016-10-06T00:40:34.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wouldnt that just be me letting you carry me?
