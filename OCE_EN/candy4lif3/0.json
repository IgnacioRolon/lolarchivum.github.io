You are not alone!!!!!!!!!!     Riot does not punish death threats.............  NOR ANYTHING ELSE EITHER!!!!!!!!    It's no big deal.   Just ask them.     They don't give a fuck.    I've been reporting the same afk / troll players in Arams for the past four years and yet they continue playing... what more proof do we need that riot doesn't give a flying fuck about any poor behaviours!    They have an 'automated' reporting system that 'punishes' 1 player out of every 50,000,   the rest are free to say and do as they fucking well please.  The sooner you realise this the better you will feel and the less stress (possibly) you will experience as you soon become numb to the constant trolls/afks/ abuse/etc etc that inhabit this game,   and as you begin to realise that it's continually the same group of players that do this week after week without any consequences and then you will understand what a complete joke the riot reporting system actually is.     Just mute every player in every game you play in and that will make you almost oblivious to all the fuckwits in Lol (except the continual afkers who inhabit 80% of games)   GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!,  You'll need it.    If all else fails go find an online game where the developers actually care about their players enjoyment and take action against the fuckwits who constantly  spoil others' fun.    \nHINT   -   it isn't riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-11-24T20:06:11.474+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"indie company btw","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-07T07:31:16.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This game doesn't punish death threats\n\n_Has recieved 2 perma's for saying kys_\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}\n\nI don't know what world you're living on, but the ones riot let's go are the ones that are trolls, not the ones who say a single bad word, or combination of letters","replies":[]},{"poster":"XD haha","date":"2018-12-05T15:18:50.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see an image","replies":[{"poster":"Candy4lif3","date":"2018-12-07T07:12:22.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=XD haha,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=cdHGcdki,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-12-05T15:18:50.216+0000)\n>\n> I don&#x27;t see an image\n\nriot deleted it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"datguyonline","date":"2018-11-30T23:41:27.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its preseason haha what is meta?!?!?!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-25T08:22:06.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gone ahead and removed the link from you post.
