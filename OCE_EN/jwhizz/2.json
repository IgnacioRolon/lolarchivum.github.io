My plan was to convert extra tokens (I had about 400-500) into key fragments which were 15 tokens each. I had them in my loot and went to convert them all today and in the latest patch it seems Riot have removed them from the game entirely, so the money I spent on the pass to get extra tokens has gone to waste. As you can imagine I&#039;m not happy that I could have had an odd 10 full keys or so..\n\nBecause of this I'm going to be very hesitant in buying any future passes. I think they need to implement some kind of announcement that comes up saying the loot's going to disappear and ask if you'd like to convert it into something before it goes away.\n\nI just hovered over my nexus blitz tokens and I can see it says there's an expiry date and yea yea it's probably my fault for not checking and assuming they wouldn't  just magically disappear but I spent a considerable amount of money on the pass just to have it for nothing..\n\nNot.
