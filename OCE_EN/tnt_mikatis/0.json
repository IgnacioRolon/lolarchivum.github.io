Prior to my &quot;departure&quot; I climbed from bronze 4 to gold 3 as a support main playing {{champion:267}} and {{champion:40}} with {{champion:90}} and {{champion:55}} being thrown in for good measure. I was unable to play ADC then and I am unable to now also, largely due to the fact I am very passive and can not kite to save my life. I am heavily reliant on the support and my average farm is 50 within the first 10 minutes (I aim for 100 within 20) I also can not seem to grasp how to play assassins and I am wondering - how do I improve? Support is always my fall back option and my goal this season is to hit plat, however I feel like being a support main won&#039;t get me there. I find the role safe as the mentioned champions and can easily play {{champion:89}} or {{champion:201}} need be. I want to be able to get out of my comfort zone and play new lanes (currently I am playing more jungle than usual and {{champion:111}} top which is interesting) I have used the practice tool but due to the fact you don&#039;t actually face anyone I don&#039;t find it helpful (sorry Riot). Is there anyone who would be able to play with me and/or advise me where I am going wrong or how to play specific champs? I really need to learn  top laners as well as learn how to play or outplay them ({{champion:92}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:122}}  mostly) as I feel the prementioned 4 have a high ban/outplay rate and I would love to be able to play them. How do I get better in general? I know when to go in and when not too etc (so essentially the basics) but I feel like I lack the ability to carry games outside of my comfort zone.\r\n\r\nThe following champs are ones I would like to learn to play (as well as the 4 top laners)\r\n1. {{champion:238}} \r\n2. {{champion:67}} \r\n3. {{champion:119}} \r\n4. {{champion:245}} \r\n5. {{champion:142}}\r\n6. {{champion:6}}\r\n7. {{champion:145}} \r\n8. {{champion:164}} \r\n9. {{champion:58}} \r\n10. {{champion:84}} \r\n\r\nI&#039;d appreciate any feedback you may have.\r\n\r\nAll the best on the rift fellow summoners!","replies":[{"poster":"CoachSaiclone","date":"2019-01-11T06:56:27.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Mikatis,\n\nI'm part of a community where we provided structured training sessions for people who want to improve. It's a little different to what you're asking for, but I think you'll be interested in the format we offer.\n\nOur discord server is at [https://discord.gg/Ze3a2aK](https://discord.gg/Ze3a2aK) and our latest session announcement can be found on our twitter too:\n[https://twitter.com/_BambooProject/status/1082173291891089408](https://twitter.com/_BambooProject/status/1082173291891089408)\n\nThis invitation is open to anyone else who's interested too.

Mid lane has so many variables to be effective it's easier to start top and move from there. Some of those champs you have can viably play top as well depending on the matchup, so it's a good place to start.\nPay attention to the enemy team comp, and figure out if it is more useful to have TP for team fights or ignite for kill threat/pressure. This comes down to knowing the matchups, the champs you're versing in lane, only time will grant good knowledge of what's going to happen.\nPay attention to your jungler. Is he a farming jungler (which will likely disappear next patch thanks to the jungle gold nerfs) or a ganking jungler. A ganking jungler will look to get lanes fed, but will usually ignore a lane that's been unlucky and let your opponent get fed, which you're likely to do in a new role on unfamiliar champs, so be wary. A farming jungler won't be around unless there's a definite kill there which relies on you as well. Be aware that no matter which role either top or mid you take, you may well be on an island as far as your team's concerned. If you aren't particularly stron on the other hand, the enemy jungler is going to see a big bucket of fried chicken, and constantly be there for 2-3 ganks. Don't TP to lane and be aggressive if you've just been ganked and killed, and be aware that they might even dive to kill you again as their jg will definitely still be in the area if he was healthy, getting vision on camps or maybe counter jungling.\nIf you can push out waves, look to take advantages in the river or get vision down on the enemies camps to get a feel for where he might be, and possibly save you from a gank. Same as support there. Get scuttle if you can do it fast, take the fruits, all of these things help.\nControl wards are still your best friend.\n\nOther than that, watch some pro streams/vods/vids in the role you are looking to take up. Have a look at how they play the split push. Staying out of vision but nearby as waves push up so you're less likely to be collapsed upon.\n\nI'd also start not playing those champs, play something tanky or team fight focused for a bit until you get a feel for the lane. Just having that time there and seeing what players can do on champs before jumping into the carry role that you obviously want will make the time easier when you do take those champs. Mechanically those champs are alot different than nami, and alot more intense. If you constantly lose track of your mouse on the screen, forget things like Zed, Zoe, Ekko etc.\n\nBut it does make me sad to hear that you can't kite to save your life and you got into gold.... learn where the opportunities for good trades are, playing around cd's etc. Hearing you say you're not good at this also makes me sad you got into gold :(\n\nAlso, playing with ignite instead of tp or exhaust takes some getting used to. For a while I just completely forget that I have it, or use it outside kill range.\n\nKeep the enemy champion selected at all times. Left click on him. This will tell you important things like health, when things like electrocute are up, other passives etc. This, along with his ability usage will give you the best info for trade windows.","replies":[{"poster":"TNT Mikatis","date":"2019-01-16T04:18:38.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best feedback I have had so far!
