Lacking?\r\nThe blue ess I dont really care for as i get it from champ caps, but only 2 key frags and nothing else? I get more key frags when logging in after a day of receiving many honours.\r\nHave to admit I&#039;m a little disappointed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T06:22:11.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/honor\n\nIt was announced with the honour changes what exactly would be in the orbs. They are meant to be 'decent rewards' yes but more than that they are meant to be guaranteed rewards. There was a lot of RNG last season with who got honour capsules. Some people got loads, and some got barely any. \n\nThey wanted to fix that, So they moved away from RNG and instead added checkpoints with guaranteed rewards, both for that purpose and as an additional measure of progression (since it takes longer this season since we have the whole year).","replies":[]}]}
