The drop rate for key shards is totally bs, in fact I just recently made a post on this exact subject.\n\nI am now counting, and I have played 25 games without getting a shard. 11 of those have been wins. More than half of those wins were in a pre made, thus INCREASING my chances, and yet even then I still don't get a key.\n\nAt the end of the day it comes down to the fact that Riot is trying to trick us into thinking they are giving us fee stuff when it's really just another way for them to earn money.","replies":[]}]}
