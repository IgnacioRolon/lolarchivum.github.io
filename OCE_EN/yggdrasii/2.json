Once that content becomes available they will get their tokens. I believe it might be implying that if you got one of the skins from your capsule you'll only get one token, but it's not totally clear and I don't believe it applies to you from the sounds of things anyway.\n\nThis is the note that applies to everyone: \n>This season only, your Honor 5 capsule will contain two Honor 5 tokens because we promised you two chromas this season, not one.\n\nSo to be clear, once you hit Honour 5 this season you will receive 2 Honour 5 tokens. For future seasons you will only get one.","replies":[]}]}
