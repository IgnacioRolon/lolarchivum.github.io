But Riot disagreed and deemed them toxic. Despite them being not offensive (no swearing, no attacks) but toxic.\r\n\r\n&quot;Even though you didn&#039;t say anything really offensive, your behavior was in fact toxic. Furthermore, retaliation is not something we allow on the Fields of Justice.&quot;\r\n\r\nFair enough right, so i asked for a clearer definition of toxicity.\r\n\r\n&quot;Hey again, Toxicity is a loose term that many players think is just a system that catches on to your swearing, but it&#039;s a lot more complicated than that. You see - toxicity is negativity in all it&#039;s forms, from the early GG&#039;s and sarcastic congratulations, incessant whining in chat, harassment or just comments that distract rather than help, flame rather than aid, or telling people to report someone. Keep in mind that it isn&#039;t limited just to the things I mentioned here, but this is to give you a better idea of it.&quot;\r\n\r\nAccording to my emails with riot, they have an absolute zero tolerance with toxicity at all.\r\n\r\n&quot;Although I understand where you are coming from and all the frustration involved, please also understand that we have a zero tolerance policy towards toxicity as in there is no excuse for being toxic to a player.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo according to this due to ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE you can be banned for saying GG just a bit early since it is an example of toxic behaviour, or for saying &quot;gj&quot; sarcastically.\r\n\r\nNot only this despite riot to admitting to my actions being in defense, but a little overboard, none of the offending parties actually received punishment (they were a duo who flamed me all game, and probably reported me. Wont give names because witch hunting etc). This shows a huge flaw in riots system, similar to the how schools deal with bullying. The bully is never punished, but if you retaliate or defend yourself at all you are instantly punished.\r\n\r\nThere is a mute button fair enough, but you cannot expect 100% of the player base who gets flamed to always mute everyone 100% of the time. That is simply unrealistic, we are human beings with emotions.\r\n\r\nNow let me talk about my own ban a little, this is my first offense, and according to standard riot procedure this should be a chat restriction right? Wrong you misbehave for one game instant 2 week ban. What other game does this? When questions about this Riot stated\r\n\r\n&quot;Whilst it is true that normally as a first offence there is the chat restriction (applied to 10 or 25 games), followed by the two week suspension ending with the fourth offense: Permanent Suspension, it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behavior in the game.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo what determines whats severe enough to be a 2 week ban over a chat restriction. No where on riots website does it state this.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Riot&#039;s ban system imitates the already broken system that school use to handle bullying. Not only this but you can be banned for saying GG to early or GJ sarcastically, not that i was banned for this though.\r\n\r\nChat Logs: \r\n\r\n[0:51] DarkShado69 (Jarvan IV): why are u jg
