In my case [ C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\system ] and search for ''system.cfg''\nOpen it with notepad, copy everything out to a new text document for safe keeping. Now delete everything on it (if there's anything) and paste this content.\nDownloadPath = /releases/live\nDownloadURL = l3cdn.riotgames.com\nRegion = OC1\n\nSave the file and reopen league.\nIf everything worked correctly it should do an update and fix your error. If not then head over to this page\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/I8XUgB8w-rads-error-or-unable-to-connect-to-supportriotgamescom \nand try the solutions in there.\nOtherwise unfortunately I believe you will need to uninstall and re install.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"CDM","date":"2015-02-26T00:39:26.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried the system.cfg the only difference is that it is presented as\n \nDownloadURL = l3cdn.riotgames.com\nDownloadPath= /releases/live\nRegion = OC1\n\nAlso tried the solutions on that page none of which worked\n\nTried an uninstall reinstall and it freezes at 86% (1mb/s to 0) and around 260mb left to patch which I may be wrong but is probably size of the patch ? Could this be a patch specific issue ?\n\nEdit 2nd attempt: http://gyazo.com/8c35f4bef60f07b8f0b057f8863dc5a3\nEdit: from 79%-91% it remains at 269mb with 0 download speed this appears to just be a bug in downloading and its installing updates, problem solved","replies":[]}]}]}
