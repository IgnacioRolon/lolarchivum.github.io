He would take advantage of the rare quiet: meditate, clear his mind and make peace with his body before it was overcome by adrenaline, injuries and the wind itself. The moment he felt the tug of bonding magic call him to the Rift, he donned his armour and weapon with practiced finesse, and seated himself on the summoning circle long before his comrades of the day. Only once he was upon the battlefield would he open his eyes and reconnect with the world.\n\nOn this day, when he entered the summoning chamber, it was different. To his surprise, he wasn&rsquo;t the only one there far earlier than necessary. Ahri, the nine-tailed fox - another Ionian with whom he&rsquo;d had little to do before now - was lying on the ground surrounded by clothes, attempting to pull a pair of shiny shorts over her many tails.\n\nOne ear was flicked towards the door, and she didn&#039;t even look up at him when she said: &ldquo;It&#039;s ridiculous what they ask us to wear, isn&#039;t it? I mean, this is hardly practical for battle. Or anything, really. And everyone knows I can&#039;t sing a note!&rdquo;\nShe gave a final heave and her tails magically popped through the back of the shorts. She sat there huffing for a moment before her golden, feline eyes finally turned to look at him, still standing there bewildered.\n&ldquo;I suppose it&#039;s all right for you. You get to wear cool things like that.&rdquo;  She flicked a sparkly nail at his attire - futuristic armour in bright oranges and gunmetals. \n\n&ldquo;&hellip;Why are you here?&rdquo; Yasuo found himself asking. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a room to get dressed in?&rdquo;\n\nAhri glanced at him sheepishly, pulling on a tight sparkly bustier.\n\n&ldquo;My room is kind of a mess at the moment, and I hate changing in the locker rooms. You would not believe what goes on in there. It&rsquo;s worse than what happens on the rift, honestly. Besides, we&rsquo;ve all got worse things to worry about than false human modesty, right?&rdquo;\nShe had gotten up and moved closer to him, holding the two sides of the bustier together.\n&ldquo;Zip me up?&rdquo; She said, poking a small pink tongue out at him and winking one of her long-lashed eyes.\n\nHe obliged, his face something of a deterred scowl beneath the grey and orange mask. He&rsquo;d never had the time nor the interest for romance in all his life, having gone seamlessly from gifted student to overconfident guard to disgraced wanderer. He was far too preoccupied with his grief and personal vendetta to worry about companionship.\nHe also did not much like Ahri&rsquo;s ways of using her magic: the few times he had faced her on the Rift he hated the false love she imbued, even more than he hated being taunted to attack by other magic-wielders. It occurred to him they&rsquo;d never been on the same side. \n\n&ldquo;So, do you know who&rsquo;s summoning you today?&rdquo; she asked, wandering back to her clothes pile and pulling on a glimmering blazer and matching sailor hat. \n\n&ldquo;No. I have more important things to contemplate.&rdquo; Yasuo sat on his summoning platform and crossed his legs, laying his orange sword across his knees. He was going to try to meditate anyway, sparkly talkative fox demon or not. \n\n&ldquo;You mean you don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He was tempted to crack an eye open and look at her again, but he resisted.\n\n&ldquo;There&#039;s some big tournament today apparently. We&rsquo;re to be summoned by the best in the League. I can&#039;t wait to see what they do with me.&rdquo;\nThere was a suggestive sigh. Yasuo sneezed.\n&ldquo;Oops. Sorry.&rdquo;\n\nResisting the urge to give himself over to irritation, he opened his eyes and found himself covered in gold powder. Ahri, now with shiny gold hair, was toting a tiny microphone, and had turned her attention to her fluffy white tails.\n\nYasuo blew the powder off.\n&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re telling me we&rsquo;re going to be commanded by people with actual proficiency in battle?&rdquo; He said, half hopeful, half derisive.\n\n&ldquo;Don&#039;t you trust me?&rdquo; she said in an overly affected voice. She laughed at herself before extracting another handful of powder and gently blowing it all over her tails. They went from snowy-white to cotton-candy pink and glittered as they moved. &ldquo;I hate doing this to them, it takes _forever_ to get out. I might need some help in the shower later.&rdquo; She smiled a predatory smile at him. &ldquo;Anyway, yes, it&#039;s some kind of special factions-of-Ionia battle.&rdquo;\n\nYasuo had tried to close his eyes and calm his mind again, but he was once again pulled to the surface by the vixen&#039;s words. \n\n&ldquo;Factions?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Mmm-hmm. You, me, Shen, Varus and Akali against&hellip; Zed, Irelia, Karma, Kennen and Riven.  So we finally get to fight together! I must say I&#039;ve enjoyed our little duels in the past but I&#039;ll be glad to have the wind by my side instead of in my face.&rdquo; She winked again. \n\nYasuo was very still. &ldquo;Riven? Today? At the northern bastion?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah. Haven&rsquo;t you faced her many times before?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No, never.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Well&hellip; I hope you can beat her.&rdquo;\n\nThe sudden wavering in the previously upbeat voice caused Yasuo to shoot to his feet. He had often been told by his masters that his pride and overconfidence were his worst faults as a warrior, but he could not help himself.\n\n&ldquo;Of course I will! I alone decide my fate! I have bested you many times over, even with all your trickery, and many people, yourself included, say you are one of the most dangerous foes a swordsman can face.&rdquo;\nHe had unwillingly raised his blade, and he could feel every hair on his head being blown up and out by a stiff breeze. He quivered like a leaf in a storm. &ldquo;I am surprised _you_ are not on the opposing team - you are a soul-sucking fox-demon, are you not?&#039;\n\nAhri&#039;s tails flared out behind her, and the faintest hint of fox-fire appeared at her side. Her eyes glowed furiously for a moment, but then the tails curled up together, and the glow became a mischievous sparkle again. \n\n&ldquo;I know you can beat her, and most likely you will. I only worry because Riven is very strong and so is her summoner, and she knows the north so well, whereas you wander where you will. I&#039;m sorry for causing offence.&rdquo;\nHer tails curled coyly around her, and she smiled, revealing tiny white fangs. &ldquo;I am just a lost soul looking for redemption. We&#039;re not so different really, are we?&rdquo;\n\nTheir comrades were entering now, and the summoning platforms were glowing. \n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to fighting by your side, Unforgiven.&rdquo; Ahri smiled at him again, tying a necklace around her neck. The gold heart reflected light into his eyes. He found he didn&#039;t mind. \n\n~\n\nWhat felt like hours passed in battle without a victory to either side. Yasuo had met Riven just as he had planned, and the clash of their wind blades had resounded across the Rift again and again. Yasuo scanned his surroundings and noticed a pair of glowing eyes in the distant river reeds. Ahri put a soft finger to her lips and crouched low.\nRiven leapt into the air with a violent overhead slash, her eyes full of rage, before they turned glassy and smitten. The arm holding her enormous sword became slack, and the blow lost all its momentum. For that fleeting moment, she was vulnerable.\nAs fox fire and wind blade lunged as one, all Yasuo could hear was Ahri&#039;s tinkling laugh. For all her flippant trickery, she too had been prepared all along for this moment.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-07-05T15:37:34.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice","replies":[]}]}
