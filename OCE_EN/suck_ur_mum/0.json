As per the Riot Games Player Support article titled \"[Loss Prevented](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201753014-Loss-Prevented)\", \n\n> This mode only activates when a large number of players are being impacted on a system-wide scale. We hit something we call \"The Button\" to activate it for the platform. Compensation Mode cannot be retroactively enabled or turned on for a player on an individual basis.","replies":[]}]}
