To rub salt in the wound the enemy team had a devourer jungle skarner and a support shaco (who was then able to spend the whole game in our jungle). Now im quite salty at the moment, but I know there are many similar experience with DC&#039;s and AFK&#039;s that have completely ruined games and im curious why there is no loss prevention or at least reduced LP loss for the team with 4 players.\r\n\r\nAll I can come up with is that people will somehow abuse the system but it seems to me that it would be easy enough to put some sort of limitation to the effect of &quot;must have not left shop&quot;, &quot;must have 0 CS&quot;, &quot;must have been AFK for 50% of game or more&quot; then there wouldnt be a huge amount or room for abuse.\r\n\r\nJust really annoying to have full penalty for loss when it is a 4v5 game from the outset...","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-24T17:01:43.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loss prevention is only for server wide issues, not just because your game had an AFK.","replies":[{"poster":"Markamus88","date":"2015-09-24T17:18:44.153+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I understand how loss prevention currently works and I get why it didn't apply in my game, but I am saying that it is silly just to stop at just server issues when it comes to things like loss prevention.  \n\nIn a game that is reliant on 5v5 teams, being a player short is a huge handicap and while im sure people have won and will continue to win 4v5's, it doesn't make sense to me that there isn't some sort of reduced penalty for a loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-25T05:09:00.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a point that has been argued to death.\n\nIT.
