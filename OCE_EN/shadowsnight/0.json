I have all my port forwarding and QoS set up and I&#039;m running at 10 ping and it&#039;s not spiking while playing. 4 other people in my team was also getting lag, 3 team mates in all for one and one in ranked, any ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-19T13:39:36.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey ShadowsNight,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers. Before we start looking at factors that may be causing these issues on the ISP end, I'd first like to confirm that the issue does not lay on your end of things. Can you try as many solutions as you can that are provided in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article?\n\nIf those solutions don't work, let's start looking into the diagnostics and see where the issue may be originating. To do this, we'll need you to provide some information for us: \n\n1. Confirmation that you've tried the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article\n2. ISP that you're using\n3. Region and/or State\n4.
