Upon resurrection, Mordekaiser enters TRUE IRON mode, his Total max health becomes half of what he had before resurrection (does not calculate active effects) and several conditions occur;\r\n-Lose a flat amount of armour and magic resist\r\n-Gain a flat amount of movement speed but become more vunerable to any cc that impares movement\r\n-Gain Bonus attack speed\r\n-Health costs are reduced\r\n-Shield conversion increases\r\n-Grievous wound is only 25% effective when dealt to Mordekaiser but all healing received from outside of abilities is reduce by 50% (Excludes fountain)\r\nThis passive scales with level.\r\nTRUE IRON lasts until next death. This passive has a 5 minute cooldown but the CD only triggers when Mordekaiser dies when TRUE IRON is active.\r\nQ:Each strike costs health but the health cost is dealt as true damage and if a strike kills a unit, Mordekaiser is healed by a flat amount equal to the health spent on the strike.\r\nW: The value of xp gained has to increase\r\nNew part of the active;\r\nIf an allied champion is selected for w, 50% of the shield gained is also granted to the ally\r\nE:(Does not need to change)\r\nR: If Mordekaiser would die while a cursed unit is active, the cursed unit perishes and Mordekaiser is healed for a portion of that units max health (health restored cannot exceed a certain value). If the death would trigger TRUE IRON, then the same health that would restore is instead added to Mordekaisers Health pool as bonus health.\r\n\r\nIf someone from RIOT would post their thoughts on this ,that would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2017-10-19T22:29:47.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so you dont get the wrong idea about what im about to say, these ideas sound pretty cool, but attack speed is a wasted stat on mordekaiser, also do we need more unnecessarily convoluted kits in league? I didn't know whether I was reading a passive or the unsolveable equation of the universe.","replies":[{"poster":"AuzzoeKnight","date":"2017-10-20T03:40:51.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm as a mordekaiser main I can safely say that attackspeed isn't a wasted stat on mordekaiser.  Tri force or Nashors is what I tend to get a lot. It's not a looked at stat but it makes his q so much faster with attack speed and both items he gets work with him so well. \n\nSaying that this kit will still not make him viable or \"show up\" in any meta, The xp bonus on his w is balanced and the change on q is a nice touch up for when your last hitting with it but having him deal true damage is a bit much as he already deals a lot of Magic and Physical damage. The main problem with him right now is that he cant and wont get on the back line with it being Ardent and Tank meta so Mord will just get cc'd to oblivion and cause he is squishy himself he will die. The r just looks too broken tbh \n\nHe will just be the same unique pick that seems only mordekaiser mains actually play.","replies":[]}]}]}
