I&#039;ve already got the Champ Thresh skin from last year, so thought I&#039;d give away the skin code to someone who could get some use out of it instead. I assume it operates like other skin codes in that if you don&#039;t own the champ but put the code in you&#039;ll get the champ as well as the skin you&#039;re claiming.\r\n\r\nAccording to the card you need to go to champthresh.leagueoflegends.com in order to enter the promo code and claim the skin (Expires on Nov 16th for reference, though I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t last that long). Promo code follows:\r\n\r\nAMWC5E55AEEE4PRA\r\n\r\nIf you don&#039;t mind, just throw a post in here when you grab it since it&#039;s first come first serve, so it&#039;ll save time for others. Enjoy! :D","replies":[{"poster":"Sujinho","date":"2015-11-03T15:19:42.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't work ):","replies":[{"poster":"DreamlessDays","date":"2015-11-05T03:52:57.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was already claimed a couple days ago by another user.
