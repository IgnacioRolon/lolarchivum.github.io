So I&#039;ve just decided to try next season and experiment with new champions, etc.\r\nI wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m the best, but compared to the people in normals and on the provisionals I&#039;d say I&#039;m at least half decent.\r\nHere are my current mains for all lanes:\r\n**Mid:**\r\n{{champion:105}} (My highest KDR champ, since he&#039;s easy to play and stuff I guess, generally carry with him)\r\n{{champion:90}} (Learning how to play him because again, OP)\r\n{{champion:103}} \r\n{{champion:45}}  (Veigarrr &lt;3)\r\n\r\n**Top:**\r\n{{champion:150}} (again, pretty good at him, picked him up early on)\r\n{{champion:245}} (I&#039;m terrible with him, still learning.)\r\n\r\n**Jungle:**  \r\n{{champion:19}} \r\n{{champion:90}} (Still learning how to improve and getting that level 3 dragon)\r\n{{champion:77}}  (I&#039;m not great at him, only got the skin through mystery gift XD)\r\n\r\n**ADC:**\r\nProbably my most hated lane\r\n{{champion:81}}  (I&#039;m trash at ADC)\r\n\r\n**Support:**\r\nI basically have almost every supp. \r\nThe ones I play the most:\r\n{{champion:412}} \r\n{{champion:53}} \r\n\r\n**Sorry for the long-ish posts but here are my questions**\r\nHoping a few decent players can point me in the right direction.\r\n\r\n**1. Lock Screen vs Un-Locked Screen?**\r\nSo basically a good majority of people I&#039;ve talked to about this have told me to unlock my screen and play. Why is that and does it prove advantageous/disadvantageous to do so?\r\n\r\n**2. What should I main?**\r\nSo, like I inferred previously, my best lanes are probably mid and support. I started the game wanting to be a support main but felt that with my KDR&#039;s, I would contribute more to the team as a midlaner, since I find myself having to do most of the work in my normal games. I&#039;m a decent toplaner and jungler, but can&#039;t ADC for crap.\r\n\r\n**3. Champions that wreck opponents if fed?**\r\nI&#039;m talking about a 3v1 to a 5v1, as I consistently find myself having to do a lot of the initiation/objectives etc. (Probably due to playing normals/provisionals) Like, I know my main mid {{champion:105}} can&#039;t do too much in a 4v1 situation if the opponent has a brain.\r\n\r\n**4. Malzahar JG**\r\nI can play him mid but I&#039;m not fully sure how to master the jungle aspect of him. Is there a particular way to kite monsters with his W to ensure minimum damage for the level 2/3 dragon? And exactly how does one survive a level 2/3 dragon? I picked up the guy recently and haven&#039;t been doing that well in the JG. Also seem to get invaded a lot...\r\n\r\n**5. Technical Side**\r\nOk, so perhaps the most burning question I have about all this is that **is a technical aspect of league (as in knowledge) needed to succeed?** Basically what I mean is knowledge about items, jungle monster outputs (in JG) and all that? Because I play the game without much awareness for any of this.\r\n\r\n**6. Final Tips**\r\nWithout trying to sound like the 9/10 narcissistic people on League, is there any way for me to boost my provisionals score or whatever even if I have a terrible team? Is there a certain way to play? Are kills all that matter? Etc.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion** \r\nThanks for reading, if any of you guys did. Lately I&#039;ve been experimenting with new champions so my past few matches haven&#039;t been that great, but I&#039;m fine with that. Please feel free to answer any of my questions as it would be extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nOverall, I&#039;m just looking to get better at the game, and not into a GODLY rank or anything.\r\nI think I probably need to focus on the technical side of the game a bit more and learn how to analyse my opponents item builds...\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks guys and have an awesome day!","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-23T01:49:56.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"♥  ** Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference.**\n Playing locked screen negatively impacts your global awareness. Sure, you can look at the mini map every so often, but sometimes you will get a hint to the enemy champion out of the corner of your eye (something you could miss in locked). If you are playing a champion like Noc, tf, GP, Jinx, it may be difficult to accurately ult. The only pro i can see is that you wont easily lose track of your champ.\nPersonally, I play with my screen unlocked (when I first started my friends wouldn't let me have it any other way), but I still keep my thumb on the spacebar ready to centre my camera again. \n\n\n♥  If your best lanes are mid and support (what you stick into champ select), prepare yourself to become a support one trick. Mixing the most popular role and the least popular role are going to get you shoved off into support almost all of the time. It isn't bad or anything, you will still be able to climb, you will just have to have a very team oriented playstyle. \n\n**For support I would suggest:** {{champion:1}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:412}} {{champion:267}} \nA heavy AP, the natural counter to low elo, overall good sup, sustain champ\nSo you can fill the gaps in your team composition when needed.\n\n**For mid I would suggest:** {{champion:1}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:45}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:105}} \nAP AOE powerhouse, strong single target, strong vs mages in current meta, AD (just incase), because you like playing him\n\n_If you feel the need to have a break from support, I would suggest ensuring your toplane is just as strong as the other two roles._\n\n**I would suggest:** {{champion:54}} {{champion:13}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:150}} \nStrong team fight build him tank, AP powerhouse, very tanky, because you like him\n\n♥ Best to nip the \"i must 1v5 solo carry\" mentality here. In all honesty, unless you are smurfing/playing vs bots you really should not be any situation where you do this. Even if your team are potatoes, it is way better to adapt yourself to their derp play styles than risk the game trying to carry. \n\n♥  **Climbing with mechanics vs game knowledge **\n\n* Some people climb based solely on mechanics (how well they push the buttons) these are the people that tend to plateau quickly and \"get stuck in elo hell\". \n\n* Other players climb based on a healthy mix of mechanics/game knowledge. This level of    game knowledge doesn't really go past knowing jg timers, champion  abilities/passives/predicted builds/counters/synergies. \n\n* A small percentage of the players rely solely on game knowledge because their mechanics are utter trash (this is which category I fall under). I win games by getting into game, identifying our win conditions, objective control order, as well as any difficulty my laners might face and type these things in chat. Most of the time it is taken positively but I still get the occasional \"go kys noob\". I also know niggly things like ability scalings and jg creep damage, but they don't come into play much. \n\n♥ **Final tips**\n\n* Solo through your provisionals. \n* **The main aim of the game is to kill the enemy nexus**. While they do help, kills aren't that important. If they were, the ranked system would be based on individual performance. All that matters is that you work together with your team to help secure objectives and kill the enemy nexus. Work with your team to do this. If you find someone isn't stepping up and taking charge and your team is wondering around like lost puppies, you be the shot caller. \n* No matter how much you want to blame your team for a loss, remember that you are the only constant in all your games and there is always something you could have done better.","replies":[{"poster":"Not a Hooker","date":"2016-05-23T06:00:23.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for taking the time to reply.\nI really appreciate it and have learned something new ^w^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-23T00:43:43.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Main whatever role you like, with the constant meta shifting I wouldn't force yourself into a role you're uncomfortable with just to suit the strongest champs, but I'd say mid and adc are the most influential roles atm","replies":[]}]}
