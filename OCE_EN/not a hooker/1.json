Some general tips/warding tips would be fine.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I play at the moment, kindred, rek&#039;sai, hecarim (and looking to get into Zac). I have trouble deciding which one to play in ranked based on teams or whatever.\r\nSo what are these champ&#039;s synergies? When should I pick them? Etc.\r\nI find my knowledge of the game/champs is lacking hence why I need help in deciding to pick who into who, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-10-06T13:24:11.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off : Buying pink wards off your first back and placing them in a defensive position in your jungle can help provide a small (pretty much permenent) area of vision, make sure to drop it in the jungle that doesnt have wolves due to being able to smite wolves for the Vision Ghost(<-what ever the %%%%s name is)\n\nSecondly: Watching guides on best clears for your particular junglers can help give you insight on how to gain a level advantage over there jungler.\n\nThirdly: make sure that almost every single one of your warding totems trinkets are placed in the enemy jungle as this will give information on where they are located and can allow for counter ganks/jungling\n\nFourth: after successfull ganks shove the lane as hard as u possible can under there turret (no matter what the laner says, only dont do this if there is immenent fear of die'n to a roaming enemy.\n\nthats all that i can think of, off the top of my head atm other tips and stuff you can find easily by just watching youtube","replies":[]}]}
