In the games I don&#039;t ban fucking master yi/kayle there&#039;s always this duo who uses it.\r\nI&#039;m  a jungle support main.\r\nI&#039;ve picked earlygame junglers to get yi behind (which works to a degree), ive roamed top as a support to prevent the incoming aids, I&#039;ve stacked armor upon armor and nothing works. \r\nNothing legitimately works.\r\nThe fucking 0/5 yi can have 22 cs in 15 minutes and still get a pentakill under our nexus towers.\r\nI hate to be this guy, ranting and all but please.\r\nNothing I&#039;ve tried works.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not going to be like &quot;Riot, please nerf&quot; or anything because obviously they&#039;re champions in League, and as players we have to adapt to the changing meta, etc (frequent abuser of maokai here), but it&#039;d be really helpful if someone of a higher elo (my accounts are Silver V, Silver II and Gold V as of this season) could give me a few pointers to beat this strat.\r\nI honestly don&#039;t even feel motivated to hit ranked queue anymore.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played 4 times against it. 4 losses in less than a week.\r\nThanks guys,\r\nMuch love &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-08-05T19:28:09.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just ignore the inevitable. You can only slow it down. The best thing to do is, since Yi will be Top the *enitre* game (after 10 mins), his camps will be unguarded and you have free reign over the other two lanes.\n\nWhat you need to do is get Bot ahead and snowball them, and then push that lane (a fed ADC can push very fast).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-08-06T02:39:46.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"alternatively, with vision control gained from lane pressure, it's possible to countergank top depending on which top and jungle you have.

Yi is a polarising champion at this elo too, since if he's on the enemy team and he's good and gets a lead, the game is as a good as over, whereas more often your teammate will pick yi, and it'll be about as useful as waterproof toiletpaper.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-08-05T12:48:38.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The things is, at bronze skills level. Advantages are not snowball and the game just dragged on and on. So that why you struggle against those champs. \n\nWith leads; Try to take: rift herald, wards, look for team fights with items advantage, dont farm when you can clearly win team fight. Push for objectives. Yi isnt a hard champ to vs in team fight. The problem is, people get caught out by him while overextending without vision to cs.","replies":[]}]}
