Basically, these behaviours are deemed severe enough that a much harsher warning is warranted, and damaging enough to warrant not offering the two extra chances that most players get in the form of chat restrictions.\n\nIf you removed the hate speech element from your log, I'd say it's likely you'd still see punishment, but it wouldn't have escalated.\n\nDo be aware that 14-day suspension is only one tier away from permanent ban, so any further offences that trigger the system (even if they aren't to the same severity) will result in permanent loss of the account.\n\nYou can reduce your punishment tier, but it is a slow process, and there is no explicit notice of when you have dropped a tier (to prevent people from abusing it). It takes the average player roughly 3 months to drop a single tier (which would put you back to 14-day for next punishment), but like Honour, this time is variable based on the behaviour you exhibit in your games and how many games you are playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ms Cougar","date":"2019-12-14T07:38:13.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because people who rage like you need that sort of ban to make them realise they are WAY out of line.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2019-12-16T06:10:33.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you know what i say to kids like you? \n\n\"orgastae: i get ill be reported\norgastae: but its worth\"\n\nENJOY YOUR BAN! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2019-12-14T10:34:25.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You deserve it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-12-14T09:53:04.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"orgastae: your playing wukong u %%%%t\n\nHomophobic word.\n\nInstant 14-day ban.","replies":[]}]}
