During my leash as J4 annie specifically waited for me to get the blue buff low and stole it. when she did that i gave bot kill a free kill by flashing in.. but after that she stole blue buff that i was going to give ahri, when i was level 9 i started saying \"germans should die\" (cause annie was german i think cause of her name was Ludënhorf) but i completely understand why i was banned for 14 days but i was just joking around overall i had a good time during playing league of legends. So please Riot can you please forgive me for the actions i have decided to do and un-ban me. PS : We won the game\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely - Ÿašùo","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-07-04T05:10:34.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\nSince it is an account specific inquiry and we can't really help you out on the boards. If you want to appeal your case, you should send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to Riot. \nFrom now its basically a waiting game.\n\nHere are some guidelines for submitting a support ticket that will ensure the smoothest and fastest response possible:\n\n> Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you (although majority of tickets are answered within 48 hours), so be patient","replies":[{"poster":"Ÿašùo","date":"2017-07-05T01:49:10.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Yaiamone, but could you simplify this? :)\n\n- Ÿašùo","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-05T08:05:59.937+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nGo to the link > I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games > Log in if you haven't already > follow the prompts.\n\nOnly do this once.

I would like to appeal from a permanent  ban. I know I was been rude and toxic in some games. When you get trolls in game its annoying. While you have people who feed because they didn't get their lane or people who don't like playing support and or people who feed because they didn't get a kill or a red/blue buff. Or people who jg with no smite while your in game just to troll. I know I was toxic in them games.
