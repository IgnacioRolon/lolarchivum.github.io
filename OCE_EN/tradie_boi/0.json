Doing really well in preseason and/or placements and/or having stopped before reaching your peak last season are all things that can net you a slightly higher placement, but it sounds like you had a low bronze end rank last season which pretty much guarantees you a Bronze 5 placement.\n\nThere were two popups that showed in the client when the ranked season started that explicitly stated you would more than likely be placed lower.","replies":[]}]}
