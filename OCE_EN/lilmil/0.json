Every champ has an ideal scenario they would like to be in, both in terms of power spikes and enemy compositions. \n\nIf Draven gets ahead early, which his passive allows him to do, he is in a position to end the game early. When the enemy is unable to pin him down long enough to outright kill him he will usually 2-3 shot enemy squishies. This is when Draven is strong.\n\nIf Vayne reaches 3/4 items, or god forbid gets further then that, she is in a position to single-handedly win the late game. When the enemy is unable to pin her down, especially by revealing her position when invisible, she will be able to kill nearly *anyone* she wants (the speed at which depends on build). This is when Vayne is strong.\n\nThe thing is both have high skills caps. Without mastery over the champ neither is as strong as they can be. Draven can roll through laning or he could fall behind and do nothing. Vayne can win the late game or she can never reach it at all.\n\nPrepare to practice which ever you pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-10-05T03:52:11.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in an even skilled vayne vs draven matchup, draven should win 9/10 times, at least.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Third Reich,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=wBxOjcTL,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2016-10-05T01:11:59.358+0000)\n>\n> Draven will beat Vayne, early, mid, and late game.\n> \n> I&#x27;d go Draven over Vayne.

Her only downside is that she is picked and banned very often.\n\nYes, Draven would win in a 1v1, but if your talking about who is the all round better ADC, Vayne is definetly the way to go.\n\nP.S. I main ADC and my two most played ADC's after Vayne are jinx and Ashe so I got you bro ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-10-05T01:11:59.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Draven will beat Vayne, early, mid, and late game.\n\nI'd go Draven over Vayne.
