Some will auto-send you an Elo boosting website and others will just stick there not doing anything. At first I just deleted them but now I&#039;m getting 3-12 a day and it&#039;s REALLLLLLY annoying. Is riot doing anything about this? \r\n\r\nAnyone else getting these rather annoying, spam adds?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-03T11:34:59.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got about three of them in my account life-time, then I stopped accepting friend requests from randoms. It really sucks how you can't do anything about it in the client.\n\nIf you have the account names, you can submit a support ticket and explain what exactly is happening. They might be able to do something about it.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
