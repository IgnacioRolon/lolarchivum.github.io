So instead of picking one thats easy to begin with _(which usually means they are boring as hell)_, and one you will probably be ridiculed for playing when you're doing well. Just cycle through all the champs until you find one you genuinely enjoy, then main them, it'll be rocky at first for a couple of days, but with a little practice they'll be just as easy to play.\n\nFor example, I love Aurelion Sol, he is pretty hard to play, and is literally the easiest champion to counter. But I stuck at him, and I had a 72% win rate with him this season, which blitzed all the win rates I had with much easier champs. And I have enough experience with him, that id rather pick him into an unfavourable situation, than counter-pick with an easier champ I have less experience with into a favourable situation.\n\nJust play to have fun, and success will follow. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolHarV","date":"2018-01-07T06:42:34.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} **_FTW_**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Elimination","date":"2017-12-29T10:05:21.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tryndamere or garen","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-27T13:37:51.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is probably the best one to pick, no skill shots, tank, very simple target priority (Either their carries, or whoever you have your passive on)\n\nMalphite is alright, but your required to have patience with his ult to not terribly waste it (if you ult 1 person, you can easily end up losing a team fight afterwards.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-12-28T01:31:56.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play Annie because you have a stun as your passive. \n\nHaving a point and click stun with your q is amazing because if you wanna catch a squishy out its super effective. \n\nPlus you have huge team fight carrying potential and TIBBBERSSS!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2017-12-27T13:11:58.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:54}} would be my pick for the easiest champion to main and climb with.\n\nHe has a very easy to understand kit, and can be incredibly useful to his team even if he is far behind through initiation through his ult.  Also, being a top laner allows you not to necessarily worry about objective control and roaming all around the map, and as you are an inherently tanky champion, so you don't need to worry about being blown up so easily as opposed to playing a marksman or a mage, and it's hard to go wrong with him when it comes to builds.\n\nI don't necessarily think it would be as fun, but {{champion:54}} is definitely the pick if you want to minimise as much micro and macro required play as possible","replies":[]}]}
