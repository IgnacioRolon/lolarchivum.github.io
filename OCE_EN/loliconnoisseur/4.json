This means he can dodge enemy attacks basic attacks and basic spells at a rate of 15/25/35/45/55% (+25% per 100 *bonus* movement speed) \nR: Uppercut: Champion performs an astoundingly powerful uppercut at the end of his q combos for 150/275/400 (+75% AD) physical damage and knocks them back. If the target had stacks of boxers might applied then the uppercut will deal and +50/75/100%  base attack damage, Uppercut potential lasts 15 seconds but champion kills and assist increase the time by 7 seconds. \nR passive; hard training: Champion gains 10 hp per 7 attack damage, and 1.4 attack damage per 7 health. Does not stack with itself. \nObviously would be way to OP with the current stats, but what do you guys think? I want something like this in league of legends, a champion who has combos on one ability, and a little like Vladimir with the passive only AD based. I noticed that I had the last q knocked them back, as did the ult, so lets say he quickly dashes towards them if you have your ult active without having to basic attack them again, and maybe a knock up rather than another knock back.

All champions have between 325 and 350 movement speed so 100_*3=300 and 25_*3+15=90\n\nI really wouldn't recommend it at all as chance dodging is a bad concept in general and I'm sure it's been removed some time ago\n\nThe R passive should probably give armour instead of HP, but that would make him too rammus like. I'd see him being an anti AD melee champ","replies":[{"poster":"LoliConnoisseur","date":"2015-11-03T14:07:01.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god I forgot to add that it's bonus move speed, no single champ really gets anything above an additional 100 bonus move speed, indeed my bad, obviously since this is just a concept idea and I don't really intend to put this in a display and say \"this needs to be added\". Admittedly dodging isn't as viable as it used to be, but for the sake of this guy being a boxer and whatnot I decided to add something like dodging, idk, please feel free to come up with something for his E.

I never really thought of a background story for him, though I feel like he could either be from noxus being very crazed, having an enormous blood lust and thirst for fighting in one on one fights, his personality itself would be shaped by where he comes from, if being from noxus he would be somewhat up himself, perhaps never being defeated in a fight, having to fight and protect himself  from danger, bur further more finding a somewhat sadistic pleasure out of defeating someone, never turning his back on a fight. But I think that maybe having him as someone from ionia wandering through Runeterra could be a better fit, perhaps looking for someone he loves, a family member, or maybe for a chance to get even stronger. Not to sure if this answers your question that well, but I tried. Lol.","replies":[]}]}]}
