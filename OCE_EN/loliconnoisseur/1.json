I had every honour title before this update, I didn&#039;t ask people to honour my for them, I earned them. I had almost 300 teamwork honours, and over 200 honourable  opponents, 70+ friendly honours and about 20 helpfuls, I had around 600 honours, and this new update doesn&#039;t even give me a fancy badge to parade for earning them all, why does it only equate to level 2 in the new system? I feel robbed, I liked seeing my hundreds of honours, and now it&#039;s whittled down to a single digit, and all I get is a couple key shards, and that&#039;s not even a compensation gift. People with a third of the honours I had got the exact same, this hardly feels fair. All my efforts that I made for everyone I&#039;ve ever helped still hold value to me, but now I don&#039;t have much of a way to remember those times. The old honour system was more than just a number on the screen to me, it was a counter to all the people I played with and against who I helped and made the game more enjoyable for. \r\n All in all, I like the idea of the new honour system, it&#039;s certainly great for new comers, but it&#039;s hard on older players. I wish you guys at riot did an integration between the two systems rather than completely getting rid of the old one, I miss my fancy numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-10T08:40:57.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're going to be implementing something to commemorate your progress in the old system, but they felt it was more important to get the new (and theoretically game-changing) system out sooner than to have the details of compensation for the old system out with it's release.\n\nJust be patient, you aren't forgotten :)","replies":[{"poster":"LoliConnoisseur","date":"2017-07-10T09:10:37.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=Mp7yENah,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-10T08:40:57.933+0000)\n>\n> They&#x27;re going to be implementing something to commemorate your progress in the old system, but they felt it was more important to get the new (and theoretically game-changing) system out sooner than to have the details of compensation for the old system out with it&#x27;s release.\n> \n> Just be patient, you aren&#x27;t forgotten :)\n\nAhh, thank you so so much. ^_^","replies":[]}]}]}
