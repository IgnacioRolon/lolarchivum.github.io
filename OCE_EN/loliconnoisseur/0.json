So I&#039;ve put thought into what I&#039;d like to see in the future with league, and realise there isn&#039;t any champion who uses terrain as a means of attack (I know there are a few champions that actually do, but not in the way I&#039;m talking about) I&#039;m yet to experience a champion who attacks from the walls, and terrain, like some kind of a swift swordsmen who dashes to and then jumps off the wall sweeping there blade(&#039;s) in a wide area, or a ranged champion who uses proximity mines attached to walls, or one of those classic traps as you trip a wire and the steaks come flying around the corner, impaling the victim, I&#039;m somewhat tired of seeing the normal abilities and traps that sit on the ground in what is practically becoming foreseeable, it&#039;s become boring with the usual &quot;dodge attacks from the front&quot; the current traps, and other abilities that that you can place are traditionally places in the middle of paths to &quot;surprise&quot; people, I feel like league has since lost it&#039;s touch with keeping people on edge, but if the danger could be somewhat spread out, meaning that you have to watch out for attacks from the wall, rather than just getting ganked by the jungle, I loved Vel, he was an epic addition to the game that made it so you had to be more aware of where attacks were coming from rather then just what was ahead of you, I&#039;d like peoples thoughts on this, and if riot you haven&#039;t added something like this for a specific reason, please tell me why you haven&#039;t explored this seemingly very viable option to make new champs, also with the changes in season 6, I imagine people will start warding more often, and personally I feel like creating someone like this will be worth it due to changes in season 6.

Having a damaging wall sticking trap is hard to add into a game (what's the champion's lore, why does it only stick to walls, why does it matter?), and dashes that bounce off walls are useless in both junglers and in laners because most junglers want to jump over them and most laners don't want to have an ability that is hard to use in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"LoliConnoisseur","date":"2015-11-04T11:09:17.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TeCoolMage,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=vHKuwE9J,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-04T09:53:21.796+0000)\n>\n> Well, Vayne and Gnar do that already, along with Bard.

Also this isn't a champion, I'm saying I just want to see more champs use the terrain of the jungle and such. For the whole blade jumpy thingy off wall, I imagined some champions ultimate just jumping from wall to wall slicing enemies up, think of a large scale yi alpha only it doesn't target people, just quickly dashing through enemy's. Ir doesn't really matter about anything I can specifically think of, it's just that it is somewhat boring seeing all this random stuff laying on the ground and people being pushed into walls, rather then coming off them. Anyway, that's just what I feel about the abilities in league, they all feel the same in a way.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-04T11:14:00.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Graves' new Q bounces off walls and does ridiculous amounts of damage when it does.","replies":[{"poster":"LoliConnoisseur","date":"2015-11-04T11:46:59.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Olee,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=vHKuwE9J,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-04T11:14:00.400+0000)\n>\n> Graves' new Q bounces off walls and does ridiculous amounts of damage when it does.\n\nI never hears about it bouncing off walls, but I just jizzed.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-04T12:05:03.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya so like if you cast it normally anywhere, it shoots, spreads out, and deals lots of damage on the way back after some delay.
