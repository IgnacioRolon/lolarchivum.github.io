Are you going cancer bruiser onhit duelist bush strats? Bursty AP cancer assassin bush strats? Get fed and become kind of a cancer ap carry runnans? Map Control Burn everyone and give them cancer?  Tank and just be annoying in lane cancer?\nWhen maining teemo, if you want to have the greatest impact, you need to pick how you plan to give you enemies cancer and stick to it. It revolves around a surprising amount around teamcomp and who on the enemy team you want to tilt the hardest.\nHere is a few examples:\nBursty AP teemo {{item:3146}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} \nhere you are trying to burst your opponent is a matter of seconds and is great for waiting in bushes for high priority targets. It''s bad vs tanks and bruisers but is good against assassins and adcs.\nOnhit Teemo: {{item:3153}}{{item:3124}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3006}} \nhere your damage is very very mixed and you are pretty hard to fight. This build involves alot of kiting and so I loving call variations of this kitemo. This build is good against tanks and duelists but bad against bursty assassins and lategame adcs.\nRunnans APC: {{item:3115}} {{item:3085}} {{item:3091}} {{item:3022}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3009}} \nthis is basically an ap version of an adc and involves alot of aaing but not so much about dueling 1 opponent and more about making up for teamwide dps. This build is decent in teamfighting and good vs tanks but bad vs duelists and bursty assassins and not great against adcs.\nMap Control Teemo: {{item:3165}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3089}}  {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}} \nThis build revolves around having unmatched map control and burning off half the hp of anyone dumb enough to walk through the minefield that is summoners rfit. Decent early game but needs good map control skills and awareness to work. Bad at teamfighting and is decent at bursting as an ap assassin but not amazing and is overall not great in fighting lategame. The map control can be worth more than an entire champion though.\nTankmo: {{item:3068}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3102}} {{item:3111}} \nthis build is really hard to kill in lane and is kinda good lategame at dueling but I don't like it since it can't teamfight, can't pressure the map much beyond splitpushing, can't assassinate people, the shrooms tickle in comparison to any of the other builds except the onhit build but at least onhit build can make use of the slows to catch someone out. It's not exactly a build that inspires fear and you limit yourself to annoying one person so it's not great. It's strong but for an experienced teemo, it's not the best way to leverage his strengths. Still the base damages make for a very safe laning phase.","replies":[]}]}
