You can replace them with items like Runaan's Hurricane which in my opinion is an essential for AD Teemo. It gives you lots of pushing power and its considerably cheaper. Blade can be replaced with something like Zz'Rot Portal, which gives you a tanky edge and also enhances your split pushing power. \nRageblade should be built last, it is very strong late game. Aside from that, the other items are pretty good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"maryxpink","date":"2016-10-19T03:42:11.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building {{item:3124}}  for on-hit Teemo is always a good option I think, but I think there are better attack speed options than {{item:3091}} . Wit's End reduces the enemy's MR, which is not really useful given how much AD dmg you have. You might want to consider getting {{item:3085}} instead for spreading your on-hit effects to multiple enemies, and clearing waves quickly. \n\n{{item:3115}}  is another attack speed option (although I'm not sure if that would work in a non-AP build). If you were to get Nashor's, you would need to get it early (maybe as your first major item) when it is most effective, before the AP part of it becomes ineffective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DongkeyKongkey","date":"2016-10-19T03:03:30.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it works, but ap teemo is still better. I have mastery 7 with teemo and have tried like all builds with him but i'm sure there's someone with more exp than me.\n\nfrom teemo mains i've spoken to they suggest rushing revolver, and needlessly large rod items like ludens and rabs then ur magic pen items, rush a zhonyas if you're against a zed or someone that can burst u 100-0.\n\nthe problem with ad teemo is it's difficult to do sustained damage in teamfights, it's fine for laning and great for pushing + mobility but having burst with ap allows you to dash in, auto attack q for about 80-90% of an adc's health then dash out again. if ur ad teemo you have to stick on a target and because of his low range you will probably get cc'd and nuked in that time.\n\nAlso your shrooms create a lot of pressure if you're pure ap with a lot of pen. the enemy team will think twice before chasing you or teamates into your jungle for example. with a blue buff is even better as you can get a lot of good coverage.\n\nanother viable build up to about gold 1 is adc teemo, just build standard crit,lifesteal,aspd and duel stupid adc's that will not notice their aa's missing :)\n\njust my 2 cents","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frommo","date":"2016-10-19T02:52:30.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To get a proper response from people you probably need to go a lot more in-depth on why these items are good and how they would beat current popular picks.  :/","replies":[]}]}
