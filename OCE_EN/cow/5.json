Facebook is too personal. But if its just like a little 'sticky note' sized page on the team page, that keeps communication within the game..","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-10T01:59:53.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When clubs come out you will have a little chatroom all to your team. You also have the power to moderate your chatroom. It will be a sticky note sized chatroom inclient, much like the current chatrooms (lfg, noob, gameplay & strategy). \n\nIn terms of leaving notes so people can see them when they log in, I'm not sure if clubs is going to have that function. In that case, discord is really good. It notifies you of new messages when you log in, you can have DM to players, you can set up multiple text chatrooms (game related, banter, etc) and multiple voice channels as well.\n\nIt even has an ingame overlay so you can keep connected while in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
