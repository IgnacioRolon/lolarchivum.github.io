Have there been a greater concentration of players since the change? are queue timers better since the changes? has matchmaking MMR improved or worsened since the changes?\r\n\r\nSince the change to make it 3 days a week on Fri-Sun I&#039;ve found that I&#039;ve been playing TT far less than I was when the queue was active for a longer period of time. I play maybe once every 3-4 weeks at this point for a few games, where as before I was able to play about 5 games weekly. This also goes for the people I normally play with. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d like to see Riot open up the queues on more days and have the balance team take a look at TT every now and again. It doesn&#039;t help grow TT if we limit it by making it available on less days. Sure the spike in numbers near end of S7 was primarily generated by getting additional End of Season rewards, but that&#039;s a good sign right there that it can be absolutely viable. Riot just needs to provide the right incentives to get people attracted to continue playing TT. Have someone take a look at TT and actually work on some much needed balance changes. Even if it&#039;s 1 or 2 people and the balance changes happens once every 3 or 4 patches that still makes a HUGE difference in keeping the queue alive in the long run. I&#039;m certainly no where near the Challenger level, but even I know those guys have 0 incentive to keep playing with only 6 challenger slots. Once they reach a certain point, the top tier players just make a new account and level that up. I&#039;d imagine it gets mundane for them to keep repeating this just to get that optimal window of good games for a while before it bombs out again.\r\n\r\nTT isn&#039;t a rotating game mode where it&#039;s something you come back to once in a while, it&#039;s was built as a competitive game mode that people do care about. I absolutely love TT and for me at least it&#039;s more fun than SR, but at this rate I fear that TT is going to die out by the time S9 rolls around if it continues at this rate. I still believe that Riot can keep both TT and SR at a healthy rate and putting proper effort into TTs revival will retain and attract new players back into League. Riot can even get to the point where they can start making a TT championship series, further boosting the mode and Leagues longevity (That&#039;s just a pipe dream for me)\r\n\r\nRito pls, help me :(","replies":[]}
