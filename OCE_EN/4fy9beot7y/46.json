Helped me improve my behavior. :)\n\nEdit: Going to miss doombots. That's unfortunate.

This should also help Riot to identify problems with their notification system, so they can try and decrease the occurrence of situations where people don't get the logs. Rioters are also willing to post logs on the boards, and I'm sure you could find one (I'd suggest looking through other ban-related posts). That will make them public, however, so it depends on whether you're willing to have everyone see what you said (if you said nothing wrong, you've got nothing to hide).\n\nOne thing that's important to note is that certain behaviours are report-worthy, even if they might not seem like it. The phrasing you use in-game can have a very distinct effect on the possibility of punishment. For example \"Can you not rush in 1v5 all the time?\" is a lot different to \"Stop feeding f\\*cktard!\" even though the main point (learning to choose your fights) remains the same.\n\nWhile it sucks you'll be banned for Doombots, you could still make a secondary account so you don't miss out the next couple weeks. You wont get to experience the complete Doombots experience but it's something. As a note, level 10 is the minimum requirement for Featured Game modes (assuming it hasn't changed since I last checked).","replies":[]}]}
