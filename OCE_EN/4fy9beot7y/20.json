I'm often the only salty person. Must be because of ELO difference?

I find playing during normal peak hours much more enjoyable, you are less likely to get tired kids staying up past their bedtime. Ranked ques 6-12 weekdays and 12-12 weekends  seems to be the most enjoyable and seems to be the best way to avoid bulk smurfs , also you can play blinds at any time and have mixed results.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-04-14T03:24:27.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how everyone thinks server \"X\" is the worst server without having experienced other servers. These things literally happen in every server and gradually decrease as you get into higher leagues. Obviously if you're in a bronze ranked match, there's gonna be way more trolls and feeder than higher leagues since its pretty much the bottom of the barrel and most people don't care about whether or not they lose since they can't be dropped any lower lol. This is the case with every team sport and not just with competitive online games so just stop crying over it and don't play competitively (ranked) if you don't feel you can handle this sort of thing. Also, there's no denying that the a significant percentage of the community is cancer, but there's also no doubt in the fact that there's also many players who are very pleasant and a joy to play with/against (again, just like any other team oriented sport or game).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-13T23:24:29.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some people must be soo unlucky... i cant remember the last tiem there was an afk on my team.
