Nothing compared to how I used to be. I don&rsquo;t claim to have &lsquo;reformed&rsquo; or anything as asinine as that because I&rsquo;ll never reform, I just learned to hold my tongue and not bother arguing with people that are quite honestly below me. I have played League of Legends since the closed beta&mdash;back when portraits were drawn by hand and characters had pizza feat and not big breasts. But it isn&rsquo;t really relevant because at the current time I feel rather pusillanimous about even posting this.\r\n\r\nI have no valid excuse or an excuse that would fly with Riot in the current state of the game. Riot Lyte would have a field day with most of my games and before the Tribunal I was infamous for being &lsquo;abusive&rsquo;. My sociopathy tended to shine in competitive games and I don&rsquo;t like losing. I don&rsquo;t like losing at all. I, in my own eyes, am perfect, no matter how badly I play. If the game is lost, it&rsquo;s not my fault and I tend to lash out verbally.\r\n\r\nI have said some pathetic things in the seven years that I have played this game. 32 permanently banned accounts for various reasons, some that I am absolutely ashamed to admit out loud. God, my given excuse for bans is simple toxicity when in most cases that is *not* the case and it has been other reasons. You see, back when this game was new and the MMR ladder was in place, I was sitting in the top thirty constantly, an accomplishment I am proud of. I slowly dropped and dropped and dropped. Whether it&rsquo;s because of age or I just became washed up, despite never being a professional gamer due to playing on 320 ping and being hindered in every aspect. If Akali or Annie were banned, and I didn&rsquo;t get them, then I was worse than a silver player.\r\n\r\nMy main account was permanently banned sometime in 2011, two years after release, and I wasn&rsquo;t the first player banned nor would I be the last. However, despite all the drama I manage to manipulate my way through support and get an unban for my account, that was never followed up and that caused me to *hate* Riot with a burning passion. You see, despite my petty hatred, I loved the game and that made my banning one hundred percent worse. I owned everything&hellip; absolutely everything. Every skin, rare or not, every champion, every rune&mdash;which is hardly an accomplishment&mdash;and I had around 313k IP. I played the game a lot (RIP my schooling life).\r\n\r\nYou see (God I say that heaps) I was asked to make a new account and level it to level twenty with no warnings, no bans and no valid reports. Despite what people would think, I did it. Not one toxic game, even when people intentionally trolled and made me want to strangle them and curse them until my fingers cramped, I. Did. It. And got nothing for my efforts as my support ticket was then denied and I got the message that Riot didn&rsquo;t unban accounts, despite the proof in the original ticket. What happened? The Rioter left Riot and the person who took over my appeal was worse than a feminist and seemed to hate me with a burning passion.\r\n\r\nI believe that&rsquo;s why I went from *toxic* to **toxic**. I simply didn&rsquo;t care when my account was banned. I used the level twenty account and got it to thirty and proceeded to ruin everyone&rsquo;s ranked games because they deserved it. 112 losses before Riot took action and even then it wasn&rsquo;t a permanent ban. A total of 175 losses, 175 games of running down mid and dying to the turret before Riot banned the account.\r\n\r\nWhy am I posting this now? Because this will be my last ever account. I&rsquo;ll never make another account again, nor will I use anyone else&rsquo;s account. I like to believe that I&rsquo;m getting better as a player, not as a human as I&rsquo;m still the bitter and cold person that I was seven years ago, perhaps more-so now, especially with my ability to lie effortlessly. I was a rather well-known forum troll on both NA and OCE, and I&rsquo;m sure you can already piece who I am, without even thinking. I really hope Riot cannot, even though my HWID and IP hasn&rsquo;t changed in many years.\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not sure how to sum this up without sounding vituperative about the whole ordeal. I know that this is a section for &lsquo;player behaviour&rsquo; but I feel as if my thread fits in this section perfectly. I know that all my banned accounts were my fault, even if I think that it&rsquo;s because if people didn&rsquo;t play like bronze trash and tilt me, I wouldn&rsquo;t swear, and that I&rsquo;ll most likely never change, instead I&rsquo;ll simply adapt.\r\n\r\nBefore I hit submit, I just want to say that all bans are *your* fault. You won&rsquo;t ever get banned for having one bad game. This is coming from someone with 32 permanently banned accounts and a few with over 1,000 game chat restrictions (later permanently banned).\r\n\r\n&lt;insert a poignant farewell message&gt;","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-16T03:48:53.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You might not know it, but you've completely reformed :)\n\n+ Being reformed isn't about accepting trolls. \n It's not about accepting injustice from **Riot** support. \n It's not about bottling up your anger and resentment with the game. \n  \n  _Being reformed has absolutely nothing to do with any of that._\n \n**Being reformed is about treating others with decency and controlling your emotions.**\n__*\n\nI'm glad you're making this last step to never be banned again. \n\nGood luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-17T04:27:09.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I support this campaign, where can I sign up?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-16T11:58:53.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am with you on this one. 5, FIVE years of playing and being a %%%% only some of the time, and having some really terrible ass games, the worst I have ever gotten was a chat restriction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-16T03:59:48.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually never been banned, *received warnings through bullshit*.\nBut back in beta (I'm with you) I was toxic, extremely compared to what I am now.

Troll builds, intentional feeding, bullying and abusing teammates and opponents until they ragequit, support ezreal, leaving games halfway through because I can't be fucked finishing them, taking smite as ADC to steal my own jungler's buffs from him, dual laning top just because. If you can think of something that will ruin the game for someone else I've probably done it. Yet, despite all of that I've never even had a chat restriction on any of my accounts.
