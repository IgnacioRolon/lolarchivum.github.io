To the best of my knowledge, most of the delay experienced in the alpha client is because it still has to interface with people using the old client. once it rolls out as the new client this of course is not an issue.\n\nThe whole point of an alpha is to test it, and unlike a beta, it is not already in a mostly ready state. I think you're expecting a little too much for an alpha given the circumstances, but ultimately, you have the option to switch back to legacy client at any time. If you're struggling that much in select then switch back to the legacy client until some things are fixed.\n\nFor me the alpha only takes 5~ seconds to lock in a champion and I haven't yet had a problem with chat so it's possible  you may be one of the unlucky ones struggling with it more than most.\n\nIt's also worth noting there is a board specifically for alpha client discussion here:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client","replies":[]},{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-14T02:51:10.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a friend that reported this.

If your friend is crashing in game it's an unrelated issue, and if they got a 20 min LPQ it's more than likely happened before. If it's happening a lot they should either post in Help & Support here on boards or submit a support ticket to try and get the issue resolved.\n\nThe perk of getting the alpha client is getting to try out new stuff early, with the caveat that things _**are **_ going to be clunky and buggy and glitchy because it's an _alpha_. Even if it was a beta, which is typically a release ready product content wise, it would still be buggy because that's the point of a beta, to bug test, functionality test, and for implementing QoL changes.\n\nAn alpha isn't meant to be a \"play on this new thing it's perfect\" because if that was the case they would just replace the legacy client with it, it's a \"hey we'll show you all this cool stuff if you help us find all the bugs and tell us what you love/hate so we can improve on it\".","replies":[{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-10-14T06:59:33.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=omEbusHa,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-10-14T04:03:58.523+0000)\n>\n> The game client and the splash client are a bit different.

However, I haven't used it in weeks as every time I do, my computer freezes in game, I never have this issue when I use the legacy client. So, although they are separate, the alpha client is still clearly the cause of my in game issue. Hoping a clean install will fix my problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-14T11:45:47.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, that is strange indeed. A clean install does the trick for most things so it's a pretty safe bet for a fix. I can't pretend to know all about it, not even close, but there _shouldn't_ be any difference once you're actually in game. Only thing I can think of is that maybe your alpha client was having authentication troubles or something. \n\nGood luck getting it fixed at any rate.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-14T01:49:29.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's in alpha though, there should be a way you can voice your feedback to Riot","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-14T03:52:33.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is in fact a link to submit feedback on the ALPHA tab of the homepage in the client itself.","replies":[]}]}]}
