I had no idea what was going on and it vanished for ten minutes and came back when I started another match. I regret that because I got a loss for it and I let down my team. Thankfully they were pretty understanding about it.\n\nMy router hasn't rebooted in an hour, according to the statistics for it. However, 'net connect has dropped twice and came up within 2 mins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-05-20T02:59:02.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you based?

After spending close to three hours waiting for tech support my friend texted me that link and it solved all my issues. Solved is an understatement as it's still happening and my router resets once every hour -- from the previous time of every 4 minutes.\n\nWhy does this happen on URF weekend. I'm so tilted now it's not even funny.","replies":[]}]}]}
