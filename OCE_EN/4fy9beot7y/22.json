Gotta figure you'd do that, but better to ask and make sure. If you have another email you could use, you could try that and see if that works. If it does, you can then try switching the email back to the current one and see if the verification works then (if you'd prefer it on that email). Beyond that, you're best bet is probably to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (I'd recommend the \"I need help with account management, data requests, or deletion\" option) regarding the issue.","replies":[]}]}
