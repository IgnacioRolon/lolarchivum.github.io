I began listing everything that I have done that would be a bannable offence. I then decided to share the list on the forums with you guys. I&#039;m done with the game, so I don&#039;t really care.\r\n\r\nI have 43 permanently banned accounts. That number changes frequently because some of those weren&#039;t mine and it&#039;s hard to remember what was mine and what wasn&#039;t.\r\n\r\n**Toxic behaviour**.\r\nThis one is pretty much the most obvious. Because I lack a filter, I tend to speak my mind and my mind is a terrible place full of hurtful thoughts and naturally, when people do bad things, they come out. But I cannot hide behind that excuse because I am a very morbid human and I don&#039;t see anyone as my equal. I&#039;m very racist, I&#039;m very opinionated, and when I insult someone, I want it to hurt as badly as possible.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that I have battled severe depression since I was eight, I have no qualms about telling other people to kill themselves and them that they&#039;re a waste of oxygen. It doesn&#039;t bother me to use their race and sexuality against them, despite being &#039;gay&#039;, not that I am anymore. I consider myself asexual now.\r\n\r\nI did it subtly, which is why it took me so long to get banned. Mention a country being bad, such as Australia, and the entire game just turns into a massive verbal war. Subtle racism is more powerful than flat-out racism, especially on the internet.\r\n\r\n**Boosting**.\r\nSomething I did frequently in 2012 - 2014. Most of the money I spent on Riot Points during that period was done by other people who paid me to boost them to Diamond. I found it ironic.\r\n\r\n**Scripting/Exploits**.\r\nThis one is obvious. I&#039;ve done both since 2012. While I didn&#039;t script on this account, I did have alts that were in high Diamond/Master due to scripts. I have scripted in games with Rioters and they&#039;ve complimented my mechanics. Another ironic moment. Scripting isn&#039;t worth the ban you get. The accounts last a few months and will be banned eventually. I just sold them off for money and smiled as some moron bought them and would be banned in a matter of weeks.\r\n\r\n**Feeding**.\r\nYou better believe that if my teammate was in his promos and appeared to be struggling, I would troll. It wasn&#039;t obvious like &#039;running it down mid&#039;. I would just simply force myself to play badly. Unorthodox picks and builds were my forte. While I still play Ashe top, it was the most tilting them to experience in your promo games.\r\n\r\nThe list could go on and on. From assisting the enemy team by telling them where my team were, where wards were placed, and what to build to counter certain champs to account sharing buying/selling.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not proud of my history with this game. I&#039;m not even sure if I want to post this.\r\n\r\nBut I am a pure example of why Riot&#039;s permanently banning strategy will never work as they think it will. As they saying goes: _do not fear the man with everything to give, fear the man with nothing to lose_.\r\n\r\nEach time they banned my accounts, I got progressively worse with how I acted and what I did. After a while, it became a game to me to prove that I could last longer and longer each time. I slowly stopped caring about a game that I once adored and it created what I am today.\r\n\r\nCheaters should go into a cheater queue. Abusive people into the same. Get my point? When people get banned, they just make a new account. Banning &#039;mains&#039; is never the answer because it just fuels and creates trolls that slowly do worse and worse things. They begin to search for ways to ruin games, much like I did.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s a reason most newer games are doing away with permanent bans. Keep the toxic people on one account and just limit them.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-23T14:43:00.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not like irl where bad shit happens and many people are literally punished for their bad luck and their desperation. No, not really, this is video game, where your actions are yours and yours alone. You're crediting your own downfall onto the game where you'd made the conscious choice to do the things that would get you a perma ban in, and continue to do so after such bans are handed. So tbh, I don't really feel bad reading about the vast majority of the ban records. Though I don't hate you or your admission of all this.\n\nBut to get to the meat, I don't think creating prisoner island is going to solve much problem. It imo only works on Dota2 because their accounts are tied to their Steam account where people put vastly more sense of attachment onto and the same thing most likely won't work here, where trolls and cheaters would still just end up creating new email/accounts easily to do whatever once they get bored of cannibalising their own kind. The only difference would be whether or not their accounts are remained active in all this, and that the amount of smurfs bloating the servers' database would be drastically reduced, but still in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't change all that much.\n\nSo no, I don't think it's that easy in this instance. \n\nBut I think on an overall level, instead of disproving the need for a perma ban system, you've pretty much justified why it should at least exist, though true the extent of its management should still get a look at at least you go that part quite alright.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-12-24T01:22:29.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beyondblue.org","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-12-24T00:03:19.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This post gave my aids cancer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-23T23:59:10.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quality shitpost","replies":[]},{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-12-23T20:27:09.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Tyler1 of OCE {{champion:119}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-12-24T20:55:14.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn op i tried to upvote for the cause but everyone here is so negative zzz\n\ngl in your future games man","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-23T13:01:11.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool story m8.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-12-23T13:53:24.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ctdOmWPg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-23T13:01:11.866+0000)\n>\n> Cool story m8.\n\n8m yrots looC","replies":[]}]}]}
