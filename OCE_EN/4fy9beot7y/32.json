This is something they learnt awhile ago, as their was a lot of server instability. This is usually 48 hours to ensure stability. \n\nHe definitely won't be released today. Sorry about that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-03T04:24:40.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annie Bots Wife,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=agT0hT7w,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-03T02:53:24.012+0000)\n>\n> triggered.\n> \n> So next week with a 4 day wait until he&#x27;s activated.\n\nWe might get lucky, I haven't seen or heard of any bugs with him on pbe so if all goes well he should be released on patch day","replies":[]}]}]}]}
