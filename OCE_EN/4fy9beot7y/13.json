I appreciate that you actually did what I asked and didn't just post logs with zero context. I like to think that I just blank out and my mind takes over and does what it wants and I don't realise it. I don't remember typing half of what I said in those games.\n\nI feel that my issue is that I simply give up far too easily and I cannot get back into the game. Despite the fact that I am a great player, mechanically, I am god awful when something goes wrong. As I have said before, I cannot actually mute people. I like to see what they say and if I can't, then I feel anxious about it. I like to think that a very small part of my mind likes having the last word, also.\n\nI'm not sure if you can, but when this ban ends can you apply a permant chat restriction without it effecting rewards? If I can't type to them, then I can't and I won't be hit with this issue in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-01T08:01:20.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I feel that my issue is that I simply give up far too easily and I cannot get back into the game. \n\nWhen I hit level 20 back in 2012, I started getting really competitive. To the point where I got mad if my friends made mistakes that cost us the game, and I gave up trying instead of playing it out. I was an a-hole, and it took me a long time to change. What I had to come to terms with, and what you might need to realize as well, is that you can't win every game. There is a winner and loser, and sometimes you're the latter - and that's OK.\nMake peace with that, and you'll start winning a lot more of those \"unwinnable\" games when you're not tilting yourself and your teammates off the face of the Earth by giving each other a hard time over mistakes. Surrender if that's what your team wants to do, but don't give up by focusing on mistakes rather than the game.\n\n> I cannot actually mute people. I like to see what they say and if I can't, then I feel anxious about it. I like to think that a very small part of my mind likes having the last word, also.\n\nI get what you mean, if I make a bad play that puts my team behind I may get anxious about how they might respond. But most players aren't going to waste everyone's time by setting their mouse aside and turning the game into a flame forum. The ones that do aren't worth anyone's attention. It's tough to get over, but you've got to try because your teammates will always get the last word on two dudes arguing by reporting them.\n\n> can you apply a permanent chat restriction\n\nChat restrictions serve two purposes:\n- to warn and reform players who are consistently unsportsmanlike (most chat restricted players never get another chat restriction)\n- to reduce the amount of harm an unsportsmanlike player can do in a given game.\n\nThe thing is: if a chat restricted player isn't reforming, then they're likely to keep using their limited chats for negativity and abuse which means they'll keep being reported anyway. Players who don't reform even while chat restricted, eventually end up permabanned. That is why you've got to focus on improving your own behaviour rather than relying on a partial shield like chat restrictions to prevent yourself from being banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-10-26T11:30:13.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aaaaaaaaaahahahahahahaha!\n\nGG, GTFO.\n\nWah, wah, I'm speechless.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-10-26T20:09:11.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kaboomblah,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=99W0Zvji,comment-id=0004000000010000,timestamp=2016-10-26T11:30:13.923+0000)\n>\n> Aaaaaaaaaahahahahahahaha!\n> \n> GG, GTFO.\n> \n> Wah, wah, I&#x27;m speechless.\n\nLol.

I was angry because no one listened to me. When I ask politely for the support to play passive, that does not mean to dive in at level 1 and die.\n4. This isn't a reportable offense. Riot have said multiple times they won't enforce the meta and I didn't troll. I still did more damage than half my team and had more gold.\n5. The 'BG' was because I didn't get my 1v1 with Kalista.

This way it should be easier to understand:\n\n1. People are all special snowflakes so you do have to be careful about being politically correct and not offending that part of this community and the name does make people less inclined to take you seriously. Heck I get alot of complaints about Nightjar because it sounds chinese (it's a small european bird) but what can you do. People in this community can and will be offended by everything.\n2. You pointed out them doing stupid things and you were generally picking on someone about losing a lane and people don't like this. If you do want to do this try to make it sound less critical and more constructive or people will report you left right and center.\n3. Unfortunately this happens and as much as I hate the bronze lvl1 towerdives and the lvl3 adc proxying behind enemy lines like a retard, they aren't going to stop and you just have to man up and stomach it or again people will report you and riot will just ban you.\n4. Yeah it kinda isn't but it doesn't add credibility to your cause and if you say anything slightly mean and salty then you'll just wrack up a higher numerical number of reports leading to a higher chance of being banned. Heck is most players had their chat history full checked I'm sure they'd all be banned, but basically more reports (even for stupid reasons) equals more ban risk.\n5. Riot still really really doesn't like BG and they aren't going to bother trying to guess the context.\n\nAlso main note: insulting idiots, even if they are idiots, stresses the entire team out and even if I'm not the one feeding, if one of my teammates starts getting angry about it, I get very tilted and I generally hate the person pointing it out more than the transgressor themselves. \n\nPS: You were in one of my placement matches, I played with you and even though you were pretty salty because you carried the game I didn't report you and I could empathise with your plight trying to carry the retards can be irritating but jesus even though I wasn't feeding and you weren't flaming me, I couldn't play the rest of the game because your anger was so tilting.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-10-26T00:16:40.108+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your IGN is Third Reich.\n\nFucking muppet.
