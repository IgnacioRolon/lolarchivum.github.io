It just becomes a brain-dead stomp, especially when that level 30 plays Lee Sin or Yasuo, clearly because they lack skill.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m watching a RL friend try and play the game. I actually feel bad for him versing a level 30 Yasuo toplane. So much so that he pretty much quit. Thankfully I was there and proceeded to dumpster the Yasuo, who in turn rage-quit for losing to a level 10.\r\n\r\nIf people wish to play with friends, make the lower level go up, not drag the 30 down and ruin new players trying to learn the game. The moment a smurf plays Yi, Lee, Yasuo, or Katarina, you know they&#039;re bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-19T09:54:51.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funnily enough, you'll find this to be an incredibly unpopular perspective (the final statement). If people wish to play with friends, it's much better to benefit a certain team for having a higher level than for a lower level to suffer versing a higher level.\n\nFor instance, your example had a friend (who lets say is Lv.5) verse a Lv.30 since most likely the Lv.30 was paired up with a Lv.5 on the enemy team. I'm assuming everybody else is hovering around Lv.5. So it's very clear that the enemy team have a huge advantage; the advantage is on the team with the premade, especially since he was also playing Yasuo which everybody knows is a hardcore snowballer. So your team of all Lv.5s suffer, whereas their 4x Lv.5 + 1x Lv.30 wins (this is an example). So the winners are 4 Lv.5s and 1 Lv.30 and the ones who lose are 5 Lv.5s.\n\nNow lets bring this to a Lv.30 scenario where one team suddenly has a Lv.5 friend premade. Now the situation becomes 4x Lv.30 + 1x Lv.5 against 5x Lv.30s. The obvious advantage is the team without the premade as your team has a handicap of a teammate. Lv.30s can easily outplay a Lv.5 and thus can get fed off the Lv.5 which makes it harder for them to enjoy the game since instead of having one Lv.30 dominate, he has to face 5 Lv.30s who most likely all have the ability to destroy him. So the winners are the 5x Lv.30s and the losers are the 4x Lv.30s + 1x Lv.5.\n\nTo compare the losers of both scenarios, Riot would much rather have 5 Lv.5s lose out rather than have 4 Lv.30s lose out simply because Lv.30s have proven by their level that they are pretty much proper players of the game whereas Lv.5s don't have much exposure to the game yet to make a decision on staying or not. Another point is, is that many people who PVP at Lv.5 are smurfs whereas newbies will usually play bot games until Lv.10 or so, but that's statistical and varies depending on individual.\n\nAll in all, you are frustrated because of a coincidence with had 1/5 chance. If there is a Lv.30 on the enemy team, there was a 1/5 chance he would lane against your friend. However if Riot puts him in a Lv.30 scenario, he has a 5/5 chance of being against a Lv.30. The math just makes sense. Unless of course you don't mind the enemy team picking on your friend at Lv.5 to get fed off him and that's assuming the other 3 strangers you were put in a match with don't mind either.\n\nSo ultimately, it makes sense that Riot's system works the way it does. Besides, Riot's pretty up there with the game, if this system you proposed were to actually be better, they would've implemented it by now. It's practically impossible that they haven't considered this, and the main reason why it isn't implemented, is obviously due to the fact that they already know it won't work.\n\nHope that clears things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-11-20T01:03:07.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, at least the low level person gets a chance against some people their level, rather than getting curb-stomped by full level-30 players","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-20T06:51:37.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh boy.
