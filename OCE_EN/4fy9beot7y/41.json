He's also not very strong by himself and needs a set up pre-6 for proper dueling so there's a window of weakness for when you want to all in him while his ghouls aren't up. He's also really bad at chasing kills. \n\nHe is a split pusher and isn't very useful without his ultimate in team fights.

(Not too sure about this since I haven't played him but) Goes oom if he uses his Q too frequently\n\nIt's about having proper knowledge of a champion's counterplay and disadvantages; if their weaknesses are ignored, any champ will appear OP.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-08T06:05:10.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to mention by simply looking at his kit he is weak to:\n\nMobile duelist: {{champion:58}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:236}} \n\nAll in fighters: {{champion:122}} {{champion:240}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:92}} \n\nWave clear: {{champion:34}} {{champion:120}} {{champion:63}}\n\nHis mana costs are very low on his Q in particular doe.

All Yoricks I have seen so far have been getting absolutely destroyed in lane and late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-09-08T07:22:17.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His ghouls are 5 gold each, last longer so easier to kill than Malz voidlings and do less damage, also i don't think they scale on any of his stats and have hard stats depending on his level. So you can farm them real easy. Nasus can also get stacks off them (friend told me this one.. so take with a grain of salt).\n\nThey also take AOE damage, So even a champ like Kayle wrecks them. They are only summoned with one ability, and if Yorick doesn't want to summon them it increases the time his Q takes to come off CD.\n\nHis wall is easy to break early on, and if you are all-in on him it kind of is your fault for letting him trap you when you 'think' you can take him, you need to KNOW you can take him before you trade, like you do with Irelia, Yas, Panth or Riven in top lane.\n\nHis ult is strong, very strong. So try not fight him when he has it up, or bait his ult, run then kill the ult. Not sure how much gold the ult gives you but if it is like Tibbers it should be 50gold. Also note, it isn't as strong as tibbers and locks on to close targets. So either wait until it is under tower (if you are melee) or range it down.\n\nHe is very reliant on HITTING you, so range champs destroy him early game. Also teemo hard counters him. Even at 6. Illaoi also destroys him as he will get him self in some stupid trades on her as he still is a melee champ.\n\nPunish him for last hitting with his Q. Every time he runs in he runs the risk of you dumping on his ass, wait until then and just run back after, his wasted a ton of his damage by using his Q.\n\nHis E (the slow) takes a while for it to land, it is easy to spot him using it, KEEP MOBILE against him. Move side to side not run directly from him, this will make his E nearly impossible to hit.\n\nHis W as said before is easy to kill. Also telegraphs hard. Any mobility move can get you out of it. Even Vaynes roll will get you out of the wall even if it is already up. It isn't like J4's ult, you DON'T need flash.\n\nHe is forced to build tanky. Most i see tend to stick to armor, so just hope you aren't AD heavy as his whole kit is amazing revolving around HP and armor. Kog and Vayne wreck him because of this. Also Teemo as i already stated just f's him in the butt if you do the on hit build with some AP/CDR.","replies":[]}]}
