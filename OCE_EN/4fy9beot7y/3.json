OCE: G1 - 4.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish that I could find a solid and perfect reasoning behind this. On North America, I sit in Diamond without an issue, generally bouncing between Diamond 2 and 3. I have hit Diamond 1, but I soon fell back into Diamond 2 as my ping was too high to deal with a lot of the plays that happened. So, how come I&rsquo;m on a server with lower ping, which should increase my ability tenfold, and yet I cannot get past Gold 1?\n\nSo, what could the issue be? Mechanics wise I&rsquo;m decent, decent enough to be able to kite and combo with almost every champ. I can play every role effectively, with mid being my strongest. Do I get tilted? No. That&rsquo;s probably my biggest strongpoint. I cannot be tilted in the sense that I start feeding or playing badly. If I could, then I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to climb so high on NA.\n\nWhy is a Diamond 2 player stuck in Gold when others go 18/2? Simple. I need a competent team to climb. I need a team that doesn&rsquo;t ignore pings. I need a team that responds to the map. I need a jungler that actually plays the role and not sits in the jungle all game claiming that&rsquo;s what they do. I need an ADC that can attack move and doesn&rsquo;t just stand there and auto.\n\nIt&rsquo;s impossible to climb solo on this server, and Dynamic Queue made it 100% harder. It&rsquo;s easy to explain, actually. With a team, I&rsquo;m a Diamond level player. Solo, I&rsquo;m a Gold level player.\n\nMaybe another issue is how toxic this server is. If I ask for a role, I will not get it. I have asked for mid 30+ times and I was either ignored or told no. Flat out, no. It didn&rsquo;t matter if I, at that stage, had a 92% win rate in middle lane. Troll teams in Gold are so frequent that I&rsquo;m amazed anyone can climb out of this server. Currently, in Ranked, I am on an 11 game loss streak, ignoring the one Sona win because I won the last team fight with an ult that stunned them all. This has spanned over days, weeks, and months.\n\nIf you go to lolking, and look at my graph, you&rsquo;ll see that I feel only once prior to this and it was corrected in a day. That small gap was because I lost one game at midnight. You&rsquo;ll see now that it has dropped, massively. It looks like North America&rsquo;s economy right now. If you go to op.gg and look at the ranked tab, you&rsquo;ll see my games. And I&rsquo;m serious when I say I don&rsquo;t go 18/2. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I don&rsquo;t roam. In most of my games I roam botlane and gank them, same with top.\n\nI have no idea how and why I&rsquo;m losing so many games. I shouldn&rsquo;t be losing these, no matter what. I went from plat 3 MMR to like Gold 5. Are these losses my fault, or the fault of my team? I&rsquo;m going with the latter. Despite this being a team game, I always feel like I&rsquo;m 1v9ing in the match. There&rsquo;s no point being nice and sharing kills. Denying myself kills puts me behind and if I can&rsquo;t carry, then we lose.\n\nAnother point is that I can land a 5man stun and 9/10, no one will follow up on the stun and they leave me to die. They'll circle around the fight and then leave when it actually starts...","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken McNugget","date":"2016-09-11T23:08:07.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shouldn't have any trouble in gold if you deserve diamond","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-12T00:10:22.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think he is saying he has a problem in Gold.

It was thrown in plain sight? Just run past it then die.\n\nThere's one good person on my team and the other 3 are horrible. Whenever I play support, the ADC is horrendous. Whenever I jungle, all lanes lose. Whenever I top... forget it.\n\nI understand there's a lot of \"My teams suck, I deserve to be higher,\" going on, but for me, that's the honest truth as I am higher than what I am on this server. No matter how nice and friendly I am, these people just do bot level crap. It's been the same for the past 15 games.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken McNugget","date":"2016-09-12T14:50:49.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are almost always things you could have done better that would have an effect on the outcome of the game.

High Gold and Low Platinum is extremely hard to climb in Oceania because of the overwhelmingly high volumes of toxicity. In this elo in particular, toxic players, trolls, and players who are too self-centred are quite prominent, especially the few foreigner chinese players (don't represent all of China or Asia) who ALWAYS want things their own way. Try finding a group of friends to play with, that way you will find yourself winning a lot more. If not, try playing a hyper carry such as Akali with Hextech Gunblade or Pantheon. Mute your teammates the second they say something toxic and revolve the game around what's most important - winning, even if that means to let go the blue buff that your chinese AD Carry is attempting take even though he doesn't need it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Teemo","date":"2016-09-12T03:32:17.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel bad for you if you are getting **unlucky teams** but you should always be focusing on how much impact you are having on each game rather than your team mates feeding. **Don't worry about loss games too much**, as long as you are improving and finding your mistakes you will eventually climb, **consistency** is key. \n\n**I'd recommend finding a good duo partner to climb out of gold with** :)\n\n**if you main mid perhaps find a good jungler that can carry or a top laner**\n\nI got out of gold in 3 - 4 days, Went from placements to gold 5 then from gold 5 skipped to gold 3 and also skipped again from gold 3 to gold 1 (I mained {{champion:17}}  top on a smurf account)","replies":[]}]}
