I'm pretty upset.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Edit: permanently*\n\nAfter my previous fourteen day ban, I played cautiously. I stopped speaking as much as possible unless I was spoken to and I think it worked for a while. I&rsquo;m sure I was still reported for things, such as feeding or negativity. I know I was negative, but it was mainly stating the obvious. Games with a leaver or someone intentionally feeding. I know it would have been wise but sometimes I just can&rsquo;t help but say &lsquo;GG&rsquo; after a mistake or something tilting.\n\nI said ages ago that this was going to be my last account and I&rsquo;ll probably honour that. I understand that many Rioters may be cheering and I&rsquo;d probably be cheering as well. It&rsquo;s not a secret that I&rsquo;m a toxic player, but I can&rsquo;t help it that I speak my mind. I did ask for a permanent chat restriction as I&rsquo;m vastly less toxic when I have to limit what I say. I have attempted to turn off /all or mute people, but I get severe anxiety about it &ndash; I have brought this up with Rioters and they did nothing.\n\nNo one has actually explained how I&rsquo;m being toxic. Riot&rsquo;s never been like, &ldquo;Woah, hey, you need to stop being negative!&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just an automated chat restriction and then they move on.\n\nI don&rsquo;t have much else to say.

Lux against Yasuo is such an easy lane and Yasuo has a lot of counterplay, ofc i wouldn't expect someone form NA to have the braincells to know that but sure, Calling Zed and Lee a \"Brainless\" Champ is so out of the question as i've seen 0 games of yours with either of them. In Fact you have below 50% win rate in an Elo you claim to be above which is kinda depressing people would believe you being a \"Diamond 90%\" win rate. Blamming the enemy champ for your own mistakes is a low blow especially since you're \"Diamond\" and you should know better, there are a lot of things that Lux can do against Yasuo and for 1 in involves skill in which i presume you do not have based on this Text. Yasuo has been nerfed and thats all he's been getting, tell me the last time he got buffed, what last year? Yasuo's Windwall is on a 23 - 18 sec cd lv 1 - 5 and only last for 4 sec so the fact that you think that is OP shows how \"Diamond\" you are. And no you're not bored, you're 100% salty. Reading further i can see you have trouble poking Yasuo which is Ironic seeing that Lux has one of the best pokes in game next to Xerath and Varus. Did you know that Yasuo has a 48% Win rate currently across all Elos? You just think he is OP cause you 1. don't know how to verse him 2. Afraid that if you do beat him, your team mates will just feed him, and not because he is actually OP. It's funny how you're talking about getting someone banned but here you are getting banned, a bit Ironic on your part but ok. You bitched and whine the whole game and on multiple occasions called players no-skill/brainless and basically just slammed the whole of OCE calling them inferior. Now i get how this is a joke like \"EU LUL\" but i hardly think you're joking when you say that, and if you say Masters on OCE is Plat on NA and you're Gold on OCE, does that mean you're Bronze in NA? Also, Junglers DON'T need to gank, for anyone, there is nothing that says Junglers are obliged to gank for laners so i don't know what you're complaining about. For a \"Diamond\" player you sure talk a lot, let me remind you, you are in a team that you have no idea of and you're trying to reason with them on why you're feeding? DO you think they care? They don't know you, you don't know them, why bother trying to reason with them, at the end of the day, they will forget about you, and you will forget about them, you're not bonded, you're not friends, who cares? They don't care if you're feeding and you shouldn't either, everyone has bad games but the fact that you chose to make this bad game even worse by trying to prove yourself therfore making yourself more stupid. Toxicity is a choice, and you chose it, it's not about the words you use, it's about how and when you use it. The worst part is you spent $700, trying to prove yourself to people you don't know and never will know for what? To get a little satisfaction? To show that you're not a feeder?
