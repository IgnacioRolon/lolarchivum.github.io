I think the big thing here is that the diamond (unsure) and plat (confirmed) were queueing with some of the pre-30s on their team. Because matchmaking tries its best to match you up with other players that aren't yet 30, it probably didn't register the rank disparity. \n\nIts ok though, being challenged is how you get better quickly ♥","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-19T00:09:53.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see no problem there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-18T22:43:34.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it when I come across diamond + in normals.
