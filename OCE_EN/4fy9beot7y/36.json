But I had the name &#039;Annie Bot&#039; and when I attempted to log into the account, so I can transfer the name over, it forced me to change my name. Naturally, I was displeased and not sure on what to do so I just closed the client and did a quick search. It appears if someone else _stole_ my name.\r\n\r\nRiot please, the account was level eleven, one level over the level ten limit, when I stopped playing on it. Why&#039;d my account name be changed?\r\n\r\nNow I have to add this guy and see if he&#039;ll give me the name back, seeing as this is the Internet, I&#039;ll most likely be told to kill myself or have to pay him/her for it.

I never even got an email about my name being changed automatically. I was just changed. At first I thought that maybe it wasn't allowed and that Riot forced a name change, but if someone else has it, then it cannot be accurate.\n\nI'm not sure whether I should contact support or not, because I can already guess what their answer will be.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-04-03T05:51:40.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annie Bots Wife,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XhMzEE10,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-04-03T05:46:49.120+0000)\n>\n> Hardly -- http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Annie+Bot\n> I made it the moment OCE opened, played it every now and then and left it at level 11.

I just checked it out and looks like that account is still active, so someone is actually using the name you should have been using. And if you did create it back in 2013 and haven't played on it since that year, your name of course would have became available for people to take. This person has done nothing wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-04-03T05:56:31.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PRIMAWESOME,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XhMzEE10,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-03T05:51:40.761+0000)\n>\n> Hardly?

If I knew that I would have got it to thirty, but I saw no point in doing that when it should have been _safe_ at level eleven. Riot didn't send me an email at all regarding the account, and I know that because the email I used gets no emails besides from League of Legends, which currently has the welcome to League email still on the first page of emails.\n\nRiot didn't even let me know that I could have lost the name, that is the issue here. I was given no warning and they just took my name.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-04-03T06:31:07.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Annie Bots Wife,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XhMzEE10,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2016-04-03T05:56:31.884+0000)\n>\n> Two games in the span of a year isn't active.\n> \n> You don't understand, names aren't meant to be taken if they're over level ten.
