The moment we patched to version 6.10, the patch was completed. We downloaded and installed the patch that Taliyah _should_ have been released in. As I said, it's poorly worded and phrased.\n\nAs for your comparison... that's awful. If Riot stated that we would get URF in December, I would be confused on why they gave no precise date, as they should. But on average, it would mean around the 15th of December, as you should assume the middle -- knowing Riot, it'd be the end of December.\n\ntl;dr: The patch is already _completed_, they're just delaying parts of it for some unknown reason.\n\nIt really should say that Taliyah will be activated at a later date, not that she'll be released with the patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-05-18T05:27:23.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The patch isn't something that is rolled out overtime.\n\nNever said it was, but until we reach patch 6.11 we're in patch 6.10.
