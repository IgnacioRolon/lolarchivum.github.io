If you reduce the duration of windwall if makes it a little more dangerous for him to fight the adc and skillshot champs and give them a bit more of a chance. He gets destroyed by alot of top laners and can be strongly counterpicked but I feel he still needs a small nerf like that. Like take reduce the windwall duration to 3s or something but a cast delay would cripple him as a squishy melee assassin fighter.","replies":[{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-31T12:58:48.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zmkQG0hA,comment-id=000d0000,timestamp=2016-07-29T01:44:50.759+0000)\n>\n> i feel windwall needs a shorter duration (like sivir spellshield 1.5s, needs to be timed perfectly or rip) since it lasts a bit too long imo. I don&#x27;t like laning against yasou but i feel he is a complete champion that is just a little stronger than most champions if used right.

Whilst I feel any other nerf would ruin him, shaving .75s on windwalsl duration would make him a little more manageable for adcs to handle  (since let's face it adc is still an extremely hard role with the previous assassin meta if your support can't peel right). \nWith his high play rate and all the community calling for a nerf, I feel he's going to get nerfed eventually; and I feel this type of nerf wouldn't be as crippling as a damage nerf, the width of windwall, it's cd or even the type of projectiles it can block. I'm not saying you can't play around his windwall and a number of counterpicks don't even care much about it. I'm just saying if you had to nerf something then I'd say if you nerfed it's duration, the nerf would be small, not very noticable except for adcs and it wouldn't affect players who master the clutch windwalls.\nOn another note, for certain matchups it's not really viable to play around the windwall since the abilities it's used to block often have around the same cd as windwall; but I don't see why people don't counterpick yasou more since there are alot of hard counters that can make it very difficult for even a good yasou to outplay you.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-28T10:36:50.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What would you rather;\n\nCurrent yasuo\n\nor\n\nPassive: Yasuo has 30/40/50/60% chance to deal 25/50/75/100% bonus damage on auto attacks \nQ: yasuo does a single spin on the spot knocking up all enemy champs in the area (550) for 1 second - 5 sec cd\nW: Passive: (OH WHAT MANA) mana costs are reduced by 10/20/30/40/50% Active: yasuo uses his wind wall (last 3 sec) of complete balancedness - 20/18/16/14/12 sec cd\nE: Yasuo dashes forwards gaining 10% armor, this is further increased by every enemy hit (minions give 1%) (no cap) last 2 sec - 8/7/6/5/4 sec cd\nR: yasuo lifts an enemy champion into the air for 1.5 seconds, dealing heavy damage to the target, then 50% more to surrounding enemies on landing. 80/55/30 sec cd\n\n\nFixes every issue you ever had with him\nNo more double crit, no shield, he has mana, no infinite dashes, he can't 5 man ult off malph knockup and be \"oh so op\" wall is shorter (oh no I was just complaining about that too, what a bargain!) \n\nLets also add a new item to the game which adds an extra level to ult (oh dayum lv 4 ults? sign me up)","replies":[{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-07-28T11:39:36.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That just doesnt make him Yasuo anymore, you are completley removing what makes him different to other popular champions, and unless you're in bronze and cant simply walk into the jungle instead of up your wave when being chased by him, and punishing him for trying to make flashy plays instead of abusing his scaling and damage then you're just being an idiot. dont take this as a wall of text trying to defend current yasuo. its just simple things you dont consider when in those situations","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-28T11:40:43.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PuncakesssR,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zmkQG0hA,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2016-07-28T11:39:36.247+0000)\n>\n> a wall of text trying to defend current yasuo. \n\nI will take it as that, its you and me vs them now","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-29T01:37:23.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the new champion you have described is wukong with a confusing passive, cho'gath q and windwall; and it sounds really really weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PuncakesssR","date":"2016-07-29T00:20:51.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think you understand what im trying to say.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FxH","date":"2016-07-28T13:27:49.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Double crit makes it so with just one item he does sustained damage that looks like burst due to crit feelsbadman","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-07-28T10:44:38.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"either make it that his passive give him 50% bonus crit and not 100% or lower his crit damage % from what it is not to 150% and 140%","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-28T11:00:14.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nazzareno,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zmkQG0hA,comment-id=000b,timestamp=2016-07-28T10:44:38.579+0000)\n>\n> either make it that his passive give him 50% bonus crit and not 100% or lower his crit damage % from what it is not to 150% and 140%\n\nhe already has 20% reduction on aa damage and 50% on q to the original damage","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-28T07:18:54.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my suggestion to the riot balance team is just to make it have a shorter duration, like sivir spellshield; to reward clutch windwalls more and reward hamfisted I'm going to 2v1 the immobile adc and skillshot support, whilst they can't fight back, less.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-07-28T06:23:53.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windwall can also block AAs, but Veig has a long delay on his wall??","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-28T07:16:11.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's because veigar e needs counterplay and imagine how scary he would be if event horizon was instacast.
