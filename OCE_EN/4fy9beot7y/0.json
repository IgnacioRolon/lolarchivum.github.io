I dont think naming and shaming is honestly probably pretty good for the community as people know who and who not to play/take seriously. if someone is that much of an asshole then the community should know about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-08T22:47:38.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_There's a few issues with calling out toxic players:_\n\n+ **It glorifies them. **\n\n A lot of these people take pride in knowing they are the worst members of the community. So they absolutely love it when people call them out for being toxic. **Tyler1** is a great example of this.\n\n+ **It leads to witch hunts**\n\n Imagine someone is a decent guy, but he has an off-game. He flames the team then AFKs. Someone screenshots that and posts it here to shame him.\n\n A witch hunt starts, and he starts receiving messages from people in the community harassing him and sending him death threats. Not everyone has iron skin for this stuff, and it could lead to him hurting himself or even worse.\n\nIn short, we really shouldn't trust your average League player to pass judgement on people. They're likely to take things out of context and don't have data on that player's past behaviour like **Riot** does.\n\nI hope that makes sense :D","replies":[{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-09T13:59:18.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ITP: Riot = Illuminati.\n\nPeople = Masochists.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-09T22:42:56.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://www.spyderonlines.com/images/wallpapers/illuminati-pictures/illuminati-pictures-20.png","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-09T10:47:35.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=FeR6zMHb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-07-08T07:11:21.041+0000)\n>\n> Hey man,\n> \n> I removed your link because it was breaking our naming and shaming rule.
