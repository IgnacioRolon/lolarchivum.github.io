I wonder if it was the Akali game where the ADC spent 90% of the game stealing my CS and then I got reported for asking him to be reported. Maybe it was the Lux game where Zed stole my lane and then refused to leave. Or, just maybe, it was the LeBlanc game where my lane was once again stolen by a duo and I was made to be the bad guy.\n\nI&#039;m so excited, like a small child on Christmas morning, to see what I did wrong this time. At least now I can buy Viktor!

I just have this feeling every game that someone will get triggered at what I do and I'll get reported.
