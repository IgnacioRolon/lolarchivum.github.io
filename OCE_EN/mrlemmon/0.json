But Riot i really hope you can help me with this issue. \r\n\r\nI have recently been having trouble getting past the loading screen into the actual game and majority of the time when i try to play a game i will be the first to come on the loading screen and everyone else is not connected then people gradually connect saying they have loaded to 100% then min slowly loads usually getting stuck on one percentage or another until it gets into the 90%&#039;s and it slowly increases very ever so slowly until it gets to 100% then freezes there. sometimes it gets through and the game has already been going for 5 mins other times i have to close the loading screen and reconnect. going through the whole process again. due to these errors i have now got to wait 20 mins to queue. \r\n\r\nit makes me very sad cause up until a few weeks ago i was connecting fine. i have been playing league since the beta and have always been a guy that treats people with respect and never put people down if they are bad. or doing worse then me instead i try to help them out. so please riot help me out here!","replies":[{"poster":"Vladex Striker","date":"2015-04-10T05:02:57.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same issue here, I'm getting this error but after exiting and relaunching client I am able to get back into the loading screen and load into the game.
