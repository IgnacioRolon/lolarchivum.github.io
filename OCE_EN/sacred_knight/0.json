I HARD-CARRIED the early game (8 asists when my team only had 10 kills), but my internet craped after that to the point when i had more than 1150. so there was no one i could&#039;ve kept playing thus i tried to dc and then reconnect in hoping that the ping would go down. i reconnected after we had won the game. but i was somehow banned. what is this riot? it just doesn&#039;t seem fair to me as i wasn&#039;t leaving the game intentionally or throwing, in fact i did the exact opposite by carrying my team&#039;s heavy ass. so pls unban me for pity&#039;s sake.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-03-14T09:15:58.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your disconnection probably caused the _automated_ leaver buster system to trigger. \nUnfortunately, this happens sometimes. The placement in LPQ indicates that you probably have left a couple of games before this, or because this was a ranked game & they are treated more harsh than norms/bot games. \n\nSending a ticket to support in this case will not do anything for you as they do not remove players from LPQ under **any** circumstances.\n\n> CAN YOU TAKE ME OUT OF LOW PRIORITY QUEUE?\nNo. We will not take your account out of low priority queue under any circumstances.\n\n\nIf you have any more questions, [check out the leaver buster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ)\n\nNote: Im assuming you were placed in the low priority queue and not banned, if you were banned, you will have received an email outlining why you have been punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sacred Knight","date":"2016-03-13T11:36:43.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Sacred%20Knight","replies":[]}]}
