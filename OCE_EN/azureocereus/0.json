What I found strange was I never encountered any bronze players throughout those 10 games, not a single one. I would check after every game who I got matched with. They were all either high silver, low gold, or unranked players. Why is it that I was never matched with bronze? I doubt it has to do with my normal MMR since it has a pretty bad win loss ratio. Can someone explain?","replies":[{"poster":"Imasukai","date":"2014-11-26T15:21:21.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're account has no ranked games played on it, it sticks you at an MMR of what it determines to be the average, which I believe is Silver 1. So, naturally, during your provisionals, you're going to be playing with/against people who are within a reasonable MMR range of Silver 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Azureocereus","date":"2014-11-26T15:23:50.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But why do so many of my friends get matched with bronze or end up in bronze if that's the case?

You will almost certainly be placed with Silvers. Depending on the outcome of that match you will be placed accordingly due to the MMR points you will receive following the match. For each win you receive an estimate average of 50 MMR points. Same for each loss. The best equation I can give you is:\n\nBASE MMR (1200) + (ranked wins x 50) - (ranked loses x 50) = Placement MMR\n\nIf you win your first ranked game you will be placed with higher MMR summoners. Considering you were already placed with silvers in your first match you will more than likely continue playing with silvers. In my second provisional match I was playing with golds. The more you win the higher the players you will be placed with. The more you lose, the lower they will be. So it is entirely possible for you to never encounter bronze players during provisionals.\n\nIf you are playing provisionals with previous ranked history then the principle is still the same. Only the equation changes for your placement MMR.\n\n(existing MMR [available estimate at OPGG] + base MMR [1200] / 2) + (ranked wins x 50) - (ranked loses x 50) = placement MMR\n\nHope this helps.\n\nKind Regards,\nlols =)","replies":[]}]}
