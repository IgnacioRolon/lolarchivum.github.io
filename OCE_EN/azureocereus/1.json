If she's so bad, why do I manage to carry so many games with her? I know she has no cc or escape, but she is really strong in lane and can easily 1v2 a gank early on if she has ult, assuming she's not behind. Even if she's losing lane, as long as she gets enough farm, she can still blow up squishy targets. Her tower pushing is really insane, too. I don't see how she's bad in teamfights since she can dash in, get a few hits and ult and deal a ton of AoE damage while being **untargetable**. I'm really consistent with her, too, unless it's a counter matchup. Most of the games I've played with Fiora ended up with me being really fed and helping win the game. Perhaps this might just be since I'm playing in low elo (bronze-silver) and they don't know how to deal with a Fiora, or because it's normals. Anyway, I don't think she's as bad as people say she is. She's really fun to play, powerful, and really annoying to lane against.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/champions/userName=azureocereus \n^check normal stats","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-13T10:04:30.610+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"she's an extremely low skill cap champ with a ridiculous high reward cap, in saying that she has no counterplay to cc and is pretty useless late game if she isnt uber fed or split pushing","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-13T14:07:42.902+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok...
