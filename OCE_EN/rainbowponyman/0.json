Not really looking for some militant Napoleonic commander that wants to plan next level strats and review post-game videos. Pretty happy to play normals, ranked or arams. Play all roles, except mid. I don&#039;t really care about ranked league etc, so if anyone actually reads this, add me.\nGold III right now","replies":[{"poster":"xDonMegadrivex","date":"2015-11-23T04:37:28.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to add me always keen for a few games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Equinux","date":"2015-11-23T04:16:23.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya, I'm gold 4 and in the same boat.
