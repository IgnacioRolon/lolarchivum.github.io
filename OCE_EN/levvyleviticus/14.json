Been to them all and it's quite standard to swear duriong conversation.Take this into consideration. I worked at a restaraunt and I was waiting tables, I dished out food to someone sitting and his friend thought it was his and he told me \"oh, that's not yours khunt\" he laughed because he thought it was his and I obviously laughed and when it came to bringing him his food, I told him \"that's not yours khunt.\" He laughed he knew it was a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-06T11:21:12.447+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">#in comtempt\n\nUsing %%%% in conversation with your friends is very different from using %%%% to abuse someone.

Ppl who are friends and family casually swear in sentences all the time. The issue is the bot has no context. You can casually swear and get detected and banned if someone reports. You can joking jest with ur mates and get banned if someone else reports you.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-05T06:27:58.230+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"No, swearing in comtempt meaning they do so with intent to make the other person angry.

What I am saying is just that. The only thing that matters is the detection bot.\n\nIf someone swears casually or towards a friend but uses one of the words written in the bots naughty list they can then be instant 14 day'd if they get unlucky and someone else reports them. I think the issue is that the detection system suddenly kicked it up a notch around last season sometime. Now ppl who weren't getting any kind of warning and thought their behaviour was fine before get an unlucky report and get 14 day'd out of nowhere. There isn't enough clarity with regards to the system as it is now.\n\nRiot needs to send some kind of message to the client (I am sure new client can do it) that says something along the lines of \"Hey our chat detection bot is a hard-ass now and here is a list of words and behaviours that will get your account nuked\".\n\nAlso different issue but I think the ban system in general is terribly tiered and fails miserably at what it should be doing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-04T23:25:00.087+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"no, they're complaining that 14 day bans are triggered by incredibly minor infractions with no escalation through the formal punishment tiers and player behaviour are being kinda dicks about it because they trust the bots absolutely but bots just look for the word and not the context.\n\nPeople are not complaining about other people being banned / suspended for genuine toxicity. People are complaining about the fact that the system is hypersensitive and that there is genuine punishment overkill from the new system which has, since about august, been coming down hard on otherwise committed and positive players who genuinely care about the state of the game.\n\nDont conflate the genuine concerns many people have over the ridiculous state of the punishment system with a few crybabies shedding a few tears because they were punished appropriately. They are two different issues.\n\nI can only hope you say something innocuous and get a 14 day suspension so that you understand the depth of the problem and can contribute to the discussion in a meaningful way.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-01-05T22:22:28.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have been one of those people that got a ban (14 day for for saying kys and %%%), and i totally agreed with why the bot gave it to me, no previous chat restrictions, and i'm just trying to work back up already, and when these people show the chat logs, yeah ofc it looks only like maybe a chat restriction, but people need to get on with it if it's a 14 day ban, but straight up permas i understand why people would be angry.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-05T22:35:23.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LevvyLeviticus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EUzazjcA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2018-01-05T22:22:28.019+0000)\n>\n> I have been one of those people that got a ban (14 day for for saying kys and %%%), and i totally agreed with why the bot gave it to me, no previous chat restrictions, and i&#x27;m just trying to work back up already, and when these people show the chat logs, yeah ofc it looks only like maybe a chat restriction, but people need to get on with it if it&#x27;s a 14 day ban, but straight up permas i understand why people would be angry.\n\nAgreed tiers for punishment are appropriate for otherwise unblemished accounts.\n\nOtherwise if you go straight to 14 days, it is two strikes and you're out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-06T01:45:49.712+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you got a 10 game chat restriction for hate speech though, what message does that send?
