The only thing that remains is the Nexus itself. What do they do? Three of them rush the Nexus and all die, giving away Baron. This wasn't enough to win the game for the opposition of course. \n\nBut second time around it happens, and that's game over boys, learn some simple war strategy you bunch of noobs. While you're at it you might like to pay attention to pings and watch the minimap more. Oh and place some wards down while you're at it.\n\nAll they had to do is HAVE SOME BLOODY PATIENCE, and wait for the entire team to get in the enemies base, and then... SIT THERE DOING NOTHING. Thats right, you don't have to do anything really. Shepherd the supers in and watch the game win itself.\n\nSo yeah, you know there is a meme about oce throws, it happens so often because of poor macro understanding. I mean you don't even have to play league of legends to understand a simple thing of not fighting the enemy when they are at their strongest. Or when you have the option of wasting time running to a fight where the enemy are stronger, instead of TRADING objectives instead. Or prioritising what objectives are more important for the team at that given moment. When the option is so obvious there is only one way to play it. Stuff like that is **basic** war strategy.\n\nI mean this was the lowest of the lows, but even when you watch challenger games you see a bunch of throws cos people think they are mechanical gods and can xpeke the nexus before putting their brain into first gear. Or because they are fed, they think mechanics will help them win a  1 v 5. And late game death timers prove them wrong again and again.\n\nUse brain before mouse!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-26T00:34:59.342+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If one player on the team is fed and the other 4 are not, the other 4 should not be fighting when the fed player is not involved, and they are throwing the game.

This also makes them much less likely to follow calls from complete strangers, especially if that stranger is 'just the support'. \nWhich I am, as a Support Main, 90% of the time. \nThe other 9% I'll be ADC; an ADC that can't lashit hit for shit but understands positioning and wave control; that knows how to freeze a lane just outside my tower giving me a safe place to farm and poke; that knows when to go for dragon and Baron and when no to; that knows to not 'chase like a Bronzie' into unwarded enemy jungle; to not dive the enemy under their tower at lvl1 (usually because I'm not stupid enough to be pushing the wave that far up in the first place.) I use builds/runes/masteries that take advantage of the *assumed* enemy ignorance and inexperience so, even if midgame I am down 6 kills, in a 1v1 situation I can generally kill them - or be very close to taking their HP to zero before I die and maybe earn a little respect for next time they face me lol Or in most cases their ego rears it's head and they start focusing me haha\nFunny Anecdote: Being exactly the above as MF, being something like 1/1/7, and vs'ing a fed 6/1/X Tristana (fed mainly off my gung-ho support and jungle with terrible engage positioning, and 1 kill off myself) and killing her in as many seconds when she thought she could come out of the fog of war and just walk up and hit me in the face and kill me. Unfortunately for her, I always ward and while she'd been roaming and chasing kills, I'd been splitpushing top and bot and my cs outweighed her KDA in gold value and this translated directly into damaging items bought. I had almost 100cs on her by that stage and had a Duskblade, Yomumus and a BotRK. I guess she didn't know where the Tab button was to check these things. Add runes consisting of armour pen, attack speed, and straight AD. I saw her, hit W, got in one auto then dropped an E on her head, and hit her with a Q as she Rocket Jumped to save her life. She died in the fog of war, where she had come from, and I only took one auto from her. \nAll she said in chat was 'How?'. \nBut, if you have to ask a question like that, then I don't have time to explain. \nFYI it was a combo of Left Click Attack Move (so I was not pissing about selecting her when she appeared, I was able to hit her immediately), Duskblade proc, Thunderlords proc and a lot of AD punch that got her HP down and killed her. She died so fast I didn't have time to use the active on BotRK. Or need to.\n\nThe other 1% of the time I'm stuck in either mid or top (since the start of this season I will dodge if I get jungle, I used to be Supp>Jungle>ADC but I simply do not like jungling anymore) and I usually play my 'pocket picks' of Swain or Morgana that are safe in those lanes vs the most likely champs I could be facing. These champs have good defenses - Morgs has her snare and her Black Shield while Swain has his snare and his E+Q is terrifying to low level enemy - and they both have excellent AOE waveclear which means, when in these lanes I don't like playing. I counter most champs because I can sit under my tower and 'play like a bitch'. Just stay safe, aa to get minions down and then waveclear for cs before my enemy can shove the lane into my tower so I don't get too far behind. I may not win lanes when I play like that, but I rarely lose lanes either. \nFor one, it means I am almost ungankable while the enemy is perpetually vulnerable the ganks from my own jungler because they have to push so far to simply cs. \nTwo, it tilts them more often than not with my increasingly bored and frustrated lane opponent not bothering to ward as they have have become more and more focused on trying to kill me. \nThirdly they will often towerdive me - and die - to try and kill me.\nAnd lastly they often simply roam looking for action which leaves me free to push the lane (denying them farm) and then following them because, mid or top, I always take teleport due to my very passive playstyle in lane. This is assuming the lane they go to has something safe-ish to tele to. If not I simply ping MIA then push and back or steal a little enemy jungle then back. \n\nBut regardless of which lane I'm in or what role I take, for one simple reason, I will have a champ that has good waveclear and can take down towers relatively quickly as most low ELO players simply do not understand the importance of keeping lanes pushed mid and late game. While my team are chasing the enemy through unwarded jungle or going on a 'see enemy, kill enemy (or try to)' sprees like coyotes chasing cats or trying to two-man the Elder Drake when we have all dragon buffs, I will be warding and keeping the lanes pushed as much as I can. Acing the enemy team and yelling 'ALL MID!' in chat while completely ignoring the enemies minion waves top and bot pushing into our base is a really good way to lose any advantage you just got. So I do my best to make sure that doesn't happen. My aim is to keep all lanes on the enemy side of the river at all times. I play ADCs and sololane champs with awesome waveclear and use Zz'rots on supports for that extra bit of help.\n\nI've had my team calling out in /all for me to be reported for 'never being in teamfights' or 'farming all game' because they don't know the difference between randomly farming and strategically pushing. And while they play the game of 'See Enemy, Chase Enemy' I will teamfight if it's there, but I wont chase one into a position that leaves me vulnerable as few people at this ELO understand Threat Priority or know how to peel, or even who they should be peeling for. I don't really care what they say about me. I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to learn, to improve, and ultimately, to win more games than I lose. And, while my team are being all butthurt in chat, they are completely ignoring, or oblivious to, the fact I'm doing my all to ensure all lanes are pushed to at least the other side of the river, if not right into the enemy base; and I've taken out quite a few towers or inhibs - either by pushing a lane and leaving minions to it or with a Zz'Rots or by hitting it myself; that I've taken us a few dragons, usually solo if ADC; and that I will clear the enemy jungle when retreating to deny them farm and buffs. The team usually takes care of mid, because PUSH MID! right? So I do my best to look after the lanes they are ignoring and other objectives they are oblivious to. \n\nMy winrate playing like this is over 50% though games like that are the minority as I try to play premade with friends who are competent players or I'd fast become homicidal. But if I do SoloQ then that's my fallback gameplan whether I'm ADC, solo laner or support if my team shows themselves to be the kind of players you don't want to play with. I also wont play with or befriend people who make basic mistakes and don't learn from them or refuse to take advice. I simply cannot be bothered. They might be the nicest people on earth but I'm too competitive for that unfortunately. I go into a game with the mindset that I might have to counter my own team as well as the enemy. And the above is how I do it. If my team turn out to be of the Non-Muppet variety then, wicked, I can play a normal straight forward game nd hopefully have some fun. \n\nYes, I am arrogant and self-confident. But I know my limitations too. Yes, I think I have more game knowledge than the majority of my same ELO peers. But game after game I see people do Stupid Shit that proves this and I will do my utmost to use my knowledge to better my teams chances of winning. Yes, I still suck with the most basic mechanics like lasthitting thanks to 4 years of playing nothing but support and being too damn lazy at this stage to go into custom games to get better. But, in most games that go over 35mins, you can't tell that by my endgame cs because it's generally creeping up to the golden figure of 100cs/10mins and I will smash through any enemy that looks at me wrong.\n\nThose are the bad games that go right. Sometimes games just fall over and nothing can resuscitate them and others are a stompfest in our favour.\n\nI know I can carry a game, even if my own team doesn't recognise or appreciate my efforts - and tbh I really don't care whether they do or not. No one really notices me if I'm support or a solo laner - except when I'm splitpushing and not with the team. But early game as AD I'm the 'shit ADC' with pitiful cs, mid game I'm the 'always farming' fucking pariah no one wants to know, and late game - if they are smart - some of my team will notice, get over themselves and rally around me and we will wipe the enemy out along with their base.\n\nBecause it's near impossible give advice and lead a team without some immature princess calling you toxic or salty no matter how tactfully you say things or how hard you swing your neck, what I can't do is play their game for them and alter habits and playstyles created out of ignorance and inexperience if they refuse to follow calls and they insist on ignoring every ping.\n\nEnjoy the wall of text, I was bored :P\n\nGLHF\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-05T08:04:19.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I smiled at this post. Teams are so retarded at low elo, they have no basic war strategy. \"What would you know, you're Janna thats 0-2-4\" they say. Like a score in game is relevant to game knowledge itself.\nBut you are right, you offer advice and they just say \"stfu noob\" or some other abuse at you. They are not able to be helped. Or they just never listen. Like I'll tell a Brand support to stop split pushing or he will be dead in 20 seconds time when they collapse on him.... and that's what happens. He's not grouping with the team, hes farming \"cos he needs a deathcap\".\n\nI have a question though. What happens when you team is constantly fighting 4 v 5s in mid lane and losing badly? Lets make it even more clear. You are playing a split pushing top laner and the opposition team is basically a wombo combo team with something like amumu jungle, miss fortune adc, and swain mid. But your team has a Viktor mid say, and Sivir adc. \nBecause games like that where they can't see their mistakes are so frustrating. Like all they have to do is sit at their tower and defend, while their top laner is hammering towers for free. Stuff like that.

If this happens hopefully you can get get at least one or two other team mates to follow your lead to secure objectives or simply push to win.\n\nBut chances are they'll just go and farm jungle....\n\nAlso, in those situations a Zz'Rots is your best mate. If you can drop one in a good spot - doesn't even have to be on the enemy side of the river for it to make an impact - and then rotate to either help the muppets or push another lane. This then technically this puts you in two places at once with the bonus gold from the Zz creeps adding to your bank.\n\nJust ignore the salt, get a Zz and ward, ward, **ward!!**.

Except for starting items, dont buy *anything at all* on Veigar until you have 200 bonus AP stacks. And then buy everything all at once and splatter the enemy all over Murder Bridge ....*muhahahaha*.... You got Kalista and theres a Kog'Maw on your team? Bind with them and ult them when they die, nothing spells fun quite like hurling a dead bug at people that does a neat little knockup on impact *and then does true damage* when he splats all over them like a scene from a bad porn.
