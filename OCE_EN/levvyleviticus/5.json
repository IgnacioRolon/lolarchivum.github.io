For sport at school we go to a laser tag place and being absolute dickheads, they decided to concentrate me and at one point I decided to push them and they started pulling my hair and bashing me against the wall and sh*t. so I&#039;m just wondering if I should block them on League (and I know one is a dick online too), and if so would my problems outside of the game actually tilt me or something? It seems like they want to fight me all the time, being immature, so I&#039;m wondering if this would change my performance in game.\r\n\r\nSorry about making you read a novel :/","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-11-30T21:23:42.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need new friends. Regardless of League, life is too short to try stay with people who don't treat you correctly. \nBlocking them would make them pick on you more if they notice it.\nNot blocking them might allow them to pick on you in game.\nThere's no real way out of it other than: you need new and real friends.\n\nI learnt this myself the hard way. There was a 'popular' guy in school who was popular due to his elo (he's a year younger than me (and my year at the time was the year group with the most LoL players) and he was at Diamond a few years ago). As a casual player who liked to help others, they made fun of mey and picked on me for 'trying to help even though I'm low elo', despite the things I help with have little to no relation to elo such as lore, simple ability usage or camp timers. Because of this I gave up on my entire year group and started to hang out with people both older than me and younger than me; I then found proper friends who treated me like a person. Now to look back, the 'popular' guy made it to Challenger but now has a terrible reputation; everyone says and knows he has a girlfriend due to his elo and isn't really in a balanced relationship; he's more of the girl's 'man bitch' because she's so bossy. Recently they broke up and now the 'popular' guy is forever alone whereas most of the LoL players in my year group have came back to me and have pursued their own interests and passions. \n\nBasically to sum it up, the 'popular' guy had his popularity backfire on him since he has no real direction in life now other than being a pro gamer whereas everyone else matured along with me and accepted how childish they were back then. People now treat everyone else as they should. Not only that, but I've found my own direction whilst still being able to (and enjoying) be a casual gamer who constantly helps people through their issues that may or may not be League related.\n\nIf you're finding it hard to 'let go' of your current 'friends', it's different for everyone. I was able to make my decision in a split second; at a blink of an eye, but everyone's different and if you find it hard, it's normal. You need to have the courage to stand up for yourself; not up against them to compete with them, but to let go and carry on with your own path, to not let them burden you. The most important lesson I've learnt in life isn't to stand up for myself to go against the friction others exert on you, but to stand up for yourself to be true to who you are, and not let these people affect your path.\n\nHope this helps in more ways than just League.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-30T23:10:56.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They don't sound like friends to me.

Those dudes sound like trash. Anyway, yeah it can be a good idea to block them, I have this extremely toxic guy who I attend school with and he just hassles me to play, so I blocked him. I have noticed I've been feeling happier without that shit near me, so definitely try to block them and stay away. Things will definitely tilt you outside of League, and if they are one of the problems, just avoid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-01T02:26:07.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having real friends is easy, you just have to be a friend to them.

I had 'friends' like that, but not to that extent. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and flipped out on them, now I only talk to the one or two who were the nicest and made new friends who are much better. Personally, I don't care about climbing but my games are now much more enjoyable thanks to that. \nLoL Boards also help with finding people, who knows who you might find.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-01T01:13:27.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does change your performance in game, and in a pretty heavy way. \n\nYou know how dealing with ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ in game can easily tilt a person? So can outside stresses. \n\nEverything from diet and fitness to breakdowns in relationships can have an impact on how you play. When you are upset or distracted with some other event (even subconsciously) it becomes easier to make mistakes, big or small. Eventually these mistakes pile up and you start to notice them, and you get sucked down the rabbit hole of blaming yourself and tilt. \n\nThe \"[stress curve](https://explorable.com/how-does-stress-affect-performance)\" is a good visual aid to accompany this. Basically, as humans we perform at our best under slight pressure due to the short term effects of cortisol and adrenaline (e.g running from a threat or doing an exam). Unfortunately, this can easily tip over into \"too much\" either in intensity or if the stressor is chronic. A fallout in IRL relationships can be pretty intense (usually enough to boop you over to the \"poor performance\" side of things, especially if league is an activity that reminds you of them. \n\nThe best way to overcome this and get you back on the path of playing like you usually do, is to find a solid anti-tilt strategy that works for you. \n\nPersonally, I play morgana in norms because its what feels natural to me. I also have this thing where I play 10 bot games with the free week champions, or even get into an hour long custom just collecting chimes with move speed bard. \n\nI think having a supportive group of people that you can play with during this time would also be essential (since you will be playing sub-optimally and don't want random ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ to rage at you and make it worse). Head over to the [team recruitment board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) for that, I'm sure plenty of people would be down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-01T01:00:38.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man, anger outside can affect you.\nI had people giving me troubles and I stayed in bronze because of it, once I just ignored them / left, I managed to climb out and get gold.\n\nFind better guys man.\nGood luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-01T00:28:57.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the others, find new people to hang with man!\n\nMy friends give me the short end of the stick all the time, ill often be the butt of the jokes (not that i don't dish out my own of course). \nBut if I'm in trouble, they wouldn't hesitate to drop whatever it is that they are doing and come to my side (even if they were in other countries at the time.) and i would do the same for them.\nThose are the people you want around you!\n\nAnd yea it will affect league.\n\nWhen youre uptight inside over something, the smallest mistakes you make in league, or the BS of the other champion (because when your having a bad day, RIOT will do their best to match you against a Yasuo or a Zed, thats just fact.) will make you more frustrated than you usually would be, and you start making big mistakes, or even worse, start getting angry in the chat, and cause everyone else to have a bad time too.\n\nIts always good to have an anti-tilt champion, that you can use to unwind, and just have fun playing no matter how you feel.\nMine is Ivern\n\nBut good ones are:\nSinged \nIvern\nBard\nRammus\n\nChamps whose playstles just are hilarious to watch. Singed and Rammus are perfect because you just run in circles watching people kill themselves while you get away scott free. (and spam laugh, if youre singed) \n\nWhile Ivern and Bard are just so happy and carefree that even if you get stomped, it doesn't matter because Ivern says crackup things that cheer you up (and watching him walk is always entertaining), and bard is a big fat man who throws little people at things and speaks music. (seriously, what more could you want?)\n\nSo if I'm having a bad day, ill usually play an Ivern game (it used to be singed before Ivern came out), before even touching Azir/Sol/Kalista or other champs that can go very very wrong, just so that i am in the right frame of mind.","replies":[]}]}
