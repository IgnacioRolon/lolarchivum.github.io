No one likes it when someone else is a jerk to them, it helps to keep in mind all the times you've been on the receiving end of such behaviour, as that will give you an idea of what you're doing to others by acting that way. I'd recommend taking a look at the [Summoner's Code](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code). It's a quick read, in it's current state, but has some good (though generic) points, things like \"work as a team\", \"don't give up\" and \"be helpful\".\n\nSome advice that may help: don't respond to negative players. Use the mute function if you need to. Many of the players who act inappropriately are just looking for attention, or are trying to prove a point. By responding to them, you're giving them exactly what they're looking for. If you feel like you might lash out, mute them, you'll still be able to communicate using pings, where necessary. Once the game is finished, you can report them in the post-match lobby.\n\nIf you need to, it could be a good idea to give LoL a break while you reflect on the behaviour that got you punished. Go find a different game, maybe a single player one, where you can get a similar amount of enjoyment, and work on those aspects of your behaviour that are most problematic. There are also a variety of other \"outlets\" you can use for that kind of thing, such as reading a good book, taking part in physical exercise (particularly things like martial arts) or using a form of creative outlet (painting, drawing, writing, sculpting etc.)","replies":[]}]}
