Armour Seals. MR Glyphs. AD Quints. Costs 4,290 IP\n\nAP: Magic Pen Marks. Armour Seals. MR Glyphs. AP Quints. Costs: 5217 IP.\n\nThese are the 2 basic ones. Since you use the same seals and glyphs in these pages, the total for both pages is only about 7671 IP. Make sure you buy Tier 3 runes.\n\n\"Tank\" pages can vary alot depending on the tank. Some like AD Marks some like AS Quints or HP Regen quints. But a very basic (and cheap) page is as follows. \n\nTank: Armour Marks. HP Seals. MR Glyphs. Armour Quints.\n\nTo save IP you can just use AD marks instead if you dont want to buy the extra armour. Also tanks may sometimes use scaling runes instead of flat but again it depends on who you play and who you play against.\n\nFor ADCs and other auto based champs (like Jax, Irelia etc) you use the same AD page as before but swap the quints for Attack Speed ones.\n\nADC: AD Marks. Armour Seals. MR Glyphs. AS Quints.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-05-02T22:03:37.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-05-02T10:34:44.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't bother, they are updating the whole thing shortly anyway and it will be a wasted investment, just buy the super cheap 1 tier 2 (70% strength of tier 3) or get the 1/2 price ones and use those.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-01T22:58:56.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank.
