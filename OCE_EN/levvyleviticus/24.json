It doesn&#039;t seem too bad because you still get it right? Well if you&#039;re playing Yasuo top lane, if you&#039;re against a tank, you are screwed over until you get pd and ie. And his q tornado had a major debuff too, as it still does the damage, but the tornado lasts for six seconds, not ten. That&#039;s a big debuff when you think about it. I&#039;ve been going to tornado someone and my tornado disappears. I just look like a mental using my q on nothing. And please don&#039;t comment on this saying &quot;WhAT ArE YoU TaLkInG AbOuT YaSuO iS oP!!!!!!!1111&quot; Because he&#039;s not op, whoever played him is just skilled.","replies":[{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-12-27T11:18:41.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a match today a ranked match that I lost cos of a shit j4 who got a ban of some sort and this yas top went like 1/9 b4 he got a quadra and almost a Penta on his own 1v4","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-26T00:48:45.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overloaded kit","replies":[]}]}
