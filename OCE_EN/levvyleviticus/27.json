My main issue is I&#039;m waay too cautious. If I&#039;m midlane against Syndra and I&#039;m Zed, I&#039;ll stay in tower most of the time because I&#039;m scared of taking damage. I would say I do this in every lane except ADC. I developed this habit due to everyone saying &quot;be more cautious&quot;. But just today my friend who&#039;s around the same level and a pretty low elo told me all the time, &quot;OMG WTF YOU COULD&#039;VE 1v2&#039;ed THEM RIGHT THERE.&quot; Then I took a second to think and realised I could&#039;ve, but if there are 2 and its just me if they&#039;re not dangerously low and walking into tower I won&#039;t take them.\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me any tips to help me with being a little more confident? I would like some help with it. Thank you for your time :)","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-01T09:18:23.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's better to be too cautious than not cautious enough. I just had a game where our Akali, instead of playing safe into a Darius match up, threw caution out of the wind and fed him 9/0. Needless to say, a fed Darius is the worst Darius.\n\nYou do need to apply more pressure to the enemy during lane phase.\n\nThat said, maybe you aren't cautious enough. Your scores for the past 10 games have been 0/10, 1/7, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-01T23:04:27.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pick an early game champ and go balls deep every chance you get untill you learn your limits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-01T20:27:15.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cautious play style = not dying every 3 minutes and feeding\n\nCaution is good, but taking risks can be very rewarding\n\nJust learn how to take calculated risks like if 2 enemies are low and there is a chance you can kill both of them but might die... go for it and if you get a kill and die you atleast break even\n\nFor instance i roamed botlane  as a fight had broken out and had to use flash to get into the right position. I did and got a double kill which got me ahead and allowed me to get fed. Had i just stayed mid i probably would have got outfarmed and outscaled by my enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-01T18:48:42.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"grow some balls, it's a video game! \n\nif you die IT WON'T HURT!

If you go ahead then definitely go in and try to fight, but make sure you are safe from ganks with wards etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2017-05-01T10:15:59.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing wrong with a cautious play-style. However there are times when you need to man up and just do it. Some plays are quite obvious and you should definitely go for them while others are 50/50 and some are 99/1. I guess you need to learn to relax sometimes and just play for fun cause it sounds like you're taking it too seriously. Taking risks and going all out at the least expected times sometimes lead to some of the coolest outplays and fun games. You'll never learn anything new if you don't try new things. \n\nSo yeah, take a risk, take chance, make a change and break away !!! XD","replies":[]}]}
