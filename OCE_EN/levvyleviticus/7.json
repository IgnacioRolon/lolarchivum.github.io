Dear god holy shit please learn to farm. I wish someone had really made it clear when I started just how important it is to get ahead in CS in your lane (unless you're playing support, of course). Really spent time practicing your farming - go play in beginner AI games and just practice last hitting minions. So much of the time when I see someone losing lane hard it's often because they're too busy chasing kills and forgetting to farm.\n\nIt's worth realising that in early game, a kill gets you the same gold as roughly 15 minions. So instead of going all in and losing, play it a bit safer, farm up two full waves and you've basically achieved the same result.\n\nHaving said that, it mostly applies to top/ADC. In the mid lane, be less focused on perfect farm and more focused on staying in lane and getting kills when possible.\n\n- Secondly, work on improving your overall game skills. I don't mean champion specific abilities or how to pull off the best combos - I mean things that are important no matter who you're playing as or which lane you're in. Things like farming, positioning yourself so you can make the most out of a minion wave without getting poked out, how to zone out an opponent so they can't get as much farm, when it's appropriate to back and when you should hold off, when you should and shouldn't use summoner spells, how to ward your lane and when you should stay in lane and when you should roam.\n\nThere's no easy way to just miraculously get better at those, but it helps to watch videos of people who are good. Watch footage from the OPL, or the IWCQ (which just finished), and rather than watching them fight, pay attention to how they're positioned, the importance they place on warding, etc.\n\n- Thirdly, if you find yourself getting killed a lot, play a lot more conservatively. Like, play more conservative than you currently are, then play even more conservative than that. Your opponent can only kill you when you give them an opportunity to do so. It's up to you to find the balance between playing safe and still having lane presence for farming and kills. Practice, practice, practice.\n\nYour overall champion skills will improve the more you play, and so will your understanding of the nuances of the game. But if you're taking in a mentality \nthat you need to fight everyone all the time you're going to struggle.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. Practice farming\n2. Learn when to push and take objectives\n3. Play safe and try hard not to feed\n\n\nMost of all, remember it's a fking game. You're playing it for fun. If you're not having fun, walk away for a while. Don't uninstall per se, but remember why you wanted to play it in the first place.\n\nEither it'll get better because you get better, or you'll keep sucking and hate it forever. It's up to you which one though.\n\nglhf","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-06T22:07:57.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just fyi, here are my 5 most recent game results:\n1.

If you're a top laner who only gets 2 kills but successfully split pushes and takes out 4 turrets and an inhibitor by yourself, that's probably worth more to your team than an extra couple of kills.\n\nI play support a lot, and even if I end up with zero kills and less than 10 assists (which happens a fair bit), if I get some deep warding in, consistently save my carry and win lane, and help my team set up for and claim mutual objectives like dragon & baron, then I'm going to call that a win.\n\nEDIT - I've recently created a smurf account, I'll add you on that (CousinYeti).

Also watch out for 'smurfs', which are players who have high-level accounts but create a low-level account to play against worse players.\n\nAnd if you really want to improve, you can watch videos of pro players.

Another suggestion is to create a different persona on each account buying different champions and maining a different role for each account. Like one account main support/junlge teamplay champs and the other main midlane/top hard carry champs. Eventually when you get to a point where you can enter ranked, use ip to buy your main champs from the other account and now you're a more wellrounded player as well as your skillevels and knowledge will combine rapidly increasing your skilllevel overall. Using different accounts helps seperate the gameknowlendge so you don't end up playing in a support esque fashion as a mid ect... since alot of players who main a role or a champ will end up playing all their champs in a similar fashion which can often lead to bad positioning or decision making.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-09T11:29:47.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, I'm back, and just on a status update, my lateset game was; guess this; 16/5/5.\nFor someone who was posting on boards about how bad they were, i'm pretty sure that is really good.\nI was playing Ashe ADC.\nThanks a lot guys, this has been really helpful","replies":[{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-11T10:44:04.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"KDA doesn't tell anything.\n\nYou could have just last hitted enemies 16 times while your team carried you, is what I am trying to tell, there's a lot more to every game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChocoThunder","date":"2016-09-06T04:06:00.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya, I'm trying to level up my low level account and since moving from NA don't have many people to play normals with on my main.

Use the gold to get items, such as armor, ability power, etc, these things will help you a lot.\nYou can hold the tab key to view all the champions, and then you can see what items they have got, getting the names of the item by simply hover your mouse to it, this way, it may give you a better idea of what you can do to counter them, like you may want to get more items, or even temporarily switch lanes.\nIf you are playing pvp, you definitely need the runes (I am not saying your champion is useless without runes, but runes will add customizable bonus to your champions), so buy them and apply them to your rune pages, you may even need to save up to buy additional rune pages and runes.\nOften, you may want to invite your friends to play a custom game on champions that you want to learn, they can give you advice if they know how to use the champion that you want to learn.\nI shall make one final point, getting only kills and assists does not necessarily mean that you will get more points, you get more points if you win, you get less points if you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-09T05:34:16.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm level 17, so i know most of that stuff, but thanks anyway!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-06T05:42:04.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just came to wave my flag of support, to say you're not the only one that sucks at league.

Including what most of these guys have written already, I have realized that playing several games with as many different champs as I can has started to help me a lot.

Learn to last hit rather than shove the wave to the enemy turret, keep a vision on hand for extra vision out in the river and maximize your gold, exp gain with minimum risk. \n\nMy second tip is learning to read your opponent. Over aggression can be a sign that the enemy jungler is coming like for example if a support is going into a 2v1 by himself but suddenly there are 2 others from the supports team popping out from the fog of war to ambush for a 3v2. Understand that when people make choices it's for a reason but also once you can get behind that reasoning you can also learn to play safer better. For example, you can reason where the jungler might start based on his champion choice or where he once was based on where he last appeared on the map and if you're overextending that he can simply walk behind you and destroy you in a 2v1 then realise that he is most probably coming towards your lane. This also applies to map awareness.\n\nMap awareness, paying attention to the minimap and understanding the movements of your enemy team is probably the most important thing you can learn in League of legends.\n\nThe final tip I will write here for now is understanding the capabilities, of each and every champion. Knowing their abilities can help you understand exactly what a champion can do. For example, Riven's strongest power spike is at level 6, if your lane has been holding off to this point or had died some point previously you bet that Riven will be seeking an all in at level 6 and so I as a jungler might seek to sit top taking the scuttle or farming gromp.  Thresh can throw his lantern out to the jungle meaning that he can bring a jungler into the fight much faster. Shen's ult stand united can shield an ally and bring himself into the fight. Ekko's ult blinks him to his hologram (where he was 5 seconds ago) healing him and dealing AOE burst magic damage.  This also doesn't just apply to abilities but items as well because items as everyone knows give really powerful item spikes to champions who synergize with them. This information is important because it can help you not only understand the strengths and weaknesses of your enemies but also your team's strengths and how a situation may play out.\n\n\nSome higher elo players might also explain that always going for flashy plays can quickly turn on you when it's so much better to make the safe decision that won't cost you. \n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-09-06T02:49:10.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Am helping a new guy in league :) he is lever 10, its really fun I like teaching, I can help yo with your games, rank or normal or any other just add me :) and I can play custom with you or teach u verbal anything","replies":[]}]}
