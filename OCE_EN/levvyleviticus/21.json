As an example, play a bot game.  The bots can be really hard to kill, not because of complex algorithms, but instead of the simple fact that they back off when at low health.  So many players won't do this, and will instead keep going back into lane to \"make up\" for their deaths, and end up feeding even more.  A lost tower is a lot better than a fed opponent, and too many players don't understand this and end up making things worse than if they had just left their lane or played super safe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-11-20T05:31:46.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People being paid to make LoL a bad experience probably + hackers always looking for %%%%%s (a narrow opening, typically one that admits light.\n\"a %%%%% in the curtains\"\nsynonyms:\topening, gap, space, hole, aperture, break, breach, crack, fissure, crevice, cranny, cleft, cut, rift, split, slit, slot\n\"the sun had found a %%%%% in the clouds\"\na beam or patch of light admitted by a narrow opening.\n\"I noticed a %%%%% of light under the door\") in their security  :l I can't even play any modes except customs now -.- I've never heard any body use ch1nk as an offense except maybe once or twice but they were both just numb walnuts that were trying to be cool.
