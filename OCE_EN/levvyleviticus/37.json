Not as frequently, but i just recetnly played with an Akali on my team that was obviously botting, and I&#039;m sick to death of it, because it just ruins the game for everyone. I was playing Yasuo and I was pretty proud of myself, as i was going about 10/4 which isn&#039;t bad for me since I&#039;m trash at him. Then our Akali feeds their Diana jungle so hard she one shots everyone (even our rek&#039;sai) and we found it very hard to outplay her. Even then we kept on defending and winning teamfights, which theoretically should&#039;ve won the the game, our Akali just died over and over and we lost. Hell, she was such a bad bot she didn&#039;t even enter the jungle once!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T21:54:18.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aram is pretty much dead now tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-29T08:00:08.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel so sad for you getting one bot when I have 4 on my team.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-30T04:56:10.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it sucks worse on aram but i dont really play it :/","replies":[]}]}]}
