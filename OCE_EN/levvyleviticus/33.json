I think it's mostly because of the bug in patch 6.14, others might say it's because of the win rate spike (Which is the bugs fault), but it's just blatant bullcrap. Being a level 17, and not being, well, great *I had to write a thread here a week ago to help me because i'm that bad*, this area should be a big learning curve for me, learning how to read how enemies are acting, how to last-hit, and general stuff like this. But because of this Yasuo crap, the only thing I'm learning is that Yasuo is broken beyond belief. You can look up some threads in the boards archives or something if you want to understand why he's so broken. Anyway, so since 6.14, Yasuo has been a huge-ass problem in normal games, and nobody can legit play in normals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRITO PLS HELP","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-12T08:10:56.768+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"welcome to the league of 1 champion\n\nfeaturing yasuo, the champ with the cancerously overloaded kit whos in everygame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-12T03:37:12.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Batman is a vigilante, only the Christopher Nolan trilogy made him a ninja.

He's powerful.** No one can deny that, theres no crit champ in the game that isnt, and he has SO MUCH utility. \n**2. He looks difficult, but is easy to play.** This is the same reason why Lee Sin is popular, you get to look like a pro becasue he makes tricky as plays, but in actual fact you need to put in very little effort to make those plays. _(Take it from me who was a Yas main for a long time, he has a VERY low skill floor)_\n**3. He is well themed.** Pirates, Ninjas, Undead. Thats the golden trio of popularity, everyone loves those 3 things, _(Pirates of the Caribbean)_ _(Batman is basically a ninja)_ _(and who doesn't like Zombie games?)_ These 3 things will usually appeal to the majority of people. Yasuo falls pretty heavily into the ninja category. \n**Just think of his character for a second:** He's a outcast warrior with a dark past, skilled in a forgotten martial art, being chased by the people he once called friends, and is looking to redeem his honour.... Thats the backstory of almost every badass character in any movie ever! _(Darth Vader, Batman, every Clint Eastwood character, Itachi Uchiha, Kenshin Himura, etc etc)_ Its the stereotypical 'Cool/badass' formula. Riot just threw imagination out the window with Yasuo and picked the typical most effective formulas there was.. and it worked, like it always does.\n\nUnfortunately, those 3 things are not easy to fix, without completely destroying what it means to 'be' Yasuo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-09-12T08:07:19.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know man, it sucks. BUT there are ways to counter him.\n\n1. **Lockdown** - Champs that can lock him down are awesome for stopping Yas, as he is very movement focused. His passive relies on it, and his dashes make him very hard to hit. Hard CC is perfect for this. Most Yas players go top lane, which is perfect for some of the best champs that lock him down. Cho'gath is a pretty decent choice, as his silence stops Yas from casting his tornado, and the q knockup doesn't get blocked by the windwall. Nautilus is pretty good too, but you have to be more mindful of the wall stopping your ult. You still have your passive though, and your shield makes you pretty solid.\n\n2. **Tanks** - Yasuo's tank busting is pretty terrible without first scaling and grabbing a BoRK and Last Whisper. Add to the fact that there are awesome items you can build against Yasuo, and most lockdown tanks can itemise against him. Randuins takes some damage off of his already weaker crits while giving tank stats, and Frozen Heart reduces his attack speed which in turn increases his Q CD while giving your lockdown abilities 20%CDR. I'm not 100% sure with the interaction with this one, but Thornmail theoretically should return damage back to Yas even on his Q's since they apply on hits. I could be wrong tho, I've never tested it.\n\n3. **Outplay** - Not as hard as it sounds, but at the same time more skill reliant. The main source of Yas's longevity is not his damage, but rather his Windwall. Being able to completely neutralise any projectile or line ability or attack is why he is so hard to play against. Baiting this out before you all in seriously weighs the fight in your favour, especially against a burst mage like Ryze or Annie. Some champs are better for this than others. Having a spammable click-and-cast is the best way, since you will have it up, and he either blocks it or gets poked. Skill shots are arguably better since sometimes you can stay out of range, but then he can also dodge it with no expense, especially with that dash. Vel'Koz has his Q, which has the benefit of being cheap so it doesn't strain your mana. You also have Annie, which also has the benefit of her passive, and because of Q's refunds when farming, you can actually target a minion in front of Yas to try and bait him out. Lux can throw a sneaky shield wand out to bait the wall with a non-damage ability and can proceed to kill Yas after it dissipates.\n\nIt is important to note tho, just because his wind wall is down it does not mean you'll win the fight. He has extremely high damage and snowballs really well, so an early death can mean a GG. Jungler coordination can also help, but don't rely on it unless you are using skype or discord or something.\n\nI hope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-12T08:46:03.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks, but Yasuo top was nerfed this patched, but an ekko mid would destory him, and in c9 vs imt last night, it showed ekko CAN beat Yasuo.\n\n\n\nthanks","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-12T03:28:20.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there needs to be a category for yasuo complainers, sick of seeing this shit","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-12T08:21:17.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Jww7FzoU-sub-board-for-yasuo-complaints","replies":[]}]}]}
