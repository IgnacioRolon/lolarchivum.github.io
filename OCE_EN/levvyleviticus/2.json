My parents said it was for &quot;school&quot; but really my school was never tech based so i got a crappy ASUS laptop for 500 bucks, and i started playing league on it. Back then I didn&#039;t know what computer limitations were and I thought 500 was a fair price for a good working computer and boy was i wrong. It runs about 25 fps normally, drops to 15 in teamfights and just becomes unusable most of the times and reaches 2 fps. Anyway, I&#039;ve had this for two years, and I know it&#039;s time to get a good computer that could run it better, and I&#039;m saving up money ( (Money&#039;s hard to get when you&#039;re a fourteen year old, okay!) so I&#039;m still about two months out of getting a good computer to run it on, because my cousin has a good computer and blah blah he&#039;ll give it to me for a lower price. But for those two months i need to see what i can do to make it that my computer doesn&#039;t crash or bugsplat every 2 games. Can anyone just give some tips on how to make my computer not go trash for the remainder of it&#039;s existance?","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2018-01-20T04:59:33.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To add on to what TheDemonEmperor said, go to Settings and choose Low-Spec Mode. \n\nAnother good idea would be to select the option that closes the Client when you go in game (hence reducing background traffic). It will mean it takes a bit longer to go from the end of the game to the end of game stats screen, but it will make the game itself run slower. \n\nYou should also turn off Anti-Aliasing too, as using that reduces performance.\n\nAlso, turn off anything like \"screen flash on damage taken\". \n\nPlaying with your screen locked will also increase performance a bit, as constantly moving the camera around means a lot of rendering and such. \n\nUse quick cast (not indicators), to reduce the amount of pop-ups on the screen. \n\nIf it's really bad, turn on Movement Prediction. \n\nAlso try reducing the size of the Champion Stats bar and the Map (although the Map is important, especially if playing in locked screen).
