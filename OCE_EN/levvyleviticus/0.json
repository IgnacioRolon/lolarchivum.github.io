They are just a stepping stone until a player has the confidence and IP to branch further out. \n\nIdeally you wouldn't run pure AD and instead would substitute the AD quints for AS (like stated in my post). However, if you are a new-ish player and have few rune pages to cover or struggle with CS AD is going to help you get the last hits. \n\nMR is pretty common, since bot lane is being dictated with heavy AP poke support like Karma and Lulu. In silver/bronze we also see a lot of players picking full AP \"supports\" like Lux and Brand. Alternatively (but more expensively), you could run scaling MR or 50/50 it. \n\nThe page contains armour seals which are more than sufficient when coupled with masteries to provide some survivability vs the enemy ADC during laning phase (which is where runes and masteries have the most impact).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emit","date":"2017-04-28T06:22:18.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His rune page is fine for someone new to the role, and you can't run armor glyphs as it gets you next to no armor per rune, also ap supports hurt without mr.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-04-28T02:50:43.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice, much appreciated","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-27T23:04:47.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Min 250 is advised.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-28T04:05:12.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ and competent at least  at 2 champs in all roles so you don't be one of those... my main got banned wah wah swap or i got autofilled but i only play yasuo mid/top wah wah!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2017-04-27T22:21:34.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forget about wins and sort out 2 proper rune pages to begin with, only once you have those should you contemplate ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2017-04-28T00:40:48.297+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"Only think of 'Wins' when you are good enough to start your 2nd smurf!
