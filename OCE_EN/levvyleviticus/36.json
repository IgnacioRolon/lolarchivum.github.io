I play for fun, sure I&#039;ll play a ranked game here and then, but i mostly just play on weekends for fun. I don&#039;t really care about improving that much, and that is probably the sole reason why i play normals. there&#039;s no pressure to go well or win. It doesn&#039;t affect your account in any way except for levelling up. But lately there have been quite a few occasions where i don&#039;t go well, which happens a bit. As i said, I don&#039;t really care about improving. As there isn&#039;t very much level of pressure, I play a game, and i go good or bad and win or lose. Again, doesn&#039;t affect my account. But in so many instances people have been flaming me and all this for going bad in a non-ranked game. I legit today told an ashe on the enemy team unlucky because she couldve gotten a penta but someone stole her 4th kill. then my teammaes flamed me for &quot;sympathising with **the enemy**&quot;\r\n\r\nI just hate that people flame me for when i have a good or bad game in a match where rank or reputation doesnt matter. it **TRIGGERS** me.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T08:50:54.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"normals are way more toxic than ranked imho, especially with fights around lane calling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ailithic","date":"2017-11-27T08:50:00.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I alway sympathize with the enemy on an organic(human) level, Keep your enemies closer and all that stuff. I have a different reason for not liking toxicity though, people giving up to fast.\n\nUmmmm... If you really wanna stop toxic people though, education in the matter, is the best place \"In my opinion\"... A really good place to start is political philosophy, which kinda deals with ethics in an applied way, But who wants to deal with politics \"pshh\".\n\nTED is a bit to broad so if you just wanna watch one or two vids The School of Life youtube channel has tonnes of ways to deal with real life situations.\n\n\n\nElse for getting better at LOL, 1. CS till you double click, 2. Know what every champ in the round is capable of, 3. another \"IMO\", know some team fighting tactics (like not fighting in jg because you'll get choked with skill shots and cc lol).\n\nAnd don't take what people say in normals seriously, \"idek know what feeding is because of the anti feeding mechanics riot implemented\".. ps. Kill reward gold decreases.","replies":[]}]}
