Has anyone done this before and has it helped them?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-21T22:46:22.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah just stay here man, youre one of the community here, and league will be pretty much the same wherever you go.\n\nSure Aussies and Kiwis are a bit rough around the edges, but Americans aren't exactly known for being very tolerant to discomfort, so you may well get a few more major tantrums when the insults do start flying. \n\nWhen I was on the NA server, 90% of hate was directed at the Mexicans, mostly for nothing other than being Mexican and talking in their native language _(before they had their own server of course)_. So NA aren't exactly saints when it comes to toxicity, or acceptance.\n\nMy guess is that Japan would likely be the most positive server, the people in general are just more polite and respectful. Although wether that carries over into the anonymous online sphere, is anyone's guess.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-01-23T05:08:25.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I guess, I just wonder what the best server to learn how to play better is","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-01-22T03:18:02.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No. This game just brings out he worst in people like any competitive game you are forced to play with randoms in.\nThere will always be \"toxic people\" and ragers when you are not 100% in control of whether you win or lose.\n\nIf you want to play the game you have to learn to buck up and just mute people.\n\nI also get 10-15 ping on OCE, but my ping to NA is over 200 since they moved the servers to Chicago","replies":[]}]}
