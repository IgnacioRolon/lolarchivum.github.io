I haven&#039;t played LoL in a while due to losing my computer. I haven&#039;t been able to play since... I think it was the update with the elementalist lux login screen. So it said there was mandatory updates in 10, 9 etc. so it updated the client and then it started the client before saying there are corrupt files. I opened up LoL and it said mandatory updates again.\r\n\r\nIt may have been due to the time set on my computer, as it hasnt been opened since december the first, last year. so I changed the time to normal as google said i needed to. It might have been due to that, but i don&#039;t know. I&#039;ve started updating again, and i&#039;ll see if it works again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-26T10:24:00.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the wrong system time can mess with patching, so you've got a solid start. The other thing to remember is to run League as admin as lacking those permissions can also mess with patching.","replies":[]}]}
