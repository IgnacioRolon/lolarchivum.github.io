Sure, the tank meta was annoying for a lot of play styles to deal with, but the one shot meta is a bit annoying. It isn&#039;t the most fun thing to get one shot every bloody five seconds without being able to anything. You can say that I should play the meta too, but I have. I&#039;ve played a lot of Kayn and Zed recently and to be honest it isn&#039;t fun when you one shot all the time. One shots are meant to be a thing that may happen under good circumstances, but it&#039;s unhealthy when it&#039;s all the game is about","replies":[{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2017-12-31T03:28:09.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree full-heartily with Sesshomaru, Lehality gives people who are able to burst the ability to steamroll the game. The culprit I notice are people who are able to either abuse it such as Rengar, Kayn and even Garen of course. Unfortunately some of the runes, Riot's also introduced have made the process even worse. Dark harvest, Electrocute, Aery in some cases for the annoying champions like Teemo who has the ability to proc it twice in an auto. This game is going down the wrong path when raid bosses such as Nasus, Darius and in some cases{{champion:420}} die in two seconds flat because all their Armour and magic resistance have been penetrated away by the absurd amount of it avaliable. \n\n\nSure that some people should be able to one shot. Big example being Zed, That's his whole kit. I've played a few games where I've played things like Poppy, Mao and Nasus that I end just being as useless as a squishy because I went full tank. However on the other spectrum. Some tanks are still impossible to bring down without a team of 5. Sion, Mao, Ornn. \n\nThe side point I'd like to also make is the introduction of \"% health damage on every new item/champion or even true damage\" A champion isn't fun when every new release is \"After 3 auto attacks deal 50% of the target's health in damage.\" Understandably this is made for tanks but it just gets annoying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-26T23:18:24.829+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I genuinely don't see the point of Lethality, the main people who buy it are assassins, and the 1 job of an assassin is to take out the squishies, but squishies only every build _(at max)_ 1 armour item _(and even then, its not a true defensive item, its usually a damage item with a bit of armour added on for a laugh)_. So when your enemy has only 1 semi-armour item, why do you need 3 full lethality items?\n\nAssassins are supposed to be shit against tanks, thats the trade off for being able to wipe the floor with squishies. You cant have it both ways _(well... you **can** evidently... but you shouldn't be able to.)_\n\n_________\n\nI fully believe that champs like Zed and Kayn _(shadow assassin form only of course)_ and other assassin-esq champs, _should_ be able to 1-hit squishes. \nBut, they should have to play everything right, and even then have to use their whole kit to do it. \n\nAnd by definition of using their whole kit to do it, they should be vulnerable afterwards.\n\nBut that isn't the case, champs like Fizz can 1-hit with just his E/R, Kha can 1 hit with Q and an AA. meanwhile champs like Vi or Gragas have gained enough damage to quite easily qualify as assassins themselves. \n\nAgreed the tank meta was horrible, and I have no desire to ever return to it, but the choice doesn't have to be between Tank or assassin, isn't it about time we had an ADC meta? _(which when you think about it, makes sense to have the high priority target, actually be a high priority for once)_\n\nTbh I think the problem is, now there is TONS of damage in the game, and Riot cant simply remove it without it feeling bad for lots of players _(wether it's balanced or not, it does just 'feel' bad when you have noticeably less damage)_, and people will adjust of course and forget about eventually, but it's that period where it feels bad, that Riot is absolutely terrified of, and whats why instead of removing power from those who have too much, they keep giving more and more to those who are already balanced, and thats why we have ended up with this one-hit meta in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"LunaLovegood","date":"2017-12-27T00:03:03.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've tried to explain this once to you already. so ill do it in the simplest way i can FLAT PEN IS MOST EFFECTIVE AGAINST SQUISHES WHO DON'T BUILD ARMOR, NOT TANKS.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-27T00:24:44.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure you're quite getting my point.\n\nASSASSINS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY NEED TO BUILD PEN OF **ANY** KIND.\n\nArmour/magic pen by definition is for penetrating defences, Squishes don't build defences, or at least not enough of them to warrant building specifically for penetrating them. So by default there is no need for an assassin to have penetration.\n\nSo it doesn't matter what kind of penetration is 'most' effective against squishes, it isn't required to have penetration at all in order to kill them, and all having excess penetration does is make assassins more effective against tanks than they should be.\n\nThe point of armour is to reduce damage per-attack, which means the more times you get attacked, the more effective armour is. Which is why when you fight a sustained damage champ like Ashe, you build armour to reduce the damage of all her attacks long term.\nBut an assassin deals all their damage in a quick burst, which means they hit you with less attacks, so instead of building armour, you build negation items like Zhonyas or Banshees, which if used correctly blocks more of their damage than armour would.\n\nWhich means, armour is a stat used primarily for tanky champs who's biggest threat is sustained damage, and need to keep reducing a little amount of damage for a long time. And negation items are used primarily for squishy targets that need to block a lot of damage for a very short amount of time.\n\nNegation items are useless for tanks who are under a constant barrage of attacks. and resistances are less effective for squishies who need to block occasional large chunks of damage.\n\nSo a sustained damage champ buys penetration, in order to bypass the block.\nAnd a burst champ baits out, or plays around the negation items.\n\nSo assassins have no need of so much lethality, they already do enough damage to their intended targets.","replies":[{"poster":"LunaLovegood","date":"2017-12-27T04:08:16.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think we just see it a bit differently to each other :). \ni have a second question though, this isnt meant to be attacking or rude, but i see you complaining about a lot of stuff on forums to the point it makes me think you dont enjoy the game and if you dont why do you still play/keep up to date with the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-27T13:47:04.397+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea haha seems that way :P\n\nValid question, Lanturn2002 pretty much says most of it.\nThe crux of the answer is: I love this game so much, and thats why I'm always attacking it. \n\ne.g. Its like how if your friend did something wrong, you'd let it slide so you didn't hurt their feelings. But if your _best_ friend did something wrong, you'd pull them aside and be like \n_\"Bro, that wasnt cool.\"_\n\nIt hurts when you see something that you really care for, not live up to be what you know it has the potential to be.\n\nI care for this game enough to be the 'friend' that pulls it aside and tells it to get their act together, not the friend that lets it slide. Even if that makes me unpopular on the boards or at Riot.\n\nIve been playing solidly _(many games a day)_ for around 6 years now, and I've seen many versions of the meta and what works and what doesn't _(in my opinion of course)_. And the most recent state of the game, is just bad in comparison to what has existed in the past, and it stings to see league not only not progress forward, but actually go backwards.\n\nSo in short, I don't complain because I don't like the game, I complain because I like it too much to accept that it should be anything less than what I know it can be.\n\nWhich is why I will fight tooth and nail over even the smallest detail, because even if just the tiniest things get changed, then thats one step closer to the game as a whole being _(what I see to be)_ better for everyone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lanturn2002","date":"2017-12-27T04:59:40.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's complaining about issues that can make the game not as good as it could be","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Green Bast3rd","date":"2017-12-28T15:06:26.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So while it is true that assassins need to burst squishy targets, lethality is built into some pretty damaging items like {{item:3147}} or utility items that have lethality stacked to them like {{item:3142}} which assassins would build anyway due to their utility value. I agree that there is a lot of damage in the game but simplifying it to \"if the assassin does his combo right the squishy should die\" is not necessarily the answer. While yes that statement is correct in most cases and yes there are assassins who do ridiculous damage to squishy targets I think lethality is not only to pen through armour that squishyâ€™s have but to allow assassins to kill a wider range of targets. Lethality to me seems like a tacked-on bonus to items that already offer great passives/actives, they allow the assassins to expand the range of who they can kill as well. Also, it means that if an assassin gets ahead in the game he can generally stay ahead due to the nature of these items. Also the game is less rock, paper, scissors than you make it seem. The case should not be \"I have an assassin and I did my combo correctly. Therefore, the squishy/fighter should die.\" Instead, it should depend on whether he did the combo correctly and if the assassin itemized correctly. \n\nYou have pushed up the wave as {{champion:238}} and you are now looking to roam but bot lane is not quite right for a gank. Instead, you see that top lane {{champion:57}} (who is currently high on the champion tier list in patch 7.24) is about 3/4 health but has built a {{item:3742}} in order to counter the ad top laner. The fact that you have a completed {{item:3147}} which provides penetration helps you deal more damage to the target as it is a flat pen. Not only that, but you get damage from the passive as well. You roam top lane and secure the kill with your top laner. Assassins have to prioritize targets in games and sometimes if not quite often they are not squishy by nature.  \n\nIt's fine to have assassins primarily kill squishies and in all honesty, I do agree that if you play your cards right they should get nuked. This means that they have to stick with their team and play correctly to avoid this, but I have come across game after game throughout my stint playing in NA since season 2 where an assassin is useless because he can only kill the squishy. {{champion:238}} kills {{champion:119}} but is stunned by {{champion:12}} and melted by {{champion:134}}. It can't just be the squishy, an assassin needs to be able to prioritize his/her targets based on the situation. Sometimes you have to kill {{champion:92}} in a hurry or she'll melt your team.\n\nJust trying to spur the conversation on.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-28T23:21:19.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make some good points, I'm going to structure my reply around the 'paper scissors rock' metaphor you use because I like it and think it sums up the situation very nicely.\n\nThe short of it is that assassins aren't included in the paper scissors rock game! \nAssassins are and have always been the optional extra mould-breaker class.\n\n_(I intend to make a big post on this point later, but this is just a good a time to discus it as any)_\nthe vast majority of games revolve around 3 key positions: DPS, Tank and Healer.\nLeague with its abundance of CC and other utilities obviously expands 'healer' into 'support' and excess of damage blurs the line between 'Tank' and 'Bruiser'. But the key concept is the same, one role does damage, one absorbs damage, and one heals damage.\nThat IS very much a paper scissors rock situation.\n\nThe tank protects the DPS, the healer keeps the tank alive, and the DPS kills the enemy before they can kill the healer. That is the basic structure of the vast majority of team based games both PvE and PvP. \nVictory then comes down to who has the better team-comp and who out-plays who.\n\n____________\n\nAssassins however are the wild card, they are introduced to throw a spanner into the works, interrupting the usual paper scissors rock cycle, and putting the enemy team off balance.\nBy replacing your DPS with an assassin, you can bypass the enemy tank and remove either the enemy healer or enemy DPS instantly from the equation. \nHowever it is always a risky move, you get rid of one of their high priority targets, but it is at the cost of your sustained damage output. So if you are successful, you give your team the advantage by outnumbering the enemy, but if you are unsuccessful, you give the enemy the advantage because your team is now without it's sustained damage output.\n\nSo assassins are and have always been greatly specialised high-risk/high-reward picks. It's the equivalent of playing paper scissors rock, and your scissors cut both the enemy's paper and scissors, but you can ONLY use scissors.\nYou sacrifice a lot by giving up a DPS position to have an assassin, especially if you're giving up mid lane _(usually an AP role)_ to an AD assassin. So if your assassin fails to do its job, it should put your team at a disadvantage!\n\nThat is the bane of being a 'specialised' class, you excel at doing your one specific job _(killing the DPS)_, but the trade off is that you are very bad at doing any other jobs _(e.g. Killing tanks, healing damage, absorbing damage etc.)_.\n\n___________\n\nLeague forgets about this trade-off, and thats why assassins are always so strong. Assassins in league have become jack-of-all-trades without losing their speciality. {{champion:157}}  blocks more damage than most tanks with his wind wall, lifesteals more then most supports could heal him for, and has a greater sustained damage output than many mages or even ADC's, all WITHOUT losing his ability to annihilate squishes. if {{champion:238}}  can't jump on the enemy DPS _(his one job)_, oh well, he just jumps on and assassinates the bruiser instead. {{champion:245}}  and {{champion:64}}  are just as effective tanks as they are assassins.\nAnd this is why Assassins in league have long since abandoned becoming 'specialty, high-risk/high-reward' picks, and have become a necessity becasue they are just so much more versatile then everyone else.\n\nWhich completely defeats the purpose! specialty classes like Assassin, by definition SHOULD NOT BE versatile, they have one purpose. If they succeed, their team gets the advantage, if they fail, their team loses the advantage. Thats the risk you take when you decide to take away the safe pick of mage from your team comp and put an assassin in instead.\n\nSo in short, Assassins shouldn't have a wide variety of targets, if they did, it would remove the risk you take by picking one.\nIt's no different than picking an early-game team comp, you have a much greater chance of winning the game early on, but if the team manages to outplay your strategy and stay alive to keep the game going into late game, you have royally screwed yourself over with your picks.\n\nIt's not fair to have the early game advantage, then when late game rolls around be like _\"Oh its not fair that I'm the one disadvantaged now!\"_, Just like if your assassin is unable to assassinate the high priority target, you can't just say _\"Oh its not fair that our risk didn't pay off, so it's only fair that he just kills another one of you instead.\"_\n\nYou forget that Assassins are supposed to be an 'extra' role _(thats why there are only 5 positions on summoners rift but 6 playable roles.)_ So the game SHOULD NOT be balanced around assassins, it should be balanced around the paper scissors rock trio of tank/damage/support, and assassin should be a feast or famine risk you take to get the upper hand.\n\nThe problem is, assassins are fun because everyone likes getting kills. So Riot releases more assassins, and makes other champs feel more like assassins, so therefore lots of people keep picking assassins, so then Riot balances the game around them. and thats why we have this horrible 1-hit meta atm.\n\n_________________\n\nYou say yourself:\n\n> I do agree that if you play your cards right they should get nuked. This means that they have to stick with their team and play correctly to avoid this\n\nSo pretend that the ADC did play correctly, and being in the centre of the team prevented the assassin from going in on him. Don't you agree that because he played correctly and essentially outplayed the assassin, that he should now have the advantage?\n\nBut that's not the way it works in league atm. \neven if the ADC plays 100% correctly and puts the tank between himself and the assassin, then the assassin just goes ham on the tank _(Maokai to take your example)_ and then the assassin's team now still has the upper hand by being 5v4.\n\nThe only thing that prevents that from happening is that tanks have enough resistances to stop assassins from targeting them, Lethality however removes these resistances.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-29T13:07:54.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You forget that Assassins are supposed to be an 'extra' role (thats why there are only 5 positions on summoners rift but 6 playable roles.)\n\nI mean... that's not really how the roles work, let alone why there are only 5 per side.\n\nHell even riot classifies a lot of the roles into sub role's (i think a few of the ask riot's and a few of the things in a few of the X role update's have mentioned this) because of the fact that the \"role's\" are there for simplification to the player, not to be accurate overarching roles that fit into specific lanes.\n\n>The only thing that prevents that from happening is that tanks have enough resistances to stop assassins from targeting them, Lethality however removes these resistances.\n\nI agree and i don't at the same time with this.\n\nI agree because there is just too much possible lethality (60 in items/72 if you count the extra dirk, which not only puts ADC's at 0 armor, but ends up putting 200 armor tanks back down to ~140, and that's without the extra 10 in runes)\n\nI don't agree because, if riot pulls their heads out their asses and fixes lethality properly, it works right as is, there just can't be so much lethality on the table, the issue then being, if they drop the amount of lethality, i can tell you what Assassin's grab next, and it ain't gonna be fun, because they will grab that % pen earlier.\n\nPenetration as a stat as a whole (both lethality and % pen) needs to be balanced in a way that you make it fair, not swing it to one side and make one OP.\n\nBut fuck guys if we have to make one op, can it please be the tank stats, because at least then it feels fair that if i have 400 armor, i shouldn't get instantly fucking popped because of pen items, because that just makes tanks feel worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-28T23:29:58.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Woah, Sessh, I just meant this as a little post man, haha gw on your detailed responese.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-28T23:57:58.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No detail is ever too small :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-12-27T08:28:58.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, let's hope they don't replace regular gamemode with urf soon, because it's verging on that point.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:30:58.985+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just bring back the old armour pen. system it was flat out better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-29T08:02:36.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lethality is awesome, I love building nothing but armour and health, and still getting nuked in under 2 seconds.","replies":[]}]}
