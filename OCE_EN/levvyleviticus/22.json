I&#039;ll go jungle, pick a champion I think i&#039;m somewhat good at, and crush the enemy team HARD.\r\nBut then one of my laners feeds 0/8 to the CAITLYN and I can&#039;t chase her down before she right clicks me. I&#039;m not complaining about the caitlyn, I&#039;m complaining about the Vayne and Orianna that fed her so digustingly that i could no longer carry. Not to mention their Yi got pretty strong from them too. Vayne was dancing in base when she was 0/5 complaining about if she didn&#039;t get autofilled the she would be 2250 cs at 20 mins and have 25 kills and solo carry easily while our first time Ori wasn&#039;t that toxic she was just not great, which makes sense since she&#039;s first time, but you shouldn&#039;t play a champ first time in a pvp game.\r\n\r\nOkay i&#039;m done venting but can we acknowledge that it&#039;s much easier to lose a game for your team than to win one?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-05-04T09:56:38.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to solo carry to win\n\nUse your team as cannon fodder while you split push :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2018-05-04T09:30:39.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo, if riot wants this game to be a competitive, team-based game, then there is no place for solo-carry champions. Anyone should be able to build a lead, but if they can't spread that lead across the rest of their team, then there shouldn't be a reason for them to win.","replies":[]}]}
