Always stay close to your support. And if you have a fighter with a stun or some tanky presence, hide just behind them. Positioning around your tanks, supports and CC will keep you alive much longer. \n\nNext is playing support, but focusing on the ADC.\nNext time you get put into support. Focus hard on your ADC's behaviour. Think this, \"I want my ADC to do this\" then, when you play ADC, your support is probably thinking the exact same thing. Don't be lazy, think hard about everything that's going on. \n\nI mained support/adc from silver 5 to plat 2. Now I'm kinda stuck in plat 1-2, failed diamond promos 5 times haha. Good luck man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr X","date":"2017-07-11T13:24:56.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on my phone but I'll do my best to explain the ADC role.\n\nI main ADC/Support. \n\nOne thing to learn as an ADC is to Kite, kiting is everything and should be the second thing to learn. Kiting is where you attack your opponent whilst running away from them. There is a video on YouTube that can teach you. If you hold down the A button a circle will show around you, that is your range, always keep the enemy at the edge of this range. BTW jinx is awesome to kite with.\n\nLike the others have said play with your support, ping the ADC if your going to go all in. Stay behind the support if he's a tank. If your support is going to die do NOT heal him. Heal if you need healing and if your support needs it to then its a bonus.\n\nKeep your wards up, keep checking the map, get a control ward if the enemy has camouflaged champions such as Evelyn, twitch, rengar etc.\n\nAlways ping MIA, (missing in action).\n\nIf your up against some cancer bot lane duo and you can't push the lane, let them push and fight under tower, this is where they may make a mistake, would also be a good time for your jg to gank.\n\nTrying to zone them out so you get your cs is a really good strategy, as you get cs, they don't.\n\nDon't ever push your lane, if you have no vision.\n\nAdd me. Mr X\n\nI can teach you if you want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-07-09T21:26:06.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'm a jinx main and if you get a more aggressive support like thresh, Leona or blitzcrank, you want to focus of chaining cc with your traps. If you do this right you will usually get 40-50% of their health or force a flash. If you have something like a Janna, Nami, soraka, you just want to sit back and farm for your MASSIVE powerspike at 3 items. Your core items will be runaans first, into berserkers and IE. Then you can take anything out of BT, GA, lord Dominic's or Mercurial scimitar against something like a Warwick or ashe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-07-12T00:54:00.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you feed, a common tactic is to blame jg and supp, continue to feed and flame, then rage quit.
