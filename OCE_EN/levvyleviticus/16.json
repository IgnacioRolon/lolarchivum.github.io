Autofill applies when the queue time is too long/matchmaking can't find a team for your selected roles (which would happen if you picked say mid as first pref and whatever the other popular role is at the time as second pref), at which point matchmaking will autofill you, making your role fill whether you chose it or not.\n\nTHe easiest way to avoid autofill is to learn support, or at the very least, to not have sought after roles as both your prefs.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-28T23:00:16.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause people suck obviously ;^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-28T20:51:34.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I undertand if you're like \"Hey, whenever i choose autofill it really sucks!\"\n\n\nJUST DON'T CHOOSE IT","replies":[]}]}
