Legit twice I have gotten, out of five capsules, 450 champion fragments. These capsules give you next to no blue essence, and even if you do get a 6300 champion frag you only get 900-ish BE per level. I&#039;m pretty sure that in the time of getting a level i could get more than what most capsules give you. I&#039;m considering at this point to just buy a crapload of rp to get a bunch of 6300 champs so I can actually get champions. My champ pool is around 30, with only including about 4-5 6300 champions. For players who only play on weekends, like me, it could take weeks and weeks to get one 6300 champion. What I&#039;m proposing is a designated champion for every single level, like Annie and Nunu and Amumu and all that for level 1-20 then getting from level 20 getting champions from the 3150-6300 pool. Oh and i know this is long and i commend you for reading this wall of text but can we get more for disenchanting them? like maybe 1500-2000 for 6300? Riot Pls.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-28T05:05:40.216+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":">I'm considering at this point to just buy a crapload of rp to get a bunch of 6300 champs so I can actually get champions.\n\nYou just told riot what they want to hear.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-29T02:01:02.511+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ELGyzElg,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-28T05:05:40.216+0000)\n>\n> You just told riot what they want to hear.\n\n$$$$$ xdd","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-11-29T06:34:56.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say that completing missions that gives us straight up Blue Essence would be a good idea.\n\nRight now there is a mission going on, Project missions, completing one mission gives you the Project icon, by clicking on the icon in your loot, you can see Blue Essence.\n\nComplete missions to win tokens, and exchange tokens for Blue Essence, 1 token gives you 20 Blue Essence, go to your missions tab for more details on this.\n\nHopefully if Riot gives us missions that rewards us straight up Blue Essence in near future, it would be all good.\n\nI agree that it is not easy to obtain Blue Essence right now, as I have to disenchant shards because I don't have enough Blue Essence to upgrade a champion shard to permanent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-29T02:01:32.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, the 50 BE and 475 xp daily missions will be out SOON. \n\nThey promised it this patch im pre sure, just haven't seen it yet.","replies":[]}]}
