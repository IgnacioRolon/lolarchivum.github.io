I have been pklaying lately and losing almost every single match and i cant stand it because i love this game but i&#039;m playing shit. ONe factor though is that i have a toaster laptop that i play on that somethimes dips down to 5 fps but that&#039;s not the real problem soon anyway because ill get a good one. can someone please give me advice but not just &quot;cs and u win&quot; because i can cs somewhat well it&#039;s just the mechanical skill that i&#039;m lacking.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2018-01-03T06:10:29.385+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok first off, improve your CS. Not trolling here, but if you can consistently get it up above 6cs/min (which you've only done once in your last 11 games, not including jungle games) you'll find you reach your power spikes quicker, so you'll be less likely to be shit.\n\nJust generally (without seeing you play), learn when to trade and when not to trade with the common matchups you get in your lane. In a nutshell, if you can deal more damage than you take, or if you can make them burn resources/escapes/potions/summoner spells, it's a good trade. If it's not any of those things or you burn anything, it's a bad trade.\n\nIn terms of champion specific mechanics, watch streamers who play those champs. Pay attention to how they trade, how they position, when they choose to engage and when they play safe, where and when they ward, what items they buy and in which order (and how that changes depending on matchup). Try to do what they do as best as you can without overextending past your mechanical ability, and you'll improve.\n\nAlso realise that sometimes you get losing streaks. Take them on the chin and enjoy the win streaks when they come around.","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2018-01-03T08:35:58.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty, the only thing is that i want to get into yasuo and the only streamer that mains yasuo is moe (yassuo) (trashuo)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2018-01-07T13:04:59.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"get gud and watch youtube and play ranked","replies":[]},{"poster":"lolHarV","date":"2018-01-07T06:39:21.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:268}} FTW\n\nPlay/Find a champion that you can play well as....Learn their mechanics an techniques, master the champion, an ur skill level will improve greatly \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
