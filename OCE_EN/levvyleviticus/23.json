I'm a support main and i gotta tell you its super hard to carry a losing team from support if youre not on a play maker like leona. \n\nMy suggestion is to use the practice tools  to practice last hitting. Get really good at a couple of non-meta champs. So things that arent gonna get instantly banned. Do a normal game or two before trying a ranked each day to get your head in the game, and don't play ranked after a loss for that day, else it can get tilting and chances are you'll snowball loss after loss","replies":[]}]}
