Please note that Urf merchandise as well as the game mode is available until April 13 at 7 PM AEDT.\n> \n> As of now, we have completely sold out of Urf figures and we do not expect to stock any more. I’m sorry this merchandise sold out so fast. Urf, the greatest of us, provided a limited supply of items and while we were excited to see it take off, we were just as surprised to see how quickly it happened. Although we don’t have any immediate plans to summon Urf again, feel free to check back for future promotions and events. Let me know if you have any other questions regarding Riot merch.\n> \n> Nat4u\n> Player Support Specialist\n> Prefers Jungle\n\nSad{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-04-03T08:52:31.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i missed out too :(\n\n> \"How long will Ultra Random Figure mode last? \n> The mode will last as long as Ultra Rapid Fire mode is active in League of Legends.
