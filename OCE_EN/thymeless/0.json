Top Garen is probably my most played champion/position (and historically best), before the patch I was at about a 65% win rate and about 3.4 KDA with him.  I had been looking forward to playing him when I heard about what patch changes were coming but to say I have been disappointed with his changes doesn&#039;t cover it at all.   \r\n\r\nThe nerf to his Q-both the movement speed and silence makes him not be able to chase people down or escape the way he used to.  This in conjuction with the nerf to his HP and W make him just die when he tries to enter a battle which the slight increase in damage nowhere close to makes up for. His E doesn&#039;t seem much better-just a little more damage but I have really struggled to hit people with it do to the previously mentioned nerfs. \r\n\r\nAlso, was there a stealth nerf to the range of his ult?  There was nothing in the patch notes about it but it used to feel like you could cast it from a longer range than you can now.  Maybe its just my imagination because he used to be able to gap close better-though did anyone else notice this?\r\n\r\nIt sort of just feels like one of my favorite champions is just a shell of what he used to be so I  wanted to see if other people felt the same way. These observations are based off just a few games playing him and several games seeing other people try (and fail) to play him.","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-08-23T10:04:08.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just when I started to love playing Garen...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fall of Icarus","date":"2015-08-23T03:05:36.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needed the nerf to the silence with his more damage focus now, because if they didn't do that, there would be even less counterplay than there already was with it (or lack thereof), with the duration of it being enough to full combo someone to death, without them being able to do anything about it. Other than that I don't think much of it either way as I didn't play him much, but the true damage on his ult seems like something that was needed since Darius was introduced, even if it is only one target.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-23T01:59:48.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you don't use him tank anymore, he works best now with crit and high ad then just spinning in enemy team, the penta are fun","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-23T02:20:00.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zgbW5XFY,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-23T01:59:48.271+0000)\n>\n> you don't use him tank anymore\n\nthats what i miss =<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrystoff","date":"2015-08-23T00:35:27.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't had a chance to play him, but reading the changes did make me frustrated.\n\nI'll have to try him before i say anything, but he was my go to top lane, he just has such a fun playstyle. \n\n{http://champion.gg/champion/Garen} This says his winrates gone up by 5%, it is an interesting outcome of the patch from what i read, since most of it seemed to be nerf's, so maybe it's just a bit more time played with the new Garen to get some positive results.
