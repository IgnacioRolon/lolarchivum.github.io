I&#039;ve been getting into casting over the past year specifically and have had several successful play-by-play casts on broadcasts. However, i&#039;m looking to get most casts as where i used to &#039;work&#039; for haven&#039;t come up with any new casts in many months now. I don&#039;t mind if its for a small event, i&#039;m just looking to get more experience as a caster on a broadcast and looking to improve my skills through practice. I know that, as of writing this, i haven&#039;t casted in some time and i am wanting to return to my previous level and improve upon it. \r\nMy experience with casting has been casting the OOL in split 1 of 2017, as well as the Internation-Eports Federation 2017 Qualifiers. My casting style, as a play-by-play, is excitable and passionate, always hyping up the fights for the best viewer experience (And also because i get really into big teamfights and can&#039;t help myself).\r\nI&#039;m happy to provide evidence of my previous casts, and if anyone is interested. Either comment below or add me on league (League Ign is Eatos). \r\nCheers\r\n-Eatos","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-11-01T22:48:08.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you haven't already, I would suggest becoming active on twitter and interacting with fellow oceanic esports fans. \nThere is a pretty big community so you can network, as well as regular opportunities for things like casting advertised there before anywhere else. \n\nFollow the accounts of OPL/OCS players, ORG owners, Sumsoc, Letsplaylive, etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-01T17:53:11.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried contacting Summoner's Society OCE?
