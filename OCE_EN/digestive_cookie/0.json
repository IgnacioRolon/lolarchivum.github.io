And how many events have there been that haven't shown up on any of those places? None.\n\n**Thirdly**, Yea... Sure... of course riot is going to give out free codes of the most sought after skin in the game, just to anyone who asks, merely weeks before its much anticipated grand release, during which they make an absolute fortune...\n\nI actually can't comprehend the number of brain cells that would need to be missing for someone to actually think that...\n\nHave a little more faith in people's intelligence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-09-24T00:46:03.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for bringing the new scam to everyones attention.
