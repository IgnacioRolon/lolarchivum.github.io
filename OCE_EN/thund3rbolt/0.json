Watching NA LCS is engaging, it feels like your in the action. Oce feels like your just in the distance, with people talking and a game in the background, which is an issue.\n\nThe commentary should be supplementing the game, not the reverse.\n\nIt&#039;s such a simple thing to fix too. Turn commentary down, or turn the sound effects up.\n\nPlease fix this? It will only benefit Lol Esports in Oceania.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-06-07T01:02:52.842+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Thund3rBOLT - really good feedback.

I'm talking about sounds from summoners rift that are too quiet. Champion taunts, flashes, abilities, etc... They are so quiet compared to the commentary.\n\nIt makes the game sink into the background while we're listening to two or three people blabble about what we are seeing, but not hearing.","replies":[]}]}]}
