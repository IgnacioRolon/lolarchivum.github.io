The &#039;ol boy has been confirmed for a rework, most likely after Poopy and honestly I&#039;m keen. \r\n\r\nThere has been talk of Taric becoming a bigger, better modern ... support. Now don&#039;t get me wrong I love playing support but in all honesty Taric is the last bastion of hope for the &#039;fuck the meta&#039; pioneers since Kindred became a thing. \r\n\r\nTake him top and maul everyone who isn&#039;t smart enough to get armor pen or 1% lifesteal. Take him mid and show off your sick E skillshots. Do whatever you want, hell it&#039;s Taric. \r\n\r\nIf he is made to be a support then everything the community sees as being Taric may be lost, except for Taric x Ezreal r34.\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t bring back s3 Taric, I mean that was a little over the top but instead bring us a Taric that fucks Riven mains while still looking OUTRAGEOUS!!\r\n\r\nAnd you know, if he makes his grand re-appearance before 2017 that would be sexy AF. \r\n\r\nLong live Fighter/Tank Taric. Please RIP support Taric.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(RIP Yorick, 2011 - 2012) {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-04T12:16:42.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things I have pieced together from here and there:\n\nTaric rework to be released Jan-Feb (hopefully).\nStill a Tank/Supp\nNo point and click stun.
