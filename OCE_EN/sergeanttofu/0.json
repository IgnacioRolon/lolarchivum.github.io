In the lane, Ahri can control the lane hard, but Fizz wins the all in. If we're talking about overall champion quality, Ahri is probably the most versatile Mid laner there is. She can play as an assassin or a battle mage. She has huge mobility, good range and also unmissable close range abilities, has good cc, can kite like a mofo, can roam extremely well, has true damage, has good aoe, can siege and sick waveclear.","replies":[{"poster":"SergeantTofu","date":"2015-07-08T13:45:55.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you for your response, and i have in fact bought ahri!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-29T11:28:27.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate both champs cus they're both so mobile and stop me from hitting skillshots...\n\nbut if I had to say which was better (the one that I have a harder time beating), it's Fizz because he can become untargetable, Ahri looks more fun because she has fatal kisses, and who _doesn't_ like brutally murdering people with pink lipstick?","replies":[]},{"poster":"0j0j0","date":"2015-06-29T11:10:37.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how well you can play them.

It feels much harder shutting down a fizz because of his playful/trickster which makes him untargetable and able to dive you under turret. Ahri's ult gives her the mobility but she can still die and its pretty easy to shut her down, just gotta dodge the charm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2015-06-29T10:14:48.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"in a 1v1 against eeach other fizz would porobably win but hands down ahri is better\nshe has sustain, burst, true damage, massive mobility her ult does stupid damage like stupid, and charm need i say more","replies":[]}]}
