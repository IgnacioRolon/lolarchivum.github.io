So its overall fun impact on the game was somewhat diminished.\n\n\n_____________________\n\nThe best champs are champs that are fun to play as AND against. \nIn my opinion, some champs that achieve this are: \n{{champion:136}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:427}} {{champion:202}} {{champion:203}} {{champion:163}} {{champion:4}} {{champion:142}} \n\nAll of these have unique mechanics that offer _clear and significant strengths and weaknesses_ at all points throughout the game.\n\nFor example, no one has ever said _\"GG there's nothing we can do against this Sol.\"_ Because even a Sol fed through the roof can be duelled by pretty much anyone if played smart.  Yet he can still significantly impact games without being terrified of everything that moves.  In my mind, thats the mark of a great champ.\n\nGnar opens himself up to different champs throughout the course of the game.  Most mages cant really do a lot to him in Mega form, but can evaporate him in Mini.  ADC's get chased down in Mini form, but kite Mega out of existence.  This coupled with the fact that unlike many evolving champs, Gnar doesn't have a lot of control over when he changes, makes for a playstyle that exposes weaknesses in both players at times convenient for both Gnar and his enemies.\n\nJhin can be an utter monster, but his reload time and attack speed allow for small windows of complete vulnerability, which can mean the fall of a titan.\nI'm not going to say he isn't mobile, because thats a lie, he's more mobile than many champs with multiple dashes, but at least he has to work for it (kind of).\n\nIn my opinion Zoe is also a great champ for exposing strengths and weaknesses. Although I realise a lot of people still don't like her.\nYes she can 1-hit _(although nowhere near as reliably as many other champs)_, but it requires a lot of set up, and a lot of skill shots, and while she is trying to set it up, both her and her abilities are very very predictable.  Not to mention her ult is guaranteed to land her in a specific spot at a specific time. _(And that spot is very well advertised to the enemy)_.  Another example of clear strengths and weaknesses, which make her fun to play, and also not a hellish slog to play against.\n\n\n____________________\n\nPersonally I don't think 1-shots should ever be a thing, on any champ.  If I had my way, all champs would have significant strengths and weaknesses. Jumping out of invisibility and 1-hitting a target before they even realise what's happened, does not fall within that category.\n\nThe only champ I'm mildly comfortable with one-shots on, is Zoe.  Because you know it's coming, you're given a lot of time to react, and literally everything she hits you with is single target, slow moving and dodge-able.\n\nThe average human reaction time is 0.25 seconds.  Moving the mouse to the correct location takes another shall we say 0.10 seconds, if we add on ability cast/animation time.  Then we are looking at about at very least 0.5 seconds before most people can do anything meaningful to affect the outcome.\nI'm not sure about you, but on my death recap, I often get numbers under that _(hell, I often get numbers under 0.25 which means I didn't even have a chance)_.\n\nSo in my perfect world, no champ, for any reason would be able to 100% - 0% any other champ in under **AT LEAST** 0.5 seconds.\n\nKha'Zix would be no exception.\n\nPeople want to outplay each other, thats the appeal of the game right?\nI don't know how many outplays can happen in under 0.5 seconds?\n\nObviously this is all just my take on the matter.\nI like to know I won because I out-thought the other guy, not because i smashed Q faster than he did.","replies":[{"poster":"itachi uchiha67","date":"2019-06-17T09:18:20.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man i think you should put in back it makes it so fun\nbut they should perhapsy nearf this auto attack passive\nand probably delay someother abilityes\ni that would make it fair","replies":[]}]}]}
