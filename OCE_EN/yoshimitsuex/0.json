Not to mention all this is on top of his release skin.\n\nAll goods, Sol/Kindred/Taliyah can wait, we wouldn't want Yasuo to miss out on his 5th skin.\n\nBeing a Katana-wielding Cyborg, or a dark-flame Demon just isn't cool enough for me either tbh. We have to find him a **actual** badass skin, none of this Lone Cowboy or Blood Samurai shit either.\n\nMeanwhile, make a _**Dragon**_ champ, give them a _**Fire**_ skin, that'll give players enough variety to last the next few years or so!
