We want a team to play every Friday flex 5&rsquo;s from about 9pm to 3am NZST\r\n\r\nRank: solo/duo can be anywhere between silver 3 and gold 3 (we are pretty easy with the rank).\r\n\r\nMust have mic and be friendly, we want to win but would rather play with a fun 5 man than a toxic team.\r\n\r\nWe all need to be willing to learn from each other and grow as a team. \r\n\r\nLet me know in the comments or dm me if you are keen. Looking forward to meeting you","replies":[{"poster":"Crumpets","date":"2018-11-24T03:38:13.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi i am interested, Please add Crumpets","replies":[{"poster":"Kindręd","date":"2018-11-24T09:25:26.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ZoDuS","date":"2018-11-15T09:37:25.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im keen :D\nive come back from a break, im playing super well and feeling super fresh.\nMain Role - Midlane\nCan play ADC, Top and Jungle quite well but mid is my most Dominate Role feel free to add me\nIGN - ZoDuS","replies":[{"poster":"Kindręd","date":"2018-11-16T03:58:13.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great.
