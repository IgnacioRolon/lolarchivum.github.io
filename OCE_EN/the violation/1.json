Also looking for people to play/skype with for content with live commentary, I plan on uploading 2-3 times a week hopefully. Also if you could give the video a thumbs up and subscribe I'd really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Valkyn7AA","date":"2015-11-06T13:33:33.980+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really liked it man, nice to see some more OCE players making content, keep it up.","replies":[{"poster":"The Violation","date":"2015-11-06T13:37:42.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers man, it'll be hard to try and make a name when there's already a million other league youtubers out there but it's worth a shot haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mr4Eva","date":"2015-11-04T18:38:52.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instant problem i can see visually is the blurry black bars on the sides of the video.\n\n\nMusic audio level was far louder than the gameplay, which can be okay at times, for this video I think the gameplay audio for the announcer was necessary so it didn't seem to work that well. \n\nOther than that there isn't much to criticise, the videos simple and is just gameplay so it's not particularly entertaining or original.\n\nTo explain what I mean, it's not like a funny gameplay video, or a video with interesting tutorials or soothing post commmentary or a live comm, it's simply a spectator mode with music. One thing I will compliment is that your thumbnail isn't too awful. However there is room for improvement, the text is thin and rather difficult to read.\n\nbest advice I can give you is be more interesting and innovative perhaps in the videos you create. After all there's thousands of other gameplays of zyra penta kills out there :P\n\n--\n\n(btw I've also done league youtube for a while so you can add me oce if you wanted to record with me and potentially collab)\n(source: http://www.youtube.com/xx4evaal0nexx ) (might actually learn something off my channel XD )","replies":[{"poster":"The Violation","date":"2015-11-04T19:37:06.222+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the pointers man, I really didn't want to have to have music in the background to begin with but I'm slightly too awkward to do a solo commentary at the moment so I was waiting to find a group or at least 1 or 2 other people and do live commentaries and what not.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr4Eva","date":"2015-11-05T09:20:09.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not a bad idea, I've done both and I definitely found it easier as a group because you can just kinda chill and steal other people's funny moments for your video.
