I am now Plat and I&#039;ve seen alot of people including my friends struggle to get out of Bronze/Silver. I&#039;ve tried coaching them and its worked I&#039;ve gotten a couple of my mates out of bronze. So back in season 1, my brother showed me this game back in around early 2010 and I fell in love almost instantly, I didn&#039;t actually rank until season 2 where I was placed in bronze. I was only 11 so I still didn&#039;t understand the game properly. By season 3 I made it to silver and thats where my elo hell started. So I never really got &quot;good&quot; at the game until i was around 14 (season 4) where I finished that season in bronze 1. I wasn&#039;t over the moon about it but I didn&#039;t care too much. Eventually season 5 rolled around, I was hyped because I thought I would do my provisionals and land back in silver, but that wasn&#039;t the case. I would end up landing in Bronze 4... I felt embarrassed to be there and I needed to get out. I started playing my usual champs back then which were Vel&#039;Koz,Syndra, and Fizz. It didn&#039;t go too well, I ended up getting demoted to Bronze 5. This just pissed me off even more, I knew I was better than this and I went into every game thinking I was the best and I was always super cocky and would flame easy. \r\n\r\nHow I got out of Bronze\r\nSo I started watching a couple youtube guides to help me, I learned to go into  every game and not think of yourself as better as everyone else even if that may be true, you cannot put yourself above others you will just fall into the eternal bronze abyss. I learned to stop flaming so easily and since I got out of Bronze I have never seriously flamed a teammate for a mistake they might of made. My number one tip to getting out is: Find an easy champ and one trick them. In my case that was Jinx, I played the absolute hell out of Jinx and I still do today, I played her so much I would go into a game with her and expect myself to win lane which was often the case because she was broken back then Rush Infinity Edge and Phantom Dancer and just watch my enemys crumble. It took me 6 months to get out of there and once I did it was the best feeling ever, \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2 (Silver)\r\nSilver didn&#039;t take 6 months, It took all of about 2 or 3, So I got out of Silver by finding a good duo partner. At this point I was still maining jinx and I started to pick up Vayne and Lucian. I ended up finding a Support main and we would play almost every day, I went through alot of duo partners and I still look back on their profiles now and its sad to see that theyre still in silver but whatever it doesnt affect me too much. I just still one tricked Jinx and did the same thing I did in Bronze and it seemed to work until i got to about silver 3... Silver 3 in  my opinion is where you finally start to get a proper understanding of the game and how to win, You made it out of bronze but you&#039;re still in hell. After silver 3 Riot introduced this thing in ranked where you would select your role and you would get one of those. SO! it forced me to pick up another role which in this case was top lane, I already played Riven and Quinn alot so they were my goto. During URF I started playing Fiora. And during the couple days of URF I managed to get Fiora from 0 mastery points to about 30k. I love Fiora she&#039;s my main up in the top lane now. So after I got a wider champion pool I eventually made it out of Silver\r\nSo really just One trick a champion you like and be happy.\r\n\r\nPart 3 (Gold)\r\nThere&#039;s not much I can say about this elo. To me... Gold is paradise, Gold was and still is in my opinion the easiest elo to get through... It took me less than a month to get out of it by using about one thing. I learned to sit back and get carried. Gold was very intimidating for me because I thought everyone here was a god or something, Its not really the case, I think the majority of the people in gold just have a sense of achievement like they&#039;ve made it or something. So I would play Jinx or whatever and my goal would be to not die, and just let my Jungler and Support set up kills for me and now i&#039;m in Plat.\r\n\r\nI doubt anyone actually read the whole thing but I hope this helped some people and I&#039;m just happy to share my experiences","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-04T04:55:53.395+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"So you basically got out of bronze by taking advantage of a champion who was broken at the time\n\nCongrats","replies":[{"poster":"Jahseh Onfroy","date":"2016-10-04T09:03:43.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao no need to be sad over his success while you're still in Bronze 1, congrats on the climb to plat Pew Pew :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-04T09:17:42.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You idiots are all misinterpreting what I'm saying I meant no fucking offense for christ sake just having a little joke around now do me a favour and stop flaming everything I fucking post so done with this shit","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-05T22:41:13.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao you're the one flaming dude relaxxx eat a cookie{{item:2054}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-04T05:22:55.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao smart arse much.. dude that's how I got from B V last year to S II but I just grinded the crap out of Vayne..
