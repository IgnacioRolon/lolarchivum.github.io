This has never happened to me before and I&#039;m pretty sure Its not my computers fault as I do have a decent gaming pc. \nDue to this ive lost around 15-20lp and have been demoted from Plat 3 to Plat 4\nI understand that the client was broken yesterday but that shouldn&#039;t have affected my champion select, especially in ranked\nIt would be greatly appreciated if something was done about this or have my lp reimbursed, Preferably I&#039;d like my rank back but that may be too much to ask but 15-20Lp back would be fair.\nCheers - IPewPewYouQQ\n\nUpdate: it's still happening, I just tried to enter a normal game and when i went to accept the game it exited the accept/decline box and said I hadn't accepted when the little timer thing was just before halfway done, This is frustrating Riot please fix this.","replies":[]}
