Yesterday after I logged off and I just searched my match history on opgg but it said smth like &#039;the summoner name doesnt exist&#039;. The name before was &#039;FobGromp&#039; and I changed it to Kevvv. I searched FobGromp and I saw my match history. Then I couldnt log in and I tried to get my password by email but I didnt receive it on my email. Today in the morning opgg told me FobGromp doesnt exist so I was wondering if my acc got hacked and that %%%% hacked my email as well and I also guessed if my account got banned because of some reasons. I dont really know what just happened so can I get help by riot please.","replies":[{"poster":"Disheartened","date":"2016-10-19T09:13:08.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"now I made sure that guy didnt hack my account and email but anyone knows how do I get the password back without email?","replies":[]}]}
