Not only that but i think ur fixed the problem with ryze being toxic to vs because from what i&#039;ve seen he still has his machine gun but just not his w which is what caused ryze to be so annoying. But even by doing that i am still impressed that u managed to keep his core identity.  I really just have one problem with his rework and 1 question. The problem i have and it would have probably been hard to incorporate into this new kit but spellvamp. I would really appreciate it if somehow he had spell vamp because that is probably one of the funnest things about the current ryze.\r\nQuestion:\r\nhow reliant is ryze of cd, because neither roa {{item:3027}}  or seraphs {{item:3040}}  has  it so its going to take a while for him to get any decent amount of it.\r\nThanks to everyone who read","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-29T04:22:39.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">how reliant is ryze of cd, because neither roa  or seraphs  has it so its going to take a while for him to get any decent amount of it.\n\nHaving not played on the PBE and tried him, i'm just going to point out that you can easily have a ton of CDR coming through your runes.","replies":[]}]}
