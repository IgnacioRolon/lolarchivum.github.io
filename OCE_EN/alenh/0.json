He provides no buffs , auras , debuffs , heals , and is relatively weak and squishy early on without items , so he isnt much good at peeling either. Other then applying damage he has no other way to protect his carry . If your playing with a group of competent players then theres no reason why it couldnt work , but its still really a kill lane , as kennan is simply not a support , and never will be.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-21T11:11:18.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Annie, Blitzcrank, Zyra.","replies":[{"poster":"KidConfucius","date":"2015-09-21T12:03:10.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"annie's stun and poke is much more reliable in lane , and doesnt require her to get as close as kennen.  blitz is certainly a support as his kit is perfect for peeling and with all his cc he can control a fight very well, all he is lacking is poke , but with a pull/knockup/silence he is perfect as a support.  zyra is about the same as kennen, usable , but again there are much better choices.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-20T10:03:10.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"coz no one here keeps up with pro games.
