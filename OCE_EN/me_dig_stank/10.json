The 'well' meaning is incredibly well, as they shouldn't be in the mmr they are in. Because its such a disadvantage to the team. \n\nThis person playing a champ in off meta role 'well' only means that even if the play 'well' (Incredibly), they will only be on par with a meta champ playing average...\n\nSo that is why its such a huge disadvantage and why people moan about it so much.\n\nAlso that maybe why some let them play and believe that they say they are awesome with the off meta champ... Usually wrong though unfortunately.\n\nHope that clears it up for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-19T05:24:24.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is where you're only thinking of half the team though. While you are correct in that a meta champ will only need to be played at an average level to be good, you're assuming that they will always be playing good. I'm going to assume that we are talking about a silver-gold range, because that is where a lot of us are. Even if the other team has an entirely \"meta\" team, that means very little seeing as how they also have to be somewhat decent with those champs. I would 100% prefer someone play a champ they are good at and more importantly, comfortable with, than playing some meta champ. Even if that meta champ is basically braindead, click q and win, that is thought being put into the champ that isn't able to be put into the game itself. That is why I never listen to people who complain that I've just countered myself, as I would only do it when i'm confident on my champ. I could not tell you how many games i've gotten into, for example, as Twitch against Cait because people assume Cait always wins, and so they flame me for putting the team at a disadvantage. Unless that Cait is just as confident as I was on Twitch, there will be nearly 0 problems. That isn't even accounting for supports because that puts the entire lane in a different place. \n\nTLDR; Until you are playing at high diamond where you can assume that people are very good mechanically, play what you are good at OVER whatever is meta 100% of the time. You will win more often than trying to counterpick or just play what is meta. Unless you get incredibly unlucky and vs a diamond smurf in every game, you will climb.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-22T08:26:44.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a meta?\n\nFrom what I see, Riot has been doing their best this year to devolve the game to a point where \n_\"Whatever the f*ck you want.\"_ is the current meta.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2018-12-19T01:09:10.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will always be a meta, they can't balance the game perfectly, so there will always be one. \nWhat ever the pros do, us amateurs will (should) follow.
