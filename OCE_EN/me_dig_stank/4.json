You know this is toxic behavior you even see a red post about it saying the same thing.\n\nGGEZ once wont get you a perm ban, just read Mara's post, but constantly doing it and knowing it pisses off other players you MIGHT have to play with one day. Is stupid. \n\nIt is one of the things that keeps that never ending cycle alive where people get trolled, only to get annoyed, play another game while annoyed, and yell at others then making them annoyed to the point where they end up being one of the trolls who says \"GGEZ\" at the end of games. Monkey see, monkey do. Thing is we are humans not really monkeys, so we know how to and when to stop that and we should. Humans have the capacity to change and we have done so over the history of man and civilization, i mean for instance we don't kill deformed or handicapped babies/children anymore. \n\nSo saying that there is another side to the GGEZ thing is rather silly as there SHOULDN'T be another side, because that side is known to be toxic and unsportsmanlike. We don't need that unsportsman behavior anymore or at all. Banter during the match is okay, fine, say \"gotcha\" or some other thing, that isn't really that toxic. But doing poorly then saying nothing but GGEZ at the end of the match isn't banter, that is just out right being a troll. \nExample, you are out on the town and you meet a girl, she says she is 18, it turns out she is 15. You say oh fuck, and don't do it again. But if you keep doing it, over and over, seeking out that aged women then sure of course in the end you will get in trouble. So why keep doing it? Rules are in place for a reason. This game has an no toxicity/trolling rule, so why not abide by that rule?\n\nI never report someone for banter, even if i am salty or upset. I just live with it. But people who say EZ or GGEZ are just children. This is the reason people hate the yas or riven player thing, they just know they are a certain way or are most likely a troll. \n\n\nI mean sure.. if the enemy is being a total dick.. you kind of have the right to say GGEZ at the end kind of like a poke in the eye.

You first say its annoying and they should get a ban for saying it after a match then you say it is okay for them to say it after a close match... Pick one. Is it wrong or okay to say GGEZ at the end of the match when you did jack all for the game. \n\nAlso you have all the right to get upset that some ass is being disrespectful to you,  your team and even their own team by saying GGEZ. Not only does it say \"you are a noob\" to you, it also says \"your team suck and should learn how to play\" to your team, then to their own team it says \"that wasn't a challenge\" which means that HARD battle and game they had for that close victory meant nothing and that it is normal or not even normal, that real matches would be EVEN HARDER which means most likely they lose games dramatically over tight close matches with even skill. How does that not click in your head? Is it you are so oblivious to what the meaning of \"ggez\" means or do you use it and want to defend the toxic behavior?\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=clgnxlgw,comment-id=00050001000000000000,timestamp=2016-08-23T09:19:36.243+0000)\n>\n>Rules are in place for a reason, that doesn't mean those rules have correct morals behind them.

You can't really see moral behind them other than it is the design the creators have for their product or game. Sure you don't have to 100% follow those rules by all means. But if you go against the rules and don't expect to be punished at one point for not following the rules you are pretty stupid. They are there for a reason as i have already said, so why not abide by those rules?\n\nAlso low ELO isn't bronze to gold. Low ELO is Br5 -Gold5. After mid way into gold 4 it is Mid ELO which ends at Plat 5 if i remember correctly. \n\nTo the next part, you can take offense to anything thrown at you, sure you can't impart your will on everything you are offended by, but by all means i will take offense to someone who constantly acts like things are a cake walk when they really did nothing to offer help for their team other than being a punching bag to put abilities on CD so they aren't use on their team. Sure in some sense that is support or helping your team but that doesn't make the game easy for you or the team. Being toxic isn't OFFENDING someone it is just bringing the mood down of one or more parties and causing a domino effect which overall makes the entire community toxic/not nice to be around.\n\nPeople play for fun, they don't need some idiot bringing down the levels of fun. Sure in ranked you are playing 'for real' but most don't think that way, they think because they are bronze or low ELO they can get away with not caring or just out right being a dick to other human beings. Seriously that is another human you are being rude too. Would you just walk up to a random person and insult them? Would you walk up to someone who is sick and/or dying and tease them for dying or being sick?? Because that is what it is like when you call someone out for having a bad game or losing. \n\n>At the end of the day, sure. Ban these people, they deserve it, blah blah blah. I left my self ambiguous when I said your views on our community are warped. What I should have elaborated is that you judge people from saying ggez and literally get mad at them when what they have done is so minor. Soon you guys will be asking for the dance emote at the nexus to be re-portable because it is BM or has toxic intentions.\n\nNo that is not how it works. Emotes really don't impact the game, you can turn them off or just decrease volume. The only way to stop someone saying GGEZ at the end of the game is to know they are going to say it and mute them before they can. Which is hard because some people actually like to respect their foe and just say GG. Or GG close game. So i shouldn't have to mute everyone just so i don't see it said from my team and the enemy... that is just bad design as it is a MULTIPLAYER GAME, which involves TEAM WORK AND COMMUNICATION. So you take the communication side of the game out.. you just have a very dull game which has no feeling or impact on your self esteem. \n\nBannable offences will never escalate. They have been the same for the entire time this game has been around (and i have been playing this for close to 8 years i think, or 7, i started when beta released). And in that time i have not seen it change at all. Other than the menu choices for banning has expanded so it is easier for the support crew to sift through and find the really bad violations first.\n\nSo don't think banning for certain things babies the community, it will more relax it and make outsiders stop calling us the most toxic community for gaming. Because it isn't, there are many other games more toxic (COD, Rainbow6 and Squad to name a few). \n\n>These are actual mental issues that need to be explored, people who play video games have been known to commonly have anxiety issues. I sincerely ask you to read my explanation further below.\n>\n>I don't want to start an argument but to sum up my point, yes this should be reportable if you take offense from it, but why and how do you guys get offended in the first place? This is the internet in 2016, if you can't handle someone saying ggez, you will be eaten alive.\n\nWhat are mental issues? You are talking to someone who has a real mental issue and my mental issue is bad and never reflects on me as a person in game/in chat. (I have schizophrenia so yeah my mental illness is rather severe.. see things and hear things and i suffer from anxiety on a pretty large level when my paranoia is high.)\n\nBlaming this on anxiety is a poor excuse. It doesn't give you a valid reason to be a tosser to people online just because you have met one or two tossers in real life who do it doesn't mean you have to reflect that in game. Be you as you are in person in chat, you don't say \"fuck you\" to a guy who opens a door for you do you? So why do that to others in game. Blaming mental health issues is just silly... \n\n>Also, my definition of banter is clearly different to your definition of banter. League of Legends is a multicultural game, with different back grounds and races playing it in each region. I want to censor myself but if someone said \"F/// you\" or \"Nice try dumba//\", that is clearly banter to me. People who intend it in a toxic way can get muted and go about their business, but people who infer that it is toxic and report aren't solving anything.\n\nThe thing is that isn't really banter, that is negative banter. Real banter is \"Oh nice try\" Or \"close one!\" Or even cheeky stuff like \"thanks for pushing me away trist/name of champ who knocks back or away\". Adding things like ass or fuck are just trying to embellish a stereotype or just bad manners. Sure i have probably used swear words in banter but never directed towards the person. As you can see.. adding a swear to banter makes it seem hostile, it is a chat based system for communication not a visual, take tennis for instance, there is a couple famous players who use swearing or gestures which are rude, but only one or two are known for seeming like they are directed with malice. John McEnroe is the one i am mainly talking about, he has a very angry face when he says the stuff he said in matches. So in game it is hard to see our expression, you might be smiling when you say \"fuck you\" or laughing. But they can't tell unless you add more to the text. Which means more time and thought which most gamers wont or can't do as they are in a fast pace environment and every second matters. \n\nWatch some pro players. The chat is rather barren, they know every keystroke is important and most the time only will type when dead, at times to try make the enemy player type so they miss things. It is the reason i don't talk as much anymore, i can't tell you how many times typing something got me killed or miss something like CS or the map.\n\n(continue in another post)","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-24T08:28:49.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not gonna continue this argument, we have a different view and a different social standard and upbringing, just like any community.

My friends and people I meet in game say stuff like that, you might have different standards. But you refuse to accept these differences.\n\n\nYeah but the thing is mental illness shouldn't and doesn't come into this really. And you tried to bring it into the discussion (not an argument). I think it is just your grasp on words in general is the problem over our upbringings, because if you think upbringing is the reason i disagree with you, then you are sorely mistaken. \n\nI use swears all the time, i swear like a sailor. I do have to stop as i work as a nurse and it can be very difficult not to upset the residents or even boss. But it has nothing to do with swearing. I also was raised in a broken home in a very poor neighborhood so is it that you think? No because that would mean i would be like you said. \n\nMy issue is that you think that upbringing, mental health and 'manning' up is the problem with this community other then the fact the real issue is a on going one which involves people perpetuating an attitude instead of acting like a real person would. Sure if they were a bogan in real life then acted like a bogan in game sure of course that would be real to them. But even that needs restraint and they need to learn this is a bigger community full of many different types of people and acting out in any manner deserves some kind of punishment. You just seem to think we should let \"boys be boys\" so to say and let people get away with being crude and horrible people. \n\nAnd i didn't say you don't think ppl should be banned. I am directing more to the fact you say it is okay to say it(ggez), then also not okay to say it, in multiple comments which i can quote my self here as i can see you have wrote it. You can't back peddle on it, and from the fact you are backing down you seem to know you said the wrong thing or things already. You need to 'man up' and take that you said something wrong man.\n\nAnd yeah banter is different between different people but i think you clearly missed what i said due to some reading problem or something. Or maybe i said it wrong. Nope i read over what i said again, clear as day. What i am saying is some times using swearing in banter can be looked at as an attack as you can't see their face or hear the inflections on their voice. So you don't know it is in jest you can only hope they understand. When most don't. Most people come into a game already a little tilted or pissed off.. they got back from work, or had a fight with someone irl. Then you come along and say \"fucking bullshit\" or \"You fucked up\" and in their head due to stress or their mood they add to it, adding words like idiot, or you are bad. The difference between saying to someone \"you fucked up\" and \"oh man you messed up there\" is massive, from aggressive to a laugh. \n\nSeriously why do you think people probably type aggressively back at you all the time? I understand you use banter a certain way, i do to, you should hear me on mic or in person. But in a texted based communication game you can't use the same methods. You need to be considerate in some sense and not keep pushing over domino's until you or that person get banned or quit the game.\n\nIn the end everyone here is right in some sense. Sure a one time GGEZ is okay.. and some times just slips. But there are people out there who just always do it, a personal friend of mine i stopped playing with use to do it and i can't stand him saying it for all the reasons i said in the other post. It makes even ME feel bad that it was supposedly an easy mode game. And that is enough for me to report even my friend for and stop playing with him. It is the same thing with the N word really, people say it once and think it is okay but overall it will never be okay to even once say it, which is sad yes but you need to remember the weight the term or word carries before you use it and GGEZ has that same effect but in a GAMING sense. Sure it doesn't have the history the N word has but by god it is getting close.\n\nLook i am not attacking you, text is just hard to make it seem like you aren't attacking someone, which proves my point for ingame. So don't think i am. But you did start this, you disagreed but couldn't give a good reason for it, you kept going and still now think you are right with next to no reason for thinking that way other than \"my friends do it so yeah\" as a kind of ground to stand on no matter how shaky it is. \n\nI think the only way to get around this issue is add in game voice..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-08-23T15:13:57.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You can sweep up 99% of the people you don't agree with or get mad at but you will still get pissed off by the 1%.

This stops people getting reported for this unsportsmanlike behaviour and also fills the chat with nicer more meaningful comments, whilst also preventing the behaviour of writing smug comments at the end of the game because they effectively can't.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-27T11:30:18.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I think thats a cool idea!

I used to play Dota,Starcraft 2 and basketball in high school and University.\n\nIn all settings of course I have experienced both awesome sportsmanlike conduct and lame unsportsmanlike conduct. But what I can say is in most gaming communities and sports competitions sportsmanship is something to strive towards. Sportsmanship is something people care about because it ADDs to the experience of the game and the spirit of competition.\n\nSure gg ez is just a couple of letters, so is any abuse hurled around to be honest. But words all have meaning the only reason words and language exists is so that people can express feelings, reason, meaning to other people. You need to think of what the person that is saying gg ez is trying to get across to the opposing team. What are they trying to convey with their words. What is the meaning behind the words. More often than not as mentioned a few times in the comments here it's about rubbing salt in the wound, it's about being rude and reducing the efforts of the other team or it's a player trying to be a bit edgy and dropping it after game to feel good about themselves.\n\nI don't think I've ever seen this kind of statement in all my life after a sports match. Every basketball game I watch I see hand shakes and hugs, every basketball game I play at the end we shake hands and say well played to the other team. \n\nBack in the day when I played Dota and Starcraft 2 thats when \"GG\" was ingrained in me, it was so awesome that we as a gaming community developed a way to \"shake hands\" at the end of a match to acknowledge each other. It's a shame to see that devolve into some players BMing others, and if i can help shift it towards sportsmanship i will. I want to do this because I want League of Legends to be a great experience for all our players, I  want to see it establish itself as a game that can last generations. \n\n(starting to ramble about my dreams for League here haha)\n\nIf we as a community don't foster a sportsmanlike community for our game it will be difficult for it to stand the test of time. In my opinion, for a game to become multi generational it needs to teach lessons that transcend the game. It needs to be more than a game, like it already is to a lot of us. It's taught me a lot about patience and how to take ownership of my mistakes. How not to blame others and how to focus on things that only I can control. (that ranked climb though). I've made friends, learnt about team work and so much more from the game. A part of any competitive game needs to have sportsmanship, it needs to help us learn what it means to be respectful to others. Humble in victory and graceful in defeat. All that jazz. League of Legends can be all this and more if we let it. We have a great big diverse community of players, and I really hope that we can all work together to make a truly special game and community.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-08-23T04:00:49.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Surprisingly i think DOTA2 had a great community while i played.

I am been general here.\n\nWhat happened to people to be so fragile? I don't say it but still the fact that people talk like someone has done something punish-worthy is insane. Saying GGEZ at the end of the game and making someone get offended is not only not their intention, but even if it was you have to be already mad to feel down.\n\nPeople misjudge where their tilt/emotions come from. They will be previously upset (such as losing a game by a stomp) and then when someone shatters their image where everyone gets along or everyone is 100% respectful regardless of situations they take it all out on them. It's honestly emotionally unstable, and due to their anxiety issues need to see a therapist.\n\nBelieve it or not, I've been there once. I would get sad/mad if someone flamed me all game, I would get super tilted when I lost and would flame people who say \"GGEZ\", I would report people for breaking the rules, and I would leave the game stressed because I fed when I did.\n\nI had anxiety problems and started seeing a therapist, it was taking me lower and lower to the point where my self esteem got effected. It wasn't League, but I labelled League as the problem. People who pissed me off once, would get grouped together with other people who pissed me off and all my anger would be put onto them. It's not a healthy or rational way of thinking.\n\nI eventually learned to cope and grew up thanks to my therapist, now I like to consider myself a stable person. I remember a few months ago if even that someone was mixing up AUD and USD when explaining what RP has more value in an obvious mistake when researching. I replied something like \"AUD is different to USD use your head\", because the OP would have been confused and the replying person make a dumb mistake, but with my fraction \"use your head\", I wasn't intending it negatively, it was more or less playful as to point out his mistake, I mean we live in OCE if you speak fluent English you are most likely living in NZ or Australia, if not I don't expect Indonesians or other places to be too unused to banter either.\n\nLong story short, he went on comparing me to a murderer by using an analogy to do with me stabbing him on the street, called for help to a mod and stopped comments on the thread. I was mad for about a day because if you have any self management or social skills you aren't going to start crying when someone says \"use your head\". And it's because anxiety builds up, and you weaken your self.\n\nPeople need to grow a shell if they are going to operate online on forums or in game. Obviously not everyone has the same situation and was raised like me, but I used to get bullied beyond repair and went through \"depression\" for a few years. It is legitimately yourself getting in your own head and making things out worse than they actually are.\n\nThis is the real world. If you are upset at someone, reporting them could potentially get them punished, but it doesn't make you not upset. So if you get mad often in game, do /mute all at the start. If you can't handle arguments on online forums, don't post incorrectly structured and statements that aren't though out.\n\nEven though I am in his presence, I have to completely disagree with Maraudaur here. Saying ggez is not toxic, people who do it (again not me) are not toxic, and do not negatively impact the game. If Riot is wasting time punishing people who say ggez instead of devoting that team to more urgent causes then there is something wrong.\n\nWe have a sportsmanlike community, most people are silent. Some people talk strategy. Some people talk banter. And then some people are jerks. People who say \"ggez\" fall into the 3rd category, but that's besides the point. It doesn't matter what anyone says, if you open yourself up to a random and get mad you are the one getting yourself mad.\n\nSure toxic people shouldn't be toxic, but it is pretty easy not to be effected by muting, or as I personally do, not caring at all. You are your own person, worrying about what a random person on the internet says about you is not emotionally healthy, especially if you play league of legends. \n\nIn the end, people are annoying, and weaker people have the right to report or as I prefer they did mute, but they shouldn't be getting hurt in the first place, it's not cool to annoy someone. However, If you get offended or butthurt because someone says \"ggez\", it is 100% not that person rubbing it in on a victory. It is him having a little fun with his victory, as much as it may be BM, it is in the end banter and not meant to be taken seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-08-23T01:00:42.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nThank you for putting your view point here. There are definitely lots of parts I agree with and I'm glad you've been on a personal growth journey and come out on the other side better for it.\n\nI agree overall we have a sportsmanlike community. Most turn up play the game and move on to the next, turning up and doing their job (to the best of their ability) is a show of sportsmanship and definitely something we (Riot) and our players don't recognise enough!\n\nSome people are definitely jerks, and we need standards in place to give them feedback so they know that kind of behaviour isn't acceptable in our community and game. Historically what we have seen is GG EZ for a majority of our players falls into this catergory. Whether its a 50 minute nail biter or a 20 minute stomp there's no need to be a dick about it. say GG acknowledge the other teams efforts and move on.\n\nYou talk about growing a shell and not getting upset, I KINDA agree with that and let me explain my thoughts on the matter. I think all players can definitely be a bit more gritty and resilient when there are jerks in game. Not let it get to them, don't add fuel to the fire. I agree with that part. But thats only ONE side of the coin. On the other hand we also need to show the jerks or unsportsmanlike players that, hey being a dick in our game isn't okay. Being a dick to our community isnt okay. If you want to be apart of this community you need to be respectful and sportsmanlike. You can ADD value to this game, you can ADD value to this community. Don't join this community and game to detract from our experience. Join this community and be a positive force.\n\nI don't get MAD when people say gg ez, I find it unsportsmanlike and disrespectful. I get slightly annoyed. I feel it takes away a positive experience I could have in the game if both teams were respectful (don't get me wrong MOST of the time its GREAT we play a fun game and GGs all round). So GG EZ to me isn't something HUGE.
