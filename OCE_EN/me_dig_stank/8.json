I understand bot being tethered, but generally  i've been bound I find it rather uncessary screen clutter and distracting  espcially in the heat of battle.  Also there are times when I have had kalista top and I dont want a tether all game but get on e regardless .  \r\n\r\nI have even had a troll Kalista tether me then proceed to feed and pull me into the other team !  I feel this should be an ability that both can activate and deactivate in game?  \r\n  \r\nGuess my only options are to \"get gud\" or gtfo (q dodge), am I right?  \r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate others thoughts on Kalistas Ultimate and tether?","replies":[{"poster":"BrbDoingWraiths","date":"2014-11-27T07:34:08.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They shouldn't have been able to throw you into the enemy to troll, you choose the direction.

The amount of GRIEFING that goes hand in hand with the same breathe that is MOBA makes this a pretty outstanding issue, a detriment to the maximum potential enjoyability of the game.
