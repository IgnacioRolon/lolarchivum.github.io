It's very likely to make you're adc toxic if not irrelevant due to the ks's and making last hitting minions very difficult. Other than that I don't see why there is an issue. \n\nP.S. reporting anyone for any issue other than what's listed in the report feature post game or in the player behaviour boards will get the reporter in more trouble than yourself. It is an offence to report anyone for something that is not deemed an offence by riot and picking any champion into any role is not an offence!","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-12T13:29:11.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's wrong with Heim jungle? Your turrets can tank and clear camps very well, he is a good split pusher late game, he provides lots of damage in choke points, benefits from Runic Echoes, and his Ult+E is really good for a guaranteed kill in ganks.\n\nClosed minded.
