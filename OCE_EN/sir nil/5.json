My team does too good and starts to throw and eventurely loses late game,\r\n2. My team feeds and we lost early,\r\n3. The OP as f**k Renekton and Tryndamere gets too fed and and split pushes top and my team instead of rallying together in a 4 or at least 3v1 they go in turns and fight them in a series of 1v1s and feeds them more,\r\nI need advice on how I can get rid of this tilt, i have tried my best to stay calm throughout all these games and tried to ping and tell them to be careful but no one seems to listen.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-11-24T12:17:03.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"looking at your recent games you do pretty poorly yourself. just focus on not getting killed so much and farming a bit more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DalIas","date":"2015-11-24T11:50:59.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing that tilted me the most was flaming other people when they make mistakes. I climbed from silver 4 to plat 3 by staying positive and working on my mechanics. If you talk trash to them when they make a silly play they'll play even worse. Just keep a positive attitude man it's the only thing you can do! (And ask first pick to ban any champs you think are op). \n\nBest of luck dude!","replies":[]}]}
