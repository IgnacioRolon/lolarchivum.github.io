And my connection is incredibly stable and i live very close to the servers (5-15ms most times) and not to mention it is a cable connnection. Yet i still get a black screen before champ select. It isn't as long as OP's but at times it can take up to 15-20 seconds long. Where my brother who had a crappy computer compared to mine got in near instantly with no black screen. \n\nIt doens't happen ever in ranked for me though. So i think it might be a blind pick issue or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-22T08:04:15.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
