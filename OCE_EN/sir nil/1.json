So far only the zed and sona teasers have come up and after watching the sona teaser something ticked in me. Why was there a wound where sona's throat is? And why did the wound come out of Zeds eye? I thought that it had something to do with their lore not just any random place riot just thought of. Sona is mute which is a defining part of her character other then the musician. Zed might&#039;ve lost an eye during the countless battles with Shen or when he fought shen&#039;s dad, if he did that wound would define his character cause it is a scar from his endless battles against Shen or as a constant reminder to him killing Shen&#039;s dad, both defining parts of his lore. Now think Vi I can bet she&#039;s gonna be hit either in her hands or in the the tattoo on cheek because those are defining bits of her lore. I&#039;m not too sure of garen because he&#039;s an old champion and the lores quiet fuzzy but I think it might have something to do with his love for Katarina. That is my theory if u can call it that. This was more of a way to connect the champions together then an actual theory.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-30T01:47:01.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw someone comment that it has a strong link to Taric too. If you look at the gifs.\n\nSona (white) - Opal For Harmony\nZed (blue) - Sapphire for Divinity \nVi (red) - Ruby for Vigor\nGaren (green) - Emerald for Insight\n\nEveryone seems to focus on the ninja angle because Zed was the first one. But i don't see any other ninja's being targeted.\n\nThat being said, I think it is a new champion, not Taric. Just thought it was interesting that the colours were actually correct.\n\nEDIT: changed my mind after the Garen teaser. Its Taric for sure. That looks like Crystal piercing him.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-31T18:16:46.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they are if anything doing a Taric rework + a Champion release.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-30T09:39:41.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't know but my friend told me this:\n\nZed is a 3 letter word \nSona is 4\nGaren is 5\nVI means 6\nDeadeye is 7 \n\nthey have also (to date) been teased in that order too.\n\ni cant remember the rest of the conversation so i don't know what it means, but it may be more that a coincidence.\nits the only way I've seen so far that clearly links 4 champs that have nothing to do with eachother. \n\n\nBut maybe not...\n\ni guess it doesnt really matter anyway because in a few days we will know anyway.\nand people always way overthink these things anyway.\ni don't see any reason why this champ should have anything to do with Shen or Zed anyway, just because he was the first teased doesn't means that he is more important that sona or garen.\nXerath was teased for kalista but that doesn't make her related to the shuriman lore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-29T20:56:28.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're almost there. **Zed**'s eyes were targeted because of his connection with darkness and shadow.
