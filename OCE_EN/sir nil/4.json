Here&#039;s why, league of legends has peaked, meaning that lol had a rapid increase of popularity but has lost that and is slowly dying. the reason why I think this is because riot has not released a count for active users since 2014, almost 2 years ago. The last time riot has released a player count was when they experienced a rapid amount of growth, where the number of players have increased dramatically. Now if league was to continue that state of rapid growth, league would have around 90 million players by now. But it hasn&#039;t, because people more people are quitting the game than joining it. This is probably to the bad reputation of the community and lack of any real tutorials. But why do I think this? It&#039;s because riot hasn&#039;t released a player count since 2014 which if they had increased I players they would release a new count, but if they say that the game is slowly losing players, it&#039;s bad advertising, and according to a ten cent employee (the company that owns riot) league actually has lost 3 million players since 2014. But how does this have anything to do with dynamic q? Because riot is trying to make the game more team focused and trying to encourage players to invite more players in order to prevent league from dying. Dynamic q was down just to do that, even the new rotating game mode was made to make older players come back to play those games, instead of just playing league 3 or 4 times every year to play the game modes, with the rotating game mode older players have more reason to play league more frequently. But by doing all this. However despite riots best attempts I feel like riot might get a backlash, where players would actually start leaving the game because solo q was removed and actually kill the game faster. Solo q while it is a nice way to test individual skill, league simply doesn&#039;t need only a few million dedicated players, they need tens of millions of players that will all give riot the money to survive, league being riots only game means that riot has only 1 way of making money. And that&#039;s all they care about money, if league doesn&#039;t get more new players than leaving ones, then the game will die eventurely. What dynamic q is is a desperate attempt by riot to increase the amount of players to ensure leagues long term survival. By giving players more reason to invite new players and increasing the reason for old players to return, riot will ensure leagues survival. They could release solo q along with dynamic q, but that would turn dynamic q into a joke, like the old team builder, most people will flock to solo q while the others will go to the dynamic q. Which would create even longer q timers and would ruin dynamic q. That is why solo q won&#039;t be released.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: League is losing more players than it is gaining so dynamic q is an excuse to convince players to invite more people to the game.\r\n\r\nHow we can bring back dynamic q:\r\n1: we do what riot wants and invite more people.\r\n(By increasing the amount of players we can destroy the one reason dynamic q was created for)\r\n2: we make riot care more about the esport side of league than than the casual side.\r\n(If riot cared more for lcs then dynamic q would only decrease the quality of players in lcs in the long term which will end up decreasing the amount of viewers because you realize most lcs players are now crap, this might however also end up in league dying even quicker, and might also destroy balancing for lower elos)\r\n3: idk think of something in the comments","replies":[{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2016-04-17T13:12:18.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"League peaked in season 3 friend.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-17T12:50:33.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solo Q wouldn't work anyway, the whole point of dynamic Q is that you can play with multiple friends. But imagine if solo Q was active, and you had a group of 4 people in dynamic, Q times would be hours and you'd still not find that 1 extra player, because no self-respecting person is going to play solo in dynamic Q when solo Q exists, which means that people with 3 friends will never find a game, also it means that Q times for Duos will jump through the roof as well. \n\nIt was doomed from the start regardless of whatever other reasons there might have been.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-17T12:53:56.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which is why Riots putting so much effort into trying to force us to take dynamic Queue, because they don't want to be wasting all this time, even though the proper solution is to just give up and give us solo before you waste way too many hours on trying to balance a useless queue.","replies":[]}]}]}
