Currently Silver V, highest I have been is Silver 1. I can give at least 40 Hours a week to game time and take constructive criticism very well, I don't rage and am just keen to do the best I can!","replies":[]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-05-31T13:35:49.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not quite Diamond 1, but if you provide me with enough stimuli I should be able to play to that standard, as I have my on and off days in terms of skill level. I'm very eager to join as I think I should be able to learn and communicate with the team quickly. All that's needed is for some proper motivation to be present and I can play well. \n\nThink about it. ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"archfugle","date":"2016-06-01T06:51:34.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man ive already sent you a request from the previous post, just waiting on you to accept it haha","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-06-02T05:53:52.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, I never saw it haha.
