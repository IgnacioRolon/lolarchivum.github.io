I was wondering if I could register as a sub, or potentially a player. I heard from another user that you could be potentially recruiting, and as our OOL org. (Hyperlight gaming) has disbanded both of teams I was wondering if it would be at all possible to join you. \nIf not, I'm happy to try out as a coach, as I have enough game knowledge to fill you in on mistakes, adaptations and directions in gameplay. Though, I've never been a coach before, I've previously been a very verbal player in most of my past teams and since I usually play mid/jungle that makes me the primary shotcaller.\n\nAnyhow, consider if you wish. Just feel free include me if you want. Thank you for your time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trissy","date":"2016-05-25T04:33:32.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I'd love to talk to you about coming on board.
