For example:\r\n\r\nYou click on &quot;Create A Discussion&quot;\r\n\r\nThe page provides a list of the nature of the problem:\r\n\r\n- Client\r\n- Game\r\n- Bans\r\n- Report a hacker\r\n\r\nThen it gets more granular. Say you then click on Client, the next list shows things like:\r\n\r\n- Shop\r\n- Chat\r\n- Loot\r\n- Champion selection\r\n\r\nAnd depending on the sub tree selection you&#039;ve made, a suggestion for relevant KB articles and FAQs are provided.\r\n\r\nI think this would give the documentation written for users a lot more publicity and clear the boards up if it was an enforced process prior to creating a discussion in Help and Support.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Rito, would it save you guys a lot of hassle in this area?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-25T16:19:09.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ideally that's what the pinned thread in H and S is for https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbPY3Rpr-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here . As to what you are suggesting, boards just isn't capable of it at the moment and there are no resources available for boards dev atm.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2017-05-26T12:52:13.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Seras,\n\nThat URL returns a 404 for me but I found the page you mean. This is a good spot for that information. \n\nAs for the resources, I see Riot are looking for a web dev in Taiwan, and one of the job roles is:\n\n\"Tap the pulse of the Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau League communities to better identify and produce the features and systems that leagueoflegends.com needs to deliver a first-rate player experience\"\n\nIs that PR speak for monitoring the boards?\n\nWe're nearly into the new financial year so maybe there will be more resources coming up. \n\nJust a suggestion anyway.\n\nCheers","replies":[]}]}]}
