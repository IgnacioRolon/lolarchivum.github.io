VOIP has been out for a while now Riot...\r\n**On a sidenote:**\r\nIn my opinion, it&#039;s pretty rich to offer a VOIP service to your LCS players while they&#039;re hitting the bigtime, but not have one embedded in the game that the rest of your community plays.\r\n\r\n**TL,DR: Bump if you want VOIP in-game.

Conversing with someone allows you to recognize them as a human, not just a feeding piece of trash that should be gunned down.

League of Legends as it stands is a very toxic environment. Players are already finding it hard enough to deal with the written abuse thrown at them. Do we really want to give players another platform to abuse players with? External voice systems such as Curse and Skype allow for users to control who they talk to. Chances are no one will be verbally abusing each other in Curse or Skype...unless your friends a total d1ck. But hey. That's just my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2015-09-17T11:57:22.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The mute button would still exist.
