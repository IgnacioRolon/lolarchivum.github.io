One idea is an Urgot cosplay skin for Elise, where she has the Frankenstein&#039;s monster look, and her spiders are mini Urgots. Nasus and Renekton could cosplay as each other. Ezreal and Taric could cosplay together. Draven could cosplay as himself. Bard could cosplay as a champion that actually matters, lots of combinations.
