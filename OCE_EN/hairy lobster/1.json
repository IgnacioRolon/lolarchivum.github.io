His new ult is also not unique enough to pick him. Pick a Kindred JG and Taric stays in his 2% pick rate box.\r\n\r\nYou can keep the new model, just give Taric his gems back.\r\n\r\nBe outrageous and do it Rito, I don&#039;t think anyone will notice.\r\n\r\nAlso I think there should be some greater player base input on how this game is shaped in future. Let&#039;s not forget the moral of the Nostalrius saga.\r\n{{champion:44}}","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-29T08:06:13.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i disagree, E led to bigger more complicated plays, W allows an ally to become butt buddies with you and has a sheild, you Q can apply to the whole team and works well if you get healing items, his ult is awesome","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-26T17:13:01.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I like the new Taric gameplay, but his numbers are pretty low, especially the Q heal, it's terrible!","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2017-05-27T02:12:13.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it was nerfed hard.
