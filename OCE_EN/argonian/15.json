Oddly enough it only seems to affect Jinx and Teemo (Who plays Teemo to even care though) and i also know as a fact it isn't Malware that's causing it since i scan my Computer every time it's turned on.\r\nAny and all help will be appreciated; I only recently bought Jinx's Firecracker Skin and have only had 2 Games to really enjoy it.\r\n\r\n-Doomy","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-24T07:19:09.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i also know as a fact it isn't Malware that's causing it since i scan my Computer every time it's turned on.\n\nWell that really depends. If it was malware designed to circumvent your scanner, then of course your scanner would say everything's fine.\n\nSo, this issue, it happens with any champion you choose or just Jinx and Teemo? (It could just be that the error just *happened* to occur on those two times)","replies":[{"poster":"Argonian","date":"2015-02-24T12:19:12.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=xnihVZrJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-24T07:19:09.349+0000)\n>\n> Well that really depends.

Still gives me the problem though. :(","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T04:59:23.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main thing I noticed about that screen-cap is that your graphics driver is looking kinda **four years old**. Could you check to see if they've updated it? I understand that it *is* Intel, though, and if you struggle to find an update, you're probably better off not looking for one.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
