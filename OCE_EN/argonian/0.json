He was strong before jungle got buffed, but now he barely survives killing his second buff. \n\nNautilus, Sejuani and Sion do his job better.

So hes in a weird spot. If you get a decent lead you should be fine its just he doesn't offer a lot. Its also tricky in the fact that riot based him around his chunks that fall off him when he casts, and its not really viable for him to run around a teamfight getting his chunks, so hes not viable much at all :(. But if you push ahead of the pack you should be fine, his E his a great ganking tool too!","replies":[]}]}
