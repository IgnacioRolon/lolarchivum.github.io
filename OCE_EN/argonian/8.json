I&#039;d like to suggest something i&#039;ve been thinking about for quite some time now. You know how everyone loves Featured Modes but sometimes can&#039;t catch them either it be a Holiday or no access to a Computer? Well i&#039;d like to suggest that a few Featured Game Modes such as URF, Ascension or Doom Bots get added to Custom Games so those that missed out on the actual event can catch up with it whenever they want with the people they want to play with. Also, I&#039;m aware with Fast-Paced Featured Gamemodes such as URF IP/XP Gains would be a problem so i&#039;d also like to suggest a decrease in rewards for Featured Custom Games.\r\nLemme know what you all think :)\r\n\r\n-Argonian\r\n {{champion:58}}","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-13T09:38:50.754+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's a good idea\n0 originality though. it's been said a million times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-04-14T07:43:02.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fantastic idea, but Riot will never implement it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Boomshakalacka","date":"2015-04-13T11:42:07.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i love your idea i thought it would also be great if you could play bots on these feature modes.
