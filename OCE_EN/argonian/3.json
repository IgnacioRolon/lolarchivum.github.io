(Any not listed in the screenshot above i already own) I prefer skins that are worth the money in terms of Splash Art, In-Game Visuals, Sound Quality and ability Particles. What would any of you choose if you were given the opportunity to choose any 3 from the screenshot above?\n\nEDIT: Purchase has been made; Final Boss Veigar, Forecast Janna and Arclight Vel'Koz have been purchased as a result of this thread.","replies":[{"poster":"GEARSTICK","date":"2015-01-29T12:50:49.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, do you even play these champs?
