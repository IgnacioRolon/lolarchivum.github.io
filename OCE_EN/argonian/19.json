I bought myself $100 worth of Prepaid Cards and only one registered and gave me RP, The other gave me a \"This code is not valid\" message. I know the error message isn't true since i already double checked the guy at the counter scanned it, activated it and everything; Rung up the store again to see if he actually did; Gave him the barcode # and he told me it was able to be redeemed. Re-Tried and still no luck.\n\nAny help?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-11T05:41:00.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a piece of paper, write your summoner name and region on it, and take a photo of that along with the card (barcode visible and legible) and then send in a support ticket basically rephrasing what you said here. They'll ask you to do something similar to what I've just told you to do. I don't know if including the photo in the original ticket will make this go any faster, because I don't think the bots are programmed to recognise attachments sent in the opening ticket.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
