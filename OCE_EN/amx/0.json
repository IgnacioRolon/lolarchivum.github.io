You need to have the MMR of a Bronze 5 to do it however, there is no safe period but if you're FRESH silver V it'd take like 8 - 12 Losses on 0 to tank that much MMR. Dosen't Necessarily have to be straight you could win 1 lose 3 win 1 lose 2 win 2 lose 4 win 1 lose 3 and demote.\nI'd like to point out that you're Safe from Decay until platinum so if you don't mind waiting it out that's always and option if you're unsure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-14T08:53:03.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes if you continue to lose games while on 0lp you can drop down to bronze 1.\nI think you have 5 games after reaching silver 5 where you are safe and can't drop but after those 5 games are played the safety net is gone.
