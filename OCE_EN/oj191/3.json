Plenty of room for awesome water effects in movement/attacks/abilities.\n\nNew mechanics required: Nimue's skills must be able to knockback/push/pull enemy champions without causing loss of control, and be able to disable mobility spells without disabling summoner spells.\n\nDISCLAIMER: ALL NUMBERS ARE ESTIMATES ONLY\n\nSTATS:\n\nHealth: 508 (+76)\nHealth Regen: 5.42 (+0.55)\nMana: 325 (+45)\nMana Regen: 8 (+0.6)\nRange: 550\nAttack Damage: 57 (+3)\nAttack Speed: 0.625 (+1.36%)\nArmor: 21.88 (+3.5)\nMagic Resist: 30 (+0)\nMovement Speed: 330\n\nABILITIES:\n\nPassive - Sea's Embrace - Static Cooldown: 8 / 7 / 6\nNimue's next ability which strikes a champion chills all champions hit, slowing them by 10 / 15 / 20% for 2 seconds. The slow duration is refreshed if a champion is struck by the triggering ability multiple times.\n\nThis cooldown is halted for 3 / 2 / 1 seconds if Nimue uses an ability.\n\n[So, every hit of Aqua Slicer will refresh the duration, or it will continually refresh while they are in Maelstrom or Riptide, or being hit by Aqua Burst.]\n\nQ - Aqua Slicer - Range: 1200 - Cost: 50 / 55 / 60 / 65 / 70 MANA - Cooldown: 8.5\nActive: Nimue launches a series of threadlike jets of water in a line, dealing magic damage to all enemies they pass through. Aqua Slicer can be cast up to two additional times within 2 seconds for no cost, with a 0.3 second static cooldown between each of the three casts.\n\nAqua Slicer's cooldown does not begin until it has been cast three times, or 2 seconds have elapsed.\n\nMagic Damage: 20 / 35 / 50 / 70 / 90 (+ 25% AP)\nTotal Damage: 60 / 105 / 150 / 210 / 270 (+ 75% AP)\nProjectile Speed: 2000 [same as Ezreal's Mystic Shot]\n\n[Projectile width is similar to Yasuo Q, or even slightly slimmer. Visually extremely thin, but spread out lengthways like a whip, curving vertically, but NOT connected to Nimue - like a vertical crescent moon shape with the curved side facing forwards.]\n\nW - Maelstrom - Range 700 - Cost: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 MANA - Cooldown: 21 / 19 / 17 / 15 / 13\nActive: After a 0.25 second delay, Nimue summons a vortex at target 300-radius area, pulling enemies in a spiral motion towards the centre with increasing force over 3 seconds dealing magic damage per second. The vortex prevents use of mobility spells but not summoner spells. Enemies who are in the centre of the vortex at the end of the duration are knocked airborne for 1 second, and take additional magic damage.\n\nThe vortex does not interrupt channelled abilities or cause loss of control.\nMaelstrom's cooldown does not begin until the duration has elapsed.\n\nMagic Damage per second: 20 / 35 / 50 / 65 / 80 (+ 20% AP)\nSecondary Magic Damage: 60 / 75 / 90 / 105 / 120 (+ 30% AP)\nVortex force increase per second: 100 / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100\nVortex force: 250 / 275 / 300 / 325 / 350\n\n[Note that champions can still move while in the vortex, so the effective pulling force is actually vortex force minus champion movespeed. The vortex should have some kind of visual effect to make clear that it is doing constant damage per second. An appropriate crowd control indicator needs to be created to let the victim know that they cannot use mobility spells. Vortex force is expresses as an equivalent of champion movespeed, ie a riptide force of 250 will make a stationary champion move at 250 movespeed.]\n\nE - Riptide - Range 1400 - Cost: 50 / 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 MANA - Cooldown: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10\nActive: Nimue forms a wave that moves outward in a line dealing magic damage to all enemies struck by the wavefront before reversing direction and triggering a riptide, pulling all enemies within the wave back towards Nimue for 3 seconds, dealing further magic damage per second to all enemies caught in the riptide. Enemies struck by the wavefront are additionally knocked airborne for 0.25 seconds.\n\nThe riptide does not interrupt channelled abilities or cause loss of control.\nRiptide's cooldown does not begin until the duration has elapsed.\n\nMagic Damage: 30 / 45 / 60 / 75 / 90 (+ 20% AP)\nMagic Damage per second: 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 (+ 20% AP)\nProjectile Speed: 1400\nRiptide force: 300 / 400 / 525 / 650 / 800\n\n[Note that champions can still move while in the riptide, so the effective pulling force is actually riptide force minus champion movespeed. Projectile width is approximately 2/3 to 3/4 that of Nami's Tidal Wave. The riptide itself should have some sort of visual effect to make clear that it is doing constant damage per second. Riptide force is expressed as an equivalent of champion movespeed, ie a riptide force of 300 will make a stationary champion move at 300 movespeed.]\n\nR - Aqua Burst - Range 1000 - Cost: 100 MANA - Cooldown: 120 / 100 / 80\nActive: Nimue shoots a continuous jet of water with enormous pressure for 3 seconds, pushing back and dealing magic damage to the first champion struck, and pushing back and dealing secondary magic damage to all enemies within a 100-radius area of the primary target. Nimue can move but can not cast while firing Aqua Burst. Nimue may re-target the water jet by pressing R.\n\nMagic Damage per second: 67 / 133 / 200 (+ 30% AP)\nSecondary Magic Damage per second: 42 / 83 / 125 (+ 20% AP)\nAqua Burst force: 500 / 650 / 800\n\n[Note that champions can still move while affected by Aqua Burst, so the effective pushing force is actually Aqua Burst force minus champion movespeed. Aqua Burst is not a channel and thus cannot be interrupted, however if you stun or knockup Nimue she will be unable to re-target the water jet until the crowd control has ended. Width is somewhere between that of Ezreal's Mystic Shot and that of Ezreal's Essence Flux.]","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-02-26T06:27:35.822+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkLorde117,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9r4qEG2E,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-02-26T05:04:43.518+0000)\n>\n> Hmmm. Interesting, but if her main purpose is do disrupt the flow (no pun intended) of the battle I don't think she'd be balanced as a damge dealing mage. Too much in one champ if you get my meaning. You'd either have to cut her damage or give her some huge survivability problems. (maybe she'd feel more even as a melee mage?) In any case, I love the concept and feel like the abilities would bring a fresh perspective to the rift. Just needs a little something to erase the need for lube.\n\nDo remember that all these numbers are just guesstimates, I don't like to work too hard on balancing something when I can't even see how it functions in-game.\n\nIf burstability became a problem I'd likely nerf her health to Sona levels to compensate.\n\nAlso don't forget that riptide can be walked out of sideways or dashed out of since it doesn't prevent mobility spells like maelstrom does.\n\nMaelstrom itself needs massive balancing but nothing that can really be done in a hypothetical manner without real world feedback.\n\nAs for the passive, the main idea is tradeoffs. The primary use case I want is for it to be used on Q so that other abilities can be landed successfully, but if you manage to use it on riptide or maelstrom successfully they become almost inescapable (don't forget you can still use flash in maelstrom just not champion mobility!), or Aqua Burst gets a lot more effective pushing force (assuming the case where they are trying to get to you) and is harder to escape.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T23:21:56.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OJ191,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9r4qEG2E,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-26T06:27:35.822+0000)\n>\n> \n> Also don't forget that riptide can be walked out of sideways or dashed out of since it doesn't prevent mobility spells like maelstrom does.\n>  \n\n\nmaking graves useful again! praise ye","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-02-27T15:36:21.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crusader charlie,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9r4qEG2E,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2015-02-26T23:21:56.045+0000)\n>\n> making graves useful again! praise ye\n\nYeah I wanted to make it counter-mobility too but felt it would be too much lol.\n\nStill havn't decided if I want riptide to reach the max range to activate, when it hits a champion, or on re-cast, and if any of the latter two, whether it should still have max length or just wherever the wavefront reached too.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-26T03:21:42.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in other words none of the abilitys are actually original, they are just stronger then most of the champs that actually have them (Yas Q but longer, Anivia Ult but with CC, Nami Ult but with a back pull, and Vel'koz Ult with the ability to displace)\n\nThis champ basically %%%%s any disengage comp up the ass, while having disengage flowing out her ass.","replies":[{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-02-26T06:09:38.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9r4qEG2E,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-26T03:21:42.554+0000)\n>\n> So in other words none of the abilitys are actually original, they are just stronger then most of the champs that actually have them (Yas Q but longer, Anivia Ult but with CC, Nami Ult but with a back pull, and Vel'koz Ult with the ability to displace)\n> \n> This champ basically %%%%s any disengage comp up the ass, while having disengage flowing out her ass.\n\nIt's not a yas Q at all, I only used Yas Q as a reference for width. It's actually far closer to something like an ezreal Q, except I wanted a more combo-ey mechanic rather than to have it on a super short cooldown like ezreal Q.\n\nAs for %%%%ing over disengage, I'm not seeing it. She's not really any harder to disengage against than any other control mage in the game. Riptide is pretty easily dodgeable when running away and can have the initial wave speed nerfed if it's too fast. Aqua Slicer does nothing against a disengage at all. Maelstrom has relatively short range and can be made shorter if need be. If you get in the edge when she casts it you can literally walk right out, that's if you didn't already walk out because it has a 0.5 second cast delay.\n\nAnd just FYI when you have more than 120 champions almost everything in the game becomes derivative in some way if you look at it too hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T03:24:13.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9r4qEG2E,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-26T03:21:42.554+0000)\n>\n> So in other words none of the abilitys are actually original, they are just stronger then most of the champs that actually have them (Yas Q but longer, Anivia Ult but with CC, Nami Ult but with a back pull, and Vel'koz Ult with the ability to displace)\n> \n> This champ basically %%%%s any disengage comp up the ass, while having disengage flowing out her ass.\n\nim sure people could just burst her to compensate, if he changed the health. for a first draft its pretty good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-26T05:04:43.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm.

Don't forget you can just split up and walk around of it, the aoe is SMALL.\n-Aqua Burst being too easy to just run away from since if you run the opposite direction it is basically adding the pushing force to your movespeed **and ignores movement speed soft caps**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-25T23:05:03.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it, 7/10","replies":[]}]}
