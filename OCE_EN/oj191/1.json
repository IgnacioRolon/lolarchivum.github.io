This isn't bloody soloQ, people aren't going to be mad at you for playing first time lee sin or gragas support. Just try something new instead of nonstop playing kat or fizz in every mode possible.\n\nThird of all, I can tell you are obviously a soloQ player that is stuck in \"elo hell\" due to the thing you have said, and as far as I am concerned, getting 3 wins isn't that hard even if you don't play a lot every day. No need to insult the people that do.\n\nFinally, you have no right to be using uncivil language for no reason and being mad at people that are simply trying to be friendly and help. Riot is trying its hardest to improve the game and help the community, they are a very active company, and if you pull in the tribunal argument again, if people were less like you, and be more broad-minded and be nicer in general, OCE will never even need a tribunal in the first place.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-25T05:48:38.957+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"wah, I'm %%%%.
