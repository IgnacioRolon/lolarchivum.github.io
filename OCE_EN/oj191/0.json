It is absolutely hilarious seeing all these Australians crying over it. \n\nBefore you say* \"but exchange rates and blahblahblah\"*, when you get some money in your own currency, you don't think of it in comparison to the relative amount it would be in another currency, you would be like *\"yessss money, time to go buy some doritos and mountain dew\"*. Also compare the minimum wages -Australian $16-18 and NZ $14.25- it still works out to be pretty equal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-09T09:38:55.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but this is easier cause they can keep their prices the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-09T19:32:55.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, the prices are at such nice numbers.
