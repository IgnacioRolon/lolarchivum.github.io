Couple of years ago same problem occurred with the OCE server and this was the fix. Rito never addressed it but it just got fixed sometime later without any announcements. I imagine that will be the case this time too. Probably in a few months change the DNS back to defaults to see if rito has fixed it.","replies":[{"poster":"Janná","date":"2017-01-10T09:33:35.048+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"worked for me (y) thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"EpicduckEG","date":"2017-01-10T09:22:28.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"legend! it worked for me aswell thanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Yellow","date":"2017-01-10T08:57:40.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, worked for me!","replies":[]},{"poster":"EpicduckEG","date":"2017-01-10T12:57:41.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have jsut finished a match and now the same error or dc comes up is there another way to fix or wait for a hotfix or something?","replies":[{"poster":"Phantom Tears","date":"2017-01-12T23:30:37.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry man, that I legit have no idea.
