You&#039;ve created a wonderful game, and systematically destroyed it over the years with bad nerfing...\r\n\r\nIt started with Karma. She wasn&#039;t blatantly wonderful, but the old Karma could be mastered to be one of the best supports in the game. When she was changed (nerfed), many were interested so they briefly played her. But shortly after, I&#039;m sure they realised the new karma was no where near as good as the old, and practically unplayable. Here Riot, you took a champion that barely anyone played, and made her shitter, even though she was absolutely fine to begin with. \r\n\r\nBut it didn&#039;t stop there. You had many other champions that barely anyone played (with perhaps the exception of gragas) to systematically destroy.\r\n\r\nCase and Point - Xerath. The old Xerath had a move that gave him insane range, added AP, and an ulti that wrecked. Not to mention his passive turned AP into Armour!!\r\nBut you couldn&#039;t help changing him, to try and get more people to play him. Well I tried the new Xerath...and while the nerf wasn&#039;t as bad as some of your others, he was still pretty bad by comparison.\r\n\r\nAnother nerf....Veigar! The cornerstone to Veigar being a good champion was his AOE stun ring. After making a 1 second delay on the ring it made him 100x worse. You couldn&#039;t guarantee hitting his moves on enemy champions, taking away his bursting potential, and essentially making him pretty average. Well done Riot!!\r\n\r\nGragas nerf - he used to hold his own as a mid laner who could sustain himself with mana regen and a damaging barrel. While I didn&#039;t research this one specifically, I&#039;d swear his barrels were reduced in damage, and he definately no longer gained mana from drinking ale. Again, he became unplayable as a mid laner, and only partially viable as support/jungle.\r\n\r\nOh yeah...Ryze&#039;s nerf!!! He never ever gets played anymore. Even though he used to be great, with his lock on Q and amazing burst. Now he is pretty average, and barely playable.\r\n\r\nAnd most recently, Anivia. OH ANIVIA!!! NOOOOOOOO. She has been one of my favourite champions for a long time. Barely anyone knew how to play her, or even played her at all. But she was one of the most underestimated AP champions in the game, with her stun, double damage ice picks, constant AOE Ulti, and second life with her egg!!!\r\nNow you have destroyed her ulti, and I&#039;m pretty sure you have lowered the mana and dmg of her ice picks, making it hard to make the most of her freezing AP damage.\r\nThis was my final straw, and was the motivation to write this.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m sure there are more champions that I&#039;ve missed, but thats all I can think of for now. You have gradually nerfed every single hero that I&#039;ve loved, and lay them to waste.\r\nWhat is truly criminal though is that you don&#039;t make obvious nerfs to champions nooby players like to play!!\r\nLike Yi, ZED, fizz, Kat, Akali, Vayne, Jax. Why on Earth are these champions not being nerfed?!?!?!?\r\n\r\nNow i&#039;m pretty sure no one from Riot will read this, but if you do, at least spare a thought for one of your players who has lost all of his favourite champions because you &#039;felt the need&#039; to change (nerf) them. \r\n\r\nBring back the old Karma, and you will begin your path to redemption. In the meantime, I&#039;m gonna try out Dota 2....","replies":[]}
