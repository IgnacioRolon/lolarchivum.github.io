An ult that instantly saves your behind after Riot&#039;s \"High risk high reward\" campaign. And hits like a truck. When you&#039;re burstier than Annie and LeBlanc, the league&#039;s premier bursters with this level of safety, and offer more crowd control than Nautilus or Nami, the King and Queen of CC, and almost as mobile as Fizz and Kassadin, with a million hops apiece, then you know something&#039;s wrong. \n\nDon&#039;t think he&#039;s OP? Name one champion who is considerably stronger. \n\nMain Problems\n> His AP Scalings are ridiculously high\n> He has a decent range for poke and wave clear\n> He does insane burst damage\n> He has three movement abilities, two of them blinks\n> He has a reset button that lets him regen to almost full health instantly\n> His reset button also does 2k+ damage in a wide AoE\n> He has a ridiculously high 80% AP scaling shield\n> His shield ability also offers an AoE 2.25 second stun at level one; for comparison, this is probably the third longest stun after Veigar E and Ashe ult\n> His shield ability ALSO offers an execute alongside an AoE stun and massive shield.\n> This is at level 1 W. \n> Along with a 2.25 second stun, he has 3 slows and a speed up\n> His low cooldowns on the Q, E and especially his passive let him shred through tanks easily.\n\nMain reasons these are problems: \nEkko has no meaningful weaknesses, in team fights, in lane, in siege, skirmishing, or assassinating targets. \n> All his CC and base damage alone mean that he never falls off if he gets behind, and is extremely useful in skirmishing. \n> Trying to deny him CS in laning won&#039;t work because of his long ranged wave clear. \n> Ganking after 6 is completely useless\n> With all his CC and double dash, it is impossible to run away\n> His passive is a permanent 80% slow AND 80% speed up. \n> He can trade, all in, and reset back to near full HP with his ult...\n> He can use the same ult to do about 2k damage or so\n> You can't chase him because he can ult back for damage or for safety\n> If you don't CC train and burst him completely in this time, he can ult back for near full HP\n\nAnd if you don&#039;t believe his damage is that high, his passive procs every 3 seconds scaling off level to deal about 200 + 70% AP (about normal for a rank 5 ability) once you land 3 hits, considering his Q + E guarantees 2 and a third auto isn&#039;t hard to pull off, this is almost a guaranteed proc. His Q has about 300 base damage, a heavy slow and 80% AP scaling, already above average in terms of both base and scaling. W is an execute which if you have a reasonable amount of AP, say, 650, does a whopping 20% missing health in damage. His ult has a 200/350/500 base with 130% scaling + 20% missing health execute. One poke combo hits for a massive 300 + 80% AP; one all in without the ult damage or shield or stun will already deal 700 + 170% (not accounting for lich bane) and slow for 80%. For comparison, other AP assassins have an all in of about 600 + 200%, without the safety of a \"click here to instantly escape\". Also, if you do use your ult for damage, your combo&#039;s damage shoots up to 1200 + 300% + 20% missing health per auto (2 autos and its already the same strength as Garen ult). \n\nHis W isn&#039;t even one ability, its probably got the strength of 3 in one. His shield has a 330 base strength at lvl 5, one of the highest in the game, with 80% scaling, THE highest in the game. It comes with its own execute, which is a stronger on hit effect than almost every other ability in the game, dealing more damage than Fizz W, when active (note this is a passive execute).  It has an AoE stun, something usually reserved for ultimates. This one lasts longer too. And even if you don&#039;t want to risk going in, it has a slow instead. Why does an ability have a 2.25 second stun and 5% missing health damage at level 1? Yes, its got a 3 second delay; even if you don't land the active component ever and completely whiff, the passive execute is still so strong that he's still OP.\n\nCongratulations. Ekko is an assassin (who is incredibly safe), a mage, a support and a fighter all in one.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-24T10:34:51.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any melee assassin already has a built in weakness.
