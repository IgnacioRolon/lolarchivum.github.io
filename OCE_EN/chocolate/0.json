Until then, I&#039;m going to 100-0 burst someone with one spell cast. \r\n\r\nWhy does no one max E first (or at least put points into it early) on the reworked Ryze? A lot of the time, its the emphasis on the W max... Which is understandable for the increased CC that it brings (and perma snare with his passive). Even before his W gets nerfed later, however, I feel E max is more viable (unless the additional CC is absolutely necessary), partially because when you&#039;re in lane, you don&#039;t have the mana to make the most of your passive (spamming spells will OOM you in about 2 passive rotation spams), meaning your W will get less use overall, and you have increased trading and kill potential with your E. For example, all Ryze has to do in lane is Q the minions to stack up a tear, and immediately cast E once the enemy champion positions themselves poorly (in the minion wave), which bounces 3-6 times (depending on how many minions nearby) and deals 2-4x the normal damage, enough to win any normal trade. In solo scenarios, the E is much more effective at harassing the enemy. In most scenarios, your enemy also won&#039;t trade with you when your passive is up or near up (if they&#039;re playing reasonably), so sneaking in a high damage E nuke is a lot easier. \r\n\r\nThe final kicker is what happens when you use your ult + E. This isn&#039;t even making use of the passive, but at level 6 with a rank 3 E and no significant items, you already deal an ideal 700 or so damage with one ulted E cast that bounces to the minion wave. The AoE on the first cast is the same as the bounce radius, so if it bounces 6 times, you deal 1 base damage + 6 half base damage (since it does full base damage to the secondary target, halved for the AoE) + 6 half base damage (returning orbs) to the PRIMARY target, totalling to a whopping 7x the normal base damage, or 574 + 210% AP + 14% maximum mana, or about 700 damage with starter items only when people only have 1k hp at level 6. Even in non-ideal situations, the E max route, combined with the ult, can chunk people down to about half HP, bouncing to only 4 minions. In teamfights, the MR shred and devastating AoE is a much more valuable contribution than a Q max, and situationally better than a W max. You also cast E as your second most common ability, so maxing it benefits your DPS, and with your ult up, your E does substantially more damage than multiple Q casts. \r\n\r\nTLDR: E + Ult = BOOM. W + Passive = OOM. Maybe W has some secret use of which I&#039;m not aware... but permasnaring isn&#039;t useful until you actually have the mana to do it.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-06-23T11:53:01.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just rolled a 6 sided die and randomly voted on E and there isn't many votes on this, 8 since this message was posted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-22T12:57:12.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E max will be more viable as soon as the nerf hit's live, fact is a perma snare is better then more damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-22T11:49:38.782+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dont stand in minions to dodge e, you stand in minions to dodge q and away from minions to avoid e.
