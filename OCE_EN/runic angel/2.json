I understand that sometimes it is me (because parents are sometimes using the internet) but alot of the time it isn&#039;t. I just wanted to ask is there any way to reduce ping, or stop it or maybe is riot doing something to make the ping heavy? Because I am really suffering for it. And for the past day I have not been off 200 ping for the entire day.\r\nThank you~ {{champion:432}} {{summoner:31}} {{item:3070}} (Sorry first time writing a discussion, wanted to try it out c: )\r\n\r\nStay frosty &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Jiglord","date":"2015-09-21T12:12:17.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recently transferred to OCE after NA became untenable with the server move.
