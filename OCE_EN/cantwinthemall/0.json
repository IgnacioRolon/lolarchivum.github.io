From a brief look Interrupt Moderation tells the CPU to take action every time a package is received from the network, disabling it will instead allow it to backlog until the CPU is ready.\n\nBy my understanding, this *could* help hardware problems (CPU bottlenecks etc.), but it shouldn't help ping, most likely it would make it worse.\n\nHow's your system running now? Does it still work?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DamoMan","date":"2015-08-27T15:09:14.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried this, think it may have stopped some of the lag but im still getting random 300+ spikes for no reason.
