At least one of them I&#039;ve reported 4-5 days ago, but it&#039;s still playing, feeding and clocking up IP. \n\nThere seems to be a new wave every weekend but in ARAM in recent days they ALL have Cleanse and Mark and they all buy Oracle potion at the start. They rarely get kills and always feed.. It&#039;s pretty obvious if you look at match histories..\n\nMost also have names with random letters added\n\nI report the same ones over the weekend expecting them to be gone on Monday at least but nooo, they&#039;re still killing my fun. If anything, there&#039;s more!! And  this last game, the guy on the other side just left, didn&#039;t report so that&#039;s only 2 reports for that game because 7 of 10 players were bots.. so 20% report rate is that even enough for you guys to look into it? Just disappointing and a waste of time when I get into champ select and see the same bot/s I reported days ago, why would I bother.\n\nAnd if I dodge a game because I know there&#039;s a bot or 2 or 3 on the team, I get penalised.. I have to play with the feeding bot or I don&#039;t play at all?\n\nPlease clean up your game Riot, the bots are bad  :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gdox","date":"2017-10-05T08:45:32.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Know the feeling. Also had a game where   it was  2V1 players and rest bots.\n\nThey are getting smarter though, they now random Honor peeps so I suppose you can get something out of the Game. \n\nLook at it as a chance to pick up an S and Chest, Free Loot is always good.\n\nAnd keep Reporting, One day someone from Riot might decide to give a Damn and do something about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-10-04T20:51:46.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot can't work out how to stop the bots that's why it's been going on so long.
