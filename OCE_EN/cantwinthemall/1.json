I didn't afk, it states pretty clearly I dodged.\n\n'Like it or not, you queue up, you play.' Does not state that anywhere in ToS. It's a game not a contract. \n\n'So focused on other players'.. Because you know me so well. ** Did not even mention other players**, only bots. Yes I like other players on my team, not bots, as most people do.\n\n'Do you only have fun playing when everything is perfect?' Because you know me so well. I don't need 'perfect' to have fun, just a full team of human players. Playing with bots on your team is fun for you? \n\n'PVP games may not be for me'  Because I don't want to play a game full of bots? Lmao! \n","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-01-03T04:42:45.235+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you throw a fit and walk away. Great!
