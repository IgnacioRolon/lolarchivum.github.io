Ludens gives you move speed and more damage on Q especially. \nSo ROA is better for lanes you get punished in (very common as an AP melee who needs lvl 6) and Ludens is better for dodging skill shots and popping squishies. \nMorello allows you to spam spells on waves for ranged clear and its passive is good vs sustain champs like Cho, Zac and Tryn if you can keep them under 40% and keep hitting them with Q. Overall other items are better for Diana.\nNashors is more effective once you have AP due to its passive 15% of AP on hit but it is not bad to rush depending situation and Raba is a terrible rush due to its needing high AP to make it gold efficient with its passive. \n\n\"Nashor's Tooth is 139.94% gold efficient.      Total Gold Value = Gold 4198.33 \n Nashor's Tooth's gold efficiency is further increased by 12.5% for every 100 ability power obtained (excluding its own ability power).\"\n\"Rabadon's Deathcap is 92.72% gold efficient by itself.\n  Rabadon's Deathcap efficiency is further increased by 20.03% for every 100 Ability Power obtained from other sources.\n To become gold efficient, it needs at least 36 Ability Power obtained from other sources\"\n\nThe other item I will often rush is Abyssal if the enemy laner and jungler are AP and close range like Fizz Sej or something. \n\nTypical build path for me is dring, catalyst or boots and negatron, finish ROA or Abyss, Sorcs, Ludens or Nashors, Zonya or Abyss depending enemy team unless snowballing then Raba Void. \nZonya is still a good item even if they dont have heaps of AD as you can use it to drop tower agro after diving, avoid Lux or Cait R or Varus Q and you will usually still take damage from minions, monsters and towers. \n\n\nDiana  168.9 CS   3.22:1 KDA  10.3 / 5.2 / 6.3   60%  20 Played\n\nLast season\nDiana  173.1 CS  2.63:1 KDA  10.0 / 6.2 / 6.2  53%  94 Played","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2017-01-09T06:45:02.537+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-30T06:03:05.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its all about what you like.
