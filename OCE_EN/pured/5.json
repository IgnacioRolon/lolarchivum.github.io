It was about being possible and it is. And you can kill people under 3 sec even with dev if you are really fed. The question was if it was possible and it is, and i gave the reasons it was. I never said it happens every game, the closest you would get to every game is a shaco who kills their jg whenever they walk into the jg. Im saying that its possible if a scenario goes right for you, say they do a 4 man invade and you kill all 4, that would leave you enough to get dev after a buff camp, or by selling your pots and waiting 20-15 sec. Then because of your massive gold and xp lead you can counter jg and just kill and kill their jg getting stacks ad more fed and easily getting mobies(with alacrity), and taking all their jg, you have complete dominance over all stacks, easy clearing to 30 within the remaining 8 min..","replies":[{"poster":"Sataníc","date":"2016-03-30T22:43:43.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you're getting the point.
