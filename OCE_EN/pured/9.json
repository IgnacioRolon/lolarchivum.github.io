I have watched a video on these mystery boxes, and they show the character on the box, which surely means Riot can&#039;t mistakenly give you a duplicate.\r\n\r\n1- Can you get duplicates within 1 purchase?\r\n2- If I purchase 3 today, and then another 3 at a later time, do they track which ones I previously got to avoid giving me duplicates?\r\n3- It mentions you can get retired/vaulted figurines. Does that mean all of the retired/vaulted figurines have stock? Or only the ones they didn&#039;t manage to sell?\r\n4- Is there a higher chance of me getting less popular figurines which are not selling well? Or is it close to random?\r\n\r\nAs a Lunar Goddess Diana main since her release, she&#039;s really the only one I want to get from Series 2.\r\nI just wanted to know if getting her is possible, as she is &quot;Special Edition - In the Vault&quot;.\r\nWarring Kingdoms Azir and Thresh are also cute, so I wouldn&#039;t mind getting them.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if I could get someone from Riot who knows about this department to respond, otherwise others who have bought these would be good too.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-11T04:15:20.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet to get these answers is to ticket player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI will answer what I can from my own experience though.\n\n1. I don't believe so, as far as I know you will not get sent two of the same from the same transaction.\n2. Again, I don't believe so, they likely don't track that so you may well get a duplicate this way.\n3. I believe the vaulted figures have halted production entirely, so that would mean you can only get those they have leftover stock of.\n4. As far as I know, yes. When the first URF figure came out it came with a random figure free, and a *lot* of people got Gragas.","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-11T04:37:06.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.","replies":[]}]}]}
