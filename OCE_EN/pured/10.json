I normally like getting a FG or FH.\n\nAlso, is a Unique Passive of 10% different or the same as a Unique Passive of 20%?\n\nThank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-29T00:20:33.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stronger unique passive of the same name generally wins out. \n\nFor example {{item:3078}} {{item:3025}} , here you'd get the icy field from gauntlet, but you can't proc both spellblades, so the AoE would be 100% base ad, but the target you auto will take the triforce spellblade for 200% base ad. Hence why it is inefficient to build both.\n\nSimilarly the bonus damage from kirchies shard items (though in this case the added utility is worth wasting the passives) {{item:3087}} {{item:3094}} both have 'energised' passives, and you won't get the damage from both, but the extra range poke on shiv proc is worth it more often than not.\n\nStraight up same passives or items also don't stack, {{item:3067}} {{item:3067}}. similarly you'll only get the strongest situational burn effect from these:\n {{item:3751}} {{item:3068}} {{item:1413}} , and if multiple team members build {{item:3190}}, only one locket effect can be active on a champion at a time, so you have to coordinate and stagger their use or end up wasting the second locket.\n\nBut items with different names sometimes technically have different passive names, even if it isn't listed {{item:3133}} {{item:3108}} {{item:3067}} {{item:3101}} {{item:3024}}, all just list 'blank' unique passive 10% cdr, but they technically have different names you can't see, and so can be stacked for more cdr.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-02-01T13:47:54.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TDLR: Just reword some of the stuff, it has a general readability to it, but it a bit confusing.\n\ntechnically triforce damage shouldn't happen, as its still applying both, triforce isn't supposed to be used as the frozen gauntlet sheen was used, but there is a little overlap in their spaghetti which causes it to do this, making triforce frozen gauntlet nasai a bother..\n\nAlso energised is now a unique case, as instead of only being able to use one, every instance of energised is used in the one hit. If you look at the \"tips\" it does say they stack (they did remove it a while back, but when they made warlords rune energised they reverted that change as they also nerfed the damage on shiv and rfc procs anyway). Another unique interaction between the shiv and rfc is that (directly taken from a tip) \"If you have both Rapid Firecannon and Statikk Shiv, the Shiv lightning can also hit Towers.\" which further reinforces the ideal that the shiv is an additional proc ontop of the rfc damage. This is why fleet of footwork can work when using shiv and rfc, although they are all \"energized\" (they needa make it energised) all the effects work, allowing you to get off the shiv damage, fleet footwork movespeed and heal, as well as the range and damage from rfc, as well as its special \"15% faster charge time\" on energised attacks, increasing synergy.\n\nAlso the locket doesnt \"cancel\" itself out when stacked, it jsut applies a reduced shield size, which is also reduced for a time hereafter the original locket times out. I feel your argument is invalid and the information incorrect, I mean, come on. really!? \"but the **extra range poke** on **shiv proc** is worth it more often than not\" it can be correct, but its exact same specification as rfc, you need to outline is, is it rfc you mean? or the chain lightning range?\n\nI get the general gist of it, but your information needs tweaking.\n\nAlso the \"it isnt listed\" stuff you said last, its defined as an \"un-named passive, which is stackable on different items with the same effect, but not with the same item\" so 2 caulfields wont stack but a caulfield and a glacial shroud will, because although it is the same effect, its not a specifically named passive such as sheen or immolate. There is nothing about names you cant see.\n\nJust give it a bit of a review and rewording, it just seems to me like you wrote this to be helpful, but didn't proof read it. Granted i don't do that when I'm in a hurry either. But there is something wrong with me. I mean, I know the lores for all the champs off by heart without even reading half of them. Also know most damage scalings, cds and base damages on spells and crap. I store useless irrelevant information, but cant remember for the life of me the useful stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-01T22:30:18.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha thanks for the proof read, I was explaining that spellblade doesn't stack, i.e. triforce+frozen gauntlet is generally a waste, I was pretty sure energised procs would only get the bonus dmg from whichever energised dmg source was the biggest, hence you would get a static shiv proc, but you would still get the extra range from the rfc, and I'm very sorry about the misinformation about locket, I missed that update in the patchnotes, and I have learnt that they do indeed stack albeit at a reduced efficiency.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2018-02-09T10:59:52.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that locket change is hella old. And the shiv and rfc stacking was returned a while back as well, they did originally take it away, but when they tunes them up like 5 or 10 patches ago they returned it to stacking\n\n\n> Though unlike other unique passives, kircheis shard and its legendary counterparts ({{item:3087}} {{item:3094}}) both have 'energised' passives, however, unlike other named and unique passives, these items interact in a special way. Instead of cancelling the effect of one out (such is the case with sheen items) these effects \"charge\" up to a single use, where all instances of \"energises\" are expended, so having both a statikk shiv and a rapid fire cannon will grant both the bonus range and chain lightning from the separate items, but also grant the damage from both of these effects in addition.\n> \n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-27T02:09:11.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That means stacking multiple of the same item will only give the passive once.","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-01-27T03:02:35.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay.
