Ever since then I tried dodging with 7 seconds left , and it always works. I suggest you try that.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-04-28T16:56:34.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because its aids for people to dodge with 5 seconds left. If you're going to dodge do it sooner and stop wasting everyone's time.","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Dragneels","date":"2019-05-04T17:11:41.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the point of dodging at the last second is to wait and see if other people would dodge. That will save you a 5 minute timer and 3 LP (or more if you have dodged before). It's kind of a dick move but you gotta do whatever it takes for LP (especially in low elo).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-05-05T02:16:38.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually the LP doesn't even really matter. It's about mmr, you might temporarily lose lp for the dodge, but you'll gain it back purely by the mmr adjusted lp gains for the fact that you didn't lose that match.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pured","date":"2019-05-02T08:59:30.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried with 10 seconds and it works now.","replies":[]}]}]}
