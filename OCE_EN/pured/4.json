If the system functions like the [original elo system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) did, then yes, both you and Bob would be at exactly the same LP and MMR if you played together all the time.\n\nOnce you get to Rank 1 things get a little uncertain though. It's likely that you'd be listed as 1st and 2nd in alphabetical order. That's what happened to [these 2 guys](https://i.gyazo.com/403eb2ca103fc9aef6ac44d23f9a220c.png) who were equal for 6th and 7th on the NA challenger ladder.\n\nUnfortunately you can only queue solo now in challenger, so we'll never know the truth! :'(","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-05-14T06:17:35.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are both brand new accounts that never played ranked before, most likely yes you \"should\" get the same rating after placements\n\nIf you are the same Elo and LP, the ladder seems to put you in alphabetical order.","replies":[]}]}
