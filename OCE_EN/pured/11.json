Or will Akali and Kaisa be released as well?\r\n\r\nThank yo in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-11T04:41:20.884+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Legacy skins don't go on the early sales, but the K/DA skins aren't legacy. The bundles are limited time, but the skins themselves can be bought at any time, so in 4-6 months they will go on sale.\n2. For the bundles, you have until the end of this event to purchase them (though I am unsure if they end with the After Party content, or with the close of the whole event). The skins you can buy whenever you like.\n3. It seems likely they will exist eventually, but it may not be anytime soon. It may well be not till next time K/DA releases a song for example, and no-one knows how long that will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2018-11-11T05:22:05.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, then I guess I will wait for the sales.
