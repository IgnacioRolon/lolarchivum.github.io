Just do a complete reset back to S6 end of season ranks, 10 fresh placement games for all. Have no MMR loss or drop, except for those plat and above (treat them like G1 75LP as if they decayed LP wise, while they retain their behind the scenes MMR).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-15T05:21:48.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really know the details sorry, I can only speculate like the rest of you.
