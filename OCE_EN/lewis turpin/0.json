Then it comes up with a 10 min leaverbuster... i didnt even get a notification for it, and i didnt quit any queues today, i only quit a custom 1v1 game with my friend. So idk what the hell is going on, dcing and rcing twice doesnt seem that bad... but i think i should have gotten a notification for it, and if it was from that custom 1v1 game i had with my friend that i quit, then there is a bug.
