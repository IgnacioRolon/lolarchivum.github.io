RIOTers please have a quickie read.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi All,\n\nFirst time poster. Not sure how this works or if it carries any weight.\n\nNashors tooth. Not the best item, but great on certain champs. I play alot of diana and I almost always get it as first item.\n\nNashors gives 50% Attack Speed and 80 AP. \n\nTo build into it:\n\n- Fiendish Codex - 900 gold - 30 AP\n- Stinger - 1100 gold - 35% Attack Speed\n\nI&#039;m absolutely fine with stinger, but I&#039;ve been thinking of how inefficient this item is when it comes to the AP side.\n\nThe jump is from 30 AP to 80 AP, isnt that huge? \n\nTo elaborate on my point Ill give 2 examples with very similar Gold costs.\n\nBanshee&#039;s Veil: 70 AP 60MR\nTo build into it:\n- Blasting Wand - 850 gold - 40 AP\n- Fiendish Codex - 900 gold - 30 AP\nWhich is 70 AP, which is what you get with full item.\n\nVery similar is Zhonya&#039;s Hourglass:\n- Fiendish Codex - 900 gold - 30 AP\n- Seekers Armguard - 20 AP (+15 with stacks = 35AP) + Armor\nWhich is around 50 AP without stacks and 65 with stacks, only 20 AP (or 5 AP) from the full item.\n\nTHEN COMES THE NASHOR.\n\n30 AP to 80 AP. Wot?\n\nIt puts you extremely behind when you want to grab more AP but cannot invest in it unless you split your gold which in turn extends the time you need to buy the full item.\n\nJust a AD example would be the ease in buying Ghostblade with the easy access of buying 4 long swords and then building straight into the full item.\n\nI just want to suggest another Amplifying Tome (or Blasting Wand, though I dont think thats the best way to do it) in the build that will make it more gold purchasing efficiency.\n\nThen it&#039;ll look like this.\n\nTo build into it: (Amplifying Tome) - IMO a necessary change.\n\n- Amplifying Tome - 435 gold - 20 AP\n- Fiendish Codex - 900 gold - 30 AP\n- Stinger - 1100 gold - 35% Attack Speed\n\n= 2435 Gold and 50 AP and 35% Attack Speed, before final version +565 Gold.\n\nTo build into it: (Blasting Wand) - Which I don't think is the correct way to do it\n\n- Blasting Wand - 850 gold - 40 AP\n- Fiendish Codex - 900 gold - 30 AP\n- Stinger - 1100 gold - 35% Attack Speed\n\n= 2850 Gold and 70 AP and 35% Attack Speed, before final version +150 Gold.\n\nPlease tell me your thoughts, and if you agree please up thing so a RIOTer can see and maybe comment and get involved!\n\n(BTW, why in the name of ornn does Amplifying Tome cost 435???? so hard to calculate backs. Pls Increase to 450 or make 425 too xD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidCrown","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-01T15:47:25.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly the issue becomes if it's easier to build, other champions may be able to build and abuse it.\n\nIt is meant to be a niche item rather then a major purchase, and because of the inefficiency of the parts, it requires a lul in your build/power spike, while giving you a large power spike on the actual item.\n\nThe issue also becomes a lot of the champs that are good with it (the main one i can think of being Kayle, but i'm sure there are 1 or 2 more) don't really need to have an overwhelmingly good early game item (which this would become in this case of having the parts having a larger amount of the power.)\n\nWhile it makes sense to bring the power of the parts up to the power of the full item, it also works against the item, because it will likely force a nerf on the item in the end, once champions are able to abuse the item earlier in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Buff Diana","date":"2017-11-02T03:31:58.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't really use that argument to say its not worth changing its build path. I believe the only reason it hasnt been done already is because its not really a popular item and its just neglected.\n\nSo many items have excellent build path efficiency, for example Warmogs. Only 2850 Gold but has 3 branches and 6 items to choose from, which is made easier as 3 of the 6 are the same so you can stack.\n\nIsnt that abuse? if we use your same logic.\n\nAs for Kayle, who we hardly see (diana too, hardly seen), yeh it'll help her but I'm sure there are more scary champs out there than a champ who got 20 AP faster during the first 15 minutes of the game.\n\nAnother thing, these days they probably just build Guinsoo's as priority, rather than Nashor's.","replies":[]}]}]}
