Really just trying to play the game how it's meant to be.\r\n\r\nThe issue:\r\nI had a very short connection drop, which left me and my friend staring at the teambuilder screen, full team, waiting to get in.\r\n(we're on the same connection atm)\r\nUnfortunately our game had already started, which the friend of mine realized when he said it was taking to long, and tried to relog.\r\nI managed to get into game before him upon hearing this, but with these kinds of shenanigans, the loss was quick, we surrendered proper.\r\n\r\nWhat got to me though, the warning box that forces you to type \"I Agree\" with some trumped up \"you will be punished for leaving\" claims.\r\n\r\nI'm plain insulted.\r\nTeambuilder likes to pretend it's still working when it's not.\r\nIt's not my fault that you have to leave said teambuilder, triggering leaverbuster on that, just to get into the actual game that's already started, a true false negative.\r\n\r\nSo while I may be complaining a touch here, I really just want you guys to, you know, fix leaverbuster so it doesn't pick on innocent players.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T10:31:08.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You may have connection issues.
