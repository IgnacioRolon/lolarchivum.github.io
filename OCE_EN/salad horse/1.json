Both state that it is solely the players responsibility to ensure their computer meets the software, hardware and **connection** requirements of the game. The fact that you have been hit with LPQ suggests that is certainly not the case.","replies":[{"poster":"salad horse","date":"2015-08-26T22:41:25.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand that but what I'm trying to say is that I have no control over my internet connection and when it does lag out or crash completely it is incredibly frustrating for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-26T23:34:51.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but you do have control over whether you play a game that explicitly states it **requires** a stable connection. If you're DCing often enough to get hit with LPQ then obviously your connection isn't stable enough for an online game. Either that or you choose to continue playing when you know it's not stable.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"xuzhinhen","date":"2015-08-27T03:12:27.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are homeless people to blame for not having a computer and internet to obtain a rank with?","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-27T03:17:05.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xuzhinhen,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=cOTokikO,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-08-27T03:12:27.769+0000)\n>\n> Are homeless people to blame for not having a computer and internet to obtain a rank with?\n\ndepends on why they're homeless.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2015-08-27T00:51:14.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boycott Telstra for providing us with terribad internet speeds and stability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-26T23:49:42.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"unless it's riots fault, you're held responsible.\nso yes, you are to blame.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-26T21:31:27.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm in Wifi 40Mbps and never get lag or DC's.","replies":[{"poster":"salad horse","date":"2015-08-26T22:42:00.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucky","replies":[]}]}]}
