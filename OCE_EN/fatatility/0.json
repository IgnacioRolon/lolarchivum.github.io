If you're being attacked then you should call the police.\n\nYou aren't suggested to play League if you find that your internet connection is cutting out. After recognising this, you should play custom games until you've found a fix for it.\n\nWhat OS are you on, and who's your ISP?\n\nPS: As for your request to be 'unbanned' (which isn't even correct, because your account isn't banned; it's just penalised), it won't go through for it's against policy. A penalty will not be removed under any circumstances.","replies":[]}]}
