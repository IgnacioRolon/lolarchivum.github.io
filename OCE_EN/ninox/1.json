I have some atrociously long posts in my past, especially back in Season 6 where the boards was still a place to discuss non-meta and meta builds, analysis and discussion of champion kits in great detail with math. \nI particuarly remember the times when I calculated exactly how much damage you needed to build on a range of assassins, to just barely be able to 100-0 squishies with quick burst spell rotation at various stages of the game, whilst simultaneously finishing the rest of the build with pure tank items. Btw if the answer to this is 1 damage items or less in early-mid, the assassin has too much base damage (back when rengar had that bonus AD bug, you could get away with just a black cleaver and with the right runes, and assuming the adc only had say a dorans shield, ninja tabi and a cloth armour, you had enough damage to 100-0 them with a spell rotation and have about 3 damage to spare).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-19T02:11:53.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't confess to sharing your apparent love of math, but I can certainly respect the effort and dedication that goes into it :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-18T07:11:17.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey HeartVine, you have a total of ~~4194~~ 4195 posts on the Oceania League of Legends Boards!","replies":[]}]}
