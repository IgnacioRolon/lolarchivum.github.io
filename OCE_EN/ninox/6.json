In rare cases someone decides to break the meta by sending down 2 champions with incredible synergy, in order to pull off amazing plays.\r\nA {{champion:412}}/{{champion:53}}  combo is a good example, due to their long range pulls.\r\nHowever by sacrificing the marksman spot on the team, they will have a much larger problem pushing towers as well as dealing as much damage in team fights.\r\nRecently the juggernaut {{champion:82}} was updated to be suitable for replacing the marksman role in a &quot;not just for fun&quot; capacity.\r\n\r\nHaving 2 champions bot is important, because it gives you a chance to contest for Dragons.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eIOOyX3.jpg\r\n\r\n1.    **Survival:** First and foremost you can&#039;t do anything if you&#039;re dead.\r\n*    **CS:** Even if you haven&#039;t got kills, CS will get you the items you need to be successful.\r\n*    **Winning the lane:** Winning the lane is great, but being able to win teamfights and take objectives is more important (This is where survival comes in)\r\n*    **Supporting:** Protect your ADC, even from themselves, never forget that.\r\n*    **Objectives:** Proper warding can show you incoming ganks as well as provide cover, both to deny and secure objectives like towers and dragons.\r\n*    **Kills:** That&#039;s right objectives are more important than kills, getting kills gives you a tactical advantage, use it WITHOUT endangering yourself.  \r\n\r\nInhibitors &raquo; FREE towers &raquo;Baron &raquo; Dragon &raquo; Towers &raquo; Buffs\r\n\r\nObjectives win games, formulate a strategy where you dictate the fights and trades, rather than responding to your opponents plans. At the very least you should be looking for good opportunities to either disengage, or turn the tides if you are in an unfavourable position. \r\n\r\nRather than chasing low heath enemies too far, you can drop the chase and can go secure objectives, if they want to stop you, let them come to you while they&rsquo;re low on health. No objective is achievable without knowledge of your opponent&rsquo;s whereabouts (warding/pings/map awareness), having just chased them, or scoring an ace.\r\n\r\nWith the season changes to Dragon/Baron they become increasingly important late game, even more so, when it comes to securing early Dragons.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/NQggLVa.jpg\r\n*Attitude, mental state, irritation, joy and sadness are all factors that can win or lose you the game.*\r\n\r\nA) **Interactions**\r\n- Your mood will affect how you play, as well as how you interact.\r\nIf you go into a match while angry, any little thing can set you off, and you will start to rage instead of focusing on the match.\r\n- Asking &#039;why?&#039; is almost always seen as an attack against someone, be it skill, knowledge or decisions, forcing them to focus on defending themselves rather than winning the game, it is a vicious cycle that can start simply with the word &#039;why&#039;. (The same applies to &#039;stop feeding&#039; and other such statements)\r\n- If you want people to listen, be courteous, and try to explain why they should do something, rather than demanding that they do it.\r\n\r\nB) **State of mind**\r\n- Don&#039;t Panic !!!!\r\nSometimes when threatened people forget everything and start running, that will get you killed.\r\n- Stay calm in fights and focus on kiting and keeping yourself alive, you can&#039;t do anything if you&#039;re dead.\r\n- Be nice to your support, he/she is there to contribute to the team, not to babysit you.\r\n- As a support, remind your ADC, to applaud you, for saving them, a simple &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; can go a long way, they shouldn&#039;t just take you for granted. (This is the mental aspect, keep them in check and keep it friendly)\r\n- As an ADC, remember that confidence is good, but without knowing your limits you&#039;re nothing more than another dead would be hero.\r\n\r\nC) **Agitation and physical state.**\r\n- Don&#039;t play if you aren&#039;t feeling at your best, I cannot stress this enough.\r\nIf you need to pee, you&#039;re hungry, your dog just died, don&#039;t play, take some time off and find yourself. If you do decide to play, at least listen to some music, eat something, that will help you to relax or focus.\r\n\r\nD) **Playful banter**\r\nWe all have our bad days, and it won&#039;t take much to set you off when you&#039;re feeling bad about something, so try to have fun in games rather than channeling your anger onto your teammates.\r\n\r\n&gt;Originally Posted by **Anonymous Rioter**\r\n\r\n&gt;Playful banter and competitive taunting is just fine. To be even more specific, that depends entirely on the player it was directed to. Taunting the enemy can inject some levity into a normally high-pressured and hyper-competitive environment, which is something that is always appreciated by people who are perceptive enough to pick up on the intent.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;So long as you avoid slipping in to verbally focus-firing on a single player (demoralizing him with nonconstructive comments, for example) and you make your intent clear that it&#039;s all done in friendly fun, then that shouldn&#039;t bring you any trouble. The only people I can imagine who might take offense would be those who take everything way too seriously, and let&#039;s face it--everything sets those people off. Just don&#039;t give it any mind. We play games to gain enjoyment and a momentary release from life, after all.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Just make sure you&#039;re not slipping from friendly taunting to actively shooting (verbally) a specific person for their lack of skill or what have you. Mature people will usually get the intent, but then there are several exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gQ8TQ5e.jpg\r\n*The difference between hammering your keyboard, and clicking the right keys at the right moment.*\r\n\r\nChampion mechanics are very different depending on the type of champion you play. \r\nCertain champs have steroids {{champion:119}}, {{champion:21}}, {{champion:29}}, {{champion:18}} ) others act more like ad casters ({{champion:236}}, {{champion:42}}, {{champion:81}}, {{champion:104}}), the details aren&#039;t important, understanding how they&#039;re played, their combos, and their limits are. Once you do that, you can effectively trade blows.\r\n\r\n ○ **Smart cast**\r\nUsing this option saves you from 1 click on the mouse button, so rather than having to click Q and then the mouse once you&#039;ve aimed, you can save yourself a split second, which can be crucial when aiming skill shots.\r\nPlease notice it can screw up certain champion abilities that requires channeling, such as {{champion:110}}  and {{champion:254}} Q, so turning off smart cast for those abilities is recommended if you&#039;re having trouble.\r\nYour other option is to turn on the &quot;Quick cast with Indicator&quot; option. With this option on you will see the indicator when you hold the key down and the skill will be cast when you release the key rather than when you press the key (Smart cast without indicators).\r\n\r\n○ **Attack move**\r\nUsually set to the A-key, it can be a life saver, as it will move you towards the location, but stop to attack the closest target in range, this can be used to prevent people from kiting you, in and out of bushes (among other things).\r\nIf you go to key binding you can find the &quot;**Player Attack Move Click**&quot; which is the smart cast version of attack move.\r\n\r\n○ **Stop**\r\nDefault bound to &quot;s&quot; the Stop command is used to stop and prevent you from taking any action.\r\nGood to help you dodge and control minute movements in fights or the laning phase, also very useful when hiding in bushes, so you do not accidentally reveal yourself.\r\n\r\n○ **Kiting**\r\nKiting is a hit &#039;n run technique used as a means to do damage while avoiding retribution.\r\nMost commonly used techniques include:\r\n- Using high range attacks and mobility to move in range to harass, and out of range to avoid retribution, {{champion:51}} is well designed for this behaviour.\r\n- Attacking and going into a bush to break line of sight.\r\n- Using slows, snares and roots to prevent enemy champions from walking up to you.\r\n- Walking in and out of their range, while timing it, so your opponent is busy doing something else (usually last hitting).\r\n- Certain champions have movement displacing abilities, such as {{champion:67}} tumble or {{champion:81}} jump, even flash.\r\n- Using minions as roadblocks in order to buy yourself time and room to maneuver.\r\n- Backwards kiting, moving backwards and away from your opponents while using abilities/spells/attacks while your opponent(s) chase you, very useful in large team fights, as it can prevent some of their champions from even reaching the fight as it is continuously moving away and staying out of their range.\r\n- To have someone peel for you (see below). \r\n\r\n○ **Peeling**\r\nThe act of &#039;peeling&#039; away the threats for another champion.\r\n- Any form of CC should help achieve this goal.\r\n- Heals and shields are useful at lessening the pressure on the ADC. There are items that can help here as well ({{item:3222}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3190}}).\r\n- **Buddy blocking**, the act of intercepting skill shots on behalf of the champion, exactly like taking a {{champion:51}} ult, or walking in front of your ADC who is about to be hit by a {{champion:76}} spear.\r\n- Knockbacks and pulls are very useful if used correctly, you do not want to place a {{champion:105}} right next to your ADC, but rather to keep him at a reasonable distance.\r\n- There are some useful champion items, like {{item:3222}}, {{item:3069}} and {{item:3092}}, but it is more important how you use those items, than using them because you panic. \r\n\r\n○ **Other Tips**\r\n- If you time certain abilities you can get off more skills/attacks at the same time. {{champion:89}} can kill a regular ward when placed, simply by timing her Q in between basic attacks.\r\n- {{champion:53}} can save his ult just long enough to get off a lightning Arc (the passive from the ulti), before activating it to deal some extra damage.\r\n- Champions like {{champion:267}}, {{champion:412}} and {{champion:89}} can chain their CC together (waiting for one to almost finish then applying the next) to keep enemies locked down for longer. You can of course, also chain your CC with CC on other champions like a {{champion:222}} E.\r\n\r\n○ **[Auto-Attack cancelling](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2k6glo/are_you_an_adc_or_support_main_between_bronze_and/climanl)**\r\n&gt; *    The Tiamat/Hydra thing your friend refers to is called animation- or auto-attack canceling. Which in itself is pretty simple. It&#039;s performing a secondary animation within your current animation. The most popular one (and one of the hardest) is overlapping your auto-attack animation with Riven&#039;s Q swing, which requires a lot of micromanagement in very short time span (0.5 sec or so). You can also do that with said Tiamat/Hydra by using it&#039;s active, or Riven&#039;s E dash (or dash in general) OR Flash.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; *    Easier animation-cancels are Graves&#039; Q/R and using E in any direction you want and Corki&#039;s Q/R and using W right after.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; *   How does it work? Vast majority of abilities in LoL have a very short cast time accompanied with a longer or equal animation, if you use an ability/active/summoner spell with an instant animation (Tiamat/Flash) right after casting one with a cast time and/or animation, it&#039;ll overlap it and it&#039;ll cast within the animation of your first ability, saving you about 0.5 seconds you would be locked in place to cast something. It also works on long channel abilities at the start of their animation, such as Ezreal&#039;s and Fiddlesticks&#039; ultimates, to reposition the starting location of your ultimate, whilst still channeling it to the final location. If done well You can avoid interruption.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;TL;DR you do more in the same amount of time\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bKlxpBY.jpg\r\n*Bottom lane is not just about playing ADC let&#039;s not forget there is also a support, which means that you have to rely on each other, it is a 2v2 lane not Rambo + 1 vs 2.*\r\n\r\n**Trust** each other, if one of you decides to go in and pull off a play, it is usually better to follow rather than hanging him/her out to dry.\r\nIf you follow, there is a chance of doing something, if not, one of you is more likely to die within the next 20 sec.\r\nIn short, if your partner is in trouble, you have to decide, can you save him/her? Yes or no, there is no time for half assed decisions.\r\nWhen they make something happen follow up on it, but remember not to go all in right off the bat, make something happen, win the encounter and then back off, don&#039;t be suicidal or reckless.\r\nAn ADC is only ever as good as the support allows him/her to be during the laning phase.\r\nContrary to popular belief, supports do 60-80% of the work, during this phase. \r\n\r\nIf your support pulls off an epic engage/disengage or generally saves your butt or gets you a kill, be sure to demonstrate your appreciation. Let them know they did something good and they&#039;ll keep doing it.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JP4X8e3.jpg\r\n*There are a couple of ways to win your lane that isn&#039;t focused solely on killing your opponent.*\r\n\r\n1. **CS**: To out farm your opponent by a significant amount.\r\nBeing better at Last Hitting is one way, it can also be done by zoning your opponent away from the farm, and freezing the lane far away from their tower, or having your support zone them out.\r\n\r\n2. **Sustain/attrition**: Be mindful of your health AND your mana at all times, as well as their health, not to mention your supports health and mana.\r\nIf you or your support runs out of mana, going in unless you have your jungler incoming ready for a gank, is ill advised.\r\n\r\n3. **Poke/burst**: Don&#039;t go all in, trade some blows with them, and be sure to come up on top, you should know that burst counters sustain.\r\nThe best time to trade is when their support is out of position and won&#039;t be able to back up their ADC, while your support is there to help you trade. 2v1 always has a better chance than 2v2.\r\n\r\n4. **Ganks**: When you have a gank incoming, it is your job as a laner to present the most advantageous situation, if they come from the lane, make sure they have an easy time sneaking into the bush, or try to draw your opponent out (bait usually work).\r\n**DO NOT** to scare them off before your jungler is in position.\r\nIt is the junglers job to get as close to them before your opponents realize it, and preferably be well positioned when they do, in order to secure kills.\r\n\r\n5. **XP**: Although it is rare to see, you can actually win by CS and XP alone, by forcing them out of lane, and freezing the wave far far away from their tower, giving you easy farm/xp, while they get nothing.\r\nThis is a crucial thing to do in a 2v1 lane, because your opponent can reach a breakpoint much much faster than you.\r\n\r\n6. **Breakpoints and items**: Reaching a breakpoint faster than your opponents, usually level 2, 6 should be your que to go in for a crucial early trade/kill.\r\nIf your opponents overstay in lane while low on health/mana and having vastly inferior items is also a dead giveaway, that they&#039;ve made a critical mistake, giving you a chance to either kill them, or force them out of lane. \r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C1tgVmZ.jpg\r\n*Here are some methods that focus on the lane and how to play in it.*\r\n\r\nYou can categorize bot lane into **3 main types**, Burst, Poke and Sustain.\r\nEach of them are played with a different tactic, and risk.  \r\n\r\n- **Burst lane** (Very risky)\r\nGreat at all ins, usually determined by the support, {{champion:53}}, {{champion:89}}, {{champion:412}}.\r\nThey have a huge kill potential at level 2, so always rush for level if possible.\r\nCertain champions have huge power spikes at level 6, and with that, they can turn from a poke to burst lane ({{champion:1}}), essentially bursting down opponents before they can react.\r\n\r\n- **Poke lane** (Medium risk, but is a skill match up.)\r\nGreat for harassing, like throwing {{champion:76}} spears all day long, this is not about nuking or bursting, auto attacks work just fine, as long as you do it consistently.\r\nHarass at every chance you get, when they are low, you either go in for the kill, or scare them off for some free farm/xp, in either case whether they recall or stay it is your win, as long as you don&#039;t do something stupid, like being baited and dying.\r\n\r\n- **Sustain lane** (Safest, but often the most boring)\r\nFocused around managing mana and maintaining health, usual champions are {{champion:16}}, {{champion:37}}  and {{champion:44}}, however champions without heals but {{item:3302}} and {{summoner:7}} is also a viable choice if played correctly.\r\nGreat for trading when being poked since you can sustain out of the things they throw at you, winning by attrition.\r\nCan turn into an endless farm fest. \r\n\r\n**Quick lane type counters**  \r\n\r\n *  Burst lane - Poke down their ADC to such an extent, that it is too dangerous for their support initiate a play. Push for level 2, and keep on pushing to get the level advantage and the minion wave advantage to help, should they decide to engage on you.\r\n *  Poke lane - this is mostly a skill match up try to avoid early poke. When/if they wish to trade, don&#039;t be afraid to either go in, or back off completely, do NOT let them poke you for free.\r\n *  Sustain lane - Burst counters sustain, the longer you spend trying to force them low, the more difficult it becomes since you cannot hope to out last them. For champions like {{champion:16}}, it is usually better to try and poke her down instead of the ADC, to mitigate her sustain and force the ADC into 2v1s when you can.\r\n\r\n*  With a LOT of poke it is possible to force their support to run out of mana, but it usually takes too long to be an effective tactic.\r\n*  Utility - Depending on what you&#039;re up against you can counter most of it through positioning alone. Such as skillshots, ({{champion:53}} or {{champion:412}} grab) positioning abilities, and AoE spells with some form of utility incorporated, {{champion:143}}, {{champion:267}}, {{champion:40}} ulti. More of this in the Positioning paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n►**Peeling**◄\r\nThis is not a lane type per say, but to choose champions who are tailored to protect their partner, through some forms of cc.\r\n{{champion:40}}, {{champion:267}}, {{champion:25}}, {{champion:201}}  and {{champion:117}} being some of the most obvious choices however depending on how you play, other less obvious champions can also be used, such as {{champion:115}}, {{champion:412}}, {{champion:26}}, {{champion:10}}, and {{champion:12}}.\r\nMake sure to use the tools available to you at the right time and place, in order to pull off some incredible plays.\r\nHowever, if you panic and use the spells too early, they may be on cd when you truly need them.\r\n**Know what you have:** Heal, slow, root, knockback, knockup, extra health ({{champion:117}} ult), shields ({{champion:25}} and {{champion:201}} ), as/ms boost, AoE zoning and so forth.\r\n\r\n►**Kill Lane**◄\r\nChampions whose abilities compliment or prolong one another (CC chains for example), to the point where they can kill someone if they make only one mistake, make great lane bullies.\r\n{{champion:92}}/{{champion:58}} is a double stun combo if they manage to get close to you.\r\n{{champion:99}}/{{champion:25}} is a double snare/AoE combo.\r\nWith a bit of teamwork you can let the APC go bot if the support has the tools to setup their opponents for an easy combo first, and let the ADC go mid.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UkLAcal.jpg\r\n\r\n*Pushing your lane compared to playing defensive.*\r\n\r\nAt level 1, 3 caster minions deals the same damage as an ADC.\r\nIf you can get your minions to help, you should have the advantage, and the bigger the wave the better your chances will be, this is called &#039;utilizing the wave&#039;.\r\nIf you can build up a large enough minion wave, you can dictate the engages in lane through the use of &#039;wave momentum&#039;.\r\n\r\n○ **Pushing pros**:\r\n - You can deny your opponent farm if you manage to push to their tower.\r\n - Good meat shield against skill shots.\r\n - Better trading potential.\r\n - You remove their meat shield, granting you an easy chance to poke/harass.\r\n - If you are able to create a large enough wave, you can dictate the engages due to &#039;wave momentum&#039;.\r\n\r\n○ **Pushing cons**:\r\n  - It requires good warding.\r\n  - Risky to be so far away from your tower, which leaves you prone to ganks.\r\n  - Getting ganks from your own jungler isn&#039;t likely.\r\n  - You have to push all the way to their tower, if you do not, they get free farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n○ **Defensive pros**:\r\n  - It is very safe, you can essentially hug the tower, and hold them off tower diving.\r\n  - Their jungler will have a low risk of succeeding unless they&#039;re exceedingly tanky, and you are low on health.\r\n  - Farm fest\r\n  - Good chance of surviving or escaping ganks.\r\n  - If you can manage to freeze the wave just outside of your towers range you will have free farm.\r\n\r\n○ **Defensive cons:**\r\n - Bad against poking comps, since you have little room to dodge, and not a lot of minions to hide behind.\r\n - If they decide to tower dive, not much will deter them. (Good bait if you have &#039;Heal&#039; ready)\r\n - If you recall the tower will take a beating\r\n - The tower will take some cs if you aren&#039;t careful.\r\n - If their minion wave grows too big you will be in big trouble.\r\n\r\nA) **Ward Placement**\r\n\r\n* **Bottom Lane**:\r\n\r\nTo prevent ganks you would want to ward the entrances to the lane, meaning the lane bush(es), river bush/Dragon and the tri bush.\r\nAs a rule of thumb, if their jungler is able to jump walls, you ward the river bush instead of the Dragon.\r\nWith only a few wards it is possible to keep the lane secure throughout the laning phase.\r\nHowever depending on your opponents play style, you may want a few extra wards to prevent them from walking into the bushes and zoning or harassing you uncontested.\r\n\r\n* **[Overall Warding](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/heating-how-pros-warded-worlds)**:\r\n\r\nWhat you want, is to create a perimeter. Knowing how many enemies you&#039;ll have to face or their general location means you can make informed decision which often end up winning games.\r\nIf you want Dragon/Herald/Baron you need to know where their jungler is as he is the biggest problem if they wish to contest it, as he can contest it by himself. One or two members of their team hardly pose a threat unless you&#039;re low, so knowing who could possibly contest it can be the difference between success and failure.\r\n\r\n\r\nB) **Minion and Tower Aggro**\r\n\r\nWhen being pushed close to your tower, you need to understand how towers work to have a better chance at increasing your cs while under the tower, as well as how minion aggro works, if you wish to harass while being pushed by a huge minion wave.\r\n\r\nTowers will attack the first target in range, and then prioritize\r\n- *CHAMPIONS WHO HARASS YOU*\r\n- Pets\r\n- Seige minions\r\n- Caster/Melee Minions\r\n- Whatever is left\r\n\r\n**Towers**\r\nWhen sieging towers, you will draw aggro whenever you attack an enemy champion who is inside of the towers range, so if they move too far away from their tower, you can actually attack them without drawing aggro. Once you&#039;ve drawn aggro it can only be lost by leaving the towers range, or becoming untargetable ({{item:3157}}, {{champion:432}} Ult, {{champion:105}} E etc).\r\n\r\n**Minions**\r\nThis same trick applies to enemy minions, as long as they have something else to prioritize first, they will ignore you even though you walk right past them.\r\nSo if you manage to bully your enemies far enough away from their minions before using basic attacks, you will not draw unnecessary minion aggro.\r\n\r\nHowever do notice that you will only draw aggro from minions when you basic attack a nearby enemy champion, compared to towers where any form of damage matters.\r\n\r\nC) **Freezing the lane**\r\nTo manipulate the minions to fight in the same place, again and again, and again.\r\nThe easiest way to do it, is simply to ensure that their wave is at least 3 caster minions (roughly) bigger than yours at all times. When there are no more friendly minions you step in and act as a punching bag, until your minions show up again.\r\n\r\nD) **The slow push**\r\nDuring mid/late game where towers are scarcer and far between, you can build up huge minions waves as they have more room to be built up slowly.\r\nTo do that, you need to wait for the wave to be close to your base, then you kill off all the caster minions, if it is a cannon wave, you need to leave the cannon minion (killing the casters),, and then leave, that way the wave will build it self up slowly but surely, so that they will have to send someone to deal with it, forcing a situation where they will have to fight you 4v5 or risk losing a tower to the huge wave.\r\n\r\nE) **From reset to frozen**\r\nWithout being interrupted, it is possible to force an equal lane to become frozen.\r\nTo do this, you need to tank their minions for about half a second before the waves collide, so that their minions will have a chance to group more tightly and will focus 1 minion, rather than spread out their attacks, like they normally do.\r\nYou still need to last hit, but you should wait until the very last moment before you do, that way you won&#039;t be affecting the wave enough, to not fall in your favour.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/IfAoSQ5.jpg\r\n\r\n*When to recall, gank mid, or leave someone to defend the tower.*\r\nBy vigorously pushing the lane, you can &#039;buy&#039; yourself time enough to leave the lane, and pursue other goals.\r\n\r\n**Recalling**\r\nAs long as there is something to do in lane without taking a risk, you should stay, this includes killing their tower, securing cs, or even setting up a kill.\r\n\r\n**Things to look out for**:\r\n- Items arms race (breakpoints) if your opponent has {{item:1038}} and you only have a {{item:1055}} because you &#039;forgot&#039; to recall.\r\n- Mana, neither you nor your partner is very useful without mana.\r\n- Health, same thing unless you want to try and bait your opponents into towerdiving, even if your jungler is incoming, it is best to let him hold the tower while you recall.\r\n- Incoming ganks. Can you survive with the towers help yes or no? A conscious decision to abandon the tower or not, in favour of surviving.\r\n\r\n**Rotating mid to gank**\r\nFirst of all you can&#039;t gank without having reliable CC, because of this, very few ad carries are able to gank mid on their own, even some supports ({{champion:16}}) are not suitable and should not be attempt it.\r\nYou can rotate mid to gank, only when your lane partner is relatively safe, the lane is pushed, and you have sufficient health/mana to not be a burden.\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious occasions to do this, is when you destroy their tower, let the ADC push 1 more wave if need be, thereby securing the lane from being overwhelmed, and giving you enough time to rotate mid for a nice unexpected gank.\r\n\r\nFew supports can hold a lane on their own for long, as this requires certain pushing potential, and cc, while a few number of ad carries without built in escapes are also at high risk when being left alone, the more cc or burst your opponents have, the more dangerous it is for your partner to be alone in lane, so no time for idling around if you wish to rotate mid to gank.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/03IFsHp.jpg\r\n\r\n○ **Breakpoints**\r\nGold is only worth as much as your build.\r\nFull items work far better at scaling off each other, than half finished items (with a few exceptions like Zeal).\r\n\r\nA break point is when a champion reaches a certain level or build an items which scales incredibly well with his kit, or off other items, such as {{item:3031}} + {{item:3086}}, or {{item:3072}} + {{item:3142}}, reaching these breakpoints is a huge step in a champions potential and is a great advantage, an advantage you should seize, but never overextend or greed will get the better of you.\r\n\r\n○ **Items ADC**\r\nNever use a generic build, always consider the team composition you&#039;re up against, for instance {{item:3009}} is very viable when up against a {{champion:75}} and {{champion:20}}, against a heavy ad comp you get more out of buying {{item:3143}}  than you do GA ({{item:3026}}), or with a heavy ap comp a {{item:3065}} can keep you alive as long as you keep kiting and attacking.\r\nIf you&#039;re uncertain of what to do/buy, I recommend always getting AD as a 1st big item, VERY few marksmens&#039; abilities are tied  to attack speed, {{champion:67}} is one of them, making BotRK ({{item:3153}}) more appealing on her, because of the attack speed, compared to the higher raw attack damage {{item:3072}}. \r\n\r\nIn the new season buying a Zeal item first is now viable if you are behind in gold and can&#039;t afford a BF sword, however you have to understand that trading will be much harder and will rely a lot more on your positioning and opportunity taking than if you were to simply play it safe until you could afford BF.\r\n\r\n○ **Items support**\r\nWhen the round begins you have 3 options for gold items, these 3 items define your lane type for the next 20 minutes, and once upgraded can make or break teamfights.\r\n\r\n- {{item:3301}}: A lot more specialised than it once was, as Spellthief&#039;s is almost always favoured now for it&#039;s upgrade, however there are certain cases where this item and it&#039;s upgrades synergise well. In lane it is the safest item to buy for gold generation, but it will also generate the least gold. It has some decent stats on it with good sustain for laning phase. If you want a safe sustain lane then upgrading into {{item:2302}} may be preferable, however there are certain champions on which the active upgrade can be very useful. Good examples for when to pick {{item:3069}} are for champions like Janna or for Thresh if you also plan to build something like {{item:3800}}.\r\n\r\n- {{item:3302}}: Basically THE tank support item. If you are playing a champion like {{champion:201}} or {{champion:89}} you will want this item. Upgrading into {{item:2303}} is never really worth it, as the active on {{item:3401}} + the extra health on {{item:2045}} will pretty much always benefit you more. The only real exception would be if there is some other item you desperately need but don&#039;t have the slot for.\r\n\r\n- {{item:3303}}: Excellent in poke/aggressive lanes and since the update combining the Twin Shadows active into FQC, almost always the best option for mage supports (and some others). Unless you are going into a kill lane, then upgrading into {{item:2301}} is usually ill advised. The active on {{item:3092}} is incredibly potent (why you see mid laners with it) and is pretty much always worth it. If you want to build full AP with no other actives then {{item:2301}} may be of more use to you, but as a general rule, FQC every time.\r\n\r\nThink long and hard before you decide for a build path, and what you hope to achieve, utility (consider the cooldown), shields, item buffs, back lane mage (burst), auras, extra item slots and so on, whatever you choose, it has to compliment the team somehow.\r\n\r\n    **Unorthodox example**:\r\nThis is to show you how a skillset can compliment a build for a specific role, in this case, someone mobile enough to be a nuisance or lock down opponents, while being tanky enough to survive it, and having the items needed to protect the adc at all times.\r\nIn short: A beefy, utility based protector.\r\nJarvan IV, with the summoner spell Heal/Exhaust and Flash (no surprise there)\r\n\r\n- {{item:3401}}: (Item mostly used in burst lanes, horrible if you wish to play poke lane)\r\n- {{item:3222}}: (We now have 2 focused heals + 1 if you count FotM as well)\r\n- {{item:2049}}: (No need for explanation)\r\n- {{item:3190}}: (Yet another item designed for shielding)\r\n- {{item:3143}}  (AoE slow can make a huge difference if timed correctly)\r\n- {{item:1001}}  (Can be substituted, I would recommend {{item:3071}} for the armor debuff it grants, depending on the teamcomp.)\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LxC7NXj.jpg\r\n*Positioning is roughly translated into decision making based off game knowledge, threat assessment, optimal approach or escape.*\r\n\r\n* **Zones of Control**\r\nThe area of which it is dangerous for you to be in, against skillshot based champions, it is usually anywhere that is within their range, without anything blocking, such as minions.\r\n{{champion:53}} is a perfect example, if he is hovering around the sides, he is waiting for you to be out of position and within his grab range.\r\nBecause of this, he can walk up and scare you out of the lane, that is called zoning.\r\n\r\n* **Danger zone**\r\n  * In terms of Melee champions, the closer you come to them, the more dangerous they become, Riven is a great example of this, the further away from her you are, the less skills she has at her disposal.\r\n  * Mages or adc on the other hand, are pretty comfortable at attack range, but it can be hard for them to aim if you are too close and ready to dodge.\r\n\r\n* **Bushes**\r\nThink of bushes and vision as tools to help kite or sneak up on your opponents with, and remember to place wards in the bushes if your opponent likes to hide in them.\r\nThat goes for their team as well, you will feel so stupid if you walk past a bush, and they emerge to kill you once you&#039;re too far away from your tower.\r\n\r\n* **Walls**\r\nTry to avoid standing too close to the walls when in lane, because there is one less way to dodge skillshots, short of flashing and present an extra danger when playing against champions like {{champion:67}} or {{champion:432}}.\r\n\r\n* **Skillshots**\r\nThe art of aiming abilities, most skillshots go in a straight line from the user, however some are circular, or other shapes like {{champion:131}} Q.\r\nSome skillshots like {{champion:222}} Chompers are about preemptively securing your, or preventing their escape, and by placing them close to a wall, you increase the effectiveness of that ability.\r\nThe more you move around the harder it will be for them to hit you, keep moving, only stop to attack.\r\nThey are often also negated by minions, so use them as a &#039;living&#039; shield.\r\n\r\n* **Targeted skills**\r\nThese are a pain to deal with, luckily the damage you receive from them is usually lesser than that of a skillshot, and there is a slight delay giving you a chance to react, in case of {{champion:44}} stun, if you have a jump, use it! ({{champion:18}})\r\nThat way you will not be in a position for them to follow up on it.\r\n\r\n* **Timing and cooldowns**\r\nTiming can be the difference between a successful trade, or a disastrous one.\r\nChampions with abilities that are needed to engage, like {{champion:53}}/{{champion:412}} hook or {{champion:89}} Zenith Blade are extremely vulnerable for a short period of time while that ability is on cd, be sure to punish them for it.\r\n\r\n* **Impact of warding**\r\nCertain champions are now able to solo the Dragon extremely early, which means keeping vision on it is very important. Wards also help to prevent enemy ganks, and aid in allied ones. If you have a rough approximation of where the enemy jungler is at any given time, you will be much less likely to be caught in a gank.\r\n\r\n* **Ganking**\r\nThe best time to gank is always when your opponent is overextended or have just used their escape ability for something, and it is therefore on cd. Calling when flashes are down to your jungler is very important.\r\nWalk up behind them, and when they try to escape, you should lead them, rather than follow (stay between them and their tower so long as you can survive it), that way you can get in more attacks, abilities, and you may even scare them into running away from their tower.\r\n\r\n* **Pushing**\r\nThe closer you come to their base, the faster their champions can close in on you, making it crucial to have proper warding, map awareness and either have backup ready (for a trap) or be ready to flee before placing yourself in danger.\r\n\r\n* **Stand Your Ground**\r\nWhen you know there isn&#039;t a single chance of escape, and you will die if you try to run, your best option is to fight to survive (or die for something), most champions have initiation abilities or spells they prefer to start with, if you can dodge those, you have a chance to turn it around.\r\nMove unexpectedly, dodge, kite, kill.\r\nIf you&#039;re being surrounded, rush in to force a fight while they&#039;re still too far away to help, so you only have to fight them individually instead of as a group.\r\n\r\n* **Chess/tactics**\r\nHave you ever watched the LCS? Those games are not just about who the best players are, it is just as much about tactics, trading dragons for towers, ulting minions to save a tower, or buy time, put pressure on a part of the map while your team is off securing objectives.\r\nEven sacrificing a player on your team to occupy your opponents long enough for the rest of your team to be useful elsewhere.\r\nTheir jungler can&#039;t secure Dragon if he is busy in top lane or dead, which is why having vision of your enemy jungler will allow you to counter gank, negate ganks, steal his farm, or even invade at just the right moment.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PdpmtLa.jpg\r\n\r\n*Playstyles determine every interaction you have with an opposing champion, and is therefore a subject well outside of bottom lane.*\r\n\r\nThere are 3 main playstyles, aggressive, passive and bait.\r\nWith any bit of observation, you can tell if your opponents suddenly changes to an aggressive playstyle, it usually means, that they have a gank incoming or they reached a breakpoint faster than you (level 6).\r\nWith this knowledge, and if your opponents understand it, you can bluff, bait or even escape ganks before they can react.\r\nProfessional players are able to change play style several times in a single fight making it exponentially harder to fight them.\r\n\r\n* **Aggressive**\r\nWhen you actively seek confrontations, to a larger or lesser degree, just show them who the boss is.\r\nBut be aware of focusing too much and getting tunnel vision which is very bad for you.\r\n\r\n* **Passive**\r\nTrying to avoid confrontations as best as possible, even letting you get zoned if it means you&#039;ll stay safe.\r\n\r\n* **Bait**\r\nThe art of making your opponent do stupid things (greed is strong), like chasing {{champion:53}} close to their tower, forgetting to hide behind minions and giving him an easy grab.\r\nHaving shields or heals is a great way to appear weaker than you actually are.\r\nObviously playing bait isn&#039;t always without risk, so be confident in your ability, and know what you&#039;re doing.\r\n\r\n****\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ysuDkIe.jpg\r\n\r\nA) **Runes**\r\nMarks/Red is focused mainly on offensive capabilities, Seals/Yellow is about health/defensive capability, while glyphs/blue is utility/magic and Quints/purple are all around.\r\nI am by no means an expert in this area, but I try to follow some simply guidelines, and work my way out, if I require something more specialized.\r\n\r\n○ **ADC**:\r\nThere is no generic page I can give you, sorry:\r\n\r\n* Red\r\nThe reason most pros take 8 ad red, and 1 crit red, is because that extra crit can make a world of a difference, while that one extra ad won&#039;t matter much at all.\r\n* Yellow\r\nOn adc mains you often see a combination of armor and health.\r\n* Blue\r\nI highly recommend mr or mr/lvl, however with the current meta, a lot of people choose either AD or AS as a means to win early game, and hope their team can protect them late game.\r\n* Purple\r\nHaving 1, 2 or even 3 LS (life steal) runes were a must have in order to trade, and not lose the lane due to attrition, this has since changed due to the life steal changes to {{item:1055}}, and now AS or AD is most prominent.\r\n\r\nPlease do remember that some champions also benefit greatly from attack speed, and modifications for an optimal build is required.\r\n\r\n○ **Support**:\r\n3 main types of support, with subgroups as well, think about how you wish to play your lane, and the lane type, a poke lane won&#039;t require as many defensive runes, if you know how to kite and kite well, where as a burst lane, would like to either burst down their opponents or to be beefy enough to not get squashed at the first encounter.\r\n\r\n* Red:\r\n * Poke - Magic pen/hybrid pen\r\n * Sustain - AP or armor\r\n * Burst - Armor\r\n\r\n\r\n* Yellow:\r\n * Armor/health/Mana regen\r\n\r\n\r\n* Blue:\r\n * Mr/Mana regen/CD\r\n\r\n\r\n* Purple:\r\n * Choose whatever compliments the goal you wish to achieve.\r\n\r\nB) **[Masteries](http://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-522-notes#patch-overall-philosophy)** (Updated for Season 6)\r\nThe masteries allow you to tailor your champion and abilities to your liking.\r\n\r\n- **ADC**\r\nThe only choices you have to make in the ferocity tree, depends on how interested you are in dealing damage compared to sustain.\r\nWith the new keystone masteries, you have to choose 1/3 abiities to focus on, someone who prefers attack speed and hitting a lot of times may prefer &#039;Fervor of Battle&#039;  (\\*cough\\* {{champion:96}} \\*cough\\*)\r\n rather than &#039;Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust&#039;.\r\nMany ADCs in the present meta are of course taking Thunderlord&#039;s Decree which simply means investing in the Cunning tree rather than the Ferocity tree.\r\n\r\n- **Support**\r\nThis is a far larger subject, yet again consider the play style and lane type you wish to portrait.\r\nGenerally speaking, anyone with significant heals/shields ({{champion:267}} {{champion:37}}  etc) should take Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing. Other mage supports will usually do best with Thunderlord&#039;s. Tank supports usually do best with Bond of Stone.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s worth noting that these masteries affect items as well. So Windspeaker&#039;s Blessing will apply to items like {{item:3401}} {{item:3222}} and {{item:3190}} \r\n\r\nC) **Summoner spells**\r\nViable options for the ADC includes, {{summoner:4}}, {{summoner:7}}, {{summoner:21}}, {{summoner:1}}, {{summoner:3}}.\r\nThe first 4 makes sense, but why {{summoner:3}}?\r\n{{summoner:3}} unlike {{summoner:21}} or {{summoner:7}} , negates a large portion of the damage for a few seconds, these few seconds can be vital if you wish to survive the burst from an assassin or to duel a Riven who flashes onto you, it provides you with one immensely important trait, to be able to duel someone, in unfavorable circumstances. However in the present meta usually the support will take Exhaust, and having dual Exhaust is not usually all that useful as you&#039;d be better off taking something like Heal, which adds value rather than prolonging it.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to go for a burst lane, using {{summoner:3}} and {{summoner:14}}, make sure the ADC is the one using the {{summoner:3}}.\r\nAnother niche pick, is {{summoner:1}} immensely powerful but only against the right team composition. (ie don&#039;t take it in Blind Pick)\r\n\r\n{{summoner:1}} is a bit special, as you may be at a disadvantage early during the laning phase, however against a high cc team, such as, {{champion:117}}, {{champion:9}}, {{champion:45}}, {{champion:89}}, {{champion:412}}, {{champion:20}}, {{champion:75}} choosing {{summoner:1}} may be the difference between surviving or not.\r\n{{summoner:1}} does NOT affect suppression. ({{champion:19}}, {{champion:72}}, {{champion:90}}, {{champion:6}}) [source](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cleanse)\r\n\r\nD) **Trades**\r\nWhen clashing at bottom lane, there a couple of ways to come out on top (assuming both sides have full health).\r\nBe tankier than your opponents, so that you can survive the trade.\r\nHave higher burst potential. ({{champion:104}}/{{champion:1}})\r\nAnd then there is skill, by utilizing Crowd Control abilities, range and positioning, in order to kite, negate or mitigate damage.\r\nRoughly speaking, it is about showing them who is the boss of the lane.\r\nYou &#039;just&#039; have to win the encounter, know your champion mechanics, combo&#039;s and timing, if the sh.it really hits the fan it turns from a trade to an all out fight and you need to be in a favourable position or you greatly risk dieing.\r\n\r\nAll out fights can be chaotic or organized, there are a ton of things to consider, positioning, playstyle, abilities, limits, kiting, just remember **DON&#039;T PANIC!!!**\r\n\r\nE) **Teamfights**\r\n○ **ADC**\r\nKite, juke, poke, do whatever you have to, in order to SURVIVE and attack the highest priority target you can get to, WITHOUT endangering yourself.\r\nOf course if you know killing XXX member on their team will turn the fight, then by all means.\r\n\r\n○ **Support**\r\nYour role varies greatly, you can be an initiator, back line supporter, or even a second defense, but the main thing is that you have to decide, what is more important, protecting your adc, or killing their high priority targets, decide before the fight erupts, cause you won&#039;t have time to think about it during.\r\n\r\nF) **Bush fundamentals**\r\nAs you all know, if you walk into a bush, your opponents can&#039;t see you, however if you use basic attacks you will reveal the bush for a few seconds, even if you stop the auto attack animation.\r\nThat is why people move out of bushes to attack, and walk back in before their opponents can retaliate, it also means you need patience if you do not wish to be discovered, or to reveal the jungler you have hiding next to you.\r\n\r\nG) **Orb walking and Stutter step**\r\nThe definition of &#039;Orb Walking&#039; is to move in between auto attacks.\r\nDo not mistake this for &#039;Stutter Step&#039; as this refers to cancelling the wind down animation of the attack, this can be done either through moving, or abilities/items, for instance, directly after a Leona has attacked, you can use the Q (stun) to cancel the time otherwise required to animate returning, to her basic stance.\r\nAnother good example is {{champion:92}} and {{item:3077}}, with some training and timing, forgive me if I do not know the specific details but {{item:3077}} is not an item you see in bottom and so I do not have a lot of experience with it, but I did quote someone higher up who explained it nicely.\r\n\r\nH) **Leashing**\r\nTo help the jungler with buffs/krugs/gromp (their choice, rarely buffs anymore) at level 1, the better the leash (more help), the less damage the jungler will take, the faster (s)he can, start his/her jungle cycle and start ganking your lane.\r\nThis is about giving the jungler as much of a head start as possible (but not staying long enough to accidentally steal the mob or take exp).\r\n\r\nI) **General tips**\r\n\r\n* Elo Hell is a mental state, improve your attitude to get out of it.\r\n* Never leave shop without potions the first, 15-20 minutes of a match. (Unless it is the difference between getting a big item like {{item:1038}} or {{item:3031}} and not. With the potions now more expensive, waiting 50 gold is not advised)\r\n* Buy {{item:2043}} whenever you can afford them and yours is down/about to be or not in a good spot for the present situation. You should try to have a pink ward up somewhere useful at all times\r\n* Making amazing plays isn&#039;t just about the 5-15 sec, it is about getting away with it.\r\n* If you&#039;re going to die, make it worthwhile, draw them away from your adc/carries/team, set up a 1 for 2 situation or even try to lead them on a merry chase, always choose the lesser of 2 evils. If you have to die, make sure your team gets something for it.\r\n* If your jungler is getting invaded, go help, chances are in your favor that the other lanes will respond to the call for aid.\r\n* Giving kills to each other is fine, but ONLY if there is no chance of losing it, or any risk involved. (ie Securing kills for your ADC is the way to go unless you are ABSOLUTELY sure they can take it.
