It's a pretty dope piece of merch and I've been pretty keen to get my hands on one as well. Regarding the delay, the TL;DR is that we received a lot of feedback about Ahri's face (specifically, the eye makeup and finer details are a bit off), and we're revising the design to make sure you guys get the product you deserve. \n\nJunko posted a link to Riot Bradmore's announcement below, but [here it is again](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/riot-official/sdp49Ers-why-were-not-releasing-the-ahri-statue) if you want to see the full context behind the decision.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-08T19:48:02.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oo thank you I had been waiting for something like that :) Someone on reddit mentioned they might be redesigning it and there would probably be an announcement sometime :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-12-07T21:14:18.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they meant the 7th for the U.S. Which means it could become available at any time during the 7th so possibly not out till later on or possibly tomorrow?\n\nJust guessing here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-07T21:47:14.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's about 5pm (EST) on the 7th over there atm :(","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-12-07T23:52:35.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gegJEQRq,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-07T21:47:14.912+0000)\n>\n> It's about 5pm (EST) on the 7th over there atm :(\n\nBut it's not the 8th yet =D.\n\nThey are probably just slow.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-07T23:27:41.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just think back to Azir...\n\nnow all waiting will feel like no time at all.","replies":[]}]}
