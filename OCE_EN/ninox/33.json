You could build Lee Sin full tank and he&rsquo;d still feel like a fighter, or build Maokai full damage and he&rsquo;d still feel like a bruiser, but that&rsquo;s my take anyway. From that perspective there aren&rsquo;t really any AP fighters in the game other than Ekko. To me it just feels like an underexplored area, like the realm of AD supports (though that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d consider possible but very far from easy). \r\n\t\r\nAnyway so I wanted to see an AP fighter in the game and I&rsquo;d tossed ideas around before of what that could look like. Ekko&rsquo;s a good execution of the idea in my opinion. He has that fighter-y feel with melee range, plenty of mobility and acrobatic-y stuff going on with some really interesting mechanics, but he still feel very mage-y to me, so my goal with this concept (I say goal but it wasn&rsquo;t ever exactly very planned) was basically how can I make it feel like a fighter while still keeping the AP central to the champions idea, but without making it something like Katarina (because assassins basically feel like high damage output fighters). So the general idea was make the abilities important but not central, I wanted the abilities to work in tandem with basic attacks rather than instead of (kinda like how Lee Sin&rsquo;s do).\r\n\r\n**Basic Design (Visuals):** I don&rsquo;t really have any particular image of the champ in my head, nothing specific anyway. I always wanted it to be a she and bipedal but not strictly humanoid (there just aren&rsquo;t enough female monsters). What I do have is a very carapace-y kind of feel, but not bug like, more reptilian with hardened skin instead of scales, with horns and a vertebra like tail and with legs like kindreds with the (hock?) extra joint, but of course with claws instead of hooves. As for VFX the idea is pretty straightforward, it&rsquo;s all about shadow strings. That said it could be executed a few different ways, but that&rsquo;s the general idea. I always kind of envisioned something that would be suitable for an Eternum skin too, I love those skins. My biggest worry with this champ is that it infringes too much on Zed/Nocturne&rsquo;s territory given the whole shadow theme&hellip;even though I didn&rsquo;t really take any inspiration from either of those champs for the kit.\r\n\r\n**Basic Design (Lore):** &hellip;.There isn&rsquo;t really anything I can say here, I&rsquo;ve got nothing, it&rsquo;s not a shadow Isles-y champ (in my opinion anyway) and it&rsquo;s not a void creature either (no desire to consume or anything like that). I don&rsquo;t even really have an idea of whether it&rsquo;s supposed to be good or evil. Spooky/unnerving/dangerous certainly but..not necessarily strictly evil.\r\n\r\nPassive - (Phantom Thread??): Basic attacks and abilities leave a phantom thread attached to enemies, marking them for (7?) seconds.\r\n\r\n\tBasic attacks against marked targets do (?) (+ ? AP Ratio) magic damage on hit and heal for (?% of Syr&rsquo;s max health) (The idea being the phantom thread kinda siphons strength thematically speaking)\r\n\r\n**Q - (Shadow charge/dark charge/shadow bomb?? I really don&#039;t know about this one):** Lobs a ball of charged shadow thread at a target area (think Lux E sorta range and area of effect). After (1?) second it explodes dealing (?) (+ ? AP Ratio) in magic damage. Champions hit are slowed (25/30/35/40%) for (2.5) seconds. \r\n\r\n        Marked champions hit are slowed an additional 10%.\r\n\r\n**W - (Vanish/Shadow Pact??):** Melt into shadow thread and pass through a target enemy (kinda like when you kill a colossus in Shadow of the Colossus and the tendrils come and find you), appearing behind them (similar range to Kat Shunpo but a little smaller) dealing (?) (+ ? AP Ratio) (+ ?% max health) in magic damage.\r\n\r\n\tIf used on a marked target, consumes the mark instead of placing one, dealing an extra (?) (+ ? AP Ratio) and granting a rapidly decaying shield [for 70% of the damage dealt] OR [equal to the extra damage dealt] OR [equal to ?% of Syr&rsquo;s max health].\r\n\r\n**E - (Tether/Shadow Stitch??):** Cast a shadow thread in a direction (does not pass through minions, just under Amumu Q range). If an enemy is hit the thread deals (? minimal) (+ ? AP Ratio) in magic damage and the ability can be reactivated to drag Syr to the target [Interrupting champions]. \r\n\r\n\tIf the thread reaches the end of its range without making contact, it will seek out and attach to the nearest marked champion within (between Anivia Q detonation and Lux E field) range, dealing an extra (% max health) magic damage.\r\n\r\n**R - (Shadow Puppeteer??):** [First activation: Sends out shadow threads to all marked champions in range (Amumu ult range), tethering and preventing them from moving outside that range for 3 seconds (trying results in a lessened Azir ult type effect). Ability can be reactivated at any time.]\r\n\r\n[Second Activation:] Interrupts, then pulls in (think Thresh Q) all tethered champions a short distance towards Syr (Diana E sorta distance) dealing (?) (+ ? AP Ratio) in magic damage and extending Phantom Threads duration on all affected by (5? seconds)\r\n\r\n(Kinda like the puppeteer item from Black Market Brawlers)\r\n(First activation functionality could be removed, or moved to the E)\r\n(Another possibility would be to make it so a champion affected by the E during the first activation would also be affected by the second even though they weren&rsquo;t marked when the ult was cast. Cause the E tethers them as well.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo engaging in a teamfight would be like hit as many with Q as possible &gt; E in &gt; W to get the shield or reposition as necessary &gt; R. Or you if you can Q &gt; W in &gt; activate R &gt; E out to a minion &gt; reactivate R if you were being really tricky.\r\n\r\nIdeally the W/R would be the main sources of damage with minimal damage on the E and decent damage on the Q (but only because it&rsquo;s theoretically hard to hit reliably). But with the Q especially, it has to be reliable enough to use as an engage so the reliability might have to go up and the damage down or so on. The idea being that she can be played front line or...mid?? line with a strong engage and decent mobility without assassin levels of burst.\r\n\r\nGood items would be things like Rylai&#039;s/RoA/Liandry&#039;s/Nashor&#039;s/Devourer. Summoner Spells probs just Flash/Tele.\r\n\r\nI wanted a champion that would be versatile (I love versatile champions) and wouldn&#039;t be limited in how they could be played. The idea being you could play full AP (mid being a possibility even) you could play tankier, you could play on hit magic damage (Nashor&rsquo;s, Wit&rsquo;s End kinda deal). I wanted the flexibility to choose between mostly basic attacks or mostly spells or somewhere in between. I know full well this whole thing is a bit all over the place, it&rsquo;s hardly polished, in fact it&rsquo;s mostly something I thought up in a severe bout of insomnia and then kinda went back to later.\r\n\r\nIt could even be necessary to attach an attack speed passive in there somewhere (on the W maybe) to make it more viable to leave out Nashor&rsquo;s or something similar. She&rsquo;d probably be strong as a devourer jungler too.\r\n\r\nBut ultimately, I just thought I&rsquo;d share it, I have no real expectations of people liking it or whatever, it&rsquo;s kinda cliched and the kit isn&rsquo;t the most original, it just seemed kind of strange having this thing sitting around on my computer...so let me know what you think :&rsquo;)","replies":[{"poster":"Adelrift","date":"2015-10-16T20:31:24.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the idea. I'd probably change his/her name to Val'Syr: The Dark Puppeteer and probably give him/her the image of Screaming Mantis from MGS4 or something similar.\n\nGreat skills, but they do need work. The passive is a good skill, but it should consume on hit as opposed to it being maintained.\n-\nExample: Hitting enemies with abilities will mark them for x seconds. Hitting a marked enemy with a basic attack will consume it, deal x damage and healing for x health.\n\nHis Q is nice. I thought it woulda been a lob though a.k.a. Syndra's W for damage and slow, then a delayed secondary damage.\n-\nExample: Lobs a ball of shadow that hits enemies in an area for x damage and slows them by x for 1 second. After 1 second, the ball explodes, dealing x damage.\n\nW is an excellent skill. Doesn't need any input.\n\nHis E is a bit too strong. It guarantees that the enemy will not get away. I would change the E altogether (maybe make it an on-hit charm, since it would fit well with the puppeteer theme).\n-\nExample: Your next basic attack deals x damage and charms the enemy for x seconds.\n\nHis ult is kinda obnoxious (has too much CC and can really turn the tide of battle no matter how bad the situation is). Gotta think about how it would affect a teamfight (since its a teamfight ult right?). But I see where you were going with this. I'm proposing this change...\n-\nExample: First Activation - Threads of darkness expel from your body, clinging to nearby enemies and slowing them by x(a lot) for x seconds.  You are rooted during this time. Second Activation - Retracts all threads, pulling enemies in, dealing x damage and stunning them for x seconds.\n\nAnyways, that is my very very long input and it is just an opinion. You don't need to change anything but I just thought I'd add my 5 cents. Thank you for your patronage.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-17T08:05:55.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I very much appreciate the input. I had a lot for the concept but it was never exactly fleshed out, it was just an idea I had pondered on. \n\nYour title \"The Dark Puppeteer\" I certainly like better, I like the name too, but that would tie the champ to the void which (in my opinion anyway) doesn't really fit. All the void creatures have some kind of desire to consume, Vel'Koz is knowledge, Kog is...anything, Cho/Rek is people and so on. (oh and the intention was for a female monster so it'd be a she :P )\n\n-\n\nI agree the passive needs some work balance wise since its the core of most of the interactions. My worry with consuming the mark after one auto is that ideally I wanted to keep the fighter feel (meaning not so ability centric). Another option would be to have a stacking mechanic kinda like Twitch's where autos stack passive marks up to 5 and then the 6th consumes it, maybe dealing a bit of damage, then have a cooldown like Rek'Sai knock up or Udyr stun. That way you'd have 5 empowered autos against a target, and make it so abilities mark if they aren't and consume if they are dealing damage depending on how many stacks are on. The idea would be, getting autos off benefits your abilities and you have the extra mechanical decision of when to use your abilities, to wait for stacks or to take the ability dmg. I tend to like this option because it makes things more interesting, makes your decisions on when to use things more important. Dmg/max stacks etc can be tweaked as needed to so gives an extra balance point as well, and because the stacking mechanic is in place, you can reduce the passive decay to 3 or 4 seconds.\n\n-\n\nI intended the Q mostly as utility, hence no dmg on the initial impact, but to have it similar to Syndra's W (maybe remove one of the slow or the dmg?) on impact would be a possibility, but I feel like that's something you'd need playtesting to really decide on, which obvs isn't gonna happen.\n\n-\n\nThe E I agree, was never sure how to fit in that interaction, I felt she needed some kind of gap closer but I just wasn't sure what. Thinking more on it, an alternative could be something along the lines of, removing the interrupt and making the mark interaction be the gap closer. Basically if used on a marked target works like an Amumu Q minus stun, if not used on a marked target it just marks them and deals a little damage and amybe in both cases it could tether for 3 seconds (but just that link no cc or anything) that can be used by the ult, the tether being longer than the ult ones so they can go further away before breaking it (basically whoever you tether with E can be affected by your ult a bit further outside of its usual range). Assuming the passive decay is 3 or 4 seconds I wouldn't think that too strong (but again, no playtesting so hard to tell).\n\n-\n\nAs for the ult, I agree it's probably too ambitious :'). The need to have champs marked was meant to be the barrier, the condition I guess, but I like your version too. I very much agree with the being rooted bit, I kind of envisioned that myself but it didn't quite connect in my head so thanks for mentioning it. \n\nI would think perhaps, First activation expels the threads, rooting you and attaching to either all nearby champs/enemies or all nearby marked champs/enemies (playtesting again) within range, then slowing them like Morg's ult, except moving out of range doesn't break the tether (I'll get to that).\n\nOn second activation, any tethered champions (including those tethered by E) take x magic dmg as the tethers snap free. Champions within the original ult range are pulled in a short distance, with the slow persisting but decaying over the next few seconds and being freed from the tether. Champions outside the original ult range take an additional x magic dmg but suffer no further cc.\n\n-\n\nThanks so much for the input, I'm glad to see someone was interested and I'm not just some crazy rambling person with a dumb idea. I may or may not edit the original post, I think it's kinda cool to see the progression of these things (and given there's only two of us here I don't think we're gonna get confused).\n\nThanks again :)","replies":[]}]}]}
