Pixel art is always pixellated, but a pixellated image or drawing is not always pixel art. Drawing/painting at a low resolution can be a good start, but it is not inherently pixel art.\n.\n\n>######**_~~EXAMPLES~~_**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OPyXfzi.png vs https://i.imgur.com/zVq54DV.png\n\nA good way to distinguish them if you are unsure is to take a step back.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m9nQGhG.png vs https://i.imgur.com/EkTeg6a.png\n\nPixel art isn't art painted at a low resolution to make it pixellated, it's art created on the pixel level. More pixels (higher resolution) means more work to refine the effect, and pixel art very much follows the \"less is more\" policy.","replies":[]}]}
