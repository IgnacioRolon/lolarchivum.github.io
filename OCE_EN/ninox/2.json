It might be a joke, but especially in a game with some pretty young kids, it creates a culture. Which to an extent is fine within the confines of the game, but it doesn't end there and that's the problem.\n\nThat said, I agree with you to an extent. I believe the no tolerance terms they have chosen are appropriately serious, and I believe that the severity of that should be reflected in the punishment, however I agree with you that one offence shouldn't put someone one step away from perma.\n\nThe cases I've seen I think pretty much all of them are deserved, and I think 14 days is a good amount of time because it's long enough to impress severity and short enough that it is not simply forgotten for half of it. If there was a second 14 day tier for this kind of offence before perma I think that would be ideal because it doesn't much undermine the severity, but it does give an opportunity for reform for the people who haven't been taking it seriously.\n\nI think we'll have to agree to disagree on how bad we think the words themselves are, but that's nothing new, I would press you to remember that this game is rated 13+ though.\n\nThe biggest thing I think for Riot is ultimately communication, something which they very often spectacularly fail at. If they're going to take a no tolerance stance on some behaviours, then announce that, so the people with different views understand that they either compromise and keep it to out of game comms, or stop the behaviour all together. \n\nThere also needs to be clearer communication on the appeals process. People often seem to think they can only appeal to remove a ban, despite the fact they can just as easily appeal the length of it as well.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-27T11:03:35.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">I guess where I stand on this, is that allowing hate speech or things like KYS perpetuates that it's ok, regardless of the actual intent with which it is said.

There's a careful balance between allowing players the freedom to play what they want, and ensuring that that freedom doesn't hurt other players.\n\nAs for the mentally weak argument.
