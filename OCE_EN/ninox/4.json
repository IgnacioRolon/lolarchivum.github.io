You do all this hard work for our sakes, for little to no thanks. Especially the community managers and stuff that take the hardest blows from the deepest darkest parts of this community. Thank you all for everything you do for us. \n\nToo often I see people on these boards bashing you guys for beyond obviously flawed reasons. So even if you know it, it always helps to hear it. We love you guys. I know that even if I don&#039;t always agree I will always have your back. So maybe there are some assweeds that think they&#039;re hot stuff and better than you and can balance the game better and could have made a better skin or whatever. \n\nIm not doing this to ass kiss, that&#039;s not what I&#039;m about. But I&#039;ve BEEN THERE. I&#039;ve had that voice in my life (unfortunately not over the internet) telling you that you&#039;re worthless and that you&#039;re always wrong and that you should just leave because nobody wants you here. And if you hear it enough you start to believe it, so I&#039;m here to say if EVER you start to believe it I want you to remember those of us that support you. Those of us that love this game and have just as much passion for it as you do. Those of us that take the time to understand you are real people and not just parts of a machine, and that it means you aren&#039;t perfect. Because we are out there, I meet more everyday.\n\nThank you OCE Rioters, for everything you do. I&#039;ll always be here for you as long as I play this game (which is going to be a long time yet).\n\nEDIT: And this applies to anyone in that position. NOONE is alone.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-11-23T21:52:53.528+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Bb1b8T6g,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-11-23T07:40:17.111+0000)\n...Those of us that take the time to understand you are real people and not just parts of a machine, and that it means you aren&#039;t perfect. \n\nThank you Seras Dragon!!!!\nBest way to start my day :) \n\n\nAnd you Sir,\n> [{quoted}](name=MrMunster,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Bb1b8T6g,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-11-23T20:08:26.263+0000)\n... Yet I believe Rioters honestly don't care - not only are they trained for this sort of incompetence displayed by misbehaving summoners, though I think their jobs come with enough perks to make them look past the dark shrouds of whining.\n\nYou couldn't be any wronger. \nMost of us don't sleep when when they know they could have done better for you.\nMost of us don't eat when servers are not working properly.\nFor most of us League is not \"just a job\" but a life choice we have made to make the game industry better for everyone.\n(sorry if this sounds lame)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-24T00:48:05.603+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"My post was pretty corny to begin with let's be honest.
