I liked the idea of giving out a free mystery skin to people who had not seen any punishments in the last year, and I really want to see more of that sort of thing. I do not think the punishments should be removed because not getting something does not count as a consequence in the eyes of much of the toxic parts of the community, where losing hard earned content does.\r\n\r\nI think a good opportunity would be to use the new crafting system they are working on to reward players. You get chests from mastery ranks (I believe) and keys from mastery scores (and playing with friends), why not give out chests for anyone who hasn&#039;t received a punishment each month? If you haven&#039;t had any sort of punishment in the last month you get a mastery chest (since you get the keys just by playing anyway), and this happens every month. It&#039;s a good incentive, and pushes not just the play to win (as opposed to buy to win) but also the play positive to win. \r\n\r\nIf you demonstrate positivity (or at least neutrality) then you will get free content much faster than those that display negativity, giving positive players a tangible advantage. Perhaps if they added runes to the system as well, as one of the biggest complaints is that runes are too expensive. This would be an excellent incentive/helper for new players as well, as it encourages them to play more, to be positive right from the start, and to try new champions/roles early on.\r\n\r\nPositive reinforcement has to be consistent, or it just doesn&#039;t work, so having a monthly reward would be about right I would think, and using the crafting system would be utilising a system that will already be in place, set to give players the opportunity to earn content for free. I see this as a way to kill two birds with one stone so to speak. It gives a tangible advantage to the positive players in the community, and helps out new players along the way (and Riot is always saying they are looking for more ways to do this). It&#039;s just a suggestion, but I know that Rioter&#039;s do sometimes take things from the boards to discussion, especially regarding helping out new players. If you think it&#039;s a dumb idea that&#039;s fine, but I would be curious to know why so let me know what you think of it :)","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-12-03T23:13:25.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although it's a good idea, giving out pretty much \"free skins and runes\" would not be what Riot would want. If they did give these chests out to people with no punishments each month, players would rely too much on these free rewards, and not bother buying from the store. This may not be the case for majority of players, but it's a risk for Riot I just don't think they would take.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-04T07:19:10.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Given their present rate of skin release, and the fact that you can't buy runes with RP, I think it would be a possibility. People would still be buying..pretty much the same amount of RP (the skins are random too so), it'd just take away much fo the frustration associated with having to earn so damn much IP. But I take your point, it's certainly something they'd have to consider.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2015-12-01T15:26:17.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm all for it ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-01T12:38:38.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Speaking of chests and keys, when was that shit coming out?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-01T12:45:59.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well given it doesn't directly influence the balance of the game, I'd say soon after season start. Could be before but I wouldn't get your hopes up. I reckon it'll be a real cool system though.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-01T12:54:48.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hell yeah I'm all for free shit.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
