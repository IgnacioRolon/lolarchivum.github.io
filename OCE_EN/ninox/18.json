I&#039;ll edit and add as more things come to mind/stuff gets changed throughout the week I reckon. Before anything else though, love the mode!\n___\n#**MAP** - EDITED 16/8\n\nSome areas feel too spread out or too far away from the action to really ever be used and/or redundant (perhaps push it all up just a bit?):\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IeON1yk.png\n\nI like having that little nook down the bottom but it feels too out of the way.\n\nI also think the Jungle towers would be a good fit for the laser turrets we had in...S4?..5? Consistent burning rather than periodic damage. Spices things up a bit and also puts more pressure on duellers or divers when they&#039;re trying to be really up in the enemy jungle. Or maybe even something like chain lightning, that&#039;s weaker but hits all enemies in the area to really emphasise those choke points. Different directions certainly, but something to make those turrets a bit more interesting and have a bit more presence.\n\nThe one tower on the Nexus also feels a little....insubstantial. Once a snowballing team reaches a nexus that turret really doesn&#039;t mean much at all. Changing that means the games would last that much longer though.\n___\n#**CHAMPIONS** - EDITED 16/8\n{{champion:55}} {{champion:121}} {{champion:238}} etc. \nIt&#039;s a snowbally gamemode by nature, but **assassins are _very_  make or break and imo snowball way too hard either way**. If the team is winning the assassins are just no fun to play against unless you&#039;re a full tank (at which point your team is probs dead), and when the team is losing they&#039;re just about dead weight. The length and pace of the gamemode seems to have amplified the negatives of assassins essentially. I will confess to being biased though, I don&#039;t care for assassins in general.\n\n{{champion:92}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:420}}  etc. \nBruisers seem to have the consistency advantage and feel to be in a pretty good place for the most part but **imo have the potential to get boring fast** since they can quickly take over a meta. \n\n{{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:40}} etc. \nEnchanter supports **feel like they're in a pretty good place**. They're definitely strong if you ignore, and especially those with heavy CC have a much greater presence than they normally would in SR but I like that. Give my supports some love :)\n\n{{champion:143}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:61}}  etc.\nControl mages **seem to perform pretty well**. They&#039;re reliable but don&#039;t lack counterplay and don&#039;t feel too negatively influenced by overall team performance in the way that assassins seem to be.\n\n{{champion:222}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:21}} etc.\nMarksmen seem to perform reasonably but appear to be ** very dependent on team performance** (not that there's anything new there). Those with mobility obviously have an advantage in such a tight space and those without are much more reliant on a CC heavy team. Perhaps a little on the weak side given that most of them have a weaker early game comparatively and need time to scale up. Some minor buffs to base damage and/or rations might be in order.\n\n{{champion:111}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:57}} etc.\nTanks are tanks there&#039;s not much to say. Definitely feels nice to have Force of Nature as a counterpart to things like Thornmail and Frozen Heart - in my mind there&#039;s always been a bit of a gap there. The tanks I&#039;ve played and vsed didn&#039;t feel like they did too much damage but could soak plenty, so my **overall impression is that they&#039;re in a good place.** Tanks with lower base stats do appear to struggle to get off the ground sometimes but I haven't played them enough to really say.\n\n{{champion:45}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:1}} \nBurst mages seem **a bit hit or miss**. Those with reliable CC seem to do alright. As a whole their performance seems to depend a lot on the enemy team comp (which being blind you can't account for in select).\n\nHaven&#039;t really versed or played much in the way of duellers so won&#039;t comment yet.\n___\n#**EVENTS** - EDITED 16/8\nDefinitely need to be expanded but that&#039;s obviously already on the table. It'd also be nice if the \"Event Starting in:\" was a bit more obvious. Playing on speakers I often miss the audio cue and without any fanfare in it's appearance the text can be easy to miss and continue not seeing.\n\n**Snowball fight feels a little long**. Pace wise it's good, fast enough that it actually turns into a snowball fight but with enough of a cooldown that it&#039;s not just spam with no thought, but the duration of the event makes it drag a bit. Maybe just drop the number of hits needed by a few.\n\n**Bardle Royale feels good**, and I appreciate that where the circle is centred caters to team performance (or at least it seems to? it&#039;s possible it&#039;s random and we&#039;ve just been lucky in that sense in which case I think it should definitely cater to the losing team)\n\n**Catch the Loot Teemo feels _very_ unfair with the AI sometimes**. Teemo will often run into winning team's jungle. The winning team got a huge boost with no real way for their opponent to contest. Perhaps a limit (or stricter limit if there already is one) on where he can run to? Keep it more central so it&#039;s an objective you can actually contest without absurd risk.\n\n**Push the Cart feels good**. It&#039;s simple, to the point, and has a clear objective which is nice to have in the mix with events that have much more flexibility in how they can be handled.\n\n**King of the Hill feels a little forced**, and a little redundant with the existence of Bardle Royale (which has basically the same mechanic with much more compelling gameplay). It could be a really cool event it just needs something to spice it up and differentiate it a bit imo.\n\n**Nexus fight feels way too rushed**. I get that it&#039;s basically your Nexus getting sick of your shit for taking too long but it felt like there was no time to prepare at all, and they travel so quickly (and at that point the death timers were so long) that it felt like too desperate of a rush with the winner basically being luck of the draw (no fun at all for the loser). Perhaps make them stand up slower to give teams some time to actually prepare once the event has been identified?.\n___\n#**BUFFS** - EDITED 16/8\nAgain need to be expanded, and again already in the works, but they all felt pretty good. Not OP to have as permanent buffs but worthwhile enough that events don&#039;t feel like they&#039;re meaningless and can be ignored.\n\n**Soraka buff feels a little weak** and insubstantial, could definitely be tuned up.\n\n**Janna buff is great but feels one-sided**. It's great if the losing team catches it, but if the enemy team gets it it's a bit much.\n\nWould be nice to have something like the dragon tracker for buffs in TAB or maybe even just at the top of the screen (with TAB displaying more details) to display which buffs are active on each team. I feel this is especially important for the permanent buffs and also once buffs start expanding in variety.\n\nPerhaps Kalista W would make a good buff that periodically respawns? Or Karthus walls that cycle over certain pathways? Don&#039;t want to make the map too messy of course but with how short the mode is I feel the buffs can be reasonably obnoxious before they become problematic.\n\nThe extra damage you take when on fire could perhaps also be increased a little. Let's be honest that person is probably fed and they can kill you a lot quicker now. Felt like the debuff part might not quite be doing it's job well enough.\n___\n#**THEMATIC**\nIt&#039;s been said that if Blitz is gonna stick around (and I would really like it to) that closer to completion it would get it&#039;s own theme/region (like ARAM/TT) for the map. Given it&#039;s a fun, not-so-serious gamemode with quirky music (I feel the likes of Lulu and Shaco&#039;s Quirky encounter fits well thematically) then I think either somewhere in/near Bandle City or heavy on the Vastayan wild magic would be a good fit, especially since they&#039;re regions we haven&#039;t seen much of. The end of the river on botside should also totally be an epic waterfall.\n___\n#**ITEMS** - EDITED 16/8\nPhilo Stone and Heart of Gold (their spiritual successors anyway) felt pretty redundant. You earn gold pretty quick as is, and the Doran&#039;s items felt like a much better pick. I&#039;m not sure if they have a proper place, and 6 starting items seems a bit overkill though the whole returning item sentiment is nice. Perhaps if they could actually build into something, like Philo into Shurelya&#039;s, or even bring back Eleisa&#039;s Miracle with some tweaked passives.\n\nI&#039;d also be real keen to see Shard of True Ice back.\n\nSpear of Shojin might prove to be problematic.\n___\nThat&#039;s just my thoughts so far though. Obviously as matchmaking and the meta settles things will change.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-08-16T09:02:41.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edits complete :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-16T14:25:40.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too!

In a rush to get the the circle fire away, teamfight breakout in your jungle **Pew** and so on so forth.\n\nI currently see no problem other than what the user does, if you're being dumb on a squishy and fire yourself into the enemy 5 man you're probably gonna die, so don't do that.\n\nPossible Adjustment - Reduce the range of the cannon to as far as the opposite bank of the river.\n\n**Janna's Blessing**\nThis thing is so stupidly strong it actually makes me mad, you guys nerfed janna shield a few patches ago, but now you've released a hyper powered version of it, no thanks this blessing is ridiculously OP\n\nProblem - the shield is massive if you're low hp when you receive it, after backing i found that i still had an additional 2 bars of shield on top of my 2-3 bars of HP, this basically makes any champ as tanky as a rank 3, 4 stack Cho'gath.\n\nPossible Solution/s\n1. Reduce overall shielding by half or more\n2. Reduce the time a champion has it, substantially\n3. Make the shield last a quarter  of the time, and have it slowly wear off over time, like it does for actual Janna.\n\n**Soraka's blessing**\nBasically useless, you know its there, but it basically does nothing for you unless you're low on HP\n\nProblem - Healing is lacklustre\n\nPossible Solution/s\n1. Turn the heal into a trinket item, that has a one time use and restores 3/4 of your max HP (ie. it becomes a hyper powered Wish)\n2. Reduce the duration of the heal over time, but increase the total healing received over that period\n\n**Zilean's Blessing**\nSomewhat over powered, but also lacklustre at the same time (its hard to explain)\n\nProblem - The free GA is nice, but it seems about as useful as GA is normally, the minute you fight and your team chickens out and you die it becomes Null and Void because you just prolonged the inevitable\n \nPossible Solution/s\n1. Similar to Soraka's Blessing change, make it a trinket item that automatically goes off when you die, restores you to full and gives you a large decaying movement speed buff for a second or so after. In order to balance this have the revive work like herald does, but on a much sooner expiry (30-60 seconds max)\n2. Do the above thing, but have it work like Zileans ulti, it lasts for 8 seconds then its done, so make it an Active item that holds the short cooldown also mentioned above\n\n\n**Cursed Minions**\nThis seems useless overall, minions die so fast anyways, what would be the point of reducing them to 1hp\n\nProblem - Useless\nPossible Solution\n1. Wither effect applied to all enemy champs after receiving the victory, the effect lasts up to 10 seconds (can be cleansed)\n2. Keeping with the wither effect, but instead of causing all stats to be lowered, just reduce the AD and AP of opposing champions by a % amount for the duration\n\n**Blitzcrank's Hook**\nThis blessing, is a pain in the ass. Not only is it just as dodgy as the in game champ (passing through minions, grabbing enemy darius' etc.) but it just seems like a pain to both sides. For the blessed, it makes you miss skillshots as far as i'm aware there's no timer when the cannon minion/tower will fire the grab and thus makes it harder aim skillshots. on the flipside the enemy team might get hooked in all manner of bullshit because the hitbox is rubbish, thus making the game more unfun than a Janna lane.\n\nProblem - Dodgy ability, poor hitboxes, brutal to both sides\nPossible Solution - REMOVAL\n\nOf course these are purely my opinions on the state of this gamemode, you can take them how you want, but personally these changes with proper balancing would make the game more enjoyable, plus you have so many champs to choose from, why not add more modes, more blessings, more rewards etc.\n\nTLDR:\n\n* Gamemode is fun and enjoyable\n* Certain modes need to function better overall\n* Some rewards are good, others are busted and need changing\n* I Suck at formatting :D\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-16T01:46:17.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I've had good success with tanks, but I've also been playing those with solid base stats like Nautilus which makes the first few minutes a bit easier. I don't play many tanks (Really just Naut, Braum and Mao) so which trends will continue I'm not sure.\n\nADCs for me felt in a decent spot damage-wise, could probs do with a small buff, but really it was the survivability that drags them down (which really holds true for SR as well). Those with mobility or with CC support did much better for this reason. Had a Jinx that got a Quadra and just kept snowballing because of good team support. \n\nMages come in a wide variety so limiting them I think is a bit unfair. That said, given there's pretty much always going to be at least a bruiser if not a tank, AP heavy teams in my experience have had the same glaring weakness you'd expect. Versed one as Nautilus, bought Force of Nature and they just couldn't kill me. Blind pick complicates this process a bit, but AP heavy teams just make it that much easier to choose your builds as far as I've seen. Might get boring for the same reason all bruisers, all game, every game does if people don't diversify though.\n\nI think we'll have to disagree on supports for now, but I expect that gameplay will change once matchmaking settles and people startw orking out what the mode is in depth.\n\n___\n\nI agree on the Teemo, his pathing is all over the show and thoroughly unfair if he decides to run to the enemy team.\n\nRoyale appears to cater to the losing team still both in position and in the Juggernaut modifier, and I have no real issue with that. Gives the losing team a chance to catch back up.\n\nThe cannon is a free teleport, no complaints from me. Doesn't feel too strong on the winning team either because homeguards gets you most of the way the cannon can in not that much more time.\n\nWith the Janna shield being a one time thing I'm not too fussed with it, but it can make things frustrating for the losing team. Perhaps they could have two modifiers for it and if the losing team gets it it's the shield, and winning team get's her passive buff or something instead. Dunno how customisable they want to make these if at all.\n\nI agree the Soraka healing feels negligible sometimes, but it's basically a free ocean drake and I think it's one of the permanent ones?\n\nFor the Zilean one, you mean remove the time limit but of course keep it one time as opposed to only being 90 seconds? I wouldn't be bothered by that but it would probably have the same drawback as the Janna one.\n\nIt honestly took me a while to work out what the curse even did. I like the concept, but it really feels like a nothing bonus.\n\n:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-08-15T23:56:48.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"enchanter supports aren't as good as you think in nexus blitz, the chaotic choke teamfights often mean you have to position way too close, and if your team knows to recall properly, the smaller map size, means that soraka's heal is more like a small health buffer than something that helps you win a sustained fight, especially when fighting for an event is often faster than a death timer.\n\nOn that note, Lulu, Nami, Morg and Orianan do break this trend; but supports like Soraka, Karma, Janna, and Sona do not perform well against good nexus blitz comps, because in the face of a balanced frontline and engage, the enclosed fighting space means their impact is greatly reduced.\n\nand yes I realised, that I have just said that half the enchanters are good here and half of them aren't.\n\n\nOn another note, teamcomp and combinations have far more gravitas than players give credit, in the outcome of nexus blitz, and assassins aren't exactly the biggest issue, more so that, snowbally bruisers are (except rengar and kayn), assassins are only overpowered against nexus blitz comps that didn't balance well and lack the brawling style necessary to win.
