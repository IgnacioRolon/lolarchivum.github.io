{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T09:25:28.807+0000","title":"The Blue Essence Discussion","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"**Fair warning, this is going to be long.**\n\nReading through boards, I come to two conclusions regarding the new method of gaining currency. The first is that not receiving BE after every game is dissatisfying, especially if you are close to getting a new something that you want. The second is that players feel you gain less BE than you did IP.\n\nI&#039;ll start by saying, I don&#039;t want to undermine any arguments, but I also feel that many of the discussions here have been derailed by emotion and bias, and I *hope* to start a conversation where we can avoid that at least for a little while. I will say that I feel quite positively about the new system (not completely, don&#039;t get me wrong), and to those of you who feel very strongly one way or the other, I challenge you to display your arguments and prove your points constructively, so we&#039;re all better off for it.\n___\n#BE Gains\nThe first thing I will say is that in both Riot communication and my own experience, you earn *MORE* BE per game in the new system than you did IP in the old. As someone who plays 1-2 games a day on work days and 4-5 on non, with the addition of the first win bonus I got 930 BE for 5-6 games. In the old system, assuming 50% winrate I would have only got 600-700~ IP. \n\nTo save a lot of math I&#039;ll also point to [this post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/Jh3Mtzu6-board-post-title-blue-essence-earn-rates-learning-the-numbers-with-carl-and-henrietta) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7bnos8/psa_riots_claim_that_leveling_from_130_is_quicker/dpji36k/) from Riot Mortdog.\n\nIt&#039;s also worth noting that we now have an extra source of income for buying champions, since being tied to BE now means we can buy champs with the currency we earn from Hextech Chests which never used to be the case.\n___\n#EXP : Game Time\nThere is one factor which I think isn&#039;t adequately accounted for or discussed in the averages we are given, since it might disproportionately affect certain player groups. I cannot speak to the experience since it isn&#039;t my own, but it&#039;s something I believe may be cause for concern. Namely, the EXP to game time relationship.\n\nFor most players this is an overwhelming improvement, because you don&#039;t lose out on nearly as much currency for losing a game as you did in the old system. However, lower ranked games and games under new (high impact) patches tend to be shorter because they snowball much more easily. So what then of the people in lower ranks who can only commit to one or two games a day? They&#039;re going to be losing out on a lot of EXP over other players. Whether or not this results in them getting less currently overall I am not at all sure, but it&#039;s something that I think needs addressing if it turns out to be the case.\n___\n#Pay to Win?\nAnother complaint I am seeing a lot is that these changes make League pay to win, but owning every champion doesn&#039;t give you an advantage, because a jack of all trades is a master of none. If anything I would argue it is the opposite, because now you don&#039;t have to spend currency on Runes, which were expensive and *necessary* if you wanted to play at higher levels of skill, you can dedicate all that currency to buying a new champion instead.\n\nNot having to pay for a necessary pre-game feature and shifting all that currency you aren&#039;t spending (instead of just removing it) into accessibility and variety seems like a wholly good thing to me.\n___\n#New Player Experience\nThe new player experience hasn&#039;t gained as much from this since they weren&#039;t buying runes anyway, but it may have if certain rumours about the shards they receive are true. Assuming new players are getting a low BE shard like Ashe or Garen *as well as* another *random* shard to get them BE then I don&#039;t see any problem, it gives them a choice, but if they are consistently getting only low cost champion shards (even if the BE itself still adds up to the same) then I think it does put some new players at a disadvantage. \n\nSure champs like Ashe and Garen are simple, but the first champion I really put time into was *Nami* who was and still is 6300. Having no chance at a higher tier shard for a champ you really want to play could well be pretty frustrating BUT I do not know how the new system functions for new players, so all of that is a really big **IF**.\n___\n#Player Satisfaction\nFrom what I can tell, the biggest issue people are having is satisfaction. It was very satisfying for many players to see their IP go up and know they are that much closer to x champion. I can also see how being 100-200 BE away from x champion and having to play enough to actually level instead of just a few games is a frustrating experience. These I feel are very valid points.\n\nMy counter would be that levelling, especially at milestones, feels like a bigger achievement since there is a bigger reward, and that having a visual display of progress in post game rather than just a +number feels a lot nicer. That said, I do believe there is merit to not completely removing the post game gains. \n\nIdeally the game itself would be the reward, but if it&#039;s a bad game then getting only EXP which doesn&#039;t result in anything tangible (relatively speaking, a number means less than a new character to play) is a not so great experience. I believe some kind of hybrid would be the way to go. \n\nHaving a big reward upon level is a great system in my eyes, it feels like an accomplishment, and attaches more sentiment to the now uncapped levelling, but some small progress after each game would also be appreciated. Not enough to undermine the level rewards or completely flood people with BE, but enough so that people who are only 100-200 BE off a new champ won&#039;t have progress a whole level just to get there.\n___\n#Mastery\nThis is the biggest problem I have with the new system. For a player like me, who owns all the champions I want and therefore has an excess of currency it doesn&#039;t pose a problem, but for player who still want to buy champions they have a big choice to make. \n\nUltimately, it&#039;s a cosmetic choice, you don&#039;t get any sort of advantage, you aren&#039;t really getting anything new, it&#039;s just style points really, but I feel and always have felt that the restriction on mastery tiers should be in the tokens and not in the essence. I don&#039;t feel that having to choose between showing pride in your skill on a particular champion, and having the chance to play something new is a nice choice at all.\n\nIf I could change any one thing in the new system it would be putting the essence cost of mastery upgrades back to what they were, even if it was at the cost of having to earn an extra token for each rank.\n___\n#Other Changes\nI doesn&#039;t seem like anyone really dislikes the new rune system. I think most people agree that it is an overwhelming improvement, and personally I feel changing things up in select will be a lot smoother and feel a lot better in the new system (once we learn what everything is and does). So really I just want to say thanks to the guys at Riot who put so much effort into the new runes because it shows and I think it&#039;s a great direction for the game (and especially the art teams because wow guys).\n\nI do think base MR or MR items need minor buffs, but that&#039;s the kind of thing that will adjust with time over preseason.\n___\n#So, thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-09T15:33:22.371+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":">because now you don't have to spend currency on Runes\n\nSo just so we are clear, yes you don't have to spend money on Runes.\n\nBUT\n\nNow unless your wanting to make a new Rune page every game for those with less pages, your forced into buying rune pages, which ends up being the same issue (And good luck doing it every champion select, even once we get better at it, it still takes a long while, i tried making one on the fly for an autofill, took me ~1 min, 30 seconds, and i still fucked the page up, and was in a huge rush).\n\nAs to my argument as to why BE is lessened not more, i'll just link to this which i posted in the other topic:\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/KsZvsY4T-revert-be-to-ip?comment=0000000000000000000000010000\n\nIf i wasn't a player with everything, i would feel screwed over, and i believe it is right for them to think so, gone are the days where having 2 rune pages is ok, now you need closer to 1 per champion you wish to play.\n\nGone are the days where you could play a single game and get that 50 IP you are short of a champ, now have fun grinding another 6+ games.\n\nAnd for those who aren't paying keen attention.\n\n>Henrietta will Level to 31 after 9 games and 1 Win of the Day.\n>Carl will Level to 31 after 6 games and 3 Wins of the Day.\n\nPeople have been saying things like they get to 31 off 5 games, you have to be playing casually, and getting multiple first win's of the day, for anyone that wanted to just spend a day grinding out the BE, your going to have to spend longer.\n\n9 games+ (remember experience required increases) to get to some BE is just terrible.\n\nEDIT: And as for the New Player Experience, it's not a shard, it's you now own the champion, no BE is allowed, the IP you originally got in the early levels is now being force fed into the \"easy\" champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-10T04:03:37.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RE Rune pages, if anything they're easier to change in champ select now. For some I'm sure it doesn't feel that way yet since everything is still new, but I feel way more comfortable changing my pages in select now than I did before, because there is an easy visual cue to tell you what each rune does, so once you know what they are it's a lot easier to pick and choose.\n\nYou couldn't change runes in the old system so had to make do with basic pages, and masteries were convoluted and lacked clarity. I would sooner spend the time to open up something like champion.gg and follow that than just make one myself on the fly. More often than not I wouldn't try to change them at all and just make do. Now I feel like I have a lot more control over how I want to play in a given match.\n\nI have 10 pages because I bought the 6 page bundle with RP forever ago, but I find myself using one for each role, maybe two for support at most. Even then, my top and jungle page are similar enough it would take no time at all to adjust them, same goes for my mid and AP supp pages. 3-4 pages isn't going to take that long at all comparatively, especially when you don't have to worry about buying runes themselves.\n___\nI agree the experience for casual players who can only play 1-2 games a day isn't great, but I addressed that in the OP, I feel a hybrid approach is the way to go, and Riot seems to be considering something of the sort.\n\n>A big goal of the new system was to shift the slow (often barely noticeable) trickle of currency from individual games to larger, more noticeable chunks that come with a level increase. We still think that design makes sense. We do agree however that it can feel crappy in situations where maybe you only need 50-10 more blue essence to get something cool, but gaining another level feels days or weeks away. We might be able to make that feel better by adding a small amount of blue essence to first win of the day rewards or something similar. Again, this isn't an announced change - just the kind of thing we are discussing to help solve a problem that a lot of players are bringing up.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7bsx5e/riot_turned_the_rewards_down_from_good_to_bad/dpl1m9q/\n___\nAs for number of games to level, I had less games than most, but also longer games.

Which was about as tiltworthy as getting 99 LP, but just as rare an occurrence I imagine.\n___\nAs for the new player experience, that sounds pretty shit.

For me, long before I got all the champions I wanted, it was barely noticeable. If I didn't actually look at the number in post game I would have no idea how much IP i earned, and I wouldn't feel any closer to a champion. The difference between 1280 and 1380 was almost completely irrelevant unless I actually wanted a 1350 champ which was very rarely the case.\n\nIP felt like some side thing that wasn't important for weeks at a time, now at least there is something significant to feel accomplished about, even if it has some...hiccups.\n\n>You realize these new things are Masteries but MORE convoluted right?\n\nMasteries meant nothing to me in the old system. I hadn't changed my support mastery page the whole season. Now every rune has a very clear purpose. Instead of choosing between one tiny insignificant choice or another, you have bigger, clearer and more meaningful choices to make. They matter more because they influence how you play a given game, and that interactivity is a great thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI wasn't saying you have one page *that doesn't change* per role. You have one page per role that you tweak in select. It really doesn't take that long to change a page once you know what the runes do. It's a familiarity thing.\n\n>Then you have forgotten how shit the client is my friend\n\nBugs are bugs. This is preseason after all, which is why they make big changes now. At least there isn't Zed getting every CS on the map or Jax crashing games.\n\nI haven't had any issues personally, though I do know people who've been unable to edit runes in select, but again, it's preseason. Runes taking up the whole screen hasn't been an issue for me, but making picks visible wouldn't be an unwelcome change.\n\n>Fact is these new changes just pushed you from having to buy runes (which just so we are clear, wasn't nearly hard at all, a pair of basic rune pages costed like a 6000IP), to having to buy rune pages.\n\nBuying runes was always a pain point for me, from when I started in S3 right up until the T2 runes dropped to 1IP. I could never afford quints because I wanted champions instead, so for the longest time I had the barest most basic rune page. I had one for support/mid and one for ADC. I later added one for jungle but I never completed it, it was filled with halves. I would much rather buy an extra rune page that I can use for *anything* over 2-3 quints that will only help me in *some* champions in *one* role.\n\nBuying runes was a frankly gross experience for me, and I'll take this over it any day. Runes feel good now. They are interactive and you feel like you actually have a choice. Before your *effectiveness in game* was limited by how many games you could grind out in a day, and that quite frankly is far more pay to win than anything they have now.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-10T04:51:51.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">you have bigger, clearer and more meaningful choices to make.\n\nDo we have clearer or more meaningful choices?\n\nLet's just check out a few of the potential choices for a minute.\n\nSorcery Tree;\n\nKeystone:\nArcane Comet: You have a stun for your first damage ability.\nPhase Rush: you liked Windspeakers and thought it should be easier to proc\nAery: You like Arcane Comet, but you want it to hit your opponent without a stun, or have some sort of heal/shield\n\nI haven't made a choice yet in this tree FYI, i've just determined the champion i am.\n\nNullifying orb: Hexdrinker?\nManaflow Band: Meditate but buffed.\nThe Ultimate Hat: Impactful ult? winning the game? here's a way to win more.\n\nI still really haven't made a choice, because ultimate hat is just too strong on anyone that can use their ult for snowballing (which is basically every champ using this page)\n\nTranscendence: 10% CDR at level 10 (The runes want their CDR per level back), or a bunch of AP/AD if you overdo CDR.\nCelerity: Rammus\nAbsolute Focus: Execution got reworked to be based off your health\n\nHere's another of the Only a choice if your a certain champion, if your super long range, absolute focus, if your not rammus then don't pick celerity, and then take Transcendence.\n\nScorch: Nerfed Brand Passive\nWaterwalking: Nerfed Fleet of foot/Quickness/Whatever else it's been called\nGathering Storm: Oh so i see your a late game champion.\n\nStill not really a choice, am i a roamer, or am i a late game champion.\n\nAnd hey these are totally clear and don't require nearly as much thinking as the old runes.... oh wait... i could see all the old masteries without having to change pages?

I like the new runes. I like the way they are laid out, I like the way the trees are guided by an overarching principle that makes it easy to choose a direction. I like that any tree can synergise with any other tree as a secondary. I like that I'm not limited to the same cookie cutter masteries for every AP mid laner or every heal/shield support.\n\nI like having options while keeping the intent and playstyle you choose clear. If I'm choosing comet it's because I have CC and want to build into burst, If I take Aery it's probably because I'm building Ardent or don't have reliable poke. If I'm playing Evelynn I can choose to focus on burst or I can focus on movespeed. I like that mages don't have to be blue, and that building them yellow or red still makes sense.\n\nI like that everyone can synergise with *their* playstyle, not just the playstyle of the champion. Do you play aggressive support? Great, pick aggressive runes. Defensive? Do the same. As a fighter do you want to push sustain or damage? Take your pick. As a mid do you want to poke or all in? Make a choice.\n\nThey have given us interactivity, customisation and choice in a clear, easy to understand and relatively concise manner. Sure the old system might have been simpler, but it was also boring as all hell. Everyone played x champion with the same runes and masteries. There was no personality beyond aggressive or passive. Now you have to actively understand and play against a *player* instead of against a champion.\n\nThe choices are clearer because they actually mean something. Before the choice between one mastery or another (keystones aside) was fairly inconsequential, now it actually matters. Clear doesn't mean they require less consideration, clear means it is easy to understand their impact.

Obviously you can still own all the champs and only play a few, so its always advantageous to keep your options open.\n2. The LAST thing we want for both game health and champion variety, is to encourage the 1-trick pony attitude.\n3. Owning all the champs _(and being able to at least competently play a fair few)_ gives you an edge in draft counter-picking. For example I think I'm rather proficient with Azir/Sol/Taliyah and have put significant time and practice into all 3 _(so I'm hardly a 'jack-of-all-trades')_, but because I own and can competently play all mid laners, if they pick a champ like Fizz who goes well into all 3 of my mains, Im at least I have the option to not pick Aurelion Sol into that counter, I could go Vlad or Galio or someone who is less likely to make me slam my face into the side of the desk.\n4. This is perhaps the thing that has helped me most about owning everyone. Having experience with a playing a champ is absolutely invaluable when it comes to learning to play against them. If I'm having trouble fighting Udyr, I bang out 20 or so games as the spirit guide, and when you play them you become aware of weaknesses that are much harder to see when playing against them. And who knows when the specific champ you are having problems with will pop up in the free rotation, so having them available for you to play at any time is so incredibly helpful.\n\nThe other thing:\n\n> I doesn't seem like anyone really dislikes the new rune system\n\nI think its too early to properly tell with this kind of thing.\nIt's certainly more entertaining and engaging in the short term, but so are the class reworks, and even riot has finally admitted that those weren't a great idea.\n\nIve seen plenty of imbalance with the rune system, for example, none of the sorcery runes go particularly well with champs like Azir or Karthus, yet go AMAZINGLY on other champs like Annie with the meteor rune. Azir doesn't particularly value speed so the MS one isn't ideal, he can't shield allies so the pet one isn't optimised, and he pokes from a distance far enough away that it gives the enemy more than enough time to avoid the meteor _(which travels from Azir himself rather than his attacks)_, meanwhile Annie has her stun up every few seconds, and if she uses her targeted nuke of a Q it stuns you for more than enough time for the meteor to hit you every single time, _(which is annoying seeming the whole counterplay of that rune is that it does lots of damage, but its a risk as it is dodge-able. It completely removes the risk for her, making her lane phase even more ruthless)_\n\nNot to mention something about the whole rune system has basically turned fighters into straight up assassins.\n\nSo unlike the old rune system, the new system strongly benefits some champs over others.\nSo while its great and exciting in the short term, It could be very problematic to balance long term _(I mean just remember how long it took them to finally get thunderlords to an acceptable spot, and that was just 1 mastery)_. \n\nBut I think its probably too early to tell what the true scope of the rune changes will yield yet.\n\nPlus I think everyone is too caught up on the BE problem to worry about runes just yet \n_(Free Shit > balance)_.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T12:46:53.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that we don't want to encourage one trick pony status, but I didn't mean to imply that not having more than a few champions was a fine experience, I only meant that owning ALL champions isn't the biggest deal. You get the status of saying you own all the champions, but I doubt the majority of players than own all play all, so you have a (easy) choice to make between champions and cosmetics, things that don't affect gameplay at all. The argument here was more against those claiming it is becoming pay to win. Owning every champion doesn't win you games.\n\nAs for counter picking, I agree that having a diverse roster is an advantage, but however much x champion might counter say, Darius inherently, if I've never played x champion before the Darius is going to win every time, so simply owning the champion isn't any help. I'd be better off playing y champion that I have 200 hours on even if Darius is a counter.\n\nHaving champions to pick that counter your mains counters (now that's a mouthful) is a good idea, but you should be expanding that slowly anyway. Start with getting a champion you want to main and practice with them. By the time you are proficient in them you'll have enough currency to buy a counter counter and practice with them and so on and so forth. Expanding too quickly just means you only half learn a champion before moving on to the next.\n\nFor your Udyr example, yes. The fastest way to learn how to play against a certain role/champion is to play some of that champion/role to learn the basics of how they work, think and function throughout the game. But remember that the free to play rotation still exists. It won't always cover what you want to learn straight away, but those that are dedicated enough to play something in order to learn how to verse it, surely are dedicated enough to play a few games with each champ they don't know on the ftp rotation as a substitute until they can afford to spend currency on that. \n\nI would think that getting champions you want to play is a priority over getting champs you want to know how to verse. And remember that for 1000 games or so we will be getting MORE currency and therefore more champions than we would in the old system. Again, that argument was against the pay to win argument more than anything else.\n___\nI still think the class reworks were necessary in some for, though I do agree that some of them missed the mark and they could have been done...more effectively. I believe the rune rework is just as necessary, and I think at least at this point it has been successful. There are hiccups of course, but this is preseason so it's expected. So far the feedback RE runes has been pretty dang positive, which is a great start, especially for changes as big as these.\n\nThis post was more about the issues people had with BE anyway which is why I only touched briefly on the rune discussion.\n\nRE champs like Azir or Karthus, the names can be a little misleading for sure, but mid laners aren't limited to the Sorcery tree at all, that's what's so great about the new system. As a mage support, I can find success with INSP, SORC, RES and DOM as primary, and any tree as secondary. \n\nThey all have different playstyles, but all have different perks to support each champion. Azir for example might be better off taking PREC as a primary tree for Lethal Tempo or Press the Attack, or INSP for Glacial Augment (assuming his soldiers attacks count as autos) or even Kleptomancy.\n\nI haven't had your experience with Fighters, but we are at different levels of play so that could well be a factor. I have found that AP burst champs are I think a little too strong at the moment, and I think base MR stats or MR items could use some buffs (or maybe some new MR items to give us more options).\n\nThe thing I like about the new rune system is that you can choose which part of a champion you want to emphasise. For example I've just started playing Eve, and I had a choice of pushing her burst damage directly, or pushing her move speed. In the end I pushed her Movespeed and took Celerity in SORC to convert some of that MS into damage. The result is a little less burst damage, but much more reliable ganks and chases/escapes.\n\nI think as far as balance goes they will tweak the runes if they are too strong across the board, but tweak individual champions if they are synergising with a particular rune too well. As you say though, really too soon to tell.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-09T22:05:07.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that the difference between owning a good chunk of champions and 'all' the champions isn't a big deal.\n\nAnd I 100% agree that youre better to pick a champ you're experienced with into a counter than a champion you've never played before, but if you have experience with that champ, then it's a boon for everyone on your team.\nAnd of course it isn't just about counter-picking, there is also the factor of what most benefits the team.  You could have 1000+ hours on Teemo top, but thats not going to help you at all when you've got no tanks or hard CC on your team.  Even as a mid laner _(someone you'd think should never have to pick tank)_ its amazing how often I am forced to pick up the slack. The number of times I've had to pick Galio into a full AD team, just so we have at least 1 tanky champ, is ridiculous....\n\nSo having a diverse pool of options is very important, _(provided of course, like you say, you actually have some experience with them)_.\n\nIm not a mathematically minded person, so I'm not sure what the situation is with getting more/less blue essence now.\nBut from what Ive seen, it doesn't seem like a pay-to-win situation, if anything it looks like you probably get more champs now _(albeit ones that you may not necessarily want)_. \n\nBut I will agree with what a lot of people say, that it feels very unsatisfying getting nothing but XP even for wins, and it must be really demotivating for people who cant play very much and so it takes them a week or more before the level up and actually see any rewards for their efforts. But again, I have all the champs and so I'm probably not the best person to make a comment on this and how it feels.\n\nThe solution is of course, that riot gives us some blue essence after each game _(even if it comes out of the cost of the level up bonus)_, and if it truly isn't a pay-to-win situation, then riot aren't losing any money from this change. and if they don't want to make this change because they will lose too much money, then perhaps the claims of pay-to-win aren't too far from the mark.\n\n_(although 'pay-to-win' is a term I think is rather inaccurate for this situation)_\n\n________\n\nOh of course, I know mid laners aren't limited to sorcery, but it does have some rather amazing perks in its ranks that are a shame to miss out on just because you cant make use of the keystones.\n\nand atm I am playing with all options for Azir, my most recent page for him is Domination (electrocution) with precision as a secondary. But I will try all options before I settle on one to keep.\n\nThe adaptive damage is a very clever way riot has done it, so that all trees are open to the vast majority of champions.\nI think the new runes will be a great system, but I do worry that the strong just get stronger.\n\nI agree with you about MR and AP burst champs, I mean even as Azir I can often 3-hit ADCs which shouldn't be a thing! and he's not even a bursty champ. I too think that more defensive MR items _(less of this Hexdrinker and edge of night crap, a defence item should be **defensive**)_ would be a big step in the right direction for build diversity in many champions, although I think a new armour/AP item would go a long way too, as Zhonays isnt for everyone, and atm it's the only build option mages have against AD teams.\n\nBut yea atm this is all speculation, it'll be a few weeks before we have a proper grip on the scope of the new runes and the changes they do and don't cause.\n\nThere could be a little more clarity regarding what counts for what runes.\nE.g. '3 Seperate attacks or abilities' Does Taliyah's Q count as 1 ability, or as 5? It launches 5 different projectiles each with a new instance of damage. But it is technically the same ability.\n\nStuff like that could be a little clearer in the tooltip imo.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-10T04:12:17.592+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make good points, and I think we've pretty much done the back and forth, but I will note on the pay to win bit.

As you say, levels don't mean anything if there isn't a payout when you get there. I think the point of uncapped levels is similar to the point of visible rank. It's a medium for those who don't play ranked (or who simply want more) to show their dedication to a game they love. Of course the result is that it doesn't mean much to casual players, or those like yourself who are limited by time, but you aren't the target audience for that particular aspect I don't think.\n\nI'm not to sure what the solution to player satisfaction is, but I don't think completely backtracking is easier. For a player like myself, earning IP after every game was almost completely meaningless. I never noticed it, and it never felt like a bonus, it was just there, whereas having a visual progression towards something is gratifying, even if it is just towards a relatively meaningless number.

You had to choose, do I get that Quint I desperately need or do I buy a new champion? Now there is only one gameplay related choice for your BE, the rest is cosmetic (mastery, chromas, ward skins etc) so those who desperately want to expand their champion pool, don't have to make such a hard choice, because it's not a toss up of effectiveness vs variety, it's only a toss up of variety or style points.\n\nBut you make good points.

I had the runes and multiple pages.  I made the choice a LONG time ago, that I wanted the options of customization and so purchased all the tier 3s.\n\nBut think of what you said \"I am not the target market because I am casual.\"  I didn't used to be.  Before I was pregnant I was very active and played a lot.  I brought friends to the game!   I helped increase their player base.  BUT, do you really think all \"new players\" are serious?  Most new players are casual until they get hooked.  So, with that logic, they NEED the casuals to try to captivate them and encourage them to stick around.  I have a college degree in business, that does NOT make me better or anything, I will only point out that ALL businesses HAVE to focus on the foot traffic that just walks in and buys nothing.  If you don't, they will never come back.  I have bought RP because I feel Riot deserved my money due to all they gave for free.  All the work they put into their product, I felt they deserved payment for a job well done.  \n\nThe problem is, they have built a community on a \"free model\" and they are trying to take the Netzero route and turn it around.  Netzero failed to do so and is out of business.  If you build off a free model and try to convert it, it typically fails.\n\nBut not focusing on all your customers including \"the casuals\" is the hugest mistake a company can make.  Marketing is valuable, marketing is important, how a product \"feels\" to the customer is far more important then reality.  THAT is why so many commercials tell you what to think of their product.  Shampoo doesn't need to foam, a foaming agent is added to give you the \"feel\" of clean.  Toothpaste doesn't \"need\" to tingle, they add to it to make it feel that way.\n\nIt's about how people feel about what they invest in, if not money, but time.  The new update feels clunky and unfriendly.  I am not a doom and gloomer, I am not going to sit here and say \"Riot go to hell, hope you fail!\" NO!  I want them to succeed, they have pushed eSports farther and faster then any company.  THAT is why I came to the forums, because they need real and honest feedback.  I am a business woman who works on deals that are from $100 to literally $500k new build outs.  I see doctors \"it's my industry\" fail, not due to poor skill, but poor business decisions.\n\nNot saying this update is a poor decision, I am saying, Riot needs to look at the dissatisfaction and get to the root of it.  They keep focusing the numbers and saying \"look there is no problem!\"  But that's not how I see it, myself, or on the forums.\n\nMy simple option :-D","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T13:05:15.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I said target market, I also said \"of that particular aspect\" referring tot he uncapped levelling, not anything else. For hardcore players having some kind of progression is valuable, otherwise all those who have all the champs they want have nothing to show for their dedication.\n\nI don't know what the new player experience is like, I was a new player back in S3 and haven't properly levelled a new account back then, but from what I've seen, the new player experience has improved dramatically. I didn't have anyone to teach me, and runes and masteries were terribly confusing and *expensive*. What hooked me was the gameplay, and these changes reduce a lot of the extraneous details and make it easier to get straight into that gameplay. It seems like a positive to me there. You don't want new players progressing too fast or they get overloaded with information.\n\nI don't believe they are in any way trying to convert their model. It's still completely free to play, and while it may not feel as satisfying to some, you are earning champions faster in this system, so if anything it's going in the opposite direction from pay to win, and still the only thing you can only get with real money is cosmetics.\n\nI don't think casuals are intentionally neglected with this change. Do I think their experience has suffered a bit? Perhaps, though I would have thought most of it would be alleviated by the first win bonus, but while I am not a hardcore player, I'm also not super casual, so I only have limited perspective on that experience. Clearly you feel it isn't satisfying enough, and that's something that should be addressed if many causal players feel that way. We can't expect Riot to please everyone though, and certainly not immediately.\n\nTo your shampoo example, if I recall correctly it was something they sort of stumbled on. The lathering agent was originally added to get even coverage, but it got to a point where not having it didn't feel right because perception had changed after the fact. Like how people weren't all that bothered by 'bad' breath until a certain company coined the term \"halitosis\" and called it an illness to sell floor cleaner as mouth wash. My point is, perception is important, but there isn't some magic formula to make people love your thing. Riot is taking the route of \"create something players want\" over \"make people like the thing we have even though it's not great\" and I respect that.\n\nAs far as business is concerned, I only did a year of it in high school, so even saying I know the basics is a bit of a stretch. I agree that feedback is very important, and Riot seems to be doing a good job of listening so far. I would simply advise to, yes give feedback, but to also keep an open mind while things settle down. There aren't all that many players on PBE, and live testing is a wholly different beast. This is the first time these changes have been exposed to the wider community, so there's always going to be hiccups, especially at this scale.\n\nIf anything, I'd say it's a good business choice in that case to have a preseason, where they get to live test these big changes while impacting players as little as possible. Overwatch has no preseason, and when they make big changes, ranked shifts so much and it's a giant mess (at least when I've played). So long as they work hard to get everything in an acceptable state before the new season starts, I'd say they've done a good job.\n\nI don't necessarily feel that Riot are trying to cover up player dissatisfaction with numbers, though I agree it sounds a bit that way, communication has always been a bit of a weak point of theirs as far as I'm concerned. I think they are genuinely listening, but it is just their way of justifying, of trying to say \"this is why we did what we did, but we hear you\".\n\nAt any rate, I appreciate you taking the effort to offer your perspective and feedback, especially on such a tight schedule. This is the kind of discussion I was hoping for, instead of a thoughtless blame game, so thanks!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Escpe Artst","date":"2017-11-10T09:50:29.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warwick URF skin is 150k BE?

It's a complete dice roll on what champions you get and if you get 3 low cost champions it's jack shit. BE/IP wasn't just used on champions as well. Because I only have 3 RUNE PAGES I have to make new ones EVERY SINGLE CHAMP SELECT and I HATE IT. So now I have to save up BE to buy more rune pages which with the new system is gonna force me to play a shit ton of games for something that really isn't that much worth it in the end. Getting to 6300 BE off the bat from 0 is going to take so many fucking levels I don't want to even think about it. Considering it takes a good 10 games to get 1 SINGLE LEVEL. \n\nIt's really just a shitty designed system, I don't want to earn in-game currency off milestone levels, it feels slow and boring. Look at the flood of posts that came through today and yesterday regarding how shit earning BE is and the amount of upvotes they got. It's quite obvious the majority of the playerbase fucking hates it so maybe Riot should listen and not continue to make their game worse, I'm about to stop playing if I have to force myself to use money to buy everything that exists in the store because I HAVE NO BE.\n\nIf I don't see any change to earning BE in the next week I'm out.\n\n\nOh and by the way my friend started playing a week before preseason started and when it hit he was level 14 and he didn't even have access to all the runes and rune tree's either. That is really great to hear because I'm fairly sure Riot said with the new runes YOU GET EVERYTHING FREE FROM LEVEL 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-10T09:16:13.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">We hear you, and it's something we're talking about internally.\n\n>We always knew shit was gonna be crazy during preseason, so right now we’re just reading all the feedback and taking note of the problems like this that folks are pointing out.
