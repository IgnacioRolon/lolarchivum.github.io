A friendly positive environment does little to breed toxicity. However there are a few technical problems I have with low priority queues. I&#039;ve never been in one myself, but of course if you queue with someone in one, you have to wait as well. Here&#039;s the problem with that.\r\n\r\nSee that picture ^. Functionality of my client is completely disabled. I can&#039;t message, I can&#039;t check profiles. AND since I&#039;m not marked as in queue, I received an invite in the corner there that I can&#039;t decline or even respond to without leaving queue and having to wait another 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nEven if this was intended as punishment for the person in the Low Priority Queue, it seems strange to punish the non leavers in queue with them. It&#039;s not a wonderful punishment either as it just serves to supply a frustration before even making it into queue. Waiting is boring. Not being able to do anything for the duration is just plain annoying, seems more counterproductive that anything.\r\n\r\nSo I guess...why is this a thing?","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-10-05T16:07:28.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"* Don't be friends with toxic players\n* Don't queue with them, make them do their low priority queues by his/her self (punishment). \n\n\n Personally I have  never been in low priority queues, as I never leave games and I am probably most likely definitely the most nice person in the Oceanic league community. With this all my friends are usually nice people so I don't witness any of your mishaps. :-( .\n\nRiot can confirm I'm the nicest player on this server. Don't believe? Just ask.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-05T17:53:49.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well certainly I don't encounter it often. The account belongs to a friend of a friend and he lent it to my friend to duo with me cause I was too low Div to duo with his main, but the friend of a friend still plays on it. He's a decent enough person out of game but he probs shouldn't play ranked...like ever :/. \n\nThat said the point of the post wasn't to point out that toxic players are toxic and should be avoided cause that's kind of a given. It just seems very strange to me that something like this exists when I believe it would only serve to make things worse. If the end game is to have a less toxic server well...toxicity is a very finnicky thing, and it just seems strange that something unnecessarily adding frustration to a game exists. How does restricting access to client features help at all?\n\nAnd I'm serious when I say no offence intended, but it's all well and good to proud of being a positive player but, you kind of come off as arrogant in your post.\n\nHonestly one of my biggest gripes is that you can encounter someone who is toxic as all hell, and who you know from their behaviour is consistently toxic, and you can report them more than once, and still see them. If it only takes three offences to get a 14 day ban, and a long time to erase those offences, then how come we still see these people so prevalent? Hell I'd settle for something saying \"hey, you've demonstrated your reports are reliable and fair and will be valued more highly in the future\" at this point. Cause right now it's hard not to agree with the toxics that run around telling you to report them cause they're never gonna get banned :/. The worst I've ever seen is the low priority queue and the occasional chat restriction (not even a ban, just the one where you only get a certain number of messages per game)\n\nBut tl;dr it just seems counterproductive to encouraging reform and positivity.","replies":[]}]}]}
