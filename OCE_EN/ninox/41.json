Pixel art is always pixellated, but a pixellated image or drawing is not always pixel art. Drawing/painting at a low resolution can be a good start, but it is not inherently pixel art.\n.\n\n>######**_~~EXAMPLES~~_**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OPyXfzi.png?noredirect vs https://i.imgur.com/zVq54DV.png?noredirect\n\nA good way to distinguish them if you are unsure is to take a step back.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/m9nQGhG.png?noredirect vs https://i.imgur.com/EkTeg6a.png?noredirect\n\nPixel art isn't art painted at a low resolution to make it pixellated, it's art created on the pixel level. More pixels (higher resolution) means more work to refine the effect, and pixel art very much follows the \"less is more\" policy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-07-18T20:29:32.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:32d}}\n{{summoner:4f}} \n{{item:30f07}} \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbofws}} \n\n> [{quoted}](name=<a>s</a>HeartVine,realm=OCE<a>s</a>,application-id=PlNcL9TL<a>s</a>,discussion-id=uu2Es3qN<a>s</a>,comment-id=0001<a>s</a>,timestamp=<a>s</a>2018-07-18T07:02:35.302+0000)\n>\n> \n\n\n**<a></a>**\n*<a></a>*\n~~<a></a>~~\n[asdas](http://asdasfa*<a></a>*a)\n* *<a></a>*\n1. *<a></a>*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-18T07:02:35.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey HeartVine, you have a total of ~~4193~~ 4194 posts on the Oceanic League of Legends Boards!\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iets ronds ofzo","date":"2018-07-18T07:01:29.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy moly that is so cool.
