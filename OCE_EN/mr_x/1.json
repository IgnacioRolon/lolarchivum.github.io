It wouldn't make very much sense to punish someone for feeding by restricting their chat, and you admitted yourself you were intentionally feeding.\n\nBe aware that the next punishment tier is a permanent ban on your account, so if you offend again you are very likely to lose your account entirely.","replies":[]}]}
