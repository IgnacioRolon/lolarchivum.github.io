Also allows us to go in and actually practice a champ/role knowing what we&#039;ll get before we start.\n\nI don&#039;t mind waiting, I&#039;d rather sit in queue longer and get the role I want rather than have a shorter queue and have to contend with calling and the arguments that follow.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-10-10T02:01:58.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If blind picks got removed the game wouldn't be fun anymore, it's chill and you can play a game so easily, if this happened for me and a lot of people it wouldn't be as chilled and laid back :(","replies":[{"poster":"Jenkss","date":"2016-10-10T12:43:05.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not too fussed about if they are blind or not, I just think the idea of having to call a lane and deal with the issues that comes from that are a turn off.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-10T03:25:19.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have the new champ select in Draft Pick Normals on other servers.\n\nI don't think it would come to blind pick until next season though. Its not a priority for Riot since most other servers have Draft Pick Normals which already have the new champ select.\n\nAnd before you ask, no; Riot already said multiple times this year that OCE is \"too small\" for Draft Normals.","replies":[]}]}
