I know that the game doesn&#039;t exist because I finished the game and had Defeat on my screen.\r\n\r\nDetails.\r\n1. When I press the connect button it says there is a network error. Brings up a yellow box and so on.\r\n2. When I log out and log back in the client attempts to reconnect me into the non existent game.\r\n3. When I play on a different account it works fine. No problems what-so-ever.\r\n4. The problem started when I didn&#039;t really care to see the stats I just pressed skip stats or whatever. Then it tried to reconnect me into the game.\r\n5. It&#039;s been about like 30 mins which isn&#039;t too bad but URF is almost gone D: (I was also playing URF)\r\n6. This is the first time I&#039;ve used a Forum so I&#039;m not too sure how to put up photos that could help.\r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[{"poster":"Zuko Alone","date":"2016-04-23T13:10:44.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm having the same problem!","replies":[{"poster":"Sly The Coon","date":"2016-04-24T00:50:01.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay I've got help from someone.\n\nGreetings Sly,\n\nThis is (Riot Helper), and I will be your support specialist for today. I am sorry that you are stuck at the reconnect screen. I know how annoying this issue can be because you pretty much cannot do anything when you're stuck here. I imagine that you'd want to play the game and have fun than getting this reconnect screen.\n\nIt sounds like you experienced what we refer to as a ghost game. This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will last a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. It often ends much earlier because the game server is simply backed up. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.\n\nAnother side effect of the Ghost game is a delay with receiving your Influence Points, Experience or League Points. Once the game \"clears\" the server, these values will be updated on your account accordingly.\n\nIf the issue persists or occurs frequently, it may indicate a problem with your connection. If this is the case, I would be more than happy to help you find the cause. If this was just a one-time occurrence, it was likely due to a delay in our server.\n\nI am sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\n(Riot Helper)\nPlayer Support Specialist \nPrefer Support\n\nEdit: I don't know if he wanted to mentioned so I edited his name out until I have confirmation he doesn't mind.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sly The Coon","date":"2016-04-23T14:24:23.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also submitted a ticket on https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us.\nIf I get any help I'll let you know.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2016-04-23T16:13:35.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Takes break from URF, comes back, \"in game\".
