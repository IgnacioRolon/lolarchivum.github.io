When she uses her W, instead of creating a gear-looking area of slow with the Ball, her W slams the ball down into the ground, making a dint in the earth, distributing the slowing effect that way. Her E removes shards of earth from the ground to protect her and her allies (they can still be seen inside the area of protection). Her ultimate (R), lifts the Ball up higher into the air, slamming it down to drag the enemies to the centre (pretty sure you know that it stuns all the enemies in the area of effect).\n\nI hope you guys take some fancy in this and give it a good go and hopefully give {{champion:61}} a skin that people will enjoy for a good amount of time.\nThanks for reading! :D","replies":[{"poster":"life for life ","date":"2015-02-26T13:45:59.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:61}}  is hard to play as bronze lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-24T11:54:42.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"one up from me","replies":[]}]}
