His dance is now just his base concept so it&#039;s a bit boring and bland and also there&#039;s no new sounds specific to his passive being taken down. I&#039;m a bit disappointed Rito, but if you can make it so, I will cherish it forever. The Blood Moon series is my favourite span of skins and I really wish for this idea to be made a reality.\r\n\r\nSincerely;\r\nMurasama","replies":[{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-13T13:09:48.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why some Blood Moon skin is fking Pink in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-13T02:28:15.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and has any bloodmoon had anything different but appearance?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-02-12T23:30:06.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they did that it would also cost more RP but I understand what you mean.","replies":[]}]}
