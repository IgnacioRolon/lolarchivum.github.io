I&#039;m not very good, but I enjoy collecting statistics about how I play and using them to understand a bit more about the game. Doesn&#039;t really make me any better, but that&#039;s because I&#039;m admittedly bad.)\n\nAnyway, with Worlds just around the corner I decided to start up a little stat tracking project, largely to work on my Excel, R Project (an econometrics analysis program) and various other skills that have been falling off a bit since I finished university. While obviously there would be a large team dedicated to stats collection for Worlds, which will undoubtedly result in some interesting statistics popping up during the game, the issue for me as an observer is that it&#039;s incredibly difficult to have access to all the fun statistics unless you collect them yourself and do all the breakdowns yourself as many fun and quirky pieces of information won&#039;t be published in an easy to access places and will eventually be forgotten. Sure, information about KDA ratios and GPM are easy to find, but what about random statistics like the precise W/L to date of a player using a certain champion who is behind on CS after 20 minutes? Listening to the 2014 rebroadcast and hearing odd stats like that very much made me think &quot;It would be fun to collect all this data and attempt to do that all so I can  understand all the background noise&quot;. \n\nSome statistics, like ward coverage distribution (wards placed, wards placed in certain sectors of the map, etc), item builds and times, or buffs taken are incredibly difficult to manually collect (during Worlds anyway) because from the looks of it, these would have to be collected while watching the matches, yet collecting and openly publishing them could lead to very interesting information for players, be it new or old, to breakdown so that they can understand what the commentators mean when they&#039;re saying that someone is slow to finish a Tri Force when to us, we&#039;d take twice as long. \n\nWith the difficulty of collecting some of these statistics in mind, and all of the rest I&#039;ve said, what are the kinds of weird statistics that you wish you could have while you&#039;re watching a match, be it your own matches, other peoples, casual scrims, ARAM or professional matches like Worlds? They don&#039;t have to be helpful statistics or statistics that mean anything at all, or they could be super serious things that keep you up at night. \n\nThey could range from a player&#039;s win rate when they buy and place a pink ward, to the winning rate of teams that undertake Level 1 jungle invasions.\n\nI&#039;d be interested to hear what you all think about the role of statistics in understanding (or not understanding) what is going on in-game. Some things might pop up that I&#039;ve looked over in my &quot;what statistics should I collect&quot; stage that would be quite easy for me to collect and comment on.\n\nFire away!\n\nMods: If you feel this would be more suited in a different part of the forum, do feel free to move it.","replies":[{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2015-10-01T14:17:43.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the most part, statistics in league don't play a massive role in understanding what is going on in-game. The basic ones shown on stream are enough for the casual viewers to get an idea of how the game is going etc. \n\nStatistics really come into play when teams, coaches, and specifically analysts are researching teams or trying to improve their own team. Knowing the GPM per player or where the jungler/support place their wards and at what times can really give an advantage to opposition teams. Does one team focus their gold on a specific player past a certain time or is it evenly spread out through the split? Does the support ward the same areas when winning and losing? Can they be caught out doing that? This type of data can really influence teams play styles and force them to change things up more than they would like. \n\nThey can also show if a team struggles vs a certain champion or team comp. A team I was working with last year lost about 75% of the games they played vs Maokai top lane, but they didn't consider him a threat in champ select.\n\nAnother point is that collecting statistics is good and all, but watching games and understanding these statistics is the most important part. I can tell you that Svenskeren (SK jungler) bought a sightstone 13/18 times last split, and 3/5 times he didn't, he upgraded his yellow trinket. So looking at that, you'd assume he had strong vision coverage, however he was 4th last for wards placed and wards cleared last split. Why? Well that's why you watch the games and find out the details that you can't simply get from looking at the statistics. \n\nJust so you know that I at least have some experience and not just making this up, I've been analyzing League games for probably 18 months now and been working with teams for just under a year. Just this year I've trialed with Fnatic and some NA challenger teams. \n\nIf you'd like to talk more about statistics, feel free to add me on League.","replies":[{"poster":"KLofM","date":"2015-10-01T15:20:37.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Does the support ward the same areas when winning and losing?

Not so much when it comes to improving my own game, but more so I can understand the larger picture of a match in general. Thing is, as far as I know, there isn't an easy way for someone like me without all the tools and resources that analysts have to track that kind of stuff. I'd love to have that kind of stuff though. I might be looking in the wrong places.\n\nI suppose that's what happens when your degree had a lot of statistical stuff in it.\n\n> They can also show if a team struggles vs a certain champion or team comp.

At the end of the day, having the statistics isn't worth anything if you don't know what kind of questions you need to be asking with them and you explain the importance of that well. That's part of the reason why I'm undertaking this because as part of all this, I want to be actively looking for things during the games. Things are going to pop up in the statistics over the next few days that are going to catch my attention I'm sure, and as a result, I'll be wanting to look for things in the matches that display certain factors (such as certain players being ahead in CS at 20 minutes when they start with a certain item but then being behind in other situations. Why does it happen? Let's take a look at the tape....) simply because it's got my curiousity and I must know! In order to look for something, it tends to know where to look and all that, which is what these statistics will ultimately be used for I would hope.\n\nAnd of course, because correlation does not equal causation. It's all very nice the numbers saying that something is definitely a thing, when actually if you watch the tape, something isn't a thing really, it's just that something else happened in that situation which contributed. Making assumptions in statistics is the biggest double edged sword ever. \n\n> If you'd like to talk more about statistics, feel free to add me on League.\n\nCheers, I will do later on after this FNC game and some sleep! It would be interesting to talk more in depth with someone who spends a lot of time on this.","replies":[]}]}]}
