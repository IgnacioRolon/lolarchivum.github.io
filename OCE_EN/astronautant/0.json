Last night and this morning I was itching to play some league as I haven&#039;t played a while so I was hoping to get back into it, I launch a game last night and I get through the champion select and everything, then transition into the game and there&#039;s a glitch where there is a blue circle and it&#039;s not running correctly, so I close it... but I can still hear the announcers and all the ingame sounds and stuff, even though the game isn&#039;t open... for some odd reason my computer detected the game as open when it was closed as I could hear everything, so when I tried to join in again so I could play, to my horror it said the game was already open... crrraaaap. I gave up and thought I&#039;d try again this morning, so I launch and I have to wait 20 minutes -_- not cool. So I get into a draft pick, and it&#039;s my turn to ban aaannd I cannot see any champions whatsoever (the champion screen in the middle is blank)... the time was ticking down and it would not allow me to ban a champion, so it kicked me and I had to wait AGAIN. This is sooooo frustrating I feel like giving up, the game literally keeps glitching and punishing me for its own glitches... I hate this so much!!","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-29T21:47:53.342+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully your intelligence lead you to:\n1.

Heck I still use Winamp 2.09 (1999) and Excel 97.
