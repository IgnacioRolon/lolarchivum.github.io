I have been doing a lot better tho. I had a bad match as trist (like I wasnt winning) and my team flamed me spamming PUSH TOWER YOUR ADC IS MID but the enemy mid had tp which she used to kill me when I did it. After I died doing what Akali told me to do, Akali started spamming in all chat \"report trist pls\" ok whatever I can take it. Top lane is calling me a c word at this point (three man) and says \"enjoy the ban\" when I said \"what for?\" he just said \"3 reports = ban\" my way of thinking was reporting me for nothing would end in nothing. \r\n\r\n\r\nNOPE. PERMABANNED. \r\n\r\nI am not arguing my history but it seems to me getting reported for no reason (with them soft admitting they had no reason in chat) SHOULDNT ACT AS THE FINAL TRIGGER FOR A BAN.\r\n\r\nHow is it fair that my final chance is ruined because they just didnt like that I didnt win lane? They literally admitted to abusing the report system in chat and I STILL got perma banned. Submitted a ticket and the staff just said this was not a mistake you have  a history (shortened as he did type more).\r\n\r\nGiven they literally admitted to abusing the report system (Whether or not what they said is accurate with the whole 3 reports = a ban they still admitted to at the very least TRYING to abuse the system, although it did work)  how is their report still taken seriously?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-11-01T07:50:08.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Without more information on the specific details of the situation (for example, type of ban, chat logs [if chat-related ban], etc) I can't really give you any information or advice that could help. The most I could recommend is that you ask for a second opinion in the ticket you submitted regarding the ban. It's not likely to change anything, but if they do discover something that was missed it may help your situation.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss the circumstances, you can feel free to provide additional information here, but we wont be able to make any changes to the punishment itself (that will still be up to the discretion of Riot and their representatives).\n\n> how is their report still taken seriously?\n\nI just wanted to address this specifically, though. The way the report system works is that the validity of reports is determined on a case-by-case basis, so the behaviour and overall validity of reports from the reporting player aren't taken into consideration; just whether that specific report is valid. The idea behind that is that *any* valid report should be actioned, regardless of where it comes from, while invalid reports are scrapped. Even though their intention might have been to abuse the system, the report must have been deemed valid, and subsequently actioned (just to note, it only takes 1 report to trigger a review, and additional reports *don't* increase chance of punishment).\n\nThe systems in place do have a certain margin of error (as all systems do), but appealing via Support should effectively address any false positives. It's extremely rare for false positives not to be effectively handled with an appeal to Support, and even when it happens the circumstances of such situations tend to be unusual.","replies":[{"poster":"Steaming Ice","date":"2019-11-01T09:10:47.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the response I learned a little bit and I will ask for a second opinion","replies":[]}]}]}
