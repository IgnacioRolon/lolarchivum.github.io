The only thing mages can build to counter them is a Seeker's Armguard into Zhonyas but because mana sustain is so important in lane you're going to have to rush a mana item before you can build Zhonyas, or you can rush Zhonyas and beg your jungler for a blue buff every time it's up, that being said, there are situations in which you'd choose a mage over an AD mid, mages have more CC than most of the meta AD mids, so if your team hasnt got a champion with pick-off CC or you want to round out your team comp's damage then youd probably want a mage, mages scale better late game but your typical AD mid wins mid-game.","replies":[]}]}
