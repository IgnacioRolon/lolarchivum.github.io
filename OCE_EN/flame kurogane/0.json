Disarmed. In weakness.\nTalon was in no form to fight. Nor was he in form to rule.\nHis gaze followed the movements of numerous golden longswords, with each blade seemingly to mock his rule as the dragon king.\n\n&ldquo;The almighty dragon king&hellip;..defeated in his own throne room, in front of the members of his assembled court and unable to find peace in his realm.&rdquo;\n\nIrelia stood over him, her silk white dress with their golden outlines glowed as the sun of the new day rose above them. Her blades flew around her and settled themselves behind her back, bobbing vertically to be in sync with her breathing.\nTalon has never been defeated so easily. For every battle he led and for every duel he had accepted, this was the fight that outstood them all. Rage filled his veins, his azure eyes glowed in fury. With some forceful diplomacy, Talon leapt at the demigoddess but the action was to be only followed with a forsaking silence.\n\n***\n\nThe village that Irelia resided in was having an enormous festival to mark the beginning of a new period of time. A new month.\n\n_&ldquo;Such a confining space. You, dear demigoddess, are a witch!&rdquo;_\n\nThe dragon king&rsquo;s roars were simply dampened out by the magic within Irelia&rsquo;s blades that kept him sealed. As Irelia took foot into the festivities, her blades fused together into a broad blade that she would take comfort on so her feet wouldn&rsquo;t tire out.\n\n&ldquo;Freedom has a demanding rhythm. And your freedom shall be granted once you find a new purpose in the mortal realm.&rdquo; said the demigoddess as she sailed passed each of the blooming colours of the booths.\nIrelia flew through to the village&rsquo;s central plaza where a familiar face was performing traditional sword dances.\n\nFiora thrust her rapier through the air, leaving phantoms of her weapon that positioned themselves according to her body motions. The phantoms stabbed into the ground as she levitated above the platform of the stage.\nThe small crowd that was surrounding the stage let out their applause as they stare in awe of the performance. Fiora hovered down back onto the stage and bowed as the phantoms were recalled back into her rapier.\n\n***\n\n\nFiora sat down at a nearby bench and unsheathed her weapon.\n&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve imagined him being here today, and yet, I wasn&rsquo;t in the crowd during my performance.&rdquo; said the young duelist as she began to polish off her rapier.\n&ldquo;Maybe it was because your technique seemed forced and not fluid as they were meant to be.&rdquo; said the voice that was attempting to point out the significant faults in her dance.\n\nFiora lifted her head up to find Irelia standing over her, with proud glowing eyes.\n&ldquo;But overall, your dance had a certain emotion that even I can admit is difficult to portray.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Thanks, Ireli- I mean, I appreciate it, my goddess.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No need for the formalities. We are friends, are we not?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;My apologies, my god- I mean, I&rsquo;m thankful for the kind words, Irelia.&rdquo;\n\nThe both of them cracked out laughing, but the laughter died down after a few seconds.\n\n&ldquo;Where have you been, Irelia? Do I not know of something that has happened?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Do you remember the dragon king that was threatening the realms of the gods and the mortals?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;You challenged the dragon king, correct? Were you successful in the duel?&rdquo;\n\nIrelia let her blades float through the air and settle behind her back.\n&ldquo;His recklessness led to him being sealed with my blades. I hope he can find peace and a new purpose in this realm.&rdquo;\n\n_&ldquo;I demand that you set me free immediately!&rdquo;_\nThe blades glowed brightly as Talon attempted to free himself from the magic seal but was yet to find success in doing so.\n\nFiora was intrigued by the glow and peaked over Irelia&rsquo;s shoulder to observe the blades.\n&ldquo;Such amazing power...I&rsquo;m glad that he has been sealed away.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;\n\nFiora let out a sigh and went back to polishing her rapier. Irelia sat down beside her and tried to make eye contact with her.\n\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Fiora? You&rsquo;re not acting the way I remember.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Yi for a while now. I hope he hasn&rsquo;t done anything that placed him in danger.&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Did he say anything before he left? Any note hinting where he could be?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;He said something about being worthy of the fabled sword of jade.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Sword of jade?!&rdquo;\n\nIrelia jumped onto her feet. Her face was filled with an enormous amount of fear.\n\n&ldquo;Irelia? Irelia, what&rsquo;s wrong?!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Knowing Yi, he is a persistent swordsman that would stop at nothing to get what he wants.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;And what is it that you&rsquo;re trying to say?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Janna is in extreme danger.&rdquo;\n\n***\n\nJanna took one step onto the water, the koi that were swimming around suddenly disappeared into the depths as a vibration rippled through the water.\nWith the unsheathed jade sword in hand, she isolated her focus to the sounds of the winds.\n\nNumerous blades pierced through the air, each of them landed in front of Janna&rsquo;s feet before they sank to the bottom of the lake. \n\n&ldquo;Are you the protector of the sword of jade? And is that the sword that I seek, gripped in your hand?&rdquo;\n\nA figure with a sleek golden blade was standing on the water, the emotions on his face showed that he was desperate for something.\n\n&ldquo;If you seek the sword&rsquo;s power to grant immortality then you are not welcome here.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I am the one who is worthy of the sword of jade. And none shall prevent me from seeking it.&rdquo;\n\nJanna summoned a cyan whirlwind behind her and reached her hand out.\n\n&ldquo;I shall repeat myself once more, if you seek immortality to be granted upon you then you are not welcome here!&rdquo;\n\nAs the whirlwind shot itself towards the figure, he cloaked himself in a cyan aura that rippled the water beneath him.\n&ldquo;Speed of thought!&rdquo;\n\nThe figure rushed towards Janna, slicing through the whirlwind with ease. His blade was one of the deadliest the Janna has ever seen.\n\n&ldquo;One step ahead!&rdquo;\n\nFiora lept between the two and parried away the figure&rsquo;s blade. Fiora kept her breathing and her body steady as she pointed her rapier at the man she once loved, Yi.\n\n&ldquo;You dare to interfere, Fiora?&rdquo; yelled Yi as he threw himself up into the air and down to the surface of the lake, creating more distance between them.\n\n&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t you, Yi! You never had the worst of intentions!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I dedicated my life to the purity and the art of combat. I am worthy of the sword of jade!&rdquo;\n\nYi&rsquo;s sword cloaked itself in a magic aura. The blade let out a roar as energy coursed through it.\n\n&ldquo;Wuju style!&rdquo;\n\nYi shot himself towards the two. His victory was almost certain. Almost...\n\n&ldquo;The spirit calls!&rdquo;\n\n...Before his body halted its movement by chains that wrapped around his limbs and he was caged by a vanguard of blades.\n\n&ldquo;Janna! Fiora! Are you two alright?&rdquo;\n\nIrelia stood behind Yi, she was exhausted after having to save the both of them after Fiora&rsquo;s attempt to save Janna from Yi.\n\n&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; Yi struggled to free himself from the chains and the vanguard. &ldquo;You do not know what I seek! What I am worthy of!&rdquo;\n\nJanna stood closer, in front of Yi.\n&ldquo;The sword of jade is not worthy of anyone. You are blinded by your desires.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No! I refuse to be defeated! Not after the fact that I&rsquo;m so close!&rdquo;\n\nThe depths of the lake beneath Yi began to become shallower. To his realisation, he was being returned to the mortal realm.\n\n&ldquo;No! You can&rsquo;t do this! Fiora!&rdquo; Yi was barely able to reach his hand out. &ldquo;We were fellow pupils at that school, don&rsquo;t you remember?!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Yi. But the sword of jade must never be obtained by anyone&rdquo;\n\nFiora stabbed her rapier into the lake, instantaneously sending Yi back to the mortal realm.\nTears ran down from Fiora cheeks and into the lake, rippling through the water as the koi began to swim up from the depths.\n\nIrelia turned and began to take her leave.\n&ldquo;Janna, look after Fiora for me. She needs someone to watch out for her.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Will do. Farewell, Irelia.&rdquo;\n\nAs Irelia started strolling back to the waterfall she came out of, Talon&rsquo;s voice erupted from her blades.\n\n_&ldquo;You could&rsquo;ve killed him. Why did you let him go?&rdquo;_\nHis voice sounded a lot calmer than it was before.\n\n&ldquo;Talon&hellip;.there&rsquo;s one thing you should know about peace.&rdquo;\n\nIrelia took a deep breath in and closed her eyes.\n\n&ldquo;One&rsquo;s peace does not come from one&rsquo;s death, but from the sacrifices one makes.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
