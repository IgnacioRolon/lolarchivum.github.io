I feel it is unfair for the players that play at that time to suffer so you can push a que that is obviously failing.\r\n\r\nYou already enforce auto-fill once every 3 games and que times are hitting 2-10 mins leading up to 3am so why the need to shut off the que?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-12-15T18:35:13.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To test and maintain queue health.\n[Both solo and flex queues are down daily for 3 hours each. ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/aAfOmVeI-oce-preseason-ranked-queue-testing-updated-dec-1st)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Axeus","date":"2016-12-15T21:24:58.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"remove flex queue altogether thanks.","replies":[]}]}
