(and this is coming from a player who has done this before in Soccer and Goalkeeping, and you can immediately feel it, though it was partially also having to sub in for the guy who had to be taken to hospital.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Palmyy","date":"2018-01-25T05:17:44.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, probably one of the least toxic things ive heard out of this community so far(besides watching some streams and pro stuff), i will probably take the advice and steer away from ranked(sure it is a bit like other games ive played but i have experience in those) for a couple of months.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T05:51:59.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Negativity bias is hard to avoid, especially in ranked. It's a rather volatile time in the season, and that means tilt is that much more common, which means everyone is less reliable in their play. It generates a lot of frustration, and while toxicity is never ok, it tends to be more prevalent in ranked in general since the stakes are higher, but also particularly at the very start and very end of the season, which makes reporting that much more important.\n\nSome people can just brush it off, but if it's getting to you, tilting you and making you play worse, then it's just not worth the time. Better to just improve elsewhere for a while and come back later better off for it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T04:46:33.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chat tends to get punished fairly quickly, so if someone is being an ass then reporting them is the best way to go. If they're consistently being toxic they *will* face punishment for it, though you may never be made aware of it. There is a notification that tells you when your report has contributed to a punishment, but it's very limited and rather unreliable. \n\nThat said, reports are very important. Players do not get punished if they are not reported, so even if you have muted someone, please remember to report negative behaviour. A false report (e.g you think someone is intent feeding but they were just real bad) doesn't hurt you in any way, so if you even suspect someone of negative behaviour, report them just for the review.\n\nThe start of season also tends to be a bit of a shitshow with regard to Player Behaviour. I'm not entirely sure why, I'm sure there are many contributing factors, but if it's bothering you or tilting you, I'd definitely recommenced waiting a month or two before diving into ranked, especially if you are inexperienced.\n\nIn the meantime, ranked isn't going anywhere, practice your main champs/roles in normals, expand your game knowledge. There's a lot you can do to improve without actually playing ranked.","replies":[]}]}
