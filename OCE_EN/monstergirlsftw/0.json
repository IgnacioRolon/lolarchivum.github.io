We are looking for 3 additional players; a dedicated MID, TOP and ADC who has the desire to learn, function as a team, willingness to listen to instructions if given and if not the best, willingness and dedication to improve fundamentals of their role. It would be preferable if the team would be willing to discuss team composition, match-ups, play styles and overall gameplay after a match.\n\nAs serious as all the above is, we do wish to have fun while we&#039;re playing. We are open to anyone ~~who isn&#039;t bad~~ with the above attitudes and hopefully, as a team, grow and progressively win more and more games (if we don&#039;t to begin with). We do have the dream of eventually becoming a competitive scene team that can participate in tournaments, even if they are only small ones. Play days are open to discussion (We aren&#039;t slave drivers) but we would like to regularly schedule Un-ranked Practice games on most days and are aiming for one ranked team game on set days (At least 3-4 / week). \n\n_**Current Composition** : _\n1.
