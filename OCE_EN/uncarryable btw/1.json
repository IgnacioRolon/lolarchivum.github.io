Every time he Qs he hits every enemy on the map, this includes neutral monsters, minions and champions. In some of the videos it also seems like it breaks the cd as well such that it's 2~ instead of 8, but in others the cd seems to be normal.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-17T08:01:36.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im pretty sure this hasnt hit OCE yet, this we havent got the patch NA has","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-17T14:34:17.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We get the patches before NA so we are actually on the same patch (I think OCE might actually be the first region to get them just because timezones) , it's a pretty massive thing but isn't that prevalent which is likely why they haven't straight up disabled Xerath. I believe there has been one or two cases on OCE but obviously they get less visibility than those on the bigger servers.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-18T02:51:22.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i must be thinking of the pbe's, either way, its only on the pbe servers then","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-18T07:11:21.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is true that the PBE servers are in NA and obviously are on a later patch for testing, but the exploit has been reported on EU servers and on the live NA server as well.
