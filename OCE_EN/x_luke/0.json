Long story short, I didn&#039;t wan the game to go through with two players having not swapped because that&#039;s bad for everyone in the game right? So I dodged the lobby but because it was glitched, the game still went through. However, I stayed disconnected so my team would be able to &quot;remake&quot; and I would be the only one to lose lp even though I really don&#039;t think I should, THEN HOWEVER\r\n\r\nImmediately after, I got placed onto a low priority queue for &quot;leaving&quot; too many games ????\r\n\r\nLike I just took a bullet for my teammates so I would be the only one to lose lp which I was okay with but then it puts me on low priority q as well for something I couldn&#039;t avoid? ie. the awesome client that rito has made somehow glitched out ! it&#039;s never glitched out on me before !!!! so it was very surprising !! i tried to do my best so my teammates wouldn&#039;t be affected but then it just punished me even more !
