Knowing deep down we want to be balls deep in a ranked game.\r\nSERIOUSLY I have spent money on this game, time and become a huge fan, how does that not give me the right to play ranked whenever I want.\r\nOCE is the only server that gets ranked taken away.\r\n\r\nI have created this discussion because I know there are others out there that have also thought about this.\r\nI am hoping if we get enough people backing and adding to this discussion we might get Riots' attention.\r\nTheir assumptions that Aussies don't stay up past midnight need to be dealt with.\r\nADD TO THIS DISCUSSION and YOUR SAY and lets take back late nights!","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-06T09:36:37.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of biology, people tend to make more mistakes between those hours due to circadian rhythms and exhaustion and other such factors.

What about for those of us that work late, haven't drank a thing and just want to unwind with some games?\nCan I also say that I am  100% percent sure that most gaming occurs of a night time and early hours of the morning, and I'm talking world class players. Even the city gaming internet cafes are staying open until 6:00am if not 24/7. There are people out there that actually want to spend their entire weekend evenings rather than partying.","replies":[]}]}]}
