Knowing deep down we want to be balls deep in a ranked game.\r\nSERIOUSLY I have spent money on this game, time and become a huge fan, how does that not give me the right to play ranked whenever I want.\r\nOCE is the only server that gets ranked taken away and I want access.\r\n\r\nI have created this discussion because I know there are others out there that have also thought about this.\r\nI want to see just how many people want this changed.\r\nI am hoping if we get enough people backing and adding to this discussion we might get Riots' attention.\r\nTheir assumptions that Aussies don't stay up past midnight need to be dealt with.","replies":[{"poster":"MouseDestruction","date":"2014-12-07T10:03:53.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think its so much about waiting times as it is someone could get to like challenger finding an easy team to beat and killing them all night and doing same the next night. But i see alot of people DO play normals, if people stopped being so negative maybe people would be more likely to play ranked. Personally i gave up on normals and generally log off when ranked stops (because %%%% mirror lanes/blind picking lane/calling my position as fast as i can and instalocking). But yeah fact remains not enough people to make health MATCHES (not so much the waiting time). Still i wish they would do something about OCE it's a bit dumb having aram as the only way to mix it up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T05:12:39.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The server pop is too low at those times to support ranked, that is why it is turned off.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Lasher","date":"2014-12-06T05:17:50.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suspected as much, but what does it matter really?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T06:48:15.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It matters for the same reason that Treeline isn't up permanently.\nIf queues are expanded into these times then all queues suffer an unhealthy lack of population in them.\n\nThe only way to fix this is to get more people playing on the OCE server. But there is a bit of a problem with this. Many people who are playing from the OCE region refuse to transfer from NA or EU because they hear we lack content that they already have access to on these servers. I'd say probably half the OCE region that plays LoL doesn't actually play on the OCE server.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle, hear OCE doesn't have Treeline etc, don't transfer to OCE, OCE doesn't have enough population because of this so it doesn't turn on queues permanently.","replies":[{"poster":"Lady Lasher","date":"2014-12-06T09:28:44.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice! Great post :) really informative and cool perspective.\nRealistically I dont want to be encouraging people to stay up all through the night gaming because it isnt healthy really.\nHowever everyone has different lives and schedules, i think it should be accessible to all who want to play at the time.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-06T09:37:25.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it would be nice if everything was accessible at all times, but it's just not feasible.\n\nI just wish the people who complain about this regularly would finally understand what I have said here and go out and get their friends to start playing on OCE which would get them their wishes.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
