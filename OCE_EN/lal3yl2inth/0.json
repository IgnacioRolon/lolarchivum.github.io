I try to improve myself and now i think i did quite good as a bronze myself. \n\nIt took me a while from bronze 4 to bronze 1 promo with an increasing winning rates but now i think i hit a wall.\nI had 10 lost streak, about 6 games (i do bad in some game which i admit it) i had a feeder in my team and a troll and starting to think that it is impossible to get out of here without being a smurf.\n\nPlease give me some advice to improve my individual skill since relying on a team is hopeless unless you are quite lucky to get a good teammate.\n\nI&#039;m going to try harder and giving it my last go to get to silver in a couple month if not i&#039;m going to quit this game. It is unenjoyable and not fun to lose a game because of feeders and troll.\n\nIt really pissed me every time i dominated my lane but the rest of my team throw the game, it is so unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"KingJamesMike","date":"2016-12-06T00:21:23.250+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"the reason smurfs can win 90% of the time in bronze elo is because they not only win their lanes but also make their teammates better. This is done through communication, understanding of minion waves, back timings, objective control, keeping timers, champion skill/matchups. There is nothing anyone can really say specifically to improve someone instantly. You need to go into your games with the mindset of improving because losing in bronze has very little to do with teammates as you are in a game with 4 bronze teammates and the enemy has 5. You are the deciding factor in most of your own games. Playing often with a champion you are comfortable with so as to focus on the aspects mentioned earlier in your games with an active in game mind (because league is similar to chess) will be the best way to improve in comparison to playing on autopilot.","replies":[{"poster":"Lal3yl2inTH","date":"2016-12-06T01:49:37.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kinda understand what you say.... maybe i got a close-minded about my team. i'll try to work on a global presence rather than focus on my lane alone. \n\nWhat else should i do if my team throw and feed? \nI can keep myself alive and play carefully but i'm not that good to carry the whole team like killing 2-3 guys alone unless i'm so fed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-12-06T02:00:52.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't try to carry your team, try to carry yourself. If you are winning your lane, extend your winning presence, if you are mid, reach out and control the river, make your opponent feel in danger leaving their jungle. Counter gank, make your opponents pay for every play they attempt to make. If you get your tower down quickly, rotate your lanes around so that you can get started on the next one. In every situation think about the objective and control it.","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Swish","date":"2016-12-06T02:57:52.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the best advice I think anyone can give. Know that if you're doing well in most of the games (we all have bad ones) that you'll eventually climb out of it.\n\nIt looks from your match history as if you're lane jumping a lot. Stick to 1-3 characters in the same lane, stick to that role and go from there. I'm only silver 2 so hardly a pro, but you'll be amazed at what the consistency you bring to each game can do for your team <3","replies":[{"poster":"Lal3yl2inTH","date":"2016-12-11T12:19:04.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, i'm best as a zyra support but relying too much on adc is annoying since you never know when you'll get a bad one. So i tried many champions in different lanes with the thinking of \"It doesn't matter anymore if i lose\".\n\nNow i got back to my main Teemo and starting to play him srsly to develop a strategy to go against his counter. i will stick to him for now since my Win-Lose ratio is very positive.\n\nThank you for everyone's advice.\n\nOne thing i really wanna add to this is STOP wasting time flaming a teammate. \nBe calm and take cs can turnaround the game in many cases.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lal3yl2inTH","date":"2016-12-11T12:08:10.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have like 9 win and 1 lose (filled in as a jungle which i'm suck at) in the past 10 games with teemo top and mid.
