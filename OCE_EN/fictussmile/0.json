My ingame ping is very weird. It slowly comes down to 30 then suddenly go high op tu 170-190. Sometimes it makes me dc from the game, especially when I am in team combat. I tried to turn off my modem and turn it on after 1 min. I turn off my anti-virus and fire wall. None of those method would help me to solve the problem. I called my network provider which is Optus this morning and they confirmed that my connection is perfectly fine. So can you guys suggest me any other method I can try to fix this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"SquidelySpooch","date":"2015-06-19T11:11:31.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi guys, \n\nIve been having the exact same issue. All symptoms; It started about 3 weeks ago (was running smooth on 30 ping for like 2 years now), intermittent spikes every few seconds to 180-200 ping and  I am also with Optus (possibly unrelated). I have been getting notable performance boost in non peak hours, midnight etc. \nI would really appreciate any help as playing atm with a 1-2 second delay is pretty much unplayable. (Try not feeding when playing against a bursty assassin like Zed, LB and the like.)\nIll also run the log diagnostics and send it off.  My OS is Windows7 Horse.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-20T04:01:03.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Windows7 Horse sounds like an amazing fork of Windows 7, though I am unfortunately unfamiliar with it.\n\nPresuming that it uses the same base configuration tools as the standard, have you tried flushing your DNS, renewing your IP and resetting all devices on your network?\n\nP.S.
