Continuing, they said: “Why does it seem like you people at Riot are against the forums SO heavily? I can understand a personal opinion, but it's gotten so far past that.\n\nWhat was the point of making a GD section here, instead of just fixing up the real GD?\"\n\n**Pendragon** offered a lengthy response: “We want to build a better forum experience for players, because you deserve it. When we launched League of Legends we picked up some off-the-shelf forum software because we had no idea how big the forums and LoL were going to get. I think it was certainly the right choice at the time but over the long run there have been some pretty significant limitations that stem from that choice.\n\n* It’s difficult to integrate into the rest of the League of Legends experience. Remember how long we had those question mark icons? We've been plagued with account authentication issues, etc.\n\n* It’s extremely challenging to technically scale. It wasn't built to handle tens of thousands of concurrent readers and tens of thousands of daily posts. Forums going down whenever NA has stability issues, etc.\n\n* It’s extremely challenging to extend. Doing seemingly easy things like adding search that “every other forum has” would involve months of hacky engineering work and is still not incredibly reliable. The time-cost of any given feature that we’re building on this technology is a fraction of what the same work would have been on the classic forums.\n\n* It wasn't built to handle moderation at scale. The toolset that allows large teams of 24x7 moderators to effectively collaborate just really didn't exist in the software. And it shouldn't have because we were using it in a way that it wasn't intended to be used.\n\nBuilding our own Boards platform - while a significant effort – goes a long way towards making the future better. It allows us to build forward-looking features and functionality, and lets us experiment to find the best types of community experiences.\n\nSome dedicated members of the GD community aren't fans of nested comments or “hot” sorting, and we've heard you loud and clear - that’s why we've built a traditional “GD” style experience on the foundation of the Boards experience. While there will be a transition and things might look a little different, this unlocks our ability to improve GD and the rest of the community ecosystem.”","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-11-27T07:08:58.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ignore him.
