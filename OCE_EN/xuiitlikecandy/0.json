I could still hear game sounds but the window itself with the game went missing. Alt+tabbing did nothing, checking processes didn't help one bit so I was stuck in limbo for a while. Eventually I left the game and restarted my client. Another dialogue box popped up and stated some files were missing or corrupt and needed to be fixed. Of course, I let it do it's thing and reconnected to the game with no other hitches. Ultimately it resulted in a loss. Got the leaverbuster message which I had to agree to. \r\n\r\nI'm not annoyed with the leaverbuster warning, or even the fact that files went missing, I'm annoyed at the fact that the loss was still a loss. I just want to have the loss prevented for my team mates. This was something completely out of their and my control and it simply isn't fair on them.\r\n\r\nI know this request is a bit much, but I'd be grateful for it. \r\n\r\nI'd also like to know how to prevent this from happening in the future. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: Error message popped up mid game, couldn't find active game window, had to leave (in order to close missing window), repaired client, reconnected, lost game, no loss prevented.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:31:09.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a %%%%%, though.

I'm fine with the odd bugsplat here and there, but something like this needs to be prevented. I've seen a few other people complaining about this issue too, so I'm not the only person that's experienced this.\n\nAside from this, I have no complaints.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jacki","date":"2015-01-22T15:19:03.229+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lost prevented can't be put on for a single game, it's only activated by riot, *Server wide* when there's a major issue.","replies":[{"poster":"XuiitLikeCandy","date":"2015-01-26T08:29:50.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, but asking wouldn't have hurt.
