Even one would be enough, it doesn't even need much range or damage. \n \nIt has been mention before that Shen didn't go as well as they wanted (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/state-season-coming-mid-season) with his sword, but I have had an amazing idea to possibly fix him by giving him a low damage ranged move for better game play with his sword instead. \nSo, after Shen does his E I thought he could move his sword in a certain direction of his choice. The way I imagine it is that he gets a ring around him, and there is a skill shot line coming from his sword current location. \n(as shown here) http://newshene.weebly.com/ You then choose in the circle around you where you want it to go. Maybe what ever the sword goes through is dealt some damage. \nThough it wouldn't be for the moves, it would be for the amazing combo potential with other aspects of his build.\n\nThis would make for some awesome game play, you can be chasing someone, dash to the side and through your sword in front of them the Q to slow them. You could also through you sword to an ally and shield them.\n\nJust to revise, Shen would still have his dash. He would then for 2 seconds after using the dash be able to throw his sword from it current place, maybe around 500 range, knocking back and damaging enemies hit. this wouldn't be for the damage, it would mainly be used to combine with his W and Q.\nCompare it to Darius pull, it isn't used to deal damage, it is used to combo with his other moves. this is what i am trying to achieve with this.\n\nI feel that this change will make Shen sword such a more fun tool to use, and I dream of the chance that a rioter sees this and it i thought for even a slight second that they will add this to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-24T02:30:58.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At first I didn't like the idea because of the knock back and damage. I just don't think Shen needs either of those to be successful in his current state. Even if the numbers were good, Shen would probably need to lose power elsewhere. Imagine being flash taunted and then knocked back into your team - that's probably a little much. \n\nThen I thought about the change if it were to purely reposition the sword. I can imagine a scenario where you could throw Spirit's refuge towards a fleeing ally to save them from that last auto. Maybe you could also reposition the sword in front of a fleeing opponent so you can apply Twilight Assault slow. While I really like the first scenario I'm not sure Riot would like the second. \n\nThe ability to make cool plays to save your team is interesting as it would require a bit more thought when it comes to positioning the sword for Spirit's Refuge. You could potentially save someone when you're just off screen too. That might push Shen too far into Orianna's territory though, and potentially be overkill considering the purpose of his ult.  \n\nSecond, giving Shen the ability to chase even if he misses his taunt is not ideal. You could attempt to land the taunt and then reposition the sword to apply the slow too. If you _do_ land the taunt and then the slow I think that would make Shen too sticky and that would mean the slow would have to be tuned. \n\nIt has potential but it would require a lot of work to get just right. Considering Shen is in a good place right now I'm not sure Riot would think it's worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-09-24T22:16:38.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nijiiyo,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=AWAsARXO,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-09-24T02:30:58.872+0000)\n>\n> At first I didn&#x27;t like the idea because of the knock back and damage.

His ult also scales with ability power, like how can you snowball the game or scale really well into late games, or at least fix his dam energy issue.  Maybe his ULT could summon his W onto his Allie instantly, so ADC don&#x27;t CRIT his entire shield away.\n\nThe thing is tho Riot doesnt want shen to solo carry really. Shen is all about supporting team mates, initiating kinda, that whole deal. Riot does not like it when or if champs can have 4k+ hp and the ability to solo kill carries/more than 1 person at a time and still be impossible to kill. They obliterated cinderhulk when it gave champions the ability to do just that. In most cases, if you want to deal damage, your gonna have to sacrifice other stats for it (health and resistances) which is why they botch some of shens scalings.\n\nin regards to OP, I do agree he needs a way of moving the sword other than just pulling it straight to himself, a bit more interactivity would be cool, but your suggestion just seems like way too much of a power creep.","replies":[{"poster":"Loughlin","date":"2016-09-29T09:41:11.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, could you read my comment bellow real quick? i removed the knock-up, and said the damage would be real low. this wouldn't be a new form of CC, it would be to COMBO with his Q and W to help his teammates more often. but thanks for commenting!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Loughlin","date":"2016-09-24T02:46:17.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see what you are saying, and I think I agree. The knock back is unnecessarily and I am going to remove it. Yeah, the plays would be amazing, and i agree its just the trouble of equalising his kit to make it work. Riot have actually said they don't feel as if he is maybe going to be changed again, which made me make this infact, but they said they wouldn't do it soon as other champs need a change more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-24T00:43:17.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">a little annoying that he has absolutely no ranged abilities \n\nI'm sorry but I'm going to have to stop there, Shen is a **melee tank** and his kit is designed around that.

But, Darius kinda does. His short range hook is ranged. And I'm not just trying to give him range, I'm also making his sword have more use.\n\nI know he is a melee tank, but this wouldn't be a damage ability it would be for the combo possibilities.\n\nAnd yes, it would be a little strong, and he would require a Nerf in other aspects of his kit but it would be made up for with the combo possibilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-09-29T10:26:41.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my honest opinion, Shen doesn't really need ranged abilities to function well. I think putting this over complicate the effects of a single ability or in other words overload his ability when Shen has a lot of defensive options in his kit especially given that his global presence is already really strong.\n\nI don't main Shen but I do have a fair amount of experience in playing him, making plays with him, and playing safe against various lanes including ranged ones.\n\nWhile his lacking the ranged capabilities of his former self he is still a rather potent duelist against champions who can not lock you down due to his Q dealing % health damage and shielding him mitigating a fair amount of damage.

For Shen to work BOT he must be agressive, but when behind he can not.
