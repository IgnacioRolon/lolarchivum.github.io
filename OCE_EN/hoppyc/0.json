By this i mean people in champion select  who lock in champions that are gimmicky and have little intention of succeeding with their chosen champion. At the time of writing this i am on ban for dodging a game with a lux adc and jinx top.  These mindsets are of those  people who clearly do not belong in ranked. I am aware that these players will always be present and there is little riot can do to stop them. In these scenarios i have the option of gambling and hoping that  these players can pull off their role or i can dodge the game and suffer a 5  lp loss. I am fine with this. It discourages frequent dodges but allows people to stop themselves from getting into games with toxic or trolling players. In this scenario the dodger is forced to wait 5 minutes until rejoining que and the people in the previous game return to Que immediately and are placed into another game within the next 20 seconds. There are  o real losers in this system and it is effective at stopping people from losing mass amounts of lp from games that they wish they could have avoided. However in the game i just received a 30 minute game suspension. This in my opinion is completely unjustifiable. I am being punished for an action where nobody loses. No one apart from myself suffers any repercussions because i dodged a game. I propose that riot make it so that it is a simple 3 lp loss and 5 minute suspension.\r\nThis is the only way to deal with champ select troll and you know it. Dodging a game creates no losers. It is the little thin gs ike thsi that make the game more bearable. Please consider what I have said here.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-05T10:33:49.300+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is quoted from a very similar post;\n> Try to look at this from Riot's perspective.\n\n> Say there was no punishment for dodging games. The incentive would be to dodge games untill you have;\n\n>1.  Your main champion and role.\n2. The most OP champions on your team.\n3. The weakest champions possible on the enemy team.\n\n> Basically no one would get into game ever.\n\nTherefore there must be a punishment. Also to further clarify, playing Jinx top or Lux ADC is not a fair reason to dodge queue. **Every player has the right and freedom to be as creative as they want with their roles, strategies and champions.** If Riot reported this or allowed people do dodge \"strange\" picks with no punishment we would not see any creative diversity in the meta.\n\nA few seasons ago, Morgana support would have been considered a \"troll pick\", and ADC Lee Sin was standard along with jungle Alistar.\n\nNow if someone picks a unpopular champion and then proceeds to harass the team and/or feed, then it's different. But if you're playing the game fairly, there should be nothing stopping you from playing whatever you want.","replies":[{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-05T22:13:50.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you had read what i said you will see that the punishment of 5lp and 5 min suspension is sufficient to stop people dodging for the reasons you quoted. I agree that every player has the right to be as creative as they want with their roles however they have the responsibility that this creative innovation does not come at the detriment of the other players in the game. Playing picks like this with little intention of succeeding is not creative innovation. I used the term \"mindset\" within my argument. What this means is any creative innovation has to be trialed and thoroughly tested in a variety of scenarios in order for them to work. Ranked is a game mode where players seek to climb through the most efficient method possible, this is called the meta. Luckily riot has a game mode for this it is called normal's.\nI fear you have not grasped what I am trying to say. To summaries it I would say gradual punishment for dodging games in which the members of your lobby have little intention of winning and do not seek to create an enjoyable game is unjustifiable in the sense that dodging is the only effective way to avoid troll and the act of dodging has the most minimal repercussions on other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-06T00:10:34.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**How does Riot know that you are dodging to avoid uncommitted and possibly toxic players? \nHow do you know that you are dodging a uncommitted or toxic player, and not an off-meta user?**\n\nIn both cases the opposite ends of the party assume the worst. You dodge because you fear a troll, and Riot bans because they fear you are stifling creativity. There is no way around this because mid-sets are not detectable. \n\nBest thing to do is handle the situation as well as possible. Who knows, maybe you might get a Korean Challenger smurf who is going Karma jungle for the lolz and carries the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-10-06T08:32:18.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is, you can op.gg your team and if they are terrible at their roles you can just go disco nunu and force them to dodge or enter into an already lost game, this is the next level of gaining elo and trolling and it works fabulously :D","replies":[{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-07T10:52:05.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure how effective that is.... ?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-07T10:51:55.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agrees there is no way too determine that there was a just reason for a dodge. But if you consistently dodge for lesser reasons then the lp loss in itself builds up and becomes punishment enough.

You might think no one's lost anything, but being queue dodged simply because someone doesn't like the pick you make is an insult to the fact champion select gives you a choice in the first place. And queue times won't be 20 seconds unless they're willing to be put in a bad MMR match.\n\nSecondly, not everyone disagrees with Lux ADC and Jinx top, there is nothing wrong with doing that if they don't do it specifically to troll, and that's more often than you'd expect. ADCs going top are slowly becoming more common and Lux specifically has the CC and range to work as an ADC.\n\nThere are plenty more ways to deal with trolls in champ select, an automated system is being created and has been tested, it's slowly being integrated because obviously test conditions tend to be very different from the entire game's setting.\n\nThe point of draft champ select is to utilise extremely niche picks like MF, Yorick and top ADCs, by allowing whoever to queue dodge for a small loss only champs you see in LCS will ever get played. And trust me, a game with two darius, two vaynes, two Threshes, two Zeds and two Elises will bore everyone and drag on for a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-07T10:59:08.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reply I made to another comment touches on some of the points you are making regarding the freedom too choose innovative picks.  I don't want to repeat myself. I did look into new ranked draft mode you mentioned! Can not wait for it's implementation.  I believe you have exaggerated the loss of being in a dodged lobby. As mentioned in the prior post I have no problem with innovative picks as long as they are thoroughly tested and proven. \n(Sorry I am not as coherent in this response. I am just about too go to bed and wanted to make sure I tackled the points you made in each paragraph)","replies":[]}]}]}
