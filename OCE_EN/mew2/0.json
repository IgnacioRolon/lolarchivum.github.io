Confused, I made a ticket asking what the reason for the ban was and was advised I had used Bots (3rd party programs). Knowing that this is completely false I requested it was further investigated only for them to say that no mistake was made.. The issue I have is I know a mistake was made, as I have never downloaded Bots for any of my games, including League of Legends, so there was  no possible way a background program could even have triggered a false positive on their detection system. \n\nI digged around the forums and found a whole bunch of threads where people had the same issue from the same wave of bans and blamed Curse Client, while I did have this downloaded, I never really used it and you would think 9 months later they could easily tell if Curse was to blame for this ban considering it was the cause of so many others back then, so I don&#039;t think it was that. \n\nBasically, I just need some advice on how else to proceed. I normally wouldn&#039;t care and just play on one of the other accounts but I know an error has been made and I can&#039;t just let them take my account and provide an excuse I know is false. Just too stubborn when I know I&#039;m right I think. Especially when the Riot staff who viewed the threads I mentioned earlier reply with \n&gt; \"poking further, however, it looks like this took place on under some rogue access on the account from another state. We&#039;ve forced reset the password on your account as a precaution, but you should be able to log in again once you complete it as the suspension has been lifted as a one-time exception. Apologies for missing this the first time.\"\nwhich just makes me think that maybe I&#039;m just one of the people they missed on the first time of investigating it.. \n\nThanks for any help. {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Hacks4Dayz","date":"2017-12-30T03:44:32.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mew2,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=0a6M2xWE,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-12-30T03:37:18.202+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for any help. {{summoner:31}}\n\nRiot never over turns ban like this. You have to show that you weren't. Get over it and make a new account this time dont use hacks.\n\nand you wont look like you are HACKS4DAYS :P","replies":[{"poster":"Mew2","date":"2017-12-30T03:54:37.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems a bit stupid, bit disappointed that Riot in almost 2018 is still at it with the same old shit I seen 5 years ago, how much money a game need to make before their support system is actually effective... How would I show them I weren't? I requested they watched my games to prove everything was player controlled but I just got \"Oh seems you have no other concerns, I'm closing the ticket now\" as a response. Like, what? I get it would be annoying to watch games but not as annoying as losing your account and the excuse they give you being complete bs.

Basically unless it was a sibling or friend who you shared account info or a pc or something with, you can probably get your account back.\n\nThat said, the time does complicate things. Assuming you didn't have anything illicit, then presumably the account was compromised. I would recommend first changing the password for the account, then respond to the ticket and mention you believe compromise may have been involved and ask for account ownership verification.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
