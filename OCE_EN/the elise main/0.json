This is an alt account, made only to play Elise. I instantly purchased Elise and Death Blossom Elise, and started the climb.\r\n\r\nAfter hitting level 5, however, I opened my free hextech box, and received Blood Moon Elise.\r\n\r\nIs the free vox guaranteed to give a skin for a champ you own? I know the regular ones don&#039;t, so am I just lucky? Is this the Elise prophecy???","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-03T09:44:22.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes the promotional chests always contain a skin for a champ you own, thats why you hold those chests on alt accounts until have the champ you want a skin for, then open it.\n\nThere is the lv 3 chest with garen and ashe, then the promotional chest which gives a taste, and in order to have a taste you need to get a skin you can redeem.
