And if they do work _**how**_ do they work, is it +1 bullet per 25%? If so then going past 25% would also be useless as 45.5% is the most rune can give and rounding also wouldn&#039;t work too well so if it did work to go over 25% would mean that the runes would need to be buffed so they could reach 50% total which I don&#039;t ever see happening. they could also just increase the damage of the 8/10 bullets (depending if you had an IE or not) by that amount or a diminished amount and if that&#039;s the case couldn&#039;t that be quite strong in some cases if he fires 8/10 bullets with +45% damage?\r\nJust a curious thought I had when brainstorming a new 100% crit build (not for Graves, just in general) for the new season without going over 100%, which BTW if you know how to do it while also having room for boots + a sustain item (so I don&#039;t have to rely on the 15% heal from masteries) without 10% crit chance rune do tell as I cant for the life of me figure it out as I want to include PD, IE, Triforce and essence reaver witch is 90% crit and 40% cdr.","replies":[{"poster":"DostThouEvenThug","date":"2015-11-13T00:10:47.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was looking up to see if anyone else had tried it as I was loading into a custom to try it for myself. As of right now, the 45.52% crit damage from runes adds 2 bullets. So right now, at around 390 or so, I was hitting 0 armor targets for around 2k if I hit with all bullets, which is including building Infinity Edge. It is hitting with 12 bullets from what I could tell. It was hard to tell how many were being shot because the streams dissipate so quickly, but I stood still shooting dragon, and I am very certain that I was shooting 12 with Infinity Edge and the crit damage runes. I'm not sure if it shoots 12 bullets all of the time, but it was at least shooting it often. It may be less than all the time because the percent is only 45.51%.\n\nAs far as going for a 100% crit build, I'd go Rapid Firecannon, Statikk Shiv, Infinity Edge, and Essence Reaver. That's 100% and we can't build PD atm on live, so it's hard to tell which would be better. I'm running BT for the Lifesteal atm as well. That's only 30% cdr though, so that doesn't get the cap, but it sure does get you going!","replies":[{"poster":"matej1919","date":"2015-11-16T19:12:01.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you could see how much your e cooldown is lovered its 0.5 s per bullet pls reply how much i cant afford crit dmg runes id like to","replies":[]}]}]}
