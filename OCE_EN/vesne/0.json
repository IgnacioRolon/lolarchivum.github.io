I found it very easy in Starcraft II to see what I was doing wrong, practice, improve, climb the ladder and got to master league eventually. But in LoL I&#039;m finding it much harder to see what I&#039;m doing less efficiently than someone who&#039;s beating me in lane. I have been watching my own replays.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been comfortably working on:\r\nWarding and map awareness\r\nMana/Health awareness\r\nPositioning\r\nKiting\r\nOther mechanics (e.g. whose ult will win in situations like vi vs azir, etc)\r\nStat comparison of myself and opponents before poke/engages\r\nObjective prioritisation\r\nEconomy (CS)\r\nNumerous Runes/Masteries\r\nFlexibility in item builds to compensate for opponents builds/comp\r\nLearning plenty of champions and all roles, but sticking with 1-2 roles and 3-5 champs to master\r\nPatience and not chasing kills and being baited\r\n\r\nIs there anything important missing? How have you climbed ladders and what did you work on? Anything stories or advice would be appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-18T04:57:56.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"And you have missed the one main mechanic of the game.\n\nLearning to trade.\n\nYou need to learn to trade optimally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-18T05:42:27.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most important things to know in LoL.\n\nEVERY champions abilities and powerspikes.\n\nThis leads into knowing lots of things like: knowing how to trade in lane in certain matchups, knowing when you have kill pressure and when the enemy does.\n\nMost importantly, knowing how to NOT feed in a losing matchup.

You don't need to master but whenever they're on free rotation try them out in norms.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-12-18T04:57:43.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When to go in and man mode, evcen if it will cost you a death. Say you are behind, but the enemy is chasing down your fed  player, you have flash up and the enemy caitlyn ults your fed team mate, but your health is low too and its eithert youll die or he will die and give shutdown gold and lose your team momentum. you need to know when your sacrifice is worht it, tis easy for some, eg support for adc, but others say adc of fed mid, or vice versa, saving someone elses life at the cost of your own.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-18T07:02:56.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could try to kill the enemy caitlynn and go 1 for 1. She can't move when she ults and you have flash, so rather than go 'man mode' go 'beast mode' and at the very least interupt her ult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-12-18T06:06:31.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your fine.
