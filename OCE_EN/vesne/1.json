It&#039;s no lag, my ping doesn&#039;t spike at all and I can see movement of creeps/champions and receive damage in real-time like normal. I thought it was my mouse and keyboard because they&#039;re so old, but in a game today a Kalista on the other team was having the same issue (obviously a huge issue for her passive in particular). I thought it would be worth posting to see how many people are affected by this and if it is something that needs to be addressed. It&#039;s extremely frustrating when you&#039;re about to escape, or just farming, or tower diving, and then you freeze and die in a stupid way and then get flamed.","replies":[{"poster":"Simple Sam","date":"2016-04-09T06:17:26.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having the same problem since a few days ago.
