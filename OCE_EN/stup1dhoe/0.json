Alipo was thrown into the junkyard because Sona's family could not afford to keep him. When Alipo was 2 years old, he found a guitar in the junkyard. His childhood was this guitar. He would play it everywhere he goes, until one day, he was performing in the streets until a woman named Jane Buvelle saw him doing his best song. She asked where he lived and decided to adopt him.  He was then bought to a palace where Sona lived. Buvelle however told that Alipo could not talk to Sona, as most of the times she would be practising her ethwal. She also told Sona that she could not talk to him. Because when Sona is not practising, Alipo would be practising. The day when Sona decided to join the league of legends was the day when Alipo found out that his Guitar could heal those around him and hurt those around him. Sona left the palace so the only people left are Buvelle and Alipo. One day, a group of noxian bandits invaded the palace. They want nothing more then valuble treasure and wanted nothing more then that. However, on the way to Alipo's room, they pushed his guitar off his table. The guitar was broked into 2 pieces. As the guitar fell on the floor, Alipo's head started to hurt. He then collapsed on the floor. Buvelle was shocked, not only did Alipo fainted but her palaced was robbed. She saw the guitar that Alipo had was in 2 pieces, which meant that someone must have came in to her palace. She ran do the nearest carpenter, but they said that they were not able to fix the guitar, Buvelle thought that this is the end of Alipo, as he was no longer breathing. She placed the guitar into Alipo's hand and began to cry on his bed. The guitar suddenly started mending its self! Alipo's chest was glowing bright yellow! The guitar then was fixed, but left a crack scar on the front. Alipo also woke up, but there was a scar on the right side of his face. Buvelle was very excited and told Alipo that he must go and find Sona.

That passive is probably the most broken thing I've seen in League of Legends. Even with a long cooldown, I think those Summoner Spell buffs are huge. Probably might need to tune those down for balance :P","replies":[{"poster":"Stup1dHoe","date":"2016-06-21T06:31:04.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The passive is now changed.
