Today I recently played a game and right after I finished playing it, I got a pop up that read quote &quot; This account has been permanently suspended. Please check the email address associated with your League Of Legends account for additional details.&quot; I pressed OK expecting to be logged out of the client, but it just took me back to the honor page. Weird thing was that this kept happening to the rest of my games, but I never got logged out of client. I don&#039;t want to log out of client or else it might ban my account legitimately. Is there any reason to why this is happening? I tried logging into my smurf accounts prior to playing, and I haven&#039;t been chat restricted or toxic in awhile. help me asap","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-07-31T02:22:00.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I brought this up with some of the Rioters and there's no punishment on the account (the one you're using now) from what they can see, so it certainly seems you're in the clear. While there are people who prank others using the \"/me\" command (which will just make chat messages appear a bit differently), the way you've worded the description indicates that's not the case. If you have a screenshot or video, that would help identify if there's a problem or if it's some player-accessible feature you're not aware of (such as the \"/me\" command).","replies":[]}]}
