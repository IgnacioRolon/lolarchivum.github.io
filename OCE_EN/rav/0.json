Back last year before the time of this server when I was a little gril in france, my best friend said to me \"rek them pantheon scrubs on the new OCE server for me\" on her deathbed...\r\n\r\nShe died due to the complex infection known as elo-hell. As she could not afford the vaccine (known as boosting) because her mother didn't let her use the family credit card. She died a pleb, a bronze pleb. A bronze pleb that failed her silver promos because of some sick minded player abusing such a cheap ass champ in bronze known as Pantheon...\r\n\r\nFrom then on, I made my way to Ethiopia, where I could finally sign up to play on this fine \"pls giv us tribunal!!1!!!\" server. To extinguish the hopes of all Pantheon players and mains. To slow them down so hard that their 355 superior base movement speed dipped below even Nautilus's movement speed. To lifesteal their 4 second ranged harass that makes you want to chew on a cheese grater. To scale into late game so hard that Pantheon becomes nothing greater than a stun machine.\r\n\r\nHere I am, in preseason. Where Pantheon can solo dragon with not only his unholy shield that blocks clocks thrown by Zilean but his amazingly absurd high base attack speed. Granting his team a silly 8% extra AD and AP in less than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nI have shouted towards valhalla to send me the finest Pantheon nerfs that will butcher his sustain and dragon slaying in the jungle and limit his duelling potential in the top lane. \r\n\r\nIn my dream last night, a wizard going by the name of Morello whispered into my ear:\r\n\r\n\"Pantheon: base attack speed nerfed from .679 to .625, changes are not always certain on the PBE and may not make it to the Live client.\"\r\n\r\ntl;dr my prayers have been answered.","replies":[{"poster":"Helmet Bro","date":"2014-12-07T03:48:42.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"10/10\n8/8\nI cri\n\nWould nerf again {{summoner:11}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Donald Trumpet","date":"2015-01-31T00:08:16.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Panth is trash made by trash for trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"skillzorddragonb","date":"2015-01-23T09:41:26.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT WONT LET ME VOTE YES TWICE WTF!? there is option to vote yes twice but it only let me vote once WTF IS THIS?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-12T11:48:41.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope everyone will forgive me for this, but I unfortunately got Pantheon in ARAM and was forced to play him by Riot themselves.
