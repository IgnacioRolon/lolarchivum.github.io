When it&#039;s area of where to place it appears, the cursor is blue and my left click cannot place it down. Just going to let you know, I&#039;ve tried deleting my input in the config of LOL, but once I restart the client, it remains the same way as before. Apparently, there is supposed to be a .ini on the input file but mine doesn&#039;t seem to have it. Please help, I cannot stand the amount of wards I&#039;ve misplaced during the month.\r\n\r\nFigaro","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-15T06:09:33.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n>I've tried deleting my input in the config of LOL, but once I restart the client, it remains the same way as before.\n\nYour settings are saved to the server nowadays, to reset them you need to do the following.\n\n1. Log into your game client.\n2. Delete the games config folder, including persistedsettings.json and input.ini\n3. Launch a custom game, confirm settings are set to defaults.\n4. Exit the game, your settings will then sync to the server.\n\n>Apparently, there is supposed to be a .ini on the input file but mine doesn't seem to have it.\n\nWindows hides file extensions by default, this is nothing to be concerned about the file is still the same.\nThere's a handy guide [here](http://www.howtohaven.com/system/show-file-extensions-in-windows-explorer.shtml) on how to enable hidden file extensions.","replies":[{"poster":"Figaro","date":"2016-02-15T06:31:11.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just tried your tactic, I deleted my config then opened up my client. I created a custom game but when I tried to quickcast my q (as fiora), my left click couldn't activate it. it shows the indicator and the cursor but my left click doesn't make it work. Btw, my mouse (Logitech Hyperion Fury)  is a year old but still functional.

When you smartcast a ward just pressing the button will place it wherever your cursor is hovering. I'm not sure if having indicators on affects this. If you want to actually click your mouse to place the ward, you'll have to take smartcast off your wards.","replies":[{"poster":"Figaro","date":"2016-02-15T06:33:32.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello there,\nQuickcasting is something I'm extremely used to ever since S3.
