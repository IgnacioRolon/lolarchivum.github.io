Though, instead of making the argument that Riot should reduce the amount of icons rewarded to players, instead propose they could allow us to pick several at a time, as such changing the Summoner Icon into a Summoner Crest (or any other name, that part isn't important).\n\nThe idea is that players may choose 4 icons, which would be laid out 2x2. I've thought about it for a while and haven't really come across many issues that may arise seeing as there are plenty of icons, even for new players, to make up the 4 with ease. The main issue would be the size, but I'm sure that's an easy fix. As for issues with profile banners for the ultimate skins, you could always just let us choose our banner, instead of it syncing with the icon (something which I didn't understand why it wasn't implemented from the start).\n\nFor example: {{champion:103}} {{item:3157}} *Edit: These icons would be the layout of the Summoner Icons\n..................... {{summoner:14}} {{champion:1}} \n\nLet me know your thoughts. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-02T03:19:00.804+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not something I would be interested in. \nThe only icon I would ever change to is the tree. \nI like the classics.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-02T21:31:45.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Skyprus,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yquoUbOu,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-03-02T03:19:00.804+0000)\n>\n> Not something I would be interested in. \n> The only icon I would ever change to is the tree. \n> I like the classics.\n\nyeah sometimes its good just to go with the stock","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-01T23:07:34.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one up from me\n\nedit: would flash and ability icons also be included in the crest selection or just summoner icons?","replies":[{"poster":"Usagi Overrun","date":"2015-03-01T23:14:31.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose that could be an extra thing.
