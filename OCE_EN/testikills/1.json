Time and time again my mate and I will do the old, nothing to really play lets give league of legends a crack again, his highest rank back in the day was Rank 14 challenger and my highest was plat 2 or something and time and time again we do a few games and unistall with the immense level of bullshit you encounter.\r\n\r\nWhy do we not gain x amount of LP based our character grades we get after game? This system does a fairly decent job of telling how well or bad you did in a game, if I carry hard in my role and get a A or S but lose, why do I still lose 15LP like the feeder on our team? Same as if we have a carry on the team who gets an S+ but I only get a B why do I deserve the same about of LP? The system doesn't make sense at all, we had a guy leave our game 3 mins in the other week, he came back at 14mins, we won at about 20 so that means he also gets a win...WHY? And if we lost because of this guy all 4 of us who played fantastic would have lost LP because of 1 joker that the game has picked up via leaver buster, why not make it a null game and we lose 0LP?\r\n\r\nThe same goes for having no voice chat, it's 2020 every single game for the past 5 years now has voice chat, why doesn't this game? This is a game that requires quick reaction times and on the fly calls, imagine playing jungle or support and being able to actually talk to your team and set things up in the heat of the moment. The same old excuse gets banged on with this one as well that people can get abused... every other game has a voice mute button, a opt out of voice chat option, voice volume metres and means to report people. If every other game can offer this option then I find it impossible to believe this game can't.\r\n\r\nTLDR; I don't understand how this game can have a honest ranked system that punishs players who did well in games and rewards players that trolled or left a match and can't have a basic voice chat system in place like every other competitive game on the planet... please link me any pro team that has won a world cup with no voice comms and just used pings... I'll wait. At least with LP gained/lose based a bit more off how you actually played your role for each match and if you had reported players/ leavers when these scenarios happen (and they happen alot) you could at least have the mentallity of - oh well at least I won't be losing lp because of x player.","replies":[{"poster":"aZileanWays2Die","date":"2020-01-20T16:33:12.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"over the last 3 seasons I've been slowly climbing starting in low silver in S8 and reaching G1 in S9.  Currently in S10 I am placed on S4 which I find is a frustrating place to climb as a lot of games you are rolling dice on whether or not your going to be on the team that is using players from high Bronze.  \n\nMy personal opinion on your critic is that Maybe on a loss base you could lose a max and a min amount of LP based on your MMR and the LP lost would be scale depending on how much you affected the game.  This way to 'Feeders' would lose more LP than the guy who manages to play most of the game from behind.\n\nI admit that the more you look at how Riot would determine the impactful player from the hindrance players.  One way to look at it is do you take less LP from the player who went 0/3 compared to the player who went 2/11;  or do you determine how many objectives the player participated in whether it be tower damage, Baron/Drag damage, Maybe even player damage.   It would require a solid balance of all these factors to determine the loss of LP between players.\n\nIdeally, you would have all the stats DMG to players, towers, drag, and baron, amount healed to allies/self, gold income (all that goodness).  Then see the ratio for the K/D/A and CS amount and cross compare it with other players of the same MMR &amp; champ (the same way your S+ champ mastery is determined).  Then rank the players from most impactful to least impactful and calculate the LP loss from that.\n\nThere will always be problems with any method but this would alleviate the struggle of these hot spots of cross rank matchmaking.  The main difficulty is you don't want to encourage players to play off meta to alleviate loss penalties as you do when trying to get an S on a champ currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"C9 Snocky","date":"2020-01-16T13:05:35.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Why do we not gain x amount of LP based our character grades we get after game?\"\n\nThis is a fairly easy one to answer, the grades given at the end of the game are pretty easy to inflate / dont reflect your actual contribution to the game.\n\nIf a player manages to waste the jungles time top lane for example, which gives the rest of the map some freedom, there is no reward and infact only damages the stats of the top laner. If a player stops cs'ing to share a lead with the rest of the team, they lose cs/m which is a huge contributor to grades. If a support dies to save the carry, they now have an extra death which degrades their score.\n\n\nThe grades you are thinking of are the foundation of MMR, if you play well and lose / have an afk and lose, your MMR goes down less than if you were the feeder.\n\nIt's been addressed before but on the topic of AFK/Inter/Bad Players/Toxic Players, you're just playing the odds. It works out that (provided you play consistently well) you will win 60% of games. There's a decently accurate stat that says, 40% of games you win regardless of how you play, 40% you lose. The remaining 20% is based on your skill, which supports the 60% winrate.","replies":[]}]}
