I know to poke them as they go in to last hit my cs all that kind of stuff but i would still like to be a lot better. If anyone is a boss adc and wants to give a hand i would love to hear it i am currently gold 1 and would like to hit plat this season.

If you have a terrible support, you have three or four options.\n\nFirst, you all caps rage at them and let them know how bad they are and that bronze 5's calling and wants their support back (not recommended)\n\nSecondly, you farm as much as you can SAFELY, and if you get a slight health advantage in your lane via poke/jesus' blessings, you take the initiative and pick the fight. Your support should do enough to make it a good trade.\n\nThirdly, you farm as much as you can SAFELY, and ask and sit patiently for jungler assistance. Even if it's just to show face to let you catch back up in cs is helpful.\n\nAnd lastly, just *survive*. Don't go for silly farm, and just sustain through the laning phase. Buy a health pot or two. In fact, you could even hedge your bets in champion select and pick a late game marksman, so regardless of your support's early game skills, the onus is shifted on you to reach the 40 minute mark.\n\nxoxo goonbag","replies":[]}]}
