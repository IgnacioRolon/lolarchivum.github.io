Meeps would be replaced with Poro elves and instead of the gold dust throughout his spells, it would be some kind of winter/snow effect. I think that this will make more summoners choose bard for games hence making him a more common pick in champion select, so people wont dodge as often.\nHope to see what the rest of you think about this skin!\nAlso, Please up-vote if you like the skin idea!\n{{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}}{{champion:432{{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}}\nWe may post further discussions in the future with any other future skin ideas!\nPlease be on the lookout for them if you liked this idea!\nP.S.

So people wont be as mad/annoyed if there are a lot of Bards playing.\nB) We never said having a skin doesn't make you a troll, but the main people who are going to get the skin are going to play him more often and might find out his true potential in team fights.\nC) Yes, but if your team has good communication, there shouldn't be many mess ups in the game solely because of the Bard.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-22T13:32:05.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) it's like you don't have the understanding of why bard is a troll pick, Bard can singlehandedly lose a game for his team, a skin doesn't change this fact, it just makes the fact even more blatant because he gets picked more.\nB) What makes you think trolls aren't planning on buying skins?\nC) Good communication or not bard can fuck up and lose a game, i've been in a 5 man and had a bard singlehandedly fuck us over, and that was with full voice comms.\nD) did you really downvote my posts because i pointed out how your making no sense?","replies":[{"poster":"snivyzorua","date":"2015-09-23T06:31:57.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, trolls do buy skins but the majority of people who put their hard earned money into a champion are planning on playing him seriously,  this  _won't_ eliminate trolls but it **will** hopefully bring new publicity to a not commonly played champion.
