I have been playing since season 1 and I am looking for a ranked 5&#039;s team that i can join to try and earn the ranked rewards and hopefully meet some new friends along the way. My playstyle for mid lane is a bit wishy washy because sometimes I really like playing teamfighting champions like azir and other times I like playing heavy cc like annie and if I&#039;m not playing either of those styles then I would be playing split pushing champs like zed. When i ad carry i normally play jinx, kalista or ashe. I am always on skype and if you are interested then add Naranjak in league. thanks","replies":[]}
