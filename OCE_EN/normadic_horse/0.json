This can sometimes lead to them getting matched with lower level players.\n\nYou also have to take into consideration that these players might be duo with a friend that is lower level, or rank, and that could result in the match.\n\nDue to our small oceanic server population, it isn't going to be changing anytime soon. Just learn to accept it and eventually you will bring yourself up to their level.","replies":[]}]}
