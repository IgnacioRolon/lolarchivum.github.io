But since the 6.1 update, I have been unable to play due to a critical error in that after I have selected my champ and start loading into the game I black screen and it never fixes itself. I have done some tests and confirmed that the mac does not shut down at this time, and that everything else runs as normal. During this black screen however, I cannot tab out, close the application, or do anything on any other windows that I may have open. Can someone please tell me ways of fixing this problem, I would like to try Jhin out and cannot try him if I cant play.","replies":[]}
