I have had RP Purchasing issues and disconnects, which have been easy to solve, but it seems that Riot Support will always give the same reply when it is a ticket submitted because of a suspension.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that no matter what I write, whether it  be any reasonable explanation as to how I got the ban, conveying my thoughts and order of events, Riot Support will not change the outcome of any given suspension. For example, this account received a permanent ban over &quot;toxicity&quot; which to me doesn&#039;t seem deserved, neither do I deserve the out-of-touch responses I always receive from the team, trained to always be as vague and ignorant as possible.\r\n\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/hvt7ku\r\n\r\nThat was the response from a Support member, where I would now like to break down each point, which was probably auto-generated by some reply bot.\r\n\r\n&quot;You got permanently suspended due to excessive toxicity.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is probably referring to the one times I was toxic in-game, which to me was nothing &quot;excessive&quot;, but rather me defending myself from someone blaming me for many things, being toxic their self while I was initially just playing the game. My toxicity would be seen as nothing different of the standard player that plays this game. Maybe the bot that generated this reply had responded to the fact, that the Zed and probably one other blind player in my game had ticked the &quot;Hate Speech&quot; box and two others, probably &quot;Negative Attitude&quot; and &quot;Intentionally Feeding&quot; to max out on 3 report categories. Not to mention the fact that people reporting players comes down to RNG, if they either remember to report, can be bothered to report, and have a justified report.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;m afraid you had an opportunity to show improved in game behavior since your account has been previously banned for 2 weeks.&quot;\r\n\r\nWell I did show improved in game behaviour, if you would consider receiving honour as a form of it (which it should). My previous ban was given to me due to &quot;Intentionally Feeding&quot; which I tried to prove was falsely accused, but they didn&#039;t listen, so would that count as toxicity too? I guess it would shaped the wording of the response.\r\n\r\n&quot;The two week suspension is the last warning you get before permanent suspension. Furthermore, while under the two week suspension, you were able to view your reform card when logging into the client, which also contained a warning that further occurrences of toxicity without clear sign of reform will lead eventually to a permanent ban.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo no matter what the situation is, no matter what kind of player you are, two strikes then you&#039;re out. I was only toxic this **one** time too.\r\n\r\n&quot;League of Legends is free to play and all content therein may be unlocked through Hextech Crafting and participation in our events. You do not need money to enjoy our game nor to unlock it&#039;s content necessarily, as we like to offer everyone the same chance to have a good time playing our game. We do not discriminate, and paying does not make one a premium user, the rules apply to everyone and although our answer will probably not be the one you wanted, all suspended accounts due to in game toxicity will remain so.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is the ultimate slap in the face, and the part of the reply that gets to me the most. This is pretty much saying &quot;don&#039;t worry about all the time and money you spent on the game, you can still enjoy the &#039;free-to-play&#039; elements of the game!&quot; Yes, like I can get back all that I had achieved, through the recent implementation of &quot;Hextech Crafting.&quot; The fact alone that I bought most of my skins with my own money before the Hextech Crafting system even came out, shows just how out-of-touch Riot Support, regarding the substance of their replies.\r\n\r\n&quot;You had the chance to use the mute feature and by that you would have shielded yourself from toxicity.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo this **ONE TIME** I didn&#039;t do what I should&#039;ve, and I get a permanent ban for it? Justified, I may ask?\r\n\r\n&quot;I know that this can be very frustrating giving the effort you put into your account. However, I&#039;m afraid the suspension was placed properly and will not be removed or modified.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo in the same sentence it is reasoning with me, but also shutting me down out of everything I had said.\r\n\r\n&quot;I hope you&#039;ll be able to use this experience to avoid future punishments in any games you decide to play.&quot;\r\n\r\nThese last 2 statements have removed my ability to reply to what they have accused me of doing, so here I am on the forums. I may even get the same people giving me the same replies. Maybe they&#039;re all right and I&#039;m wrong, I was incredibly toxic and deserve a permanent ban. Can an outsider at least review my case, which is a case probably felt by many others in the same boat. I mean, this game is known for having a toxic community. Its not like I am standing out, or this is something that will cleanse the community. I feel like they got the wrong guy.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-01-08T08:39:55.644+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SAP Herbie,\n\nI spent a while looking at your recent history, because like yourself I felt that your log was a little soft to consider it for a perma.\n\nYou've had a sketchy couple of months leading up to this. I won't go into detail here unless you want me to, but there were two 2 week bans prior to this perma.\nYou've had about a 20% (of games) report rate against you since October, and quite a few pretty abusive games where you were lucky enough to not be reported, and you can see a couple of such examples in the latest reply to your ticket. It wasn't until someone finally reported you for this game that the Instant Feedback System was moved to act.\n\nI am leaning on this game being severe enough to be perma because of your recent behavioural history, two temp bans already, and that this game basically went like this:\n- Someone whinged about no ganks\n- You responded with negativity and whinging in kind\n- Back and forth continues for the whole game while your teammates are asking you to stop and focus on the game\n- 3 minutes before the game ends you've sold all your items and are sitting in base continuing to focus on complaining about your team\n\nAll because some other player made a slightly snarky comment about needing ganks. That's a purely frustrating experience for the other 3 members of your team, hence the report against you from one of them and the punishment - which when taking your recent report history into account was just a matter of time as your previous bans did little to persuade you to reform.","replies":[{"poster":"SAP Herbie","date":"2018-01-09T11:39:04.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To you reading the other players logs, it may seem like a \"slightly snarky comment.\" I can promise you it was more than that, it was me (the jungler) taking all of the hateful blame, comment after comment, from someone that had so obviously lost lane. I tried to ignore it initially, but it had gotten to the point where the damage had been done, and the mute button wouldn't do much for my sanity. I should've muted him from the start if I could feel this approaching. He was so convinced that since I died to Diana one time, that his previous deaths to her after being solo killed multiple times had nothing to do with it. The only reason I died was because he was solo killed, then Diana was able to move into my jungle and kill me there. I was caught up in the game, and was thinking that there are certain things that are my fault and others that are not, and that I needed to explain my frustrations, which wasn't necessary towards winning the game.\n\nI can only see that my own logs were bad, and nothing of what anyone else had said, which leave me unable to quote what they said. I do remember that at the end of that game everyone agreed with me too, the fact that Zed lost his lane on his own and etc in all chat, maybe except for that one player out of nine you mentioned reported me. When I was in the base 3 minutes before the game ended, it was because they are taking all the inhibitors and we can't stop them, I had used this opportunity to reply to their accusations. I never do that and I now know that nothing good can come out of doing so.\n\nMy suspension was received for this game, and I have now been reminded of my previous acts of toxicity. Until the point of my ban, I had been winning a lot of my games, through teamwork and positivity which would have been around 80% as not toxic. I actually felt like I was on a good run, and did not pay close attention to my toxic actions as I am unaware of each time I receive a report, and how the reports can build up. Here and there I acted toxic because of similar scenarios, where I feel like I have been placed on the same team with someone blaming me when I am doing nothing wrong, then I type back. I had entered every game with the intention to win, but then have had my positive mindset changed when the situation of the game turns bad, which had become toxic. While I may seem as a a toxic player, I have always tried by best, but had not used the mute button enough and have given into certain unpleasant situations. \n\nNow that I have been banned, I have had the chance to reflect on my actions as I have done now. I have had my chat logs attached from my worst toxic games, and of the three of them I can remember how each time someone had annoyed me, but that is no excuse for my swearing or abuse to even my innocent teammates not involved. My reasoning had always been that someone had provoked me to do it, but that is the same reason any other toxic player acts the way they do. My most recent previous 14 day suspension consisted of an intentionally feeding report, which I still feel was due to my terrible KDA starting from a failed invade, where I was not toxic, which acted as the replacement category for \"Unskilled Player\" which used to be in the report ticket. My other 14 day suspension was for another case of toxicity a while ago, which I do not have any logs for. My report history was accumulated over some time, and I wasn't aware of how I was receiving a bad record for myself, and I felt misleaded how I was improving my honour levels after my suspensions, rising to honour level 2 or 3 after initially started at \"dishonourable.\"\n\nGiven the opportunity I could treat this experience as the most severe yet, and a reminder to never be toxic towards my teammates again. The solution which I believe would work for me, is to always mute players before they get to me, which is something I had considered but had never implemented religiously. I would like to believe that I am not a toxic player, and that I have the ability to consistently be a good player to my teammates.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-04T06:13:36.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This is probably referring to the one times I was toxic in-game, which to me was nothing \"excessive\", but rather me defending myself from someone blaming me for many things, being toxic their self while I was initially just playing the game.\n\nYou are held accountable for your negative behaviour, it does not matter who started it. Defending yourself be being toxic in kind are not the same. Being salty because someone is being an ass to you won't get you punished, but throwing the toxic back at them just puts you on their level.\n\nAs for how excessive it was, if you don't believe there was anything worthy of punishment in your chat logs then I would recommend posting them and let the community judge. The community ultimately decides what is and isn't ok by what they choose to report, but of course false reports mean nothing. If you were not intentionally feeding, then a report for it would have resulted in no punishment, and if you have been caught up as one of the very few false positives, then an appeal would have resulted in the ban being revoked.\n\n>Well I did show improved in game behaviour, if you would consider receiving honour as a form of it (which it should).\n\nHonours are great, but being positive or just a good player in one game does not negate being negative in another. You were warned that continued negative behaviour would result in further punishment. Receiving honours for a few games does not change that.\n\n>which I tried to prove was falsely accused, but they didn't listen\n\nAgain if you feel it was unjustified then pass it to the community to judge. GIve us the match history of the games cited, or at least give us a date so we can go through it ourselves. Even then though, the payer facing info alone can be misleading, since some people can get pretty sneaky about intentionally feeding, to the point where nothing player facing other than being in the game or seeing a replay actually shows evidence of guilt.\n\n>This is the ultimate slap in the face, and the part of the reply that gets to me the most. This is pretty much saying \"don't worry about all the time and money you spent on the game, you can still enjoy the 'free-to-play' elements of the game!\"\n\nThat is not what it's saying at all. It is a response to you mentioning how much you have invested in the game. The key phrase here is \"We do not discriminate, and paying does not make one a premium user, the rules apply to everyone and although our answer will probably not be the one you wanted, all suspended accounts due to in game toxicity will remain so\". In other words, it does not matter how much money you have spent on your account, if you demonstrate negative behaviour sufficient to see your account permanently suspended then it will be so, you do not get special treatment because you are a paying user.\n\n>So this ONE TIME I didn't do what I should've, and I get a permanent ban for it? Justified, I may ask?\n\nAnd what of your first punishment? Intent feeding bans escalate straight to 14 day for obvious reasons, and you were explicitly warned that you were on thin ice and that any further negative behaviour would net you a permanent suspension. There was no surprise there, and you should have been well aware.\n\n>Can an outsider at least review my case\n\nIf you want an outsider to review properly, then give us your logs, give use the games you were supposedly intent feeding in.\n\n>I mean, this game is known for having a toxic community. Its not like I am standing out\n\nSo if I went to place known for it's arsonists, that would make it ok to set fire to someone's house?","replies":[{"poster":"SAP Herbie","date":"2018-01-04T09:46:30.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since I didn't act the way I should've one time, I get a permanent ban?

I just feel like I always get the same responses no matter what I say.\n\nCan a Support member again look at how excessive my logs were? There was no racism/hate speech.

They won't revoke it since it was a valid punishment but they may make the decision to reduce it so you aren't one step away.\n\nHowever, I say that without knowing your full history, and whether or not you have been punished or reported a lot before these two recent punishments. If you want to take that angle, then persist with support, but remember to be respectful to them as well. They have the kind of job that gets no thanks, so try to bear that in mind when asking them essentially for a favour.","replies":[{"poster":"SAP Herbie","date":"2018-01-05T04:47:55.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the honest advice, I am continuing to try to reason with Riot support.
