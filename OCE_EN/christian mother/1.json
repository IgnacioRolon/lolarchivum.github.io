So much for being able to actually play against players as you'll always get disconnected or can't even load in at all. It's hard when all you can do is test things in custom games with ping ranging from 300 - 500+. I've seen many people requesting a PBE server for OCE but it has always been brushed off and given the excuse \"It is too expensive\" While I do understand there are expenses, Riot is a wealthy company and is only going to make more with all their event exclusives and releases. All I'm asking for is to be able to have the satisfaction of playing a game that won't disconnect when trying to start up. Thank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-06T09:51:06.919+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Consider the cost of opening a brand new server = high.\n\nNow consider the benefit of opening a test server which makes no money of its own in a region that does not have the population to provide useful test data = extremely low.\n\nNow consider that test server will also have upkeep costs = totally not worth it.\n___\nSure it'd be nice to be able to test stuff on reasonable ping in OCE, but companies don't run on \"it'd be nice\". To put a PBE server in OCE would be a giant money sink for a whole zero benefit.\n\nIf EU doesn't have a PBE, why would OCE get one? The PBE only has so much value as is, because the percentage of players that actually use it is tiny comparatively speaking.\n\nIf you want the satisfaction of playing a game that won't disconnect, just play on the OCE servers?","replies":[]}]}
