But, when you land the snare from Jhin&#039;s W ability and you gain your passive movement speed. Since it is a QUITE long skillshot, shouldn&#039;t you gain like 2x the speed from passive. It would make more sense since why would you need the movement speed from it if you&#039;re literally not even that close to make the snare useful.","replies":[]}
