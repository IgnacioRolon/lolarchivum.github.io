Given that we've had a new mode introduced it's logical that the standard workings of the Rotating Queue would get interrupted. So far, there's been no set rotation, with modes appearing in a seemingly random manner. Currently, the available modes are sitting on either 2 or 3 appearances in the queue, it's reasonable to assume we'll see URF at some point before any other mode get's it's 4th appearance.\n\nAs for the so-called \"promise\", it was never guaranteed. The actual statement is, and I quote, \"Modes will *likely* repeat every 1.5~2 months.\", emphasis on the \"likely\" [[link](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/JzQkg9BJ-rotating-game-mode-queue-update)]. I would also like to point out that this estimate was likely used as an average, indication that their intentions were to have each mode (that's included in the Rotating Queue) appear 6-8 times in any given year, not necessarily *literally* every 1.5-2 months.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-07-17T00:53:16.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where did they say every gamemode will come out 1-2 months apart?\n\nRiot said URF would be available twice this year and it has been.
