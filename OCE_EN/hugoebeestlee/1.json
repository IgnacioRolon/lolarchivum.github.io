But since then I had switched high schools which means they terminated it. So when Riot sends the sign up for Alpha to my my e-mail address I literally can&#039;t go to it. The same thing goes for when I want to change the e-mail for my account, it sends an e-mail to the address that doesn&#039;t exist. I want to help out in alpha, but I can&#039;t. How can I fix this!??? {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-21T03:18:18.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIn this case (As you're unable to change your email account yourself) you'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support as they're the only ones who can help with account related issues.","replies":[]}]}
