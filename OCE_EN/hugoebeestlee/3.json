Now whenever I try to sign in on the support website** it comes up with a screen which shows that I need a verified email address**. It then sends an email to verify my email. Firstly**, I already have a verified email **but this doesn&#039;t matter because it&#039;s what I want to change. Secondly**, I&#039;m just trying to sign in yet I keep on getting redirected to this**, also when I did try to sign in at one point the only server that was available to sign into was NA, I&#039;m on OCE. \r\n\r\nP.S.** Riot I couldn&#039;t even reply to the only comment I got **which wasn&#039;t useful because of what I just stated.
