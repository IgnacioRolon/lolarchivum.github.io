Last season i didnt have good placements and only had a 20% win rate and got put in bronze 1, so that happens. 2018 season starts and i slave my way through my placement matches. Only dropping my first game going 9-1 in placements. I get bronze 3, to me as a player it doesnt really seem fair that my friend who got 1 win more thank me last season got silver 3. Just a little rant here. See ya and hope you guys got what you wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-17T00:05:52.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your rank is soft reset at the start of each season from your previous end of season rank. Preseason rank changes have a minimal effect on that MMR, so you will pretty much always be placed 2-3 divs lower than where you ended the last season. Placements don't mean all that much for your MMR, they're really only a way to ensure that you are still at that level.","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2018-01-18T00:23:16.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep seeing people post that preseason has minimal or no effect on placements.\n\nFrom my own personal experience on multiple accounts this can not be further from the truth.\n\nI ended last season S1 100LP. During pre-season I started maining support (was a top main) and I climbed to Plat 5 around 50LP.\n\nDid my placements, went 6-4 which is pretty average and got put straight back in plat 5.\n\nTo me that shows that pre-season has a huge impact on your results.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-18T00:57:43.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people don't climb multiple tiers during preseason. Vast majority of players only climb 1-2 tiers in preseason, which has basically 0 impact. \n\nYour story tells me that your MMR when you were in S1 was probably quite high for your rank, and your subsequent extreme climb in preseason really pushed it up. Placements you were probs being matched with mid to high plats and won just over half hence the placement.\n\nIt's not impossible to be placed higher, and it's not impossible to improve your rank placement in preseason. It just doesn't happen very often.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-16T20:02:42.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey it always places you lower then the previous season.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-01-17T03:00:46.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it almost always places you lower than you started, unless you go like 10-0 or something mad like that.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-01-16T14:03:20.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Örnn Bot","date":"2018-01-16T20:02:01.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver is average in all regions so bronze is not as bad as people say","replies":[{"poster":"986A","date":"2018-01-17T02:15:12.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well bronze is below average so I wouldnt  say it’s good","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-17T00:28:52.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If last season was your first that has a huge effect of your rank as it’s essentially the full placement.
