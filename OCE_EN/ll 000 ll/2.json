My supp was Morgana, played by a player called 'ienvy'. We were vs Lucian and Leona and eight minutes into the game, I was 23 cs ahead of Lucian and he was stuck under his turrent. Morgana was right behind me in the bush so I was kind of focusing on my farm and poking enemy whenever they tried to kill a minion. I was not paying enough attention to chat but I had my eyes on the map, in case of a gang. Soon after Voli came to gang me and I turned to the lucian who was half hp, expecting morgana will shield me and possibly get two kills as voli was under lvl. However, my supp turns around and walks away and I died after killing Lucian in 1 v 3. As I pressed enter to activate my chat to ask to Morgana, why s/he walked away, I noticed that s/he called the enemy jungler to gang me, just because s/he was pissed off with the fact that I pushed my lane and locked enemy under their turrent (Morgana never said a word to me or pinged). I have seen many people fighting and going afk or feeding intentionally but this one was (in my opinion) just epic (although beyond my understanding) so I wanted to share this experience with those of you who cares about playing with good people to have fun. \r\n\r\nGood gamings\r\n\r\nll 000 ll","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-04T04:46:42.374+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"turrent","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-04T05:13:34.500+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's like the 5th time in a week I've seen that mistake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ll 000 ll","date":"2014-12-04T04:52:21.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry.
