The League of Legends is a fairly good game but the majority of players are extremely toxic. In almost every game, players fight with one and other. I have never seen a game where people wish cancer or death to others (just because they had a bad game or gave first blood, etc.). \r\n\r\nI started to play League of Legends only because I like team fights and I like games where I can be part of a community. After two weeks, I felt that I became a stressful person and even lost my temper in a couple of games. I have never experienced these feelings before in a game. \r\n\r\nI deleted this game from my computer two days ago and started to play another game. It only has been two days, but I already feel the difference. I, once again, have fun playing a COMPUTER GAME. When I log into my new game, I actually feel relaxed, rather than stressed. I, once again, have fun (as it is supposed to be) in a COMPUTER GAME!. No more of those people who wish cancer to others because of a COMPUTER GAME!. \r\n\r\nMy advice to those who feel the same way as I do, is to delete this game and go and play another game (there are so many good games out there). \r\nLeave those toxic players with each other. Let them have what they deserve. Let them play with players like themselves. After all, the League of Legends is not a game for them but a way of living. \r\n\r\n...","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-19T01:17:54.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nearly every game has mostly trash community \n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-18T22:19:39.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternatively, make friends that aren't toxic poopheads in league and always play premade.

It's good you have left.\n\nOn a serious note, fair call man, this game brings out the worst in people which have spent RP on it, the only advice I have is to try and get better at the game, so then your team doesn't rage at you, if they do you don't need to react, because there is no point in reacting to some child on a different computer. \n\nIf it makes you feel better they are very depressed individuals without much to do.","replies":[]}]}
