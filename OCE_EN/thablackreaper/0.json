If you really did nothing that would inherit an honour level reset, then there would be something wrong with the system. The people at riot support have generally been really nice and helpful to me so far, so I recommend you chuck them a visit. Might resolve it for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-11-25T06:07:27.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This certainly sounds weird. Honour shouldn't drop at all without a punishment being issued. Quick question, is your honour currently locked? You';ll be able to check by looking at your profile, as it should show a lock icon on your honour if it is. I would certainly recommend submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (I'd recommend the \"Account management, data requests, or deletion\" option) and hopefully they'll be able to resolve the issue for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-25T00:53:08.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine wont go away, it's still 5 lol (for prev season if new hasn't started yet)","replies":[]}]}
