Create situation where you can contest valuable dragons. \n- Lane Control; try to keep all 3 of your lanes pushed up. This makes pushing harder for your enemies and could result in pressure or tower damage.\n- Rotations; when giving up an objective, always try and trade it for something. Try split pushing techniques. Anything to disrupt what works for the enemy. \n- Defend towers; try not to lose tower just because you've been out-rotated.\n- Don't die; I know easier said than done, when your behind, but if you can stop the feeding you stop their momentum. You also stop them increasing the gold gap, and work towards lowering the percentage gold difference as the game continues.","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-11T15:06:06.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the \"expanding on the holiday out to late game\" part :P\n\nnice advice however","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-12-11T15:26:12.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks! :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-12-11T21:11:57.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a set in concrete rule of never surrounding!
