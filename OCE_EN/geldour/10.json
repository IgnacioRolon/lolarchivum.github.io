If you are a higher pick, you have the right to take one of their roles. \nMay not be great for team co-operation, but you do have the right as a higher pick, to pick your role first.","replies":[{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-30T02:03:51.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yup, thats what i mean. i main support too, i was ( OCE Support ) but name changed back to my original name","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
