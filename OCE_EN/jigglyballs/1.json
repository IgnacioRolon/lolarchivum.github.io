I said this in team chat and another guy was like &quot;yeah that is pretty odd&quot; we had a discussion about what if caitlyn had a bolt action snipe so she would have to do that thing with bolt action snipers i dont know what its called but she would have more range because of it. Also her ult is really weak compared to other adc champs its not the best range but not bad range but it doesnt do much damage unless you are ahead of everyone else by a bit and it can be blocked which is also pretty stupid, i mean its weaker then karthus ult and his one damages all champions without being able to do anything but zhonyas, i know not everyone will agree but i think it would be pretty cool for caitlyn to have a bolt action sniper.","replies":[{"poster":"morekaks","date":"2016-02-22T03:53:14.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that would be awesome if {{champion:51}} could out range other champs but have slow attack speed, but not just {{champion:51}} have her own thing but all of them just like how {{champion:104}} and {{champion:202}} do, would make adc alot more interesting and fun role to play","replies":[{"poster":"JigglyBalls","date":"2016-02-23T09:04:59.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe attack speed just decreases the amount of time it takes to reload but when  reloading she cant move or she would be slowed while reloading","replies":[]}]}]}
