After a day of thinking came up with true/false love Ahri(if someone has a better name please say so), so this skin has two sides to it true love and false love, Ahri will be true love throughout the game until she uses an ability then she will turn into false love Ahri for around 5 seconds and during that time if she activates another ability it will reset the timer of false love Ahri. Tell me if you like the idea and would want it in league of legends","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-28T10:13:19.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda cool, not enough detail to know for sure.","replies":[{"poster":"JigglyBalls","date":"2015-10-29T09:57:49.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well we only came up with it in a bus trip after around a day of thinking of a name and we couldnt really think of a good name","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-30T04:40:56.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name doesn't matter.

You could say the same about Spirit Guard Udyr or DJ Sona. It doesn't affect gameplay in any way more than visually.
