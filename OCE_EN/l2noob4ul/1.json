It was working fine until today. I&#039;ve tried the changing to google DNS but it didnt seem to fix it\n\nis anyone else getting this problem? I wanted to re-install league but it won&#039;t even let me download it\n\nI am located in Dunedin, New Zealand\n\n*edit\nAlso cannot access server status page, tried to do so with other devices (Tablet+Phone) and both did not work","replies":[{"poster":"GokoLuri","date":"2015-04-05T10:53:37.727+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man. Luckily, I'm in Dunedin,too. And I am a student of University of Otago living in a uni flat. I met the same problem today but I have known the reason. It is because of our shitty Campus Internet. When I connected Campus Internet I would meet the RADS Error and couldn't even access facebook, but after I made my Iphone as a hotspot trying my 3G data, it was fixed! That means our facility and game r not the problem but the Campus Internet is! idk whether u r using Campus Internet or not but at least this is just a suggestion. U can reply me after u solve ur problem :)","replies":[{"poster":"l2noob4ul","date":"2015-04-05T16:34:00.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha, yea, im @ a uni flat\n\nalready maxed out on data this month so the phone as hotspot won't be an option\n\nare there any grievance procedures for this? i mean its ridiculous that we're paying horribly marked up prices for residence and they don't give us usable internet. i mean if im renting anywhere else i can easily refuse to pay rent until they fixed it if this sort of thing happened.\n\nbut a few things that aren't working\nfacebook\nleague\ntomshardware\n\nbtw gokoluri, just wondering but what ping do you get? on campus net and phone wifi? if the phone wifi is good then i think i might just switch to a higher data plan and use phone wifi permanantly to play league","replies":[{"poster":"GokoLuri","date":"2015-04-05T19:20:06.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, man~~~~I just used my phone as a hotspot to find out if it is the net problem or my game's problem. Once I access LOL successfully with my phone wifi I immediately stopped using it, so Idk the ping when playing via phone wifi. I really don't think it's a good idea to play via 3G cause it will cost u a lot of data and even more when u need to patch. I 'm gonna go to uni flats office to complain about it directly, Although I don't know if it's open in easter holidays. I think u should go and complain about it, too, because more people complain about it more attentions they will pay.","replies":[{"poster":"l2noob4ul","date":"2015-04-06T05:27:00.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its working now\n\nbut uni flats is opened on wednesday, im prolly gonna go complain a bit + pick up sum packages","replies":[{"poster":"GokoLuri","date":"2015-04-06T06:39:54.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, it's working.

I had met this problem too many times before uni flats came and changed our router. Although the problem still turns up sometimes, it never came that often. u can send an e-mail to Croisella(croisella.trengrove@otago.ac.nz) and complain about it then they will come and change ur router(Better make ur flatmates do it, too. Cause more people complaining and more attention they will pay.) Good luck man. I've accepted ur friend request :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-05T08:52:20.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Also cannot access server status page, tried to do so with other devices (Tablet+Phone) and both did not work\n\nAlthough the server status page is elsewhere on their network, are these both running the same ISP, and what is your ISP?","replies":[{"poster":"l2noob4ul","date":"2015-04-05T16:34:25.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The university of Otago (Dunedin) uses Vodafone\nMy phone carrier is also vodafone but using the phone data, the status page/fb/toms hardware works\n\nso ya, its the uni problem","replies":[]}]}]}
