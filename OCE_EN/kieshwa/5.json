Some champions were just completely useless, either the whole game or from after a certain point.\n\nThe true damage is really negligible, is it like what, 10-20? \n\nI think I will have to agree on your point on the low CD though. I think it's a tad bit too frequent for offering such a wide gap closer. \nAs for tanks, I think it renders champions likes Malzahar, Vel'Koz, Xerath more vulnerable in that they would have a far more difficult time dealing with Volibears and Shyvanas knocking them about.\n\nI've also got some issues with the 20% CDR on Black Cleaver. It indirectly buffs all bruisers and their gapclosers by a lot. I'm aware that's a different topic.\n\nAnd don't be so rude.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Terra","date":"2015-04-30T17:22:34.422+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Yep, we're monitoring how the spell affects ARAM matches, with the CD being something we watch particularly close. Hopefully it'll bring more champ diversity and less picks where you auto-reroll because they are useless! Worst case scenario is it could result in a different set of champs bring really OP in the mode, but ideally it'll have a bit more positive of an impact than that :)","replies":[{"poster":"aspect8","date":"2015-05-02T02:06:25.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ability could be fixed by letting the player throw the snowball every 20 seconds or whatever, but once it hits it goes onto a much longer (90 seconds or so) cool down, whether you choose to initiate or not.  The risk / reward ratios on this item are seriously skewed as it stands right now.  Essentially every single character now has a Malphite-Lite ultimate on a 20 second cooldown.  For characters with a very powerful close range kit that was traditionally held in check by gap closing issues, this breaks games.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-03T12:12:25.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that punishes people from using the ability.

This just takes a large element of skill out of the game.\n\nIt's giving an enormous advantage to bruisers and assassins, which can literally jump across the screen and kill you and then use their own jump, stealth abilities and/or flash to get away. Same thing with tanks and engaging.\n\nIt also makes it impossible to retreat. My team had lost a team fight (which an enemy Wukong initated via Mark) and were pulling out to get to our turrets (3 of us left), and despite us having some good distance between them (we'd normally be safe) -- their surviving team zips in with mark and kills us -- the Wukong (which initiated only 30 seconds ago), the ADC and mage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slazza","date":"2015-05-01T05:51:05.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd be happy if they lower the range and remove the true damage.\n\nIt is completely overpowered on some champions.","replies":[]}]}
