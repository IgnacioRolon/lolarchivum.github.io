But in this situation and often happens when people get melee&#039;d through flashes, that Riot&#039;s system leaves you in two places at one when you teleport.\r\n\r\nFix it at some point please, this is pretty crappy mechanics","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-04-27T00:04:11.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The melee auto attack through flashes is actually an entirely separate issue to the \"being in two places at once\" bug. \n\nI strongly recommend you check out [**DTM**'s post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/HZ4wirXv-melee-attacks-being-uninterrupted-by-flash-is-counter-intuitive-for-both-sides-of-the-fight?comment=0001) on the melee auto-attack and flash interaction. He does a great job at explaining the background and logic behind that interaction.\n\nBut otherwise you're definitely right, being in two places at once after a dash is a terrible interaction that's been around for a while now. I don't think it's an easy fix though, it will most likely require re-coding how the game detects your position.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-29T10:11:57.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes the coding would need to be remade pretty much from the ground up, as s much stuff is intertwined they cannot efficiently change the code without causing major problems otherwise.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-27T03:37:28.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done it a lot and it's because the opponent always manages to flash as the auto is being executed right after the initial gap where it can be cancelled (If that makes sense).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-26T23:03:42.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, if you use a blink/switch/teleport/dash, either you get away and the ability goes on cooldown, or you don't get away and it is unable to activate.\n\nI also believe that if you put a certain distance between yourself an a melee auto attack, the auto should miss. _(and ranged attack animations should be canceled, UNLESS the projectile is mid flight, in which case it should still hit you.)_","replies":[]}]}
