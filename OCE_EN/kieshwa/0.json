Hell, he can 1v3 and walk away easily with his burst. \r\n\r\nSome things they could change to bring him down a bit:\r\n- If you ult with E up, you lose the E charge\r\n- More than half the range of his ult\r\n- Completely remove the damage of his ult (It's already a massive gap closer with a big AoE CC, he doesn't need 400 damage on top of it.\r\n- Tune down some base armor/MR so he's not so tanky if he rushes TForce.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-03-19T10:28:19.510+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hecarim is balanced lol, just because he gets picked in LCS doesn't mean he's broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-19T09:53:08.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you beat hec in lane he is weak later on if you counter jg he is weak if you play darius he can q w ult GG adc dead","replies":[]},{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-03-21T04:00:45.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He isn't a broken champion he can get shut down quite easily just get your team to cc him and kill him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-20T22:09:34.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can remove E from ult man...you E in, don't land it, ult behind them and E knock back desired target forward..its a key mechanic in his kit...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essy","date":"2015-03-20T12:44:50.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trinity force do tons of damage - Phreak","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-19T16:56:13.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same build is almost as OP on Udyr.
