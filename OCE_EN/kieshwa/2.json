Tanks building nothing but tank, maybe a triforce, then being able to burst 1500+ damage in a couple of seconds.\n\nWhy does Riot not see this as a problem. Just the fundamental premise \"To deal damage, build damage, to live longer, build tank\". It almost makes builds pointless, just make everyone roll a tank, and build tank with a bit of CC and you'll win.\n\nI've kind've had it lately to see tanks build NO damage items, then top damage dealt to champions for a game, it's happening more and more lately and I'm about ready to give up the game because of this stupidity. I've always though tanks did a bit too much damage for how little they damage items had to build, but lately, especially Hecarim, it's gotten too much.\n\nI know it'd make it too convoluted or whatever, but maybe make some sort of like pvp stat on damage items, increases damage dealt to champions by X%, so that tanks won't lose damage in jungle or minions, but can't build nothing but tank and then simply outlast people while they burst them down.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-03-28T06:31:53.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"garen walks up to a half hp adc....presses r...gg.

I used to find Elise and Voli were the worst for wrecking carries whilst still taking an eternity to kill. Like what Mar3thyu said below they all have their cons and they do tend to cripple them heavily. Voli is very easy to kite for example, the same goes for Sion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-27T17:51:32.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because most \"tanks\" are actually fighters, look at Irelia, she isn't really a tank but for some reason she can build a Triforce and then full tank while still dealing a billion damage, the other thing is that lots of them have some sort of true damage or %hp damage which was given to them so they would deal some damage instead of no damage but has proven to be too much damage almost every single time.\n\nI think that if you wish to deal damage you must build damage, not one damage item, but at least three if you wish to deal a decent amount of damage while being a little tanky, i find it incredibly silly and quite broken how a champion only needs one damage item and they can still burst but be the tankiest in the game as well, looking at you Irelia.\n\nTheres a simple fix to all this and that is to nerf the shit or completely remove true damage and/or %hp on tanks, Irelia should lose the true damage but in return change it to bonus damage, Zac should lose his %hp but in return increase the AP ratios on his abilities thus making it so if they want to do damage they need to build damage, this is just off the top of my head i'm sure there is a lot more to it than that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T08:33:42.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"a) if they are 3+ levels on people this doesn't count.\nb) if they have a tri force/BotRK/Devourers/anything similar this doesn't count\nc) if it's built into their kit, there is a reason for it\n\nFact is tanks are strong, but if kited properly by an ADC, the ADC wins 9/10 times (thornmail being the exception to this rule)","replies":[]}]}
