One, the one players are able to see, is your LP. This changes at the end of every game and it relies on your second value, the MMR, or Match making rank, to show calculate the change in LP at the end of a game. No one outside of Riot can see your MMR. Each rank is associated with a certain MMR, so if you are in a rank above what your MMR says you should be, you will gain MMR faster. Each team has a team MMR, so if your MMR corresponds to bronze 3 and you beat a bronze 2 enemy, you will gain more LP for a win and lose less LP for a loss, as you are fighting above your rank and are expected to lose, and the system . If your opponent is at bronze 4 level of MMR as a team, you will lose more LP for a loss and gain less LP for a win, as the ranked system sees your MMR as more skilled than the opposing team, and punishes you for losing to a weaker team,\nIn short, the exact opposite of what you described.\n\nThere is more information about the MMR system at these links\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ\nAn official Riot Games FAQ about the ranked system, LP, and MMR.\n\nhttp://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/209734/how-is-lp-calculated\nhttp://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=3409638\nCommunity members explaining MMR and the match making system used by League of Legends to other community members\n\nEdit:I just realized you were talking about the S, A, B, C, D system of ranking individual performance. \nWhile many people agree with your idea about this having an impact, it makes the game a killstealing competition for the losing team, with every player attempting not to lose too much LP. This reduces the chance of a well coordinated team mounting a comeback, punishes the supports, and leads to an overall loss of enjoyment for the losing team, so this system can never work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-14T02:18:34.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the current system is fine and doesnt need a change","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-13T01:23:10.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yet il get a d in some games cos I went 2 10 0 but I got 5 outer turrets, 2 inhibs, 1 nexus turret so I did all of that yet now I get 15 lp and not 20 as I died a lot if at anything I carried you.
