So since Riot have implemented a way to gauge individual performances in a game, why not have the champion score have an effect on the LP loss/gain from a game. Is it fair that you may play extremely well in a game, well enough to be given an S+ rating, but still have full LP loss for someone else causing a loss.\r\n\r\nSay do something like this:\r\nIf LP gain was going to be say 20 from a game, give maybe +/- 33% LP based on mastery, so;\r\n\r\nS gives say 26\r\nA gives 23\r\nB gives 20\r\nC gives 17\r\nLower gives 14\r\n\r\nAnd same with losses, say loss would&#039;ve caused 20LP loss:\r\nS changes loss to 14\r\nA changes loss to 17\r\nB changes loss to 20\r\nC changes loss to 23\r\nLower changes loss to 26.\r\n\r\nI just find the idea that your point gain/loss for INDIVIDUAL rank isn&#039;t determined at all by your INDIVIDUAL performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another note, premade should not have any effect on champion score; that&#039;s just really dumb from Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-07-09T06:14:35.257+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Because basing LP gains off of numbers such as KDA and CS will turn the game into an anti-social farm fest/ in-team fights of KS. ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide#q2)\n\nI have won many games where our 0/10 member distracting the enemy team with a strong split push allows my team to get the baron and rotate for the win.
