I think its due to they have quite unique roles to play and they can contribute to team doing various things which are hard to be measured fairly","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-06-28T03:50:05.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does have a reduced impact =/ your kda is actually 5-1-5 not 10 if you break it down, and your farm is only 104cs by 25mins which is kinda low. Thats more your 16-20min mark cs- i also notice in 26mins\n\nnot 1 dragon, rift herald or baron, which JG participation is important in....\n\nSo, your point is?","replies":[]}]}
