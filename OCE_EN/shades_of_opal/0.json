You need your team and abusing them will only make them play worse and feel bad. So, I lost my honor points a year ago and since then I haven't earned the ribbons back despite gaining them back again. Is it possible to get the ribbons again after losing all the honor points? Or is that part of the punishment for toxic behavior?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-10T02:25:59.703+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure if you can get ribbons after losing honour point but one thing I do know is that, in order to get a ribbon in the first place, you need to *consistently* get honoured.
