As those champions can absorb just as much _(if not more due to their healing factors)_ damage than Braum can, but unlike Braum, they can dish out almost carry levels of damage. So in an extended fight, champions like Darius and Sion will take home the victory, as they can act just as much of a tank as he can, but also be able to burst down other champions.\n\nSo it may seem that you lose extended team fights more often, because once your Ult and shield and passive are down, he becomes only a meatshiled, while the top lane champions are useful throughout the fight AND are a also meatshiled.\n\nSo its not that Braum isnt good, its that champions like Darius are TOO good. Thats why he doesn't feel as effective as other tanky non-support champions.\n\nThats not to say that Braum isn't useful, quite the opposite, a good braum with good team coordination can make sure that the enemy ADC is 100% pointless in a fight, set up your stun and let your ADC freely AA them from the safety of your wall. With todays level of damage output, no ADC should be living after you land your stun on them. a Vayne or Draven will likely kill them before your stun even procs anyway.\n\nRemember that if the enemy is focusing you and killing you first like you say, you are doing your job! Because every ability used on you, is one less that your ADC or Mage has to worry about, and the longer they stay alive, the higher your chance of winning.\n\n______\nSo no. I don't believe that Braum is a weak champion, I think he is actually quite balanced, but i think it is other tanks _(the ones that deal damage)_ that are too strong, and so make braum look weaker in comparison.","replies":[]}]}
