The problems with tenacity and slow/stun/poly-morph interactions are interesting though since it appears to be working partially.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-25T06:40:25.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah its just lulu, sometimes her polymorph goes through yasuo's wall or qss cant remove her q slow or polymorph, she has been that way since 6.7","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-26T03:44:12.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah except I've noticed that elixir of iron sometimes interacts weirdly with certain sources of cc such as shaco box fear (with a bit of trial and error I'm certain I can replicate this, tenacity seems to only help against this fear sometimes), and casseopia sludge.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-26T05:51:34.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her sludge isnt affected by tenacity... its on off as as soon as off it drops.
