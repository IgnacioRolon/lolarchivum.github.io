Mirror matches, no counter picking, no bans and its the only game mode after ranked goes down. i hate playing this game with my friends because if you have more than 2 ppl(or if you are in different leagues)  you have to play blind pick.  \r\n\r\nyeah bit of a whinge but  my god i hate this game mode. all i want to do is have a fair game of draft","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-02-26T13:31:42.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot doesn't want to give it back because according to them it would reduce the number of players picking other game modes available. The servers also have costs and Riot OCE doesn't feel that the small pool of players is worth the effort. \nThe idea is to push as many people into playing Teambuilder.\n\n I somewhat agree to you though because Draft Pick was an excellent way for new players, who haven't played Ranked Draft Pick before, to try out the different picking order and the banning phase. It was great practice for a Ranked Match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"life for life ","date":"2015-02-26T13:28:25.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"LOL blind pick is some what is fun. like break the meta.lol.. my whole team once go all mid in blind pick and we win lmao we push all tower in mid lane in 18 min lol my team was {{champion:89}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-02T00:09:04.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do hope it's possible (AND practical!) to break the meta with teambuilder. The system should be automated and not use captains as most of them will either be meta sheep or the scapegoat if the team doesn't work out. Just try to make an optimal team based on what's considered a purely skill based pick (by having players vote on an official LoL version of those counter pick statistics websites), while making sure each team has an even amount of AD and AP champs + avoid repeating the same role.\n\nE.g.\n\nYou can get a team like this\nTop:\n{{champion:8}} (tank)\n{{champion:16}} (support)\nJg:\n{{champion:432}} (Bruiser)\n{{champion:4}} (Assasin)\nMid:\n{{champion:103}} (Mage)\n{{champion:74}} (Mage)\nSupport:\n{{champion:7}} (Assasin)\n{{champion:89}} (Tank)\nADC:\n{{champion:119}} (Draven)\n{{champion:119}} (Draven)","replies":[]}]}]}
