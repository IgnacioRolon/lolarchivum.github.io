Say I buy $10 of RP and mystery gift myself twice, I've already spent enough to have RP to just buy one of the skins I like, that's 95% of them. Sure I could get 2 I like, including those I wouldn't have been able to get with the $10 worth, but the odds of not getting something I like are much higher.\r\n\r\nTechnically that has already happened (Deadly Kennen now SN Sona) so while it might be fun to take the risk, in hindsight it's not really worth the cost.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-11-28T01:59:23.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, you pay 490 and get a skin worth 520 or more.","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2014-11-28T03:51:00.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yes, you pay 490 and get a skin worth 520 or more.\n\nThe point is, do I want to spend my money on a possibility or a certainty?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-28T04:26:14.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> > yes, you pay 490 and get a skin worth 520 or more.\n> \n> The point is, do I want to spend my money on a possibility or a certainty?\n\nDo you like certain skins? or do you like deals?\nI personally want to own a skin for most my champions, so I bought Fejlord Ashe and Rammus. only 260RP. whatever.\nHowever, Mystery Skins you are going for the jackpot. Infernal Nasus, Spirit Guard Udyr etc... but usually end up with Coral Reef Malphite. The thrill of the gamble.\n\nI can't convince myself that spending 1200 RP on 1 skin is worth, but spending it on 2 mystery gifts and getting 2 crappy skins, i can handle. My own dumb brain.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-11-28T02:04:43.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me and my friend just traded mystery gifts and got Blackfrost Anivia and Whistler Village Twitch, so I'd say it can be worth it at times.","replies":[{"poster":"LMAOisbeast","date":"2015-11-24T02:01:41.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=06tolAP1,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2014-11-28T02:04:43.678+0000)\n>\n> Me and my friend just traded mystery gifts and got Blackfrost Anivia and Whistler Village Twitch, so I'd say it can be worth it at times.\n\nI bought a single mystery skin with my last few riot points and got Blackfrost Anivia, less that 10 minutes after thinking about possibly maining here XD.

However, that is greatly because we only have like 25 champions each, and we have selected the champions we purchase somewhat carefully, I guess. So when we gift each other it is usually for a champion we play.\nMy advice though? Don't. I would rather spend 975 for a skin I want rather than 1040 for two skins I don't want.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-11-28T08:34:49.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO remember , IMO\n\nyou shouldn't\n\nI have gifted myself in the past, only the find skins on champions i don't play as much, which is kind of a waste.\nI play them sometimes.\n\n\nI would only buy skins manually that i like, which of course will only be sales because i am cheap as fu.ck \n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taliyah","date":"2014-11-28T02:00:58.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, you get addicted.
