DISCUSS, ADD STUFF","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OK, so you know a champion that has really been bothering me? Evelynn. We have all these champions that feel so rich and storied and *realised *but do you know who isn't? Evelynn.  Really, what is going on with her everything? Caster minions are now more lively and functional then she is. She's some wispy thing trying to get around in bondage leather- I'm pretty sure Elise pulls that off better than she does. And she's not even wearing leather.\r\n\r\nShe needs her own identity.\r\n\r\nWhere is she from?\r\nThe Shadow Isles. What do most of the champions of the SI have in common? \r\n\r\nTHAT GREEN SHIT. Ok, let's get back to the Shadow Isles in a minute.\r\n\r\nWhere did Evelynn come from? Or rather: The best way to create a new Evelynn is to think of the past Evelynn and what the Shadow Isles did to them.\r\n\r\nYou know what she reminds me of? An elf. The problem is, there is already Morgana rocking that thematic niche so what else? A pixie or fairy? That makes me think of Lulu. Where did Lulu come from? Bandle city a long time ago before she was taken to The Grove and lived with the Fae. Ah, now we are getting somewhere! \r\n\r\nWhat makes Bandle city so hard to find? How long has the legend been around that it is hard to find? Maybe people who went looking for Bandle city never found it because maybe some were diverted as they were also close to The Grove. Hallucinations and other distortions would turn people away but what if someone fought through it and found themselves trapped in The Grove? Someone like Evelynn. A regular human (but maybe one not without questionable motives) tries to find Bandle city but is instead trapped in The Grove with the Fae. Over time her purpose fades, her body changes and she begins to lose herself but remembering her name.\r\n\r\nHowever, remnants of her original purpose linger and she eventually finds herself drawn outside the land of the Fae creatures for the first time in a very long time due to some urge she can't quite remember, some quest or task left unfulfilled. She searches for years and years always out of sight, but often taking time to delight, help (or unintentionally terrify) those who could not see her for her own amusement. The long years were unsuccessful, and still frightened at this cold unchanging world she found herself in she attempted to find the entrance of her home and found she could not. Then one day while searching she finds herself in the path of a handsome man.\r\n\r\nDespite the Fae side instinctually urging her to remain hidden the human side overwhelms it and she reveals herself. The man is intrigued and tells her that he can help her as he knows where her home is. Overjoyed she does not think twice about accompanying him for several weeks, becoming more and more enamoured as to to a place that was his Circus camp. The man was a circus ringmaster and knew enough rudimentary magic to place unbindable chains on poor Evelynn. She would be a part of his acts and she did act, for many moons came and passed before one day she saw that horrendous man with his arms around another woman. Evelynn felt sorry for her until they came closer and they both mocked her, regarding her as some kind of unlovable, hideous monster. Enraged and all the lies, betrayal and pain, her magic burst out as spikes of pure hate, breaking her chains and impaling both people in front of her.\r\n\r\nThis was not the warm and helpful magic she knew she possessed and it frightened her and free at last, she ran. As far as she could, using all the magic she could, to get as far away as she could. Maybe there, far far away, where ever that was, she would find her home again and beg forgiveness for leaving and forget about the world once and for all. Exhausted, she collapsed on the cold grey dirt and cried herself asleep where she had appeared, not even enough magic to conceal herself. She didn't care, if something came up and killed her while she was sleeping nothing would matter anymore. As she slept fitfully, the Shadow Isles comforted her.  She awoke still cold and opened her eyes a crack to the swirling of spirits lighting up the night's sky like an aurora. This land was full of them, they surged along the ground, into the ground, out of the ground, appearing and disappearing due to some spectral wind. Some came up to her as she stood, like curious animals and when they spiraled around her Evelynn felt not from them joy and warmth at their touch, but despair and suffering. When she felt that she did something she had not done in a very long time, Evelynn chuckled. It grew into a snicker and then a laugh. Here, finally! She found a wonderful world just as warped as her home. A world that could share her pain. \r\n\r\nThe best part was she *always* was welcome home the instant she wanted to be, no matter how far she traveled because sharing soon was not enough, and she left for Valoran to bring her style of pain and misery to any and all who plucked her interest, although occasionally did so for a fee. Some say with every kill Evelynn is still searching for something but one this is for sure, those unlucky enough to hold her attention do not last long. \r\n\r\nSTORY OVER *(dear god it needs editing but nvm)*\r\n\r\nAnyway have some images I found with the laziest of google image searches stfu my head hurts\r\n\r\nhttp://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/evil-fairy.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://th01.deviantart.net/fs71/PRE/f/2013/177/4/e/evilfae12a_by_darkangelqueen4891-d6apqhc.png\r\n\r\nhttps://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/28/24/c8/2824c8babb372a32e7407806bda0d349.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://image.blingee.com/images15/content/output/000/000/000/3a9/183247748_449709.gif","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-03-15T06:19:06.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think I read somewhere that Evelynn was the created from all of the hatred people had for each other (since there have been a bunch of wars between all the factions, lots of hatred everywhere).\n\nI agree that she needs an identity, but I think she should bring something new than build upon already existing things.
