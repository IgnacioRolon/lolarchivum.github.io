Ever since her ratio nerfs on her q (which contrary to many people I believe were required as her early game damage was absurd)  Building Sona AP doesn't really give that many benefits as building support and mana regen items. Secondly a lot of people think Sona is a %%%% champ because Riot slightly nerfed her, In reality Sona is still great and provides a lot of early game poke and late game utility.  The last thing about Sona is that like many supports she isn't really a bigplay champ. She's squishy has no gapcloser and most of her utility comes from passive auras and tagging the correct enemy with the correct powerchord. For people who are use to playing champs such as Zed and Irelia playing a champ with no escape like Sona is a foreign concept to them. They often go really balllsy in lane thinking they can get kills and carry their adc and end up just dying.\n\nAlso something I need to get off my back that has been pissing my off for ages is everyone who complains that Sona is %%%% because of her ratio nerfs. I believe that Sona was actually the most OP support in the game prior to these nerfs as she had some of the highest level 1 burst and poke damage in the game well still providing great utility. If memory serves me right prior nerf Sona's winrate was something like 56%. now its about 52%. She also has the benefit of being easy to play **as long as you play her like a proper support** and has an ult that can decide a team-fight in an instant.  If you've got a friend that plays ADC ask them to play Ashe and duo with them as Sona. The result can be spectacular.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-09T12:11:27.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Riot gutted Sona with their %%%%ty half-assed reworked and now she's not viable unless it's aram.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-09T11:13:45.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People realized Sona sucks and have stopped using her, on some real %%%% what the hell did people think was gonna happen?
