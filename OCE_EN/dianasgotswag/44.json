Yi heads bot. No longer feeling like jungling I move to bot lane.\n\nYi dies then immediately quits. I hang around briefly before shifting to mid. Dinger moves around and keeps feeding.\n\nZed gives up and quits. Why I had to spend the next while baring this shit and wasting my time was beyond me.\n\nAs for why the game went for so long, the other team were having fun with their game and I was the other person say no to the surrender votes :/ \n\nWanted to see how long it took them to kill me. Took them long enough and by then the Nexus was wide open.\n\nBut my original point remains. There has to be an option to surrender under 20 if things are really really bad. It was just me and Grag at one point. Then dinger came back and resumed feeding. -_-\n\nThe game could have been over in 12 minutes had they grouped and shoved bot..","replies":[{"poster":"TurtleSlayer","date":"2014-12-11T15:43:18.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they should take surrender out of the game, and make it if someone gets reported for afk and they are afk from no reason then perma ban.
