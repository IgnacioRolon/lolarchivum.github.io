His life was boring, slated to be drowning in mediocrity, the life of a Demacian whose noble family was barely politically relevant anymore. Struggling just to stay in the ever changing loop, he decided to forward his military training, after all, a good soldier is a well respected soldier and that was exactly what his family needed. He quickly became bored, however, as not even in the military was he safe from those wishing to usher his family out of the political spectrum. Finding the ridged Demacian military training also not to his liking, he went in search of other techniques, leaving behind his country and his family. \n\nHe traveled far and wide, weathering his designer sunglasses and 4.5 star hotels until he came upon the island continent of Ionia. There he found what he had been searching for, the most awesome technique of awesome he had ever witnessed. He watched an old man catch a fly..._with his foot_. Lee&#039;s foot, the man had actually thrown Lee off his balance and by grabbing his foot, used it to crush the fly. And his tibia. Lee could not tell because he had also cracked his skull, passing out several seconds later.\n\nHe begged the old man upon awaking, train him, train him to be an amazing warrior he could come home to awe his family with. A warrior who could kneel before the king as a proud member of Demacian politics. A warrior like none had ever seen. The old man said no. What kind of a stupid quest was this, anyway? Despondent, he camped outside the old man&#039;s hut day and night as long as he could. Occasionally going out to order the base necessities, like gold flaked chai-carob milkshakes and deconstructed pizza. Eventually, Lee Xin was able to get through to the old man, crawling through several meters of barbed wire and ignoring several restraining orders.\n\nHe was trained over many months, learning the art of awesome. He learned to master the mystic art of energy usage as he honed his body and mind to become one, training so hard that his head hurt and he threw up. Lee Xin believed it was only a test for his body, a test he would pass in the flying colours that constantly distorted his vision. In reality, it was his brain hemorrhaging. After many, many more months the old man said he had nothing left to teach his pupil. So he left. On his way home, Lee focused on what he had learned and disregarded everything the man said and went back to using mana, because seriously, energy was for chumps, man!\n\nHe raced home to Demacia, eager to show off his abilities. Impressed with his grossly overpowered skills, the Demacian military allowed him to return as long as he used his powers to help defeat Noxus, who had once again been putting kittens up tall trees and placing maidens in burning buildings. He would agree only on the condition that his family were left alone and allowed back into political life. Lee was then informed that his parents were dead, the family mansion had been demolished, he had no inheritance and his sister wanted nothing more to do with anyone, being donated to the local whore house. He agreed anyway.\n\nHe was put in charge of the most elite group in the Demacian military, the rabid peasant brigade. Lee Xin trained them with all the steel and ire of a constipated goat, molding them into something they could channel their remaining lives towards. Unfortunately, his confidence in his abilities were entirely misplaced and the whole band of Demacian soldiers were slaughtered. By him. In an argument. Over dessert. During battle. Like, a full scale war kind of battle, seriously, you should have seen it man, when those dinosaurs showed up shooting lasers, _shit got real_. It was awesome!\n\nAs for Lee Xin, after the battle, people eyed him off in the street, shooting daggers into his back, even a few literal ones, but those did not hurt nearly as much as those angry eyes that Fiora Laurent was shooting at him. They had been friends once. Well, the_ staring at someone awkwardly for hours on end without realising they can see you_, friend. Thus a friendship had been born. In Lee Xin&#039;s head. Things got creepy. Fast. Like, _hey I just met you but fondle my chest hair_ creepy. According to Lee Xin she got over it though, because when spying on her with a mirror he caught her writing his name down in a little book entitled &quot;LLIK&quot;. Whether she was trying to write Like or lick didn&#039;t matter to Lee Xin because SCORE!\n\n\n**Passive**\nAfter using an ability, Lee Xin&#039;s next 3 basic attacks each deal bonus physical damage and reduce his other abilities&#039; cooldowns by 1 second.\n\n**Q Sonic Strike **\nCooldown: 12 seconds\nMana cost 0/0/0/0/0\nLee Xin fires a bolt from his hand.
