Unfortunately you are likely to have very little communication in YoloQ.\n\nBut here a thing you should remember, a lot of focused tanks like say Sejuani {{champion:113}} , Rammus {{champion:33}} , Zac {{champion:154}}  and Sion {{champion:14}}  can do LOTS and I mean LOTS of damage with just tanks items, in low elo most people don't understand how to focus or peel, so they attack whatever is hitting them and doing damage at the time.\n\nThen you have another problem which is more common to me, the tank shows up about a minute before the rest of the team. Now in this instance you have no choice but to focus the tank. He is there, no one else, and once the rest of his team does show up it isn't as easy as 1 2 3 to switch to the squishies as you want to believe it is. Often when a tank is that deep you can't just go around them and ignore them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-11-19T06:12:04.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-19T06:32:14.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reported!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-19T06:08:09.025+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats dianasgotswag!

Frontline tanks are in the meta and they deal off a lot of damage if not dealt with. There is only little circumstances when a carry can ignore the tank. Supports need to peel for the carries and sometimes tanks stack only armour so your ap mid is a great tool to deal with the tank and help your marksman out. Try to focus on your game and not your teammates and what they are doing. You will become a better player, no problem.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2014-11-19T05:54:52.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not always the easiest option to hit a carry over a tank, i don't obviously know your situation but just something to keep in mind.. if you were their champion and had a tank running at you, what would you do?","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2014-11-19T05:13:58.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"School should end in around December - End of December.","replies":[]}]}
