What if Thresh IS Lucian hundreds of years in the future? What is Ashe IS Avarosa from another timeline but she can&#039;t remember? What if Nocturne is Zed?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a trend towards centering things to the back to Runeterra, such as the Nasus/Renekton lore changes. Even though it makes him unique I&#039;m sure Taric&#039;s lore will have him as a native of Runeterra because a world hopping adventurer that gets stuck on another world might just incur HASBRO&#039;s wrath.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of black holes at the moment but recent champions have lore in as such that they may not play a main role in some epic tale but they do have stories attributed to them. What if some of the other stories were all wrong though, not that we knew it?","replies":[]}
