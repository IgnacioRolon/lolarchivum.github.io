It is very strong if you get stacks early and accompanied with Botrk you can do crazy % damage, but 2. You have to remember that unlike other adc's you don't build straight ad/crit so your normal AA's do less than normal for a ranged AD Anyway so it almost evens out.\nWhat I think is stupidly strong is her heal, it's fine for jungling but it's crazy sustain if you take her in a lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-10-15T11:37:06.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't find the w very strong but the e definitely needs to be nerfed that slow and damage is outrageous, I'm not convinced the passive needs to be nerfed coz you do need to put in a decent amount of effort to get those stacks up","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-10-15T12:02:42.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I suppose the stacks stemming from 15 or so marked kills is gonna hurt like a bitch anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"fop123","date":"2015-10-23T04:58:09.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are way too squishy to get nerfed because of damage.

Her passive is normally pretty hard to stack past 10 or 12 in a normal game but it depends how successful you are ofc. I would consider her maybe a bit too strong but not necessarily OP, I think the word is more than a little overused though I'd agree on things like Darius heal (which I think just got nerfed?) or Veigar ult though Veigar has to snowball a lot harder than Darius.\n\nTheoretically they introduce champs a bit stronger than they think they should be to account for the learning curve, and they usually get their first balance in the next patch, but I honestly think once people learn to play against her she'll be in a pretty good spot.\n\ntl;dr she'll most likely get a small nerf but nothing huge.","replies":[]}]}
