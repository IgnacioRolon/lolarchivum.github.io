To begin with they were bitching about how shit I was going and never thanked me for anything I did to help. I could tell they were getting annoyed that I wasn't failing hard when the sledging increased and they were all bragging about their smurf status, clearly they only use these profiles when they feel like heaping scorn and contempt when judging the players they get matched with. By the end of the game I wasn't doing too bad at all but the other four on my team, OH NO, they couldn't have that. They would rather LOSE then have this one other player get a WIN. I mean, they don't *care*, they are on smurf accounts but no they are saying \"we deny your efforts\". Then they tried to tell me they weren't premade? Fucking bullshit. Maybe find their main accounts and perma them too?\r\n\r\nNow, everyone has games that get thrown when they were kicking arse that really should have been wins, does that mean you should only take positive points from wins and ignore losses completely? No, and some might say this applies here, why should the \"DEFEAT\" matter? This is completely different. What happens when the team fucks up is completely different to what happened here. You don't just roll you face on the keyboard or misclick and start a surrender vote. What happened was not a fucking accident. It was a final attempt in game at an act of belittlement (I'm not even going to start on the post game chat).\r\n\r\nCan you guys put a restriction timer on the surrender vote to stop this troll bullshit? Like if the other nexus is going down you *can't call a surrender*? It won't completely fix the fuckwits who want to ruin the game but it will be something, at least.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-01-19T12:59:27.681+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"just a game bra","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2015-01-19T13:18:26.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was it ranked, if not, Does not matter, if it was, Does not matter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-19T13:11:11.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"one game let it go","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T14:23:29.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:62}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-19T13:40:35.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh I am really glad they did what they did, I hope your parents smash your computer and kick you out onto the street, ASAP.\nAnd I hope your LoL profile is permabanned, and you are also issued an IP ban so you may never return to this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-19T13:29:52.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you make threads that aren't on these topics, u need a little variety.","replies":[]}]}
