This VO change was made in order for the VO to not distract or interfere with her music. She has an obvious Daft punk/EDM feel and we wanted the VO to harmonize with that. \nThe VO is also supposed to be heard with her music. I would hold off on final judgement until you get the whole experience. :D\"\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/ELgn5vMa-issue-with-dj-sona-voiceover-very-hard-to-understand-with-additional-vo-filtering?comment=000f","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-02-04T10:51:27.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You  can either do CTRL 5 Or /toggle","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-04T09:53:25.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes like 1 second and a half to type that line........\n\nOr even shorter.","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-02-04T09:56:42.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=M6NKFM5E,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-04T09:53:25.528+0000)\n>\n> It takes like 1 second and a half to type that line........\n> \n> Or even shorter.\n\nWouldn't you rather press one button?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-04T10:02:06.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno what button would work though, so I just think \"oh well not the biggest hassle in the world\" but if there is another more convenient option then yer I would use it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-04T09:56:03.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"agreed with the key maybe you could do /toggle map (key) the 1st time you use the skin","replies":[]}]}
