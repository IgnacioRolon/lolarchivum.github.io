TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because Riot have commented that he is a champion that has no real identity, I&#039;m having a go at giving him a meaningful impact when someone picks him in a game. He currently has a great dot passive and can deal tonnes of damage. That is it though. There is nothing to describe his play style that doesn&#039;t put him in the same pool as Malzahar, Swain and even Teemo.\r\n\r\nBrand needs a solid identity to set him apart. I always liked his passive for how &quot;neat&quot; it was. Now we have champions with long winded and sometimes downright complicated passives (and more commonly they have more that one, with another tacked onto an ability) in order for them to be meaningful or interesting. As much as I hate this turn away from simplicity, Brand needs some depth, something that no other champion can do. I came up with this:\r\n\r\n&gt; Brand&#039;s abilities set his targets ablaze upon damaging them, dealing 8% of their maximum health as magic damage over 4 seconds (capped at 320 against monsters), and empowering his abilities against them.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **New **: Brand&#039;s abilities or enemy champions affected with Blaze that contact **brush **cause the whole bush to burn out from the point of source for a moderate duration while losing its stealth properties and afflicting enemy champions who walk into it with Blaze. \r\n\r\nYeah. Ok. Have a few seconds to digest what that could mean. Brush is integral to League in many, many ways and giving a champion such power over it is...massive. When the Blaze effect wears off the brush goes back to normal, and Blazed brush does not give line of sight but there is no limit to the amount of brush that can be under the effect at any time. Effective warding and map awareness from both sides becomes extremely important. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that a scorched-brush policy is a dangerous tactic, as although the enemy will certainly think twice about following your allies through burning brush your team will still be visible if the other team has line of sight and you are forced to retreat back through it. Also it costs tonnes of mana you should really be using to pentakill the other team with.\r\n\r\nOn to Sear. Sear is Brand&#039;s only safety ticket aside from deleting anyone weak enough to make the mistake of engaging at the wrong time and many encounters will have players live or die by the use or misuse of this ability. Careless timing should _still_ get Brand killed but there is room for improvement in certain situations that should reward Brand and his team for proper map awareness.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Active: Brand launches a fireball in the target direction that deals magic damage to the first enemy it hits.\r\n&gt; **New**: If Sear passes through Blazed **brush **it will continue to pass through any targets it encounters.\r\n&gt; Blaze: Targets that Sear contacts with are also stunned for 2 seconds (Unchanged).\r\n\r\nPillar of Flame is an ability that plays for huge damage spikes but a slight change was added to really burn in the concept that you just shouldn&#039;t walk into that burning brush...\r\n\r\n&gt; Active: After a 0.625-second delay, Brand makes the target area erupt in flame, dealing magic damage to enemies within.\r\n&gt; Blaze: Pillar of Flame deals 25% additional damage. **New**: Deals 30% additional damage instead to targets in **brush**.\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nConflagration has a great interaction with Blazed targets already. That said, some character identity can be added by having it seek out brush too.\r\n\r\n&gt; Active: Brand sets the target enemy aflame, dealing magic damage.\r\n&gt; Blaze: Conflagration also spreads to enemies around the target. **New**: Also spreads to nearby **brush**.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n**Shouldn&#039;t I be able to tell how long this bush is going to be on fire for? This is a strategic game that requires I know everything! Tell me!**\r\nAs his role is that of a chaos-sowing-inferno-mage, throwing in a little of the unknown forces teams facing Brand to make rapid choices rather than just sit around waiting for timers to run down.\r\n\r\n**So if I&#039;m affected with Blaze I can&#039;t even run into a bush to at least TRY to save myself? Even worse, it will just reapply his passive on me if I do! WTF?**\r\nNowhere is safe. In all seriousness this will probably need some testing to see if a minimum time for Blaze carriers to start burning the bush is required.\r\n\r\n**Will other champions that have also interactions with brush such as Nidalee, Teemo or Rengar still gain benefits from it when it is Ablaze?**\r\nNeither enemies or allies will be able to gain their usual passive benefits from Blazed brush.\r\n\r\n**Speaking of Teemo, I thought brush control was firmly his space?**\r\nTeemo&#039;s shrooms are not limited to brush.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-29T20:59:01.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1\n\nI often think of things like this to add to League but I feel like they take this direction with things like new Champs and reworks etc so I think you've got some great ideas that Riot might take on board. I don't think Brand should be reworked any time soon though because there are a lot of Champions that have been basically destroyed or left for dead and Brand is still a strong contestant and still has a pretty blatant identity (massive inferno of AOE nuke damage don't group up, don't get combod and try to take down this pyro-maniac).\n\nAnnie just drops tibbers on people and says they smell like burning, Brand has more style and personality than this lol.","replies":[]}]}
