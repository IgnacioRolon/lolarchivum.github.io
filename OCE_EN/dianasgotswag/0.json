That being said, the best part about Tunnel>Un-burrow is the knockup, not the damage. So I didn't feel as if that player had nothing to contribute to the team. They were valuable as a disruption tool and regardless how poorly a Rek player might be performing, that simple combo can turn fights easy into their team's favour and that Rek did that more than once. So when they went afk, at around 29 minutes I think it was, the team really felt that. Not everyone like being a one trick beat stick, setting up kills is just as important as getting them.\r\n\r\nOther recent champions have ways to help out their teams.\r\n\r\nKalista, with the slow on Rend, creates opportunites where kills can be set up and team mates can be saved. This is especially true for the the Oathsworn ally, which can be yanked to safety with Fate's Call. However, Kalista relies on her Oathsworn ally to be able to ult, and some of her bonus damage is tied to her W. If an Oathsworn ally goes afk you're in a lot of trouble (although you can still buy Black Spears in the shop, apparently if the Oathsworn goes afk you can bind someone else but I thought Riot were removing this). \r\n\r\nGoing a bit further back we have Yasuo and his third Q. Knock up is a great way to help the rest of the team in a team fight. Ult to keep them there a little longer? Even better. There is one more thing that makes him work well on the back foot. That wall. Rumour has it that if you stand close to the wall, you can smell the putrid odour of smelly cheese. That guy really needs a bath. Jokes aside, Wind Wall can stop game changing abilities and while throwing it down in the middle of a teamfight is probably not the best way to use it, it has it's uses.\r\n\r\nRiot are making champions that have great bonuses to working in a team and that's good for teams, but I find I'm winning less 4v5s than I used to. There was always the \"hold out team we can do this\" attitude but with recent patches that is no longer there. It is almost guaranteed now that if someone quits, it's gg. It doesn't stop me trying but I've noticed it doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nI've been playing Lissandra a bit lately. It turns out actually wanting to improve with a champion really helps the outcome. Now, before I unlocked her I never went well and while I know hitting like a wet noodle does bugger all for the team on the AP \"carry\" front I know now that her CC is very, very powerful. I know it is never good to think \"it's ok if I go shit this game\" because your champion has spell X that can help the team and the 90% chance of extreme animosity from at least one person on your team that comes from having tonnes of deaths and the subsequent detraction of the *willingness to take part* in teamwork that it creates in either party or in others on your team. If people can either not act in this manner or overlook and see past what has gone wrong there are champions being released that reward the team that sticks together and even though you might be even less likely to win if one of these newer champions ditches the game I can't wait to see the next one.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T16:41:05.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champion can help when behind. Even if your Karma is 0/10/3 or something like that, she can still slow the entire enemy team, or shield and entire team for a small amount, for example.\nI have been in games where the score has been like 10 vs 60. People act as if being behind means there is no way to get ahead, and I feel like that is a large part of the problem. People give up on trying to get ahead when they have the potential to do so.","replies":[]}]}
