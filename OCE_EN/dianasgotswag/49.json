Something horribly wrong.\r\n\r\nI've been disillusioned with support playing for a while. Sure, I found out that hitting like a wet noodle isn't so bad if your team has a clue to use your plays or you are just having an awesome game and the damage dealers know what the fuck they are doing but you only need one carry to have their hands shoved deep up their arse to start feeling useless.\r\n\r\nWith no support does this apply quite as well as with Nami. I'm sure there are tips out there and things to know to just play her better.","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-03-20T22:19:20.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want to take control of the lane, try putting a few points into e. Many ADC cant trade against this damage. Be careful of doing this vs adc like draven though.\n\nAnother thing, if you have fast reactions and you see your ADC going to attack an enemy, or maybe a minion that they wouldnt be able to lasthit, put you e on them and it will apply if the auto is in midair.\n\nIn teamfights dont put your e on the ADC, keep it for yourself to peel off the enemies.\n\nDont try and initiate fights with her late game. Stick on your ADC and keep them alive, dont try and CC their ADC (unless their ADC is wayyy out of position).\n\nOh yea and run AD runes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-20T14:25:42.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your ADC is half competent, play level 1-3 hard (in the case of a Blitz/Thresh play it so your not gonna get grabbed, in the case of leo, play Level 1 hard on the ADC)\n\nGenerally I take my W first, then Q level 2 UNLESS there is an invade, this assists your jungler (he gets a heal) and means you can be forcing good trades (If you managed an Enemy>You>Enemy bounce, you can still come out healed and with the enemy's losing 150 Health between them.)\n\nRemember that your in a sustain lane, All-in counters you hard, but your also the disengage queen (I personally call Janna the Reset Queen) If you get jumped, aim that Q, use E on yourself (ADC if they are competent) so you can slow the aggressors.\n\nAs for later game, your aim is to lock down the threats in the following order (highest to lowest priority):\nSomeone jumping your Carrys\nThe enemy Carrys\nAnyone on the enemy team that is out of place.\n\nYour aim as Nami is to be able to disengage a dive, and to stop all in Attempts, if someone dives too far ahead of their team, try to hit a Q, and Ult the rest of their team back, what this achieves is making the diver trapped from his team, and turn the later fight into a 4v5\n\nAlso it's a good idea to buy a Mikael's as it's just another heal that you can drop on the carry that's being dived.\n\nThe thing is Nami's Disengage and sustain are her good points, if your getting all in'd then you've picked the wrong champ (Pick Janna against an All in comp.).\n\nMy personal build is FQC>Sightstone>Mobi's>Mikael's>Locket>Twin Shadows/Randuin's (depends on the enemy team)\n\nWhich if you use this build, be aware you have actives out your ass, use them.","replies":[]}]}
