Kills aren't everything. In fact, it's often kill-hungry players lke you who make games last so long in the first place. If you're so far ahead, why not just provide pressure via your presence and use that pressure to destroy structures?

IS. THE. POINT. I had so many kills because I was going out of my way to get them to help the rest of the team supposedly fulfill their own roles and shove their own lanes but nope. It got worse the longer the game dragged on because of the BIG FUCKING THREAT target over my head meant I was dead after pretty much every team fight.
