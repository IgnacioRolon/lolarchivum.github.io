Auto some minions so they are all nearly dead and have a few stacks each and plow a Q through them collecting every single stack of Rend on the way onto an enemy champion then eat their face.\r\n\r\nIt is even better in team fights because it doesn't take long for everyone to be covered in spears and this is just from one game but the threat potential of activating Rend could force an enemy to disengage or even allow your team to disengage because of all the slows.\r\n\r\nIt is nice seeing Riot release champions with notable weaknesses. Her passive is powerful but you can be in trouble very quickly if you over/under compensate.","replies":[]}
