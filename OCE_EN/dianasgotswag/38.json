If it's another person then you disconnecting and reconnecting wouldn't actually make them load any faster, so you may as well just stay on the loading screen.\n\nAlternatively you could use Borderless mode (in place of Fullscreen) so that League doesn't have to close when you application switch, meaning it won't crash.\n\nThat's just a quick way around this for the moment. Could you tell me your OS and graphics card? Also, what resolution are you at?","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-08T04:33:24.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm running on a laptop so borderless mode...not much of an option, maybe when the new hud arrives I'll check it.\n\nI'm running windows 8.1\n\nalso, it seems riot are working on a fix next patch of sorts","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-10T08:44:18.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">also, it seems riot are working on a fix next patch of sorts\n\nWhere did you hear this from? I'm just curious.\n\nSo even if you're in Borderless and application switch, the game will still freeze *even though it doesn't leave your monitor*? That could be related to your **graphics card** (which you didn't mention yet).","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-06-11T07:41:04.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it was on S@20, just a small note that riot were trying to fix a crash bug that occurred when players tabbed out.

Does it excessively heat up during play? Getting something like a cooling fan would go a long way to speed it up, if that's the problem.\n\nHave you made sure your graphics drivers are updated to the latest versions? Check Intel's website, and compare the latest version number to your own.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
