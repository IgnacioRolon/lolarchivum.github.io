Riot would need to rework her kit to give her an actual role rather then a blending of a fighter/assassin while not being top tier at either. She's very cool thematically and an anti-thesis to Leona. This is my suggested rework for a fighter Diana, she has a huge blade which she does little with in actual killing of champions and this rework gives it more focus by making her more auto attack based. These are all without scaling, damages and cool downs (though i proposed a cool down since mobility like that needs to be gated) as well.\n\nBefore reading the rework all current base stats remain the same, except attack speed which would have the appropriate compensations for the removing of the 20% from her live passive \n\n**Passive: Pale Cascade** - after auto attacking 3 times, the next time Diana would take damage she gains a shield with 3 orbiting spheres. If the 3  spheres detonate on an enemy, the shield is refreshed.\n\n There would obviously be an internal cool down on this, so she cannot be permanently shielded by building attack speed. Opponent can keep track of it the same way the keep track of her live passive. \n\n**Q: Crescent Strike** - Diana swings her blade unleashing a crescent bolt of lunar energy, enemies struck by Crescent strike take magic damage and\n                                            grant Diana vision\n\n**W: Moonsilver Blade** Passive - Diana's auto attacks deal bonus magic damage on hit \n                                             Active - Diana swings her blade dealing magic damage and cleaving nearby enemies (works on towers/auto attack reset)\n\n Idea behind this is to make her more interactive with her blade but also to show she is a fighter. Same animation as her live passive.\n\n **E: Lunar Rush** - Diana rushes to a target unit, if the target it is an enemy, they will take magic damage and be slowed. Champion kills or assists reduce\n                                     the cool down of this ability. \n\n This ability would have a moderate cool down (20 seconds perhaps) \n\n**R: Daylights End ** - Diana becomes the avatar of the moon for 15 seconds, in this avatar state she gains increased attack speed and movement speed.\nDiana also gains the ability to recast Daylights End. Recasting Daylights End will draw in and slow all nearby enemies to her location \n\nThis is Diana's main source of power and enabling her to dish out sustained damage but also have a periods of weakness where she cannot fight. She will also be able to team fight with a purpose effectively and not just the current live Q > R > R or Q > R > W > R to blow someone up nor is she entirely reliant late game on hitting a Q. \n\nThe kit retains basically everything from her live kit, with just some tweaks to them. It focuses diana on being a sticky fighter with periods of strength (shield, ult) and weaknesses \n\nCore items would be attack speed with ability power/magic damage: Wits end, Nashors, tri force and even rageblade. Gunblade could also be used since she's auto attack based\n\nComments and thoughts appreciated ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-26T04:44:13.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're suggesting that Rito turn her into a hybrid, and while I don't totally disagree I think that you're trying to make her god tier rather than viable. This sounds really over powered but underpowered at the same time... There is no valid build for that skillset...","replies":[]}]}
