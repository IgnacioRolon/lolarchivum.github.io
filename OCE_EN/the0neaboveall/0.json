Riot would need to rework her kit to give her an actual role rather then a blending of a fighter/assassin while not being top tier at either. She's very cool thematically and an anti-thesis to Leona. This is my suggested rework for a fighter Diana, she has a huge blade which she does little with in actual killing of champions and this rework gives it more focus by making her more auto attack based. These are all without scaling, damages and cool downs (though i proposed a cool down since mobility like that needs to be gated) as well.\n\nBefore reading the rework all current base stats remain the same, except attack speed which would have the appropriate compensations for the removing of the 20% from her live passive \n\n**Passive: Pale Cascade** - after auto attacking 3 times, the next time Diana would take damage she gains a shield with 3 orbiting spheres. If the 3  spheres detonate on an enemy, the shield is refreshed.\n\n There would obviously be an internal cool down on this, so she cannot be permanently shielded by building attack speed. Opponent can keep track of it the same way the keep track of her live passive. \n\n**Q: Crescent Strike** - Diana swings her blade unleashing a crescent bolt of lunar energy, enemies struck by Crescent strike take magic damage and\n                                            grant Diana vision\n\n**W: Moonsilver Blade** Passive - Diana's auto attacks deal bonus magic damage on hit \n                                             Active - Diana swings her blade dealing magic damage and cleaving nearby enemies (works on towers/auto attack reset)\n\n Idea behind this is to make her more interactive with her blade but also to show she is a fighter. Same animation as her live passive.\n\n **E: Lunar Rush** - Diana rushes to a target unit, if the target it is an enemy, they will take magic damage and be slowed. Champion kills or assists reduce\n                                     the cool down of this ability. \n\n This ability would have a moderate cool down (20 seconds perhaps) \n\n**R: Daylights End ** - Diana becomes the avatar of the moon for 15 seconds, in this avatar state she gains increased attack speed and movement speed.\nDiana also gains the ability to recast Daylights End. Recasting Daylights End will draw in and slow all nearby enemies to her location \n\nThis is Diana's main source of power and enabling her to dish out sustained damage but also have a periods of weakness where she cannot fight. She will also be able to team fight with a purpose effectively and not just the current live Q > R > R or Q > R > W > R to blow someone up nor is she entirely reliant late game on hitting a Q. \n\nThe kit retains basically everything from her live kit, with just some tweaks to them. It focuses diana on being a sticky fighter with periods of strength (shield, ult) and weaknesses \n\nCore items would be attack speed with ability power/magic damage: Wits end, Nashors, tri force and even rageblade. Gunblade could also be used since she's auto attack based\n\nComments and thoughts appreciated ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"The0neAboveALL","date":"2015-03-04T10:04:15.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback guys!

Will the Crescent Debuff work on invisibles? \nThis might be a wild and probably stupid idea but I feel like there should be a CC Immunity feature in her kit. Not to long maybe 1 second or just some relatively small amount of Tenacity-like/CC-reduction type. \nI am aware of the existence of the infamous{{item:3157}} and its synergy with Cooldown Resetting champs.","replies":[{"poster":"The0neAboveALL","date":"2015-03-04T10:03:17.051+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I first showed this rework to my friend I had her Q reveal invisible units which confused him, but the logic behind it was since she is the anti thesis to Leona who is the sun and in most fantasy genre the sun/ight reveals shadows hidden things etc but leona doesn't reveal invis units so I gave that to Diana. It also sort of fit with the Diana theme song where she says \"the sun only blinds\", so denies vision and Diana/moon gives vision\n\nThat's not a bad idea and could be a 3rd addition to her first ult activation, but would require numbers to determine whether it would make her op or not","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-02-26T01:37:33.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"i agree with pretty much everything said but some tweaks would be beneficial, like her w i think that she would benefit from a small aoe burst much like katarinas w where she may swing her blade in a circle or maybe even darius' q where the tip does more damage than the inside to give her a bit more mechanical prowess, and her ult seems a little underwhelming i think the base ult should maybe last for 6-8 seconds and kills or assists reset the timer or give a 3-4 second boost and maybe even an aura much like sivir ultimate but maybe just attack speed and and removes unit collision but aura can't be reset, quite an interesting thought but i think it may be a while before we see a diana update with so many underplayed champions and she only came out late 2012","replies":[{"poster":"The0neAboveALL","date":"2015-03-04T09:57:47.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feed back! This proposed W should probably have perhaps a bigger AoE then her live passive does, pre nerf size\n\nIt's hard to tell if that ult would be a fraction underwhelming or real strong without having numbers put into the kit, as the numbers would influence the strength of it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T00:56:45.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"this  is great. i think you could perhaps make her passive scale with the units moved so move speed regenerates it faster.\nthis would make her able to build attack speed as a key attribute without being too juiced up.\n\nalso you should make something which can reduce the cooldown of her ultimate by up to four seconds (or maybe 0.8 seconds per enemy champion caught in the slow) so it could be reduced to 8 second cooldown with -8 from 40% cdr and -4 from your ability.","replies":[{"poster":"The0neAboveALL","date":"2015-03-04T10:00:05.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Though Yasuo is arguably my favorite champion his passive wouldn't really fit with Dianas theme\n\nI envisioned the ult not having a very long cooldown to begin with, being a fighter cooldown reduction would feature pretty well in her build paths - Nashors, frozen heart and iceborn for example\n\nSo without numbers on the ult it's hard to give it something more without it being too strong to begin with","replies":[]}]}]}
