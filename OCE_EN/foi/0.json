It could be as if the one that disconnects has betrayed Kalista, hence why she can&#039;t re-cast on the same champion. As it is now, it is a little stupid because if the soulbound champion disconnects, then Kalista effectively doesn&#039;t have an Ultimate to use.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-29T12:02:40.864+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can rebuy it in the store {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Foi","date":"2016-04-30T01:03:33.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The black spear is on sale in the shop, but cannot bind/unbind.
