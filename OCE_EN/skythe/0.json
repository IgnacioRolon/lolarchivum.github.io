I main mid/jg and love to play ad/ap assassins\r\nMy questions are as follows:\r\nHow should i approach my promos? Should i play champions from a strict pool?\r\n* How do i avoid acheiving a low rank from the off?\r\n\r\nBtw, XD alot of my friends are experiencing &#039;elohell&#039; as we like to put it as theyre struggling to get out of BIV/V... any advice on that?\r\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"Hollowchazz","date":"2016-04-05T17:00:37.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Focus on Two roles and maybe 3 champs per role (depending on the pick rate) \n\ni main akali mid and she never gets picked, buf if she did i could just dodge OR play the champ that counters her best like vlad or lulu.\n\nI also did jungle with shyvana and udyr being my main picks while having warwick be my backup.\n\nYou don't really need 500 games before going into ranked, But i will say you should get rank 5 on your two main champs and really understand the champs power spikes and play style. \n\nIf you lose 3 in a row stop playing for the day, You might be on tilt. If you are on a win streak keep playing till you lose :D\n\nIt also helps to build your own rune pages rather than rely on the internet, sometimes the best page is the one that caters to your play style. I went from s4 to g5 using hp regen runes on akali","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am Khajiit","date":"2016-04-04T05:32:31.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I recommend putting off playing ranked until you have a solid grasp of the game and have at least two full rune pages.\nAs far as champion pool is concerned, play simple yet effective champions like Annie, Kayle, talon etc (for mid). Avoid playing complicated champs that require you to have a high understanding of the champ and the game in order to be effective. For jungle, play CC heavy and/or tanks champions. Trust me in lower leagues CC and good initiation wins games a lot easier than squishy champions who not only take time before becoming effective but are also a lot harder to pull off consistently.\nHonestly, the only way to avoid achieving a low ranking is to delay playing ranked until you have a few hundred normal game wins, otherwise you're more than likely gonna land into lower elo due to not being experience enough yet.\n\n\"Elo hell\" doesn't exist. It's a term used by people who are stuck at a division which pushes their skills to their maximum limit. If someone is good enough, they should have no difficulty getting out of whatever division they're in. It doesn't have anything to do with your team being bad or having afks in game. As long as you're able to play consistently well and better than the players in that certain division, you will eventually climb.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2016-04-03T01:19:50.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly if you have just hit 30, even more so since the xp of reaching 30 was dropped. Basically you know less or as much as a bronze player. Don't expect to beat people who have been playing for a year+. Give it time, don't rush into ranked like said before. I honestly think 500 normal wins is a good amount before trying ranked. And even then, you will still have SOOO much to learn. A fresh 30, smurfs will eat you alive man and make you hate the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Cocoslashcrash2","date":"2016-04-03T11:11:40.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy says it all. I waited till I had 450+ wins before I played ranked and I don't regret it at all. I went from being unranked to gold 4, maining support. One thing I can definitely recommend to improve is watching high elo streamers and professional players and just listening to the advice they give, even if they don't play the same roles you do. I found Nightblue3 in learning match ups and warding patterns as well as just the game in general as he explains a lot of the plays he makes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-02T11:06:26.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you just hit level 30 my main advice would be to wait a couple of months before playing ranked. So many players (including myself) start ranked straight after 30 and get placed in low bronze. Some are stuck there forever due to stubbornness and the inability to adapt (hence elo hell).\n\nIf you insist on playing ranked, my main points would be:\n\n* **stick to champs you are comfortable** with, **but** be sure that the champ pool for the roles you play is able to cover weaknesses in your team. This means having a tanky champ, a champ that provides CC, as well as one of each AD and AP.\n* **Ward up**. Ward the map (the support isn't going to do everything for you) and make sure you are constantly looking at the minimap.** Ping if you see an enemy, ping if you want an objective**. This will also help you play safely as you can predict ganks.\n* **If you lose a game, take a break for a while**. Remember that the past is in the past and there is nothing you can do to change it. No point getting tilted.\n* If you encounter a toxic player (highly likely tbh), mute them and report them in the end of game screen. Every report counts! One thing I would advise is not to reply to them, as it will most likely distract you. **Remember: meeting negativity with more negativity will never help the situation.**\n* Be encouraging in chat. Even if it's just a \"gj :)\" or a \"nice one\", you'd be surprised by the amount it helps your team remain positive. \n* Make sure your runes and masteries are efficient. Take a couple of hours to look at your champs and go through some guides to make sure everything is in order.\n* Build to the conditions (e.g, if every lane is losing, don't build devourer. If the enemy team is full ad, don't rush spirit visage)\n\nIf you do get placed in \"elo hell\", it's fine and it is completely possible to get out.

I completely get where you are coming from. The only issue with relying on OP champs is that they will often get banned/picked or they may not be the best to suit your particular team comp. Meta is always changing and what is OP one month will be completely different the next. \n\nPlaying champs you are comfortable playing is generally a better idea (IMO) than picking up the FOTM champs. I have seen so many players potate because they picked an \"OP\" champ that was left open, only to realize that once in game they had no idea how to play the champ. This is also made worse when you come up vs the majority of players who will be playing their comfort picks. \n\nTL;DR OP champs are fine but you have to be careful of pick/ban/meta shifts. Good idea to supplement existing champ pool with an OP champ or two, rather than completely rely on them.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-04-02T13:35:53.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:11}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:10}} who is very good atm maby more powerful then yi {{champion:420}} {{champion:96}} {{champion:78}} {{champion:106}} {{champion:238}} did I say zed I don't think I did{{champion:238}}  \nand dw I main {{champion:23}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:24}} now you can hate me","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-02T21:22:43.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tryn and jax are fine.
