Heard of   kha'zix? Yeah his title is the voidreaver. And the names of the abilities are weird. Void pool? Rift pool? Void Rift is just copying vel'koz W. And the ult void swarm. Tldr, many voids and I'm sorry to say but not much creativity. \n\nWhat on earth does a void rift have to do with someone becoming invisible? And a swarm is like a swarm of insects, not a portal. And 5/10/15 s taunt? That is so op. Pls nerf numbers. Same thing for W. What does a pool of voidness have in relation to healing? and passive...seriously? A stalker? That has absolutely nothing to do with increased range. \n\nThis really just seems like a bunch of random ideas thrown into one crazy champ. He can't be a mage because there isn't any combo on him. Look at vel'koz. His combo is perfect. E, w, q, ult. then I look at this champ and I can't find a combo suitable for him. What is it? Q and ult? Because that's the only damaging spell he has, unless you would want to E yourself, and you don't need the attack bonus. You're supposed to be using your abilities. My best guess is a support. His stealth and heal are for a support. \n\nBut before you think I'm a h8r, I have some stuff I like about this champ. His new ally stealth mechanic. That's cool. The bonus from your targets' ad and ap would be awesome. If he becomes a support he would synergise well with ezreal. I think with some tweaks to names and numbers he would be gr8","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T15:10:34.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, initially I thought Athal's primary role would be support.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2015-03-26T23:36:08.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah probably :/","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T16:22:11.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't wait for this champ's lore though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-26T16:19:51.941+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like this champion has awesome potential, abilities are interesting, but there are still some issues with it, namely all abilities having relatively high cooldowns especially in the early game, you may need to give this champion some autoattack damage buffs from abilities or with his base AD stat to offset this.\n\n* **Passive:**\nI feel that to better understand this, it would beneficial for everyone to know ability effect ranges and ability cast ranges. Though the range increase would still be a little redundant in my opinion unless it was only applied to a couple or one of the abilities. I feel that you should shift the Ability Power bonus passive (Plasma stacks) from W to here, have it apply to all of his abilities, but to offset that, increase the number of Plasmas required.\n\n\n* **Q - Rift Pool:**\nMaybe you could just rename it to *Pull*, it's more accurate and quicker to say and being less repetitive as well. Might need to reword your description here. Decent AP scaling, Base damage is probably too low for solo lane capability, but good for a support ability. Its cooldown is pretty high in its first couple of ranks. I suggest Rank 1 = 10 seconds, so he can use this to escape after engaging or to re-engage into fights. Considering that it's his only CC ability aside from his ultimate. Other than reducing its mana cost you could add mana refund per champion hit (unless you increase Base damage to mage-like type, I foresee strong waveclear potential).\n\n\n* **W - Void Pool**\nDoes the Lifesteal and Spellvamp bonus apply to himself?\nHow does it (if it does) interact with {{item:3065}}? \nI feel that you should add AP scaling with this ability, maybe make it higher than Q scaling or just increase base healing. Also, weird that a void champion would like to heal, (but whatever, your choice). Mana cost, a tad bit too high at rank 1, especially since there is no AP scaling on it.\nThe bonus AP might be a bit low, maybe increase it to 7, I estimate that it would take him about 3-5 mins to get a stack, (if it's only tied to this ability, see **Passive** above.) For 50 health, it's cooldown and mana costs are pretty damn high to be frank. \n\n\n* **E - Void Rift**\nCan he use this ability on himself (that would really help him be more independent)?\nIMO, name's kind of odd. Something in the line of *\"phase\"* or *\"shift\"* would be more fitting. The damage and movement speed bonus is fine with me. The invisibility is a little bit over the top at early ranks. {{champion:121}}'s ultimate gives him 1 second invisibility, more relevantly {{champion:67}} is also 1, given that she ults, and they are already quite strong. {{champion:29}}'s Q give him an attack speed boost. \nThe cooldown though is really high, for giving 50%+ ad on next attack, it seems like a counterintuitive escape ability because I believe that  you plan to have this ability be an escape. It would be unwise keep the invisibility time and the cooldown this long and high.\n\n\n* **Void Swarm**\nThe taunt time is OP, getting exponentially more OP the higher its rank. Athal is not even remotely tanky, so unless you plan to redirect some of the damage he's going to take, then this is kind of stupid, especially since his whole kit is leaning towards support against ADCs. \nYou should probably scale its damage with AP as well, 20 or 35 damage per second is not going to do anything, really. \n\n\nOverall Athal needs a more consistent CC source so that he can peel for his ADC as well as help his ADC escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-05T22:20:50.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you probably know better how it would work in-game but his kit is just all over the place lol. just my opinion though","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-06T07:21:14.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support siege based champ that's how it ties Is stealth helps the ADC do an 150% AD strike   Or a getaway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-05T09:46:03.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stats up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-04T22:59:22.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay so the thing that confuses me is his passive is over powered if on an AD based champion due to crit smashing his lane opponent.\nbut if it was enabled by damage via abilities it would make more sense as it's not pretty much always active.\n\nhis W seems to be a zz'rot portal with a different passive and I think it would be a bit weird. not to mention made more uninteresting by being similar to malz.\n\nperhaps you could make it summon an explosion bubble somewhere in a short range that knocks enemies that get hit back.\nhis E is a good ability but it doesn't make sense with his kit. as a caster, he doesn't add anything to the lane unless he has an ally (so support)\nbut he is obviously built around a solo lane (from his W and passive).\n\nI would consider placing the E as a self activate or maybe 50% armour penetration for the next X amount of attacks/ magic penetration for the next ability.\n\nhaving a mage that was buffed by stealth would be interesting.\n\nhis ultimate sounds good, but again it kind of takes chunks out of the other parts of the game.\nI would make it so it summoned a void portal on the ground doing 130% of his ability power to an enemy and stunning them when it closed up.\n\nbalance it out by making him medium ranged with mild amounts of health, more on the squishy side. \nthis means he can be out ranged and out bursted, but with his kit he can amp up the damage late game.\nI think its reasonable considering how easily he can pop someone with his ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-05T04:59:53.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm thanks but I want him as a siege based support, I'll try and change the R","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-05T05:15:06.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated","replies":[]}]}]}]}
