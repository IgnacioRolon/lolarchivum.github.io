Basically since the rework, hes worked fairly well. I don&#039;t have any complaints about his passive, or his w, e and r. However I can&#039;t help but feel that the heal on his Q is a bit in the op zone. The current amount is just crazy, especially on an ability that has a relatively low cd and is incredibly easy to hit with.\r\n\r\nThe heal itself on that ability is fine, but the amount does need to be dropped. I suggest halving it from what it currently is. We can then see how it goes from there.","replies":[]}
