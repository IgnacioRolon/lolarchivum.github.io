He has poor cooldowns and when you use 2 abilities on an opponent (qw) you are better of auto attacking that is how bad his damage is early game. i am not asking for him to go back to the old nerf but at least give fizz a small buff on his q or w so it is possible not to lose lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-10T05:47:33.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go ad fizz","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-10T06:07:43.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Riso,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=oyqAAYfb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-02-10T05:47:33.630+0000)\n>\n> Go ad fizz\n\nThis AD Fizz is the new playstyle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-10T06:01:35.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He doesn't need a buff, fact is at 6 he can insta gibb pretty much anyone, so his problem is his early power (cause every champ should have a weakness) and even that is taken away cause his E is a free escape.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Destucto","date":"2015-02-10T05:39:23.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi","replies":[]}]}
