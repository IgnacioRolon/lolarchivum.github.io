Despite the description in the patch notes specifically saying &quot;on **_damage_**/attack on a champion or structure&quot;\n\n2) Teemo&#039;s mushrooms now get popped occasionally by wards, though it only seems to happen sometimes.\n\nI suppose this is a current continuation of riots trend to not allow any non meta roles to be picked anywhere else. Just a side note, while the changes seem small this results in around 500-1000 less gold for teemo over the course of a game","replies":[]}
