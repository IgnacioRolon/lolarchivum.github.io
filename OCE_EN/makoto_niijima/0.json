First of all, why would you make the bonus map, a map that was taken away from OCE because it was never played, then bring it back as a way to get more points, PLUS, you only get 6 points for a win rather than the 10 you would get from Summoners Rift or Howling Abyss. It was in my honest opinion, a dumb mistake to make Twisted Treeline the bonus map. It was made the bonus map for one of the most wanted rewards.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T11:24:28.151+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE has had twisted treeline for over the entire year I've been playing?

It's actually been pretty consistent over the past year. That said, it's been made available for a full 48 hours (both normals and ranked) while the bonus map is set to TT (as opposed to 3pm-1am for either normals or ranked). What's more, games on TT have a lower average length when compared to SR, which helps counteract the fact that there's only 3 people winning each game as opposed to 5. And if that wasn't enough, the total HP of today's monster is 7,500 less than yesterdays.\n\nAll things considered, it's not like there's anything being missed out on by making TT the bonus map for a couple days.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-02-01T12:07:34.746+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its fine. There are 7 bosses and you only need to get 5 wins + final boss fight and 20 points (HP) in order to unlock everything.\nThe same thing happened last year where the community \"failed\" against 1 thing but still managed to unlock everything.\n\nThe thinking may be, that Riot want to entice people to try out TT. Making it a bonus map makes it more appealing to people who simply dont have an interest in that game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Lurenza","date":"2017-02-01T15:41:01.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.

Or forget to have a jungler or complain about you jungling since they have a 2v1 lane (which is actually beneficial because they will level faster and I can pressure top, enemy altar, and visit bot to support when needed, whereas the enemy doesn't have as much flexibility).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-01T11:24:55.346+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure you only get 1 point for a win on any map, and if that map is on bonus day it becomes 2 points.

I don't play the new TT pretty much at all, but the last couple times I did try the mode the matches were like 15 minutes long assuming no deadlock matches.\n\nAnd even if the matches on TT are the same length as SR, it's not like you're losing anything in particular since it's just like playing on SR but with 3 people instead. And you earn the same amount of points per win.","replies":[{"poster":"Makoto Niijima","date":"2017-02-01T12:10:40.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You dotn earn the same amount of points....

Well yeah there is a difference in that one you're right, I didn't notice that's what you're referring to.\n\nBut hey, as someone else has mentioned, the monster for today has less HP than the previous one. And with 20 min left and 4k points to go, I think we could manage, even just barely. Even if we do fail, there is a second wind so no worries really. Then it's all happily ever after with the bonus map on SR.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
