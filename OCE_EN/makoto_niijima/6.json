People are trying to find out what is wrong with their games by creating discussions in the &quot;help&quot; and &quot;support&quot; section of Riots boards and yet NOTHING has been done in there for 6 HOURS! Some people can&#039;t play what they want to play simply because we aren&#039;t getting a response! Where are the Wrenchmen? Where are the Riot employees? We can&#039;t answer our own questions, It&#039;d help if somebody did.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-06T10:21:19.064+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude, I know that your frustrated and you want some quality League time, but you have to understand that the Wrenchmen, like the Emissaries and Instructors, are volunteers. We have jobs and other commitments like everyone else, we don't get paid for this and can't be on boards 24/7 to respond. \n\nMost help and support threads are typically answered each day, which is far better than what it used to be, and far faster than player support usually can be. The Wrenchmen especially are the busiest of of irl so it isn't in any way fair to expect 6 hours to be too long. They have to sleep sometime.\n\nAs for Riot, Riot OCE is pretty small scale, and they just don't have the resources to respond a lot. Often what they do respond to on boards will eat into their own time and they do it where they can because they care about the players.\n\nI feel perhaps you are expecting too much of people with too little time who do this voluntarily, please consider that. We help where we can.","replies":[{"poster":"Makoto Niijima","date":"2016-05-06T11:12:01.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, here is the link to what I'd like assistance with. http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/PWNb8n3c-ranked-still-broken","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-06T11:24:22.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you (I did see the post) anyone who I might be able to get to answer it are asleep or otherwise unavailable atm.
