Throughout the laning phase, the enemy laner will be forced to decide whether or not it's worth walking into her White Ashes to deny her the buff at that location. Which culminates in her ult, when the enemy realises just how far they have trespassed into her ashes.\n\n-------------\n\nWhen she was young, Ingrid was a prodigy at fire magic, and she was fascinated by the dancing flames. One day, when she was practicing a particularly high level spell, she lost control, burning down her home and family. Stricken with grief; suffering from terrible burns; and scared that she would be executed for the murder of her family, she fled, vowing to herself to never use her fire magic again. \n\nAs she grew older, she discovered something of an affinity for ashes, eventually learning ash magic, which she considers the highest form of fire magic. Now, in her old age, she seeks to teach her ash magic to anyone that will listen to an old woman&#039;s ramblings.\n\n**Passive: Ashes of the past**\n_Standing here almost reminds me of home_\nWhen standing on **Scattered ash** gains 10% movement speed, +5-10% AP, and +5-10% MR.\n\n**Q: Burning ashes**\n_The ashes burn hotter the the flames_\nThrows white hot ashes in target direction, if they hit an enemy deals 50-200 (+0.3 AP) damage on impact and 30-180 (+0.2 AP) over the next 3 seconds. If the ashes miss, they mark the ground underneath the endpoint as **White ash**\nIf an enemy walks over **White ash** they are dealt 20-150 (+0.2 AP) damage over the next 3 seconds. If no one walks over **White ash** for 5 seconds, the ground becomes **Scattered ash** for the next 2 minutes.\n\n**W: Ashen shield**\nIngrid creates a shield of ash around her that blocks 60-200 (+0.6 AP) damage for the next 1-2 seconds. When the shield wears off, turns a small area around her into **Scattered ash** for the next 1 minute, area changed is doubled if the shield is destroyed before it wears off.\n\n**E: Immolate**\n_Life is but a moment away from ash._\nIngrid attempts to incinerate target enemy, dealing 30-120 (+0.3 AP) damage. If **Immolate** kills the target enemy, turns the ground around them into **White ash**. Deals double damage to minions.\n\n**R: Memories of the Inferno**\n_Even ash remembers what it was like to burn_\nIngrid channels for 1 second ignites all the **Scattered ash** within a large area around her, dealing  30-60 (+0.2-0.4 AP) damage per second to all enemies standing on **Scattered ash**, after 5 seconds the ignited ash explodes dealing 100-200 (+0.3-0.7 AP) damage to all enemies standing on **Scattered ash** within range.\nAll ignited ash is consumed.\n\nTaunts:\n\nTo enemy Brand\n_You seem to be burning. I can fix that for you._\n\nTo enemy Freljordian\n_I fear not what the ice brings._\n\nTo enemy Annie\n_It&#039;s like looking at a younger, stupider me._\n\nTo enemy Leona\n_The sun burns all to ash.

I thought I felt a cool breeze._\n\nTo enemy Maokai\n_You'll make some lovely ash._\n\nTo enemy Sejuani of Lissandra\n_You should surrender now. You were already having trouble with ash before I showed up_\n\nTo enemy Ashe\n_Who would trust the ashes to protect the ice?_\n\n_I'll help you to look more like your namesake._\n\n**Quotes**\n\nOn walking\n_I'm hobbling as fast as I can._\n\nOn buying Hextech items\n_Would call this a gizmo, or a doohickey?_\n\nOn buying Rabadons Deathcap\n_Now THIS is a hat._\n\nOn buying Liandry's Torment\n_Will this make more children scream at the sight of me, or less?_\n\nOn killing with her ultimate\n_Scatter with the ashes!_\n\nJoke\n_Trespassers will be burnt. Survivors will be incinerated._","replies":[{"poster":"OrionTheHunter","date":"2016-07-18T04:52:26.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added some more quotes, and a short description of Ingrid's playstyle.","replies":[]}]}
