You had a few where you did well and a few were you slightly below your team; about half and half; I can see some point in that you've got alot of kill participation but also alot of deaths. You did dish out decent damage for your role but you didn't ward so much and in the games you lost, objective control wasn't that high. Also Silver V is a place where you're around the 1200 mmr which is somewhere between low silver and high bronze so I don't think it was much to do with players being boosted since I mean silver is kinda average statistically.\n\n Also 5 losses in 7 games is not statistically unlikely no matter what tier you are. Let's say each team has a 50% chance of winning, the odds of this losing streak happening in your next batch of 7 ranked games is around 10.16% which means it's not so unlikely that you'll get streaks like this.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-22T05:45:07.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also playing whilst angry is not a good idea since you'll be tilted and less likely to be able to calmly carry your team to victory and climb the ladder.","replies":[]}]}]}
