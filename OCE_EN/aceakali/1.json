They are the one complaining they cannot climb up bcoz in 30min of game then cant even get more than 50cs so stop ur stupidity and let other solo players enjoy the game, so players don&#039;t lose their division \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-15T00:24:15.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Troll or nah?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-15T17:42:37.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, he's real.

If a silver was to duo with bronze, sure the bronze may feed the silver but as the same time the silver on your team can get fed off bronze on their team.\n\nPlus the OP seems to be forgetting that Silver is just Bronze skill level but with bragging rights. SII and up is when it starts getting decent.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-19T12:44:51.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=lpyENwdm,comment-id=000000000001,timestamp=2016-05-16T08:59:50.925+0000)\n>\n> ...but it gives them bronze too at least.\n> \n> Not anyones problem that your bronze is shit and theirs is better.\n\nThey don't have any bronze, that is the point.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Rengorax,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=lpyENwdm,comment-id=00000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-05-17T07:34:32.740+0000)\n> \n> These games are rare.

Here's my original post again:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Main Line,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=lpyENwdm,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-15T17:42:37.452+0000)\n>\n> Like you&#x27;ll see a game with one team having 5 silvers and one team have 3 silvers and 2 bronze 4s or 5s.\n> \n\nSo the whole point of my post is that players are in totally different divisions, skewing the fairness of the teams. Need some examples, [check the image](http://i.imgur.com/1gDV1QM.jpg), its not just in Bronze/Silver. First image, a Gold 3 in with Silver 4s and 5s? I could understand if the other team also had a Gold player, but no. Second image had a Bronze 4 who was totally outclassed which you can see from their feeding, and the last image has a Challenger in with Platinums vs a vastly superior team, despite plenty of master level players in the need to mention 40 minute (!) queue (he can tell from his friends list). Some skilled games would be nice, not just stompings most of the time in one direction or another. Some consistency would be nice, this dynamic queue is skewing everything stupidly.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"AceAkali","date":"2016-05-16T08:01:31.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha so true, had last game 3 bronze bcoz of that one s1 guy duo with b5 guy lead to 2 silver 3bronze against my enemy team with s1 and s2 players, I love how RIOT make matchups <3","replies":[]}]}]}]}
