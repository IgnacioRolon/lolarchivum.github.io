When I was high silver I used to play with my bronze 5 friend and our games were usually averaging bronze 2-Silver 3.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T21:09:34.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like the [Interesting Thread] tag you added to the title... for a thread that isn't really very interesting at all, just a misunderstanding.\n\nFood for thought?
