Such as, \"you're getting rekt in lane, perhaps you should tank up a bit instead of building full damage?\", etc. Don't just bitch \"you're a noob, uninstall you retard\".\n\nOften, people who claim that assholes are everywhere, are themselves the asshole, causing the problem.\n\nMaybe you are in Bronze 5 (just a guess, based on your attitude) for a reason, because you are offensive and put your own team on tilt. Perhaps if you start being helpful and encouraging, you can grind your way up to a level where players don't troll so much.\n\nIf this is too much to ask, perhaps team games aren't for you, there are plenty of solo games available elsewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-05T03:17:24.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"OP mad.\n\nCya buddy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-05T02:48:55.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Good riddance, honestly.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-05T12:25:46.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't GIT MAD GIT GUD SON!\n\nEnjoy ur ban kid :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
