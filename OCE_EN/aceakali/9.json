Seems like if it works in plat or above its fine strategy, well duhh majority of people there are of similar skill level so sure it seems balanced. if it don't work at the bottom it don't work ;) for how many YEARS have people complained about this.....? why not advance the match making and advise the player that current games would not be balanced at that time asking if they would like to proceed instead of sticking randoms together or one advanced player per team 2 intermediate and a beginner, its not like the advanced will be laning against the other teams advanced player, chances are they will be versing the beginner so to speak. \n\nque dodging; if 4 people pick a random bunch of squishy champs I should have the right to back out of a game. and not wait for another 5, 15, 30? minutes. qq because you are probably one of those.\n\nwhat I am really tired of is bringing up legitimate issues just so people can make up excuse on riots behalf as to why there apparently is no issue or just trash talk instead of looking at the issues and discussing them like what this board was actually meant for in the first place. \n\nstatistics; 5% of the oce community show bad behaviour or trash talk? where did that figure come from? try above 60% without question. banning? usually banning the person getting bullied by the premade reporting them as a group who initially instigated the issue.\n\nlol and make suggestions or take a survey limiting you to what you can suggest about, why not an open page for your customers to tell you what really needs addressing not just how they feel about the last patch.\n\nyeah can be a great game, can be, just isn't at the moment and hasn't been for a while. shame.","replies":[{"poster":"AceAkali","date":"2016-08-17T03:15:20.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"cant be bother to read this long msg \n\nif u short it up in 2 lines that would be great","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-17T05:21:41.639+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats not very nice.
