Because currently you are destroying the community for those who have just started who are looking to work their way up from the bottom. What&#039;s average league points for a win in bronze 14 and yet for the loss, the person loses 20+. You&#039;re making it very hard for those players to move up the ranks. Your expecting them to win at more than a 3/4 win rate. For bronze a genuine bronze player. They will never be able to move up and płay against better people who they can learn from. Instead cause the players lose more league points then what they would get for a win. Your pissing a lot of people off, who are better then the current rank they are but can&#039;t get out of it because you have smashed the chance for people moving up. It&#039;s just frustrating to see that your all talking about the higher ranking people and worried about those players. Those players were once at a bronze stage and riot is acting like they don&#039;t care about bronze players who a very small percentage of players will become good enough to play on the big stage. Your foundations and pathways to achieving that goal is slowly destroying the community and point of playing ranked. It will get to a point where if people are placed in bronze. Then they won&#039;t play ranked cause they know the loss rate is bigger then the win rate points.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-13T06:20:28.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got bronze 3 after placement and after a week I got back to silver V (Was silver 3 last year). The things I realized in bronze is that most player do not know the basics like warding, freezing lane and when to disengage etc. So I recommend playing a champ that you are really good with.\n\nChoose a champ you are good with > Get fed> Help other lanes>BOOM YOU WON THE GAME.\n\n\nThere was one game where I had to fizz jungle and my team was doing really bad until I played like it was my last game, ganked as much as I can and made sure to take advantage of the enemy who has no flash. I counter jungled and made sure I was aware where the enemy jungler was by warding alot.\n\n\nUpdate1:\n\nAlso, gold v mmr is 1400-1450 so it clearly shows that you are so far away from gold elo mmr and that is why you are getting silver team mates. Just reply to this if you have anymore questions concerning mmr, I would be glad to help :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-06-13T03:20:37.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its limiting us so we actually work for it, rather than trying 'freelo' champs, fuck it took me 4 years to get to silver and i climbed as a support main, if i liked any other role that would have been a lot faster, just play your best champs regardless of the %%%%s in ranked \n\n:)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-12T13:03:45.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, that only happens if you are below MMR, or negative MMR as I like to call it. Basically it is the games way, however shitty, of keeping you where you belong. If you are constantly rising, a 65% win rate is about how good you need to be to keep climbing. Anything lower than that and it will throttle your LP.","replies":[]}]}
