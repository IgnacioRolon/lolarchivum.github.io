It has a gtx960 4g for graphics and I get about 350fps mostly, except every minute or so I get an &quot;fps stutter&quot; were my fps will drop down to 15 in an instant and then only a second later shoots back to 350 instantly. The screen basically freezes for a second, causing me to die often when going in to fights. It happens when I turn down the graphics to a lower setting as well.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone has had similar issues and has found a fix. thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Hoopzenator","date":"2015-12-16T06:34:32.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what I am getting, I bought a new laptop with a 980m in it, should be running well over 200 fps, and it does, but it'sa micro glitch/stutter and it happens every so often in game, especially with a shoot a spell or place a ward or whatever.
