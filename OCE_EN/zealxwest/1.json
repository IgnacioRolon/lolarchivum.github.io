Like i know \"money\" is what most say, Morg{{champion:25}}  and Kayle{{champion:10}}  both have a fair few skins. Lets be honest though. The Kayle{{champion:10}}  rework in my eyes is a huge overkill and now i have to waste my ban on this stupid champ instead of being able to stop counter picks to my champ pool.  Like Kayle{{champion:10}}  doesn't even need to get ahead if she afks till 18 she would still be a uncontrollable monster...\r\n\r\nHeals, slows, Range, melee, Immune, Aoe, true dmg.... like they just threw the whole rainbow into her kit and was like \"yeah that will sell skins...?\" I just cant see the logic....","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-03-06T19:11:36.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Played a game, had a inting kayle, 0-5 at 12 minutes, no cs. randomly out of the blue starts 3-4 autos and the enemy adc, who was fed got blown the eff up. adc's are useless if the champ is in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Streeserz","date":"2019-03-06T06:26:50.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, Kayle's early game (before level 11) is worse than ever, and late game better than ever. They completely wrecked the champion. There was no need to change either of them, and Kayle's skins look terrible. Her champion size is still too small and the Aether Wing skin looks and feels like a 1350RP skin now.\nPatch 9.5 is a cesspool of stupidity. Nunu number nerfs (because \"he is too strong in soloqueue\"), and then Morgana buffs (just to make her stronger in soloqueue). I mean what was the reason for the update? Because Kayle was terrible? Well she's even worse now! Morgana was bad because she couldn't get in range to ult? I mean like Zeyzal says, don't balance champions to be good at everything. Morgana was perfectly fine before. Just because soloqueue monkeys couldn't get in range to frontline ult doesn't mean she needs a buff. She was being picked in competitive!\n\nBalance for challengers please and avoid stupidity. If Monkeys think champs are OP, they can still ban them until they get better at the game and understand why they are currently not the best. In the meantime just make champions semi-viable in soloqueue, that's all we ask. Even better, hire LS to be an advisor to the balance team. It's not hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-03-06T04:21:01.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Snowball early then","replies":[]}]}
