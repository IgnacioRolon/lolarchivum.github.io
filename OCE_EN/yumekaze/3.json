I&rsquo;d steal, feel no remorse for the family that needed this money. Just run, and going into the sewers, living off what had been stolen. That was my life, each night. No guilt, no pain, no family to turn to. I had nothing whilst all those around me had more. I needed to live. Fading into the shadows was all I could do as I was searched for. I thought I was safe, content. That was, until the death gauntlet began.\n\nEach night, the guilds of Noxus would send out mercenaries with &ldquo;invitations&rdquo; to join their guilds. I politely replied by dumping their bodies in the moat. A thank you of sorts. I was coated in their lives, their souls represented by the crimson stains upon my cowl and blade. These nights got more and more intense, as the assassins and mercenaries flocked for me like bees to their queen. Maybe that&rsquo;s what my bounty would get them.\n\nEach night, it was an endless sprint, to which the end was my life, and if I ever stumbled, the light would fade before me. The energy drained out of me and stress flooded in. Struggling to catch my breath amongst the slums, the other&rsquo;s who couldn&rsquo;t supply for themselves, I could only do what I did for myself, and watched people succumb to starvation or disease around me. I felt no sadness. No guilt. No duty. I knew my time would come, I couldn&rsquo;t do this forever.\n\nEach night was the same. Except tonight.\n\nMy usual performance began, with my first act being to steal from the biggest merchant in Noxus and run. Using the uneven bricks of the buildings as footholds, I leapt onto the roofs of the houses, silently and swiftly running across them, the full moon showing off my silhouette as I blinked, like a shadow. I jumped off the roof of a house five streets away and slipped into an alleyway, dark and with a strong stench. I quitened my breathing to the point where I may as well have been dead, and the near-noiseless scurrying of the rats was all the most able of hearing would notice. After I was sure the mob was gone, I released all the tension that had built up in me. That&rsquo;s when I noticed something was off. A strong aura of death, like the reaper surrounded me. I thought I was giving into my stress, so I laughed it off inside. My suspicions were confirmed, however, when a hooded figure descended from the roof above me and with his sword in hand, lunged for my throat. Act Two was about to commence.\n\nI staggered back, caught off guard by the sudden attacker, dodging the lethal part of the blade, but cutting into my skin, making it bleed. In just that one, swift movement I had known one thing; this assassin had technique better than any other who came for me. I had a feeling for once in my life; fear. I attempted to blend in with the shadows and sneak up behind him, possibly cut his throat so he would be silenced and bleed out, but I knew that was pushing it too much. But if I could get behind him, I&rsquo;d be able to slow him with the element of surprise and get him in his vitals. As I made my way to end his life and add one more to the lives that stained my soul, the assassin spun to face me, and we clashed blades. That plan wouldn&rsquo;t work, greatly astonishing me. &ldquo;Who was this?&rdquo; I said admiringly in my head. But no time for flattery, my life&rsquo;s on the line.\n\nI knew I had no choice anymore but to fight, no tricks, no games, just blade upon blade. The beautiful display of swordplay, as the glimmer from above made it all the more beautiful.  I dashed for his right leg, knowing if I cut nerves there, I&rsquo;d be guaranteed to end him as he bled there, I&rsquo;d give him the mercy of a quick death as honour for being so talented. Effortlessly, the mystery assassin rolled backwards, dodging me and making me misstep as I nearly lost my balance. As I leant forward, nearly out of position, I aimed for his arm as I threw three daggers from belt. Alas, however, it was in vain as he blocked them with ease with his own mighty sword. Quickly, I took a standing stance and mocked him by saying,\n\n{{champion:91}} &ldquo;You bastard! Not gonna apologise for making me bleed earlier, huh? And after I thought you were so polite to come to me!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Nice fighting spirit kid, although I don&rsquo;t especially like hypocrites.&rdquo;\n\nWe both knew what to do. I put all my energy into this last strike. If I failed now, I knew I&rsquo;d be dead, or dragged into one of those hopeless guilds. I leapt onto the wall to my left, and quickly jumped off it, towards this assassin. This was our curtain call. As I got to within an arm&rsquo;s width from his heart however, my execution was interrupted. A sudden flash of metal appeared before me, as I was thrown from him by his sword, my own weapon rattling as it flew across the alleyway away from me. His sword was now in my face, ready to take me to Hell. I guess I deserved it after all.\n\n{{champion:91}}&ldquo;I guess this is it. Although I&rsquo;d like to know my killer&rsquo;s name before I die here.&rdquo;\n\nHe removed his hood.\n\n&ldquo;General Du Couteau. I shall give you a choice. Join the Noxian High Command, or be killed by it.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather save myself here, thanks. But I&rsquo;ll do it only under one condition.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Which is?&rdquo;\n\n{{champion:91}}&ldquo;I only take orders from you, &lsquo;Master&rsquo;.&rdquo;\n\nHe put his sword back in its scabbard and helped me up. He took me in. I was amazed by the condition of the house, the bookshelves, the candles, the furniture, everything. I was greeted by a more amazing sight than this, however. A beautiful girl, with scarlet red hair. She was about my age.\n\n{{champion:91}}&ldquo;Talon.&rdquo; I introduced myself.\n\n{{champion:55}} &ldquo;Hmm&hellip; I like you. Katarina. Nice to meet you.&rdquo; And she shook my hand. I saw the glimmer of killing instinct in her eyes.\n\nThere was another girl here, just as beautiful, with brown hair. She must be Katarina&rsquo;s sister, I&rsquo;d assumed. She looked quite a bit younger than me.\n\n{{champion:91}}&ldquo;Talon. Nice to meet you.&rdquo; I introduced myself again.\n\n{{champion:69}} &ldquo;Cassiopeia, likewise.&rdquo;\n\nI hoped I&rsquo;d manipulated them well. One day, I vowed, I&rsquo;ll escape this place, and be free again.\n\nAuthor's Note: Refers to the adoption of Talon into the Du Couteau's in the lore, as well as some other lore, a few references to in-game stuff here and there, stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:33:41.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That backstory was chilling and just so delicious to read :P Great atmosphere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yumekaze","date":"2016-07-07T11:02:59.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BTW, the word count on this is 1,111 words (main body, excludes the note I placed at the bottom).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Seagull","date":"2016-06-26T10:43:42.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I loooved this!
