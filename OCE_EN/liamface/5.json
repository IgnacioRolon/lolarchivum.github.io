Lifesteal/Spellvamp effects used against Aleksis are slightly decreased. Every 6th auto attack on an enemy champion gives her a small percent of health back based on the enemy's current HP.\n\n**Q - Blood Spike**\nSmall AoE skill shot ability with short range (*think of Karthus*)\nIf Blood Spike kills a champion, the range is temporarily increased (3/4/5/6/7 seconds) and the cooldown (15/13/11/9/8) is reset. Blood Spike does extra damage based on the amount of Plasma Infection stacks. If a champion is killed with Blood Spike, the Plasma Infection is spread to nearby champions within a certain radius for the same amount of stacks on death. \n\nBlood Spike does 20/35/50/80/100 (+100% AP) magic damage.\n\nBlood Spike does 10/20/30/40/50 magic damage per Plasma Infection stack, and remove all stacks once used.\n\n(Note: *This ability isn't meant to be a hard hitting ability on its own. If an opponent is careless and gains significant stacks of Plasma Infection, then the damage will be significantly more as a consequence*).\n\n**W - Plasma Control** \nPassive - Attack speed and attack range increase with the amount of Plasma Infection stacks near her.\nActive - Draining health per auto attack allows for an on-hit debuff (caps at 25) called 'Plasma Infection'. This ability does 30 attack damage (+70% AD) on hit.\n\n5 stacks - Blood Spike cooldown reset (When ability is used) and health cost negated.\n10 stacks - Inflicts Grievous Wounds.\n20 stacks - Reduces armour and magic resist by 10%\nEach stack lasts for 3/4/5/6/7 seconds and is refreshed by additional auto attacks and abilities.\n\n\n**E - Hemo-Transfer **\n Aleksis quickly implodes into a floating body of blood, moving herself towards a direction before reanimating herself from the blood. Cost: HP  - Does no damage. Can be used up to 2 times within the first 3 seconds of activation. (**To clarify** Distance is intended to be short range, enough to dodge a thin skillshot, but shorter in distance than most movement abilities). Untargetable during the quick blink, but can still be damaged by auto attacks. Can be hit by abilities directly before and after the blink (see: Tristana rocket jump)\n\nCooldown: 25/23/20\n\n**R - Sanguine Ritual **\nTarget cannot be attacked by opposing players except for Aleksis (4/5/6 seconds). Deals 100/200/300 (+50% ability power) on use, and gives the target the 'Sanguine Haemorrhage' debuff, which burns the target's HP down depending on the distance they travel (the debuff shows how much health is going to be lost over time). The target leaves a visible trail of blood.\n\nLevel 1 damage cap: Deals 75 bonus true damage over 4 seconds.\nLevel 2 damage cap: Deals up to 125 bonus over 5 seconds.\nLevel 3 damage cap: Deals up to 225 bonus over 6 seconds.\n\nEvery 150 units the target champion moves, the target loses 2.5% of their maximum health.\n\nDamage ticks are decided by every 150 units the target moves.\n\nLasts for 4/5/6 seconds.\n\nCooldown: 120/100/80\n\nArt:\n\nI added a basic drawing I did of Aleksis - **please keep in mind I don't draw**, but I wanted to give people a basic idea of what she looked like.\n\n**Lore - **\nComing Soon.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-09T05:14:13.857+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aleksis' ultimate is somewhat close to Bloodseeker's ultimate in Dota2...\n\nStill, I like the idea, cuz you can have a ton of synergy with knock back champions, like Lee Sin for example, forcing them to 'move' to take more damage or something like a Blitzcrank grab, also forcing 'movement'","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-09T05:47:30.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got me ;) ..

The proposed ability moves less distance and costs health per use before being put on a cooldown. Do you think it's unfair in any way?
