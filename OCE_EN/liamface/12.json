Or am I able to get my order changed to that? It would be greatly appreciated because I had no idea if I waited another 4 days I would have had another rune page for the same price.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T23:46:18.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wasn't the announcement made *well* before that date?","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-01-25T11:09:12.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=Gar0zrEE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-24T23:46:18.874+0000)\n>\n> Wasn't the announcement made *well* before that date?\n\nPossibly? Although I thought they made the announcement of the RP sales well before the date, I don't remember reading about rune page sales.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T07:20:36.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I had a look through the website. The announcement for the double rune pages is [here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/2015-season-kickoff-sale). It was posted on the day it came out. My bad on that part, I got it confused with the RP sale.\n\nYou should be eligible for the extra page then, if you send in a support ticket and ask them nicely. Keep some screen-shots proving the purchase handy.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
