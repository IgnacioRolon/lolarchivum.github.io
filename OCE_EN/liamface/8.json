It's recently just come to Kickstarter.\r\n\r\nTrials of Ascension is an MMORPG that seeks to create a world where you can live through your character and actually contribute to that world. The developers have said that they aren’t trying to make a game that pleases everyone, which I think is really commendable considering the current state of MMORPGs. There are many unique aspects to this game (that may or may not be worrying for people who haven't experienced it), so I encourage everyone to look into this game and to join the discussion.\r\n\r\nI have been a member of the ToA community for a while now, and honestly the community and developers are amazing and kind people (the staff at Forged Chaos are as equally awesome as our OCE staff).\r\n\r\nI'm more than happy to answer questions or provide links/etc to any questions you guys might have.\r\n\r\nThe link is a referral link (http://trialsofascension.com/ks.php?ref=197461) - so if you don’t feel comfortable using me as your referee to the Kickstarter campaign, an alternative link is here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/forgedchaos/trials-of-ascension","replies":[{"poster":"Blackavar","date":"2015-02-21T06:26:05.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks pretty cool, first time i've heard of it but i hope it will be free","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-21T06:40:03.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=astrapoof,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=w2ebV8o8,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-02-21T06:26:05.716+0000)\n>\n> Looks pretty cool, first time i've heard of it but i hope it will be free\n\nI know there is going to be a free trial option, but the plan for now is to have a monthly subscription. \n\nIt would appear that it would be around $12 USD a month. They are also considering $8/month and $15/month.","replies":[]}]}]}
