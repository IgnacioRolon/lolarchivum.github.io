I could totally see this being a legendary {{champion:53}}  skin).\n\nTo avoid copyright issues this could totally go along with the superhero theme (e.g Super Teemo amd Super Rumble) and be called Super Blitzcrank.\n\n**Q** - Similar to iBlitzcrank except his fist blasts off with fire effects\n\n**W **- The red wings on his back expand out as shown in the picture as Blitz jetblasts along.\n\n**E** - (Not 100% sure what could be done for this ability) Fist glows red with small puffs of steam coming out around the wrist joint of his armour.\n\n**R** - Blue electricity explodes out from his core as his armor magnetizes off of his body (exposing the normal rusty blitzcrank under his superhero armour).\n\n**Passive** - When the passive is down the purple/parts that aren't red lose their colour and go gray.\n\n**Recall **- Blitzcrank poses with his fist in the air as his jetpack opens and launches himself upwards.\n\n**Possible joke** (the video doesn't show the finished version of what he looks like)**:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVLA8fvBczg \n\n**Possible taunt:** \"On a scale of 1 to 10, what would you rate your pain?\"/\"What is your pain on a scale of 1 to 10?\" (see: video below)\n\n**Ideas for general chatter:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R1R7_EgkFI \n\n**Death animation**: All armour falls off and interior body deflates.\n\n**Concepts of Baymax/Super Blitzcrank:**\n\nhttp://imgs.tuts.dragoart.com/how-to-draw-baymax-from-big-hero-6_1_000000019941_5.png\n\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/918Th61HzWL._SX355_.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-29T12:11:12.950+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot please make this!! everyone who plays blitz will buy this!! please!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-01-29T08:17:52.525+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't do it!

Riot has been able to make skins from other franchises without any issues, and I don't think they'll be calling the skins 'Baymax Blitzcrank'. I imagine they'd have some room to work with as it does follow a theme already present in the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-29T08:32:28.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"copyright issues.","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-01-29T08:40:44.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Wumachine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=dZ03lE4g,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-01-29T08:32:28.741+0000)\n>\n> copyright issues.\n\nAn idea has to start from somewhere, right? There are other skins such as Mecha Malphite, Mecha Aatrox (Pacific Rim), Popstar Ahri (came from a post on the NA forums requesting a Girls Generation Ahri skin), Super Teemo, Super Rumble (Gurren Laggan), (etc etc) all have taken ideas from someone else's material (It's not necessarily a bad thing). \n\nI'm just trying to throw out some ideas because a skin following this theme for Blitzcrank would be pretty awesome. It wouldn't be the first time Blitzcrank has a skin based off of something that isn't completely related to LoL lore *cough* iBlitzcrank.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-30T01:04:41.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even like {{champion:8}}'s Nosferatu skin was taken from the first vampire movie made in 1922!
