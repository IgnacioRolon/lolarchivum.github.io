I joined back in around 5-7 minutes and continued playing. I did really well and almost basically carried my team to victory when at the end of the game i gained no LP and not just that, I lose LP. \n\nI shouldn't LOSE LP because my internet cut out for a short period of time. I basically lost around 34 LP because my internet cut out for 6 minutes. This is really irritating especially for those who cut out for no at all reason. Can you please adjust the system so i at least dont LOSE LP! thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Say No to Krugs","date":"2020-02-27T12:22:13.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow can you lose LP from  afk/ internet disconnection when you reconnect play and win? \nI understand not gaining LP and rewards in this situation but losing LP when you connect back , play and win is just wrong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-26T11:39:16.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The problem with a system like this is how easy it is to abuse.\n\nGame is lost? Just unplug your ethernet or turn off your wifi and you don't lose LP!\n\nOk, so how do we stop that? \n\nGive people only one per week? Probably still too much. Given that AFKing is a behaviour that is punishable, rewarding it is rather counter-intuitive, even if it is limited. \n\nMaybe one or two per account? Great, except at a certain age accounts are going to lose all sorts of protection. Newer accounts will maintain that protection but not loyal older ones who are arguably the ones you would want to protect more.\n\nAlso, consider the principle of protecting players from something that has harmed other players, whether it was intentional or not. While it would be nice, there is no good way to implement such a system. \n\nAlso consider that if it's one game here and there, it's basically meaningless in the grand scheme of your ranked season, and if it's more than one you aren't the kind of player that should have such protections.","replies":[{"poster":"PykeTilt","date":"2020-02-26T11:58:02.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won the game though. im not complaining that i disconnected and lost the game","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-26T12:04:08.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's true, but how often does such a case occur?\n\nLike I said, that single game is essentially meaningless over the course of a whole season, and you will likely only have one such game the entire season.\n\n\nIs it worth designing (and preventing abuse cases of) a whole system for something that happens so rarely and has only a short-term impact.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
