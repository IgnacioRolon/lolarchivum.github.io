Also when I play custom it works. I am using public wifi in a hotel. I do 1v1 with my friend in custom and that works. And when I do custom the ping is like 10-20","replies":[{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-03T08:49:03.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I am using public wifi in a hotel. \n\nThere's your problem. If it's public wifi more people are going to be using it therefore the connection may not be as strong. I suggest not playing until you get home.\n\nAs I've stated on many threads everyone agrees to a TOU and EULA agreement stating that the player must have a sufficient and stable internet connection to run and play the game. Riot cannot fix this issue as I presume its to do with the internet at the hotel. I doubt hotel internet can run a game such as League of Legends and still provide internet for all other hotel guests.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlimCognitoDude","date":"2015-10-03T08:43:16.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I got a low priority queue for that.","replies":[]}]}
