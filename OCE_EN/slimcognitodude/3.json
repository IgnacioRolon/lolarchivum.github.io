So Riot just removed bots from the abyss.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-06T09:40:51.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you serious............ Like not even kidding me?? He was vsing bots.. Ffs half the people bought two sets of boots??? It's people OUTSIDE of riot setting up bots.. With scripts set on how to play.. Notice their builds and the TWO pairs of boots?? Then look at the scores... And think hmmm this lvl 17 went 61/3/24........... Put 3 and 3 together and make 8 already.\n\nEdit. I LOVE how you've commented from your smurf.. I'm assuming you AND op are one in the same??","replies":[{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-06T10:21:03.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm commenting from my smurf because of someone who was cursing at some other guy telling him if your upset go kill yourself(because he said he was done) This is not the full story and I'm missing key bits because it is not necessary for everyone in this chat to hear. and I'm Mutley not this guy. \n\nNow that, that's over. Go ahead try vs bots in the howling abyss, because unless bots were recently added into the Howling Abyss It is impossible to verse bots.\n\nP.S. this Summoner is level 13 so he was probably versing brand new people how don't know about the 'Unique passives' on items that's the logical answer for why the other Summoners had 2 boots.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-06T16:50:22.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ps your trying to belittle me and you have no actual idea at all on what your talking about.. I KNOW you CANT play bots in aram (howling abyss) BUT it DOESNT STOP OTHER PEOPLE from using SCRIPTS TO BOT. But yeah sure 6 out of 10 people bought 2 pairs of boots and have a very similar build.. Yep just cause they are new.. As someone who JUST leveled a smurf... THERE ARE LOADS OF BOTS IN THE LOWER LEVEL ARAM CUES. Sorry to say.
