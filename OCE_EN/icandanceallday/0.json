The mere mention of their race as in &quot;gg chinese players&quot; ends up in me getting banned, it&#039;s happened on 4 of my accounts. I&#039;ve spoken to other people and they had this happen to. I think what is happening is that there are chinese people who control the punishments or whatever that department is, and whenever they see aussies retaliating to the toxic chinese players they just dish out bans. This is disgusting behavior and these toxic chinese players with their trolling and shit talk are ruining our server, we need action lads.","replies":[{"poster":"Ancient Scripts","date":"2016-09-23T22:10:11.018+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Asian invasion mate fucking every Chinese speaks in Chinese in game it feels like we're in China. OCE lol is fucked and has been invaded. Probably those in the tribunal are all fucking Chinese too so just quit the game and play something else. I personally don't like FPS but might go try Overwatch.\n\nOh and also make sure you report them at the end too so when they report you at least non Chinese mod might look into both of the conversations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-25T01:00:31.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"The Chinese\" do not control the punishments. The punishment system ([Instant Feedback system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)                  )) is automatic and punishes everyone equally and fairly.\n\nI know for fact that you did not get banned for just saying _\"gg chinese players\"_. I don't know what you're saying to these players but it's clearly not acceptable.\n\nIf you truly believe that your punishment is unjustified, then I recommend post your chat logs here as proof. If what you say is true, then I'll do my very best to see any punishments reversed. \n\nAlternatively you could also argue your case to [**Riot** support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new), using your chat logs as evidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Merladdin","date":"2016-09-24T23:43:41.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dont do it back, use the mute button","replies":[]}]}
