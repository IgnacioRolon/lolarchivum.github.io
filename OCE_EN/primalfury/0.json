They&#039;re playing to just win and not enjoy what they&#039;re doing. They&#039;re not going for crazy dives or anything.\r\n\r\nAnd then you check their player history, and its just 10 URF Ez games, every time. \r\n\r\nSo grats, you ruined the point of the mode to where its not fun, because unless you&#039;re also picking the same 10 deep pool of champs, you&#039;re probably just going to get crushed and not enjoy your 20mins of them farming you","replies":[{"poster":"WeakboyLuvLadies","date":"2015-04-03T22:51:53.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely, I understand what you mean.

I think it is just inherent and I am not sure you can fix it. \n\nAll you can do is not care about winning basicall these champions being dominant is only a problem because you want to win and have fun.\n\nAlso I find champions with spamable hard CC can be super dangerous and the best counter picks to hyper mobility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-04-04T10:41:01.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear OP, the same shit happened last year or did you forget?
