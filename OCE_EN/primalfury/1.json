Either they dont like how its going, or any number of reasons.\r\n\r\nThe system in place to 'gate' how often they can play, is pretty much not a problem to them. They're already willing to abandon a game, and go do something else while the game plays on without them, so what is another 20minutes while they just wait for the timer to finish then get into a new game.\r\n\r\nI've even talked to a few who have this gating. They dont care. They think its great there isnt an actual punishment for them other than time leaving the game open.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be implemented harsher penalties for people who afk games. Limit their IP on top of gating their games, something that actually affects them in games. Ban them from anything other than bots games for weeks.\r\n\r\nBut I'm just getting really frustrated that I get stuck in a 4v5, they other team thinks its great, and the person on my team who left faces 0 real punishment","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-24T06:56:05.298+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"people can dc, you going to punish them because of a storm? you have no soul.
