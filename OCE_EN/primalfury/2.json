Yes, you can randomly win 4v5s, but they're not easy to win, and more often than not you just get stomped.\r\n\r\nOften as well, opponents since they have such a clear advantage, like to drag out the game to really beef themselves up and crush you over and over. This prolongs the game, and your options are either get crushed, stand in the fountain and wait, or leave. The first two mean you are still locked into a game, wasting time. The 3rd can lead to you being punished.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see an option where you can leave the game, punishment free, if someone on your side has been d/c'd for a fair amount of time. It means you can go do something else, and encourages your opponents to end the game faster, as there might be only a few, or no opponents for them to kill. If someone has been gone for over 5minutes, usually the other team has gained a sizeable advantage, or more commonly, your ally just isnt coming back.","replies":[{"poster":"Phantasies","date":"2015-02-04T05:10:29.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know how this will work as the current way it works is it locks you to the game server for the duration of the game so that if the game crashes you can easily reconnect to it without issue. Everyone has been the person who fails to connect due to Bugsplats/crashes and once I reconnect it is usually fine... In essence I'm trying to say that I think this would cause more issues than it solves.\nI think at the moment too much is pushed on someone who leaves/DC's as it being their fault, We all know that it happens and I'm sorry your experiences with leavers has been bad but you know that there is a surrender button there... maybe it might be more prudent to lower the timer on surrendering? Or is it that you don't want the loss on your match history??","replies":[{"poster":"PrimalFury","date":"2015-02-04T05:15:03.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont mind a loss in my match history, but I can often have players who refuse to give up a clearly losing battle.

I would definitely be pro a system that detects a missing player and after 3 - 5 mins asks if the team missing a player wished to end the game (resulting as neither a win or loss).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-02-04T09:24:26.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what if he leaves for 5 minutes, then you leave, then they come back like 2 seconds after you left? bad idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-04T08:07:54.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"abusable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-02-04T04:55:51.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isn't that the system already present in dota 2?
