But I still had no S even if I had a positive score, a relative good CS, a good warding score and lots of tower participation ... I don&#039;t understand why Riot is using a system of comparison to other player to define our rank on the end of each match... {{champion:103}}  is a quite popular champ so getting S on her is quite difficult... not talking only because I&#039;m mad at last game but because I already saw some really good players that end like 20/0/12 and get ~200 farm can&#039;t get a S or sometimes not even a S-... Riot fix improve on your system please.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} {{sticker:sg-kiko}} ---------------------------------------------\n---------------","replies":[{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-06-08T08:31:31.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"190 CS in a 34 minute game isn't ideal so for an S. You want around 230-340 anywhere between there is optimal. And one of your games I noticed you only placed 1 if not, 0 Control Wards. They contribute highly to your S rank. I play on average 9.6 CS p/m and sometimes I don't even get an S, despite everything being perfect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-06-09T11:52:38.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably have a terrible **vision score.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-06-06T09:25:05.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what i saw of your ahri games, your weakness is CS, No matter how hard you try, no matter how good your score is, if you have less than a 6(cs/min) score, you're not going to get S (S- maybe, but not S or S+), you should be aiming for 7+(cs/min), that's why you're losing your S score \n\n\nJust a note: the amount of CS is not important, what's more important is the CS/Minute, 200cs may seem like a lot, but if your game goes for 80minutes.. it's nothing at all, while 150cs at 18minutes, is very good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-06-06T09:23:04.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assists and vision score seems to be favoured a lot","replies":[]}]}
