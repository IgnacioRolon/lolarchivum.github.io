Late \r\nb. And not calling quick enough \r\n\r\nand then \r\na. Can&#039;t see earlier calls and think they are right \r\nor \r\nb. Do not CARE, and lock in there champ anyway (even if other summoners agree that a person didn&#039;t get that lane)\r\n\r\nIt is putting a huge dampener on our game play experience, especially when we are the ones who are getting 15 minute + bans for not selecting champs, because we are to confused at what lanes people are going!\r\n\r\nI believe that the ranked lane selection needs to be implemented into norms, that way a third party is choosing the lanes for all the players, so there is no confusion as to who got the right lanes, this way also if someone doesn&#039;t go that lane they are allocated, they can be reported and since the server allocated a lane to the players, Riot can see that they were allocated e.g MID for that match, and ban the crap out of them because this is getting to much to deal with.\r\n\r\nIt is working for ranked and although Norms is no ranked, it still can use the same champ select system to help improve the overall league experience for more then just me and my friend.\r\n\r\nLet&#039;s make norms GREAT AGAIN cause it&#039;s really pissing us off!\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\nMillsy128\r\n\r\n&quot;I am the will of man unbound by flesh.&quot; - Xerath","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-06T03:43:55.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play Solo or Flex then...

At least in Norms I get _some_ chances arguing whether or not we could go unconventional, while with the Ranked queue format there is simply none.\n\nI'd rather the return of Teambuilder queue or Draft queue than either of those things discussed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-05-06T06:58:57.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When Flex queue was announced OCE was promised that Normal Blind Pick would be deleted and replaced with Normal Flex.\n\nBut obviously it will never happen.\nThere's no point complaining because Riot wont do anything to fix it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2017-05-06T06:53:23.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree with the op, sorry.

Or at least thinking about it? I don't remember the details of it, but anyway, apparently they're working on something that combines the role preference thing in draft, and the short champion select of blind.
