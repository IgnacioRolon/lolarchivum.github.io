I know people are just going to say &quot;omg you&#039;re just toxic shut up and suck it up riot is always right&quot;, but I&#039;ve been banned before and i&#039;ve thought &quot;yeah that&#039;s reasonable i was pretty toxic there&quot; but this honestly just seems like Riot is just looking for the smallest excuses to ban people. Read through and check the screenshots before making a judgement.\r\n\r\nScreenshots of the ban message below. I wasn&#039;t exactly the height of politeness i&#039;ll admit, but i definitely feel it&#039;s not worthy of a permaban or even a chat restriction punishment. They just gave that one game there as evidence and i wouldn&#039;t really call that &quot;extremely inflammatory and offensive&quot; as they say it is.\r\n\r\nBan message screenshots:\r\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zzJkv\r\n\r\nA bit of context, not to say &quot;my team deserved to get flamed&quot; but to show why i said what i said. Reason i called leo out for being silver is because she spent all of champ select saying i didn&#039;t know how to play the game and that bot was an instant loss because i picked jhin, then proceeded to flame me for picking jhin and spam ping me every single time anything went wrong in the actual game. I was 5-2 at the point i asked &quot;still hating on the jhin pick?&quot; and leo just said im trash and its cuz she carried the lane. A bit further on with the xin crying comment, we were taking the enemy&#039;s blue and xin missed smite on it so i got it, then he proceeded to just run into a 1v3 and die then blame botlane for it and call us shit. With the panth comment, i got flashed on by 2 of the enemies while defending a tower and got killed,  leo and xin flame and blamed me for it, so i was like why are you blaming me and not the the 2-8 top laner who&#039;s just farming enemy krugs while enemy team 5 man pushes our inhibs. I spent all game helping team where i could and focusing objectives and finished the game with the highest kill participation on the team. I know all this doesn&#039;t really mean anything but it&#039;s just context for this post so take it however you want. \r\n\r\nNo way to make anyone believe this, but most games i do make an active effort to be friendly and positive, encouraging team mates and telling them not to flame each other, i&#039;d say less than 10% of the games i&#039;ve played i have a negative attitude/chatlog, but then i have this game of relatively mild chat and I get permanently banned for it? I&#039;ve run into so many players who throw around racist slurs, non-stop swearing and literally telling others to kill themselves and don&#039;t ever get the &quot;a player you reported was punished&quot; for reporting those players, but i called someone silver a couple of times and said top didn&#039;t do anything all game and i get perma banned for it? Xin flaming the whole team and blaming everyone but himself for all his deaths, leo flaming all the way from champ select to the end of the game, and yet i get banned for this? What kind of system is this...\r\n\r\nIf i actually deserved to get banned then fair enough I&#039;ll admit i&#039;m wrong, but in this situation a permaban just seems overkill/unfair for a chatlog like that. If i was banned for being toxic in other games why not show those other games as evidence? System is outdated and makes no sense, OCE server has been up for so many years now, why do we still not have tribunal or proper player behaviour system in place? All we&#039;ve got is a completely automated system that doesn&#039;t take into account what players actually say, but rather bans people based on the number of reports they get and not actual bannable offenses..","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-03T06:19:35.637+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unfortunately, you can't expect any useful information from Riot about these sorts of bans, they refuse to tell us why they are getting over zealous with their banning, even when it's fucking absurd.\n\nThe general consensus i can give you from the bans we have been seeing;\n\nSit there and take it like the little bitch you are, because we at riot games don't give a fuck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-12-03T07:39:45.253+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'll do my best to explain why you were banned, there's a lot to cover though, so you might want to read it in parts :D\n\n___*\n\nThe question isn't _\"was my behaviour in just this specific game deserving of a permanent ban?\"_ as you seem to imply it is. You may disagree but that's not how permabans are issued. \n\nInstead the question is more like;_ \"am I frequently insulting others in chat and not changing my behaviour?\"_, if so then you get permabanned.\n\nThe escalation path is:\n\n> **First Offense**: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n> **Second Offense**: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n> **Third Offense**: Two Week Suspension\n> **Fourth Offense**: Permanent Suspension\n\nYou said that you have been _\"banned before\"_, which according to the escalation path tells me you're received at least 3 warnings before this permaban and failed to reform after every warning. **This is why you received a permaban for this game.** The system gave you multiple chances and you failed to reform.\n\n___*\n\nYou also said that this game wasn't even worthy of a chat restriction, but I definitely disagree and I think others will too.

No, but the bar is a bit higher than that in League. And to continuously display this kind of behaviour is unacceptable. \n\n___*\n\nYou also seem to imply that because Xin and Leona were breaking the rules, that makes you breaking the rules ok. This is not how it works. \n\nPeople insulting others does not give you the right to insult other people as well. You are judged for your actions only, and in this case your actions were not acceptable.\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope that explains things. As with 90% of cases I see on the boards, all of this could have been completely avoided if you had muted and just focused on winning the game. If you do choose to come back to League I **strongly** recommend you take this advice. \n\nAnd remember we'll always be on here to help if you want some tips on reforming :)","replies":[{"poster":"Aethereas","date":"2017-12-03T12:51:32.187+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll try to address all your major points.

He kept saying that picking jhin showed i didn't know how to play the game, like yeah i'll admit this was a little toxic but is it really so bad that i deserve to get banned for it?\n\n> \n> * You insult your entire team by saying _&quot;xd bad team&quot;_  and then insult another team mate by saying they have _&quot;done literally nothing all game&quot;_\n \nThe \"xd bad team\" wasn't directed at my team, it was directed at leona because she was blaming me for every thing that went wrong in the game. The \"xd\" was just poking fun at how saying your teams are bad is the \"classic silver excuse\" for why they can't get out of silver. Me pointing out that panth had done literally nothing all game wasn't directed at him or blaming him, it was me talking to leo and xin because i got dived by the enemies and killed trying to solo defend a tower, leo and xin flamed and blamed me for it, so i was like why are you blaming me and not the the 2-8 top laner who had fed all game, not showed up to a single teamfight and was just farming enemy krugs while enemy team 5 man pushes our inhibs. I had the highest kill participation on the team and had helped the team in every situation i could and yet they blamed me cuz i died from the enemy team dived me trying to solo defend a tower, I feel like it's reasonable to be a little indignant at that and point out what i did considering it wasn't aimed at panth and wasn't directly blaming him.\n\nThe chat logs are right there, I didn't say anything negative to the other players in the game. It was only xin and leo and they were both flaming me from champ select, inting, swearing at me, calling me shit and blaming every single little thing in the game on me. They do all that and receive no punishment, I call leo silver and say that xin was crying and that means I deserve a ban?\n\nThis just proves the point that context is sometimes more important than what is actually said. Automated system is a bad idea but riot just refuses to acknowledge or try to fix it. \n \n> * You then on multiple occasions you say Xin is _&quot;crying&quot;_, spending _&quot;all game blaming others&quot;_, and spending _&quot;more time flaming than helping&quot;_. Whether this is true or not, you&#x27;re clearly just saying this to escalate the situation and insult him.\n\nDo you honestly think those things deserve a ban? The guy was literally flaming me for the entire game and int'd after he missed smite on a blue buff and you're saying i deserve a ban for saying he was crying and flaming his team? You calling me an asshole in your comment is more toxic than what I said to xin that game...\n\n>You said that you have been \"banned before\", which according to the escalation path tells me you're received at least 3 warnings before this permaban and failed to reform after every warning. This is why you received a permaban for this game. The system gave you multiple chances and you failed to reform.\n\nThe last punishment i got was a 2 week ban which i received  over a month before this perma ban. It was long enough for me to have unlocked honor again and start earning loot boxes. I had literally played hundreds of games between the last punishment and this one, but riot doesn't care about that. The way riot seems to be working, you could play 380 games perfectly behaved or with no chat at all but if you're passive aggressive in the other 20 you deserve a permaban. The system giving \"multiple chances\" is just 3 chances, that's it, it doesn't matter how many games you play well behaved, even if less than 1% of your total games played have some slight toxicity in it the automated system will still ban you. \n\nThe system is flawed and is banning people for things that are barely even bannable offenses. Riot is refusing to implement tribunal or even personally review bans put in by the automated system and you're still praising them and acting like this is all working perfectly fine. Yeah i get that it's \"just a game\" and not real, but the money that people spend on the game is very real and to have riot permanently ban accounts that have had hundreds of dollars spent on them through an automated system that doesn't take into account anything but keywords and volume of reports is ridiculous.\n\nhttps://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/tribunal-oce\n\nThis post was made 4 years ago. 4 years. 4 years ago they said they would sort this out and put tribunal back into the game but they just haven't bothered to do it. How could it possibly take 4 years to \"improve\" and \"update\" the tribunal system? Riot has made so many huge changes to the game in the past 4 years but they couldn't update/improve the tribunal system in that time? It just doesn't add up. Something is wrong with the system and riot isn't bothering to fix it because **they don't care about the players anymore**. Sad but unfortunately there's nothing anyone can do about it if riot refuses to even acknowledge that there's a problem :/","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-12-03T23:32:22.123+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> _\"yeah i'll admit this was a little toxic but is it really so bad that i deserve to get banned for it?\"_\n\n  + Yes. As I explained before **frequent** unacceptable behaviour is why you were banned. This game by itself is not enough to warrant a permanent ban, but the fact that cases like this keep happening does warrant a permanent ban.\n\n\n\n> _The \"xd bad team\" wasn't directed at my team, it was directed at leona because she was blaming me for every thing that went wrong in the game._\n\n  + I don't quite get what you mean exactly. But even assuming that line was not toxic at all, it doesn't really matter, since even if we omit that your chat logs still aren't acceptable IMO. That line was only a small part of multiple other insults.\n\n\n> _Me pointing out that panth had done literally nothing all game wasn't directed at him or blaming him, it was me talking to leo and xin because i got dived by the enemies and killed trying to solo defend a tower_\n\n+ I find it very unconvincing that you were not _\"blaming him\"_ especially after you specifically said _\"blame the path\"_ while in-game. The fact is, it was obvious Pantheon could see the chat and you insulted him.\n\n>  _Do you honestly think those things deserve a ban? The guy was literally flaming me for the entire game and int'd after he missed smite on a blue buff and you're saying i deserve a ban for saying he was crying and flaming his team? You calling me an asshole in your comment is more toxic than what I said to xin that game..._\n\n+ If Xin's behaviour is toxic and unacceptable, that doesn't give you a \"free pass\" to then insult him with no consequences. **You are judged for your actions only.**\n\n\n+ As for what I said, I never meant to imply that you were an \"asshole\" this game. I never said that your conduct this game was \"asshole\"-ish or that you were an \"asshole\". All I was trying to say is that IF your team is being an \"asshole\" do not assume that gives you the right to to be an \"asshole\" as well, as a general principle.\n\n Whether or not you were an \"asshole\" this game is none of my business and ultimately up to you to decide. Either way, I have since changed the language and I apologise for any issues I may have caused. I'll be more careful in the future, thanks for the feedback :)\n\nYou are completely right on the tribunal though IMO. It of course doesn't justify negative behaviour, but I do feel your frustration. It is definitely disappointing to see Riot not put resources into it, or at least explain why they are not putting resources into a Tribunal.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-04T04:10:03.836+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">It is definitely disappointing to see Riot not put resources into it, or at least explain why they are not putting resources into a Tribunal.\n\nBecause an automated system is easier to run, even though automation is terrible at determining anything *cough youtube cough*.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-05T20:13:07.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=f5ZP7sKK,comment-id=0001000200000000,timestamp=2017-12-04T04:10:03.836+0000)\n>\n> Because an automated system is easier to run, even though automation is terrible at determining anything *cough youtube cough*.\n\nthis.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-12-03T08:08:07.375+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"the escalation path part isnt exactly correct anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-03T08:20:28.381+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"It's always been the case that certain behaviours could skip you tiers.
