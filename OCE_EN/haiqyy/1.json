Haiqyy here, first time posting. I've received a new laptop recently and downloaded LoL Oceania for it. Windows user. Everything went well until it got stuck at Step 2/2 83% with the download speed of 0kbps. I left my laptop on all night last night and it was still stuck. On my previous experiences, I'd always leave the download open for an hour when it's stuck and it continues. This is the first time it got stuck! Help please, much appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Haiqyy","replies":[]}
