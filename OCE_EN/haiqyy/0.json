What is happening Riot? It's my third provisional game and it's a defeat though it's not my fault in anyway. Everybody in-game started to disconnect and have huge lag spikes though their internet is fine. I opened my browser while I was reconnecting and it was pure bliss. Please count my last game as Loss Forgiven cause my team and I didn't deserve such bs. I couldn't reconnect after awhile, it just gets stuck and says that I don't have any internet! My internet is perfectly fine! Rito PLS.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:02:21.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loss Forgiven is only enabled when there's a severe issue affecting most players so that all matches completed during that time are forgiven, and it's not performed on an individual basis. Additionally, once a match is completed, it is marked like that forever, and cannot be \"forgiven\", much like Yasuo.\n\nThis may have been caused by the recent patch.
