I'm seeing some random lockups in my game that are making it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening, it's like I'm getting slices of what's going on.\n\nIt *could* be ping spiking, but it feels more like my connection and/or the game itself - does this sound similar to your problem? It appears to be more common during teamfights or player interactions.\n\nI'm with Telstra, always via cable.","replies":[{"poster":"Slump God","date":"2015-07-30T07:27:55.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds exactly like my problem. Ill get the lock ups constantly, even while doing camps as a jungler as well as team fights or just simply walking around. I highly doubt its my internet because its fine when playing Counter-strike as that all I've been doing since this occurrence. As i said ive ran ping tests during a game and while my ingame ping was in the 80s and my test said i was at 28 ping, it doesn't add up.\n\nAlso ive asked some of my friend if they're having this problem and they've said no, but the people in their game were saying what you described.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-07-30T07:48:32.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have something to track your downloads?

I wasn't clear from your description whether the game lockups mentioned were of that type.  That issue can happen on quite high-end PCs and cards, so its not necessarily a factor of poor PC performance.\n\nBut from what you are describing it sounds like the client performance itself is smooth (animations still display fine, screen not stuttering), but abilities & skillshots are not going off when you initially trigger them.","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-07-31T11:50:29.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best I can describe it is as if the game runs perfectly fine for some period, but then for no reason odd events occur.\n\nThe most common I would associate with lag, the game will \"stop\" as if the player did not change direction, but the animation will continue anyway. After a period, the game will \"speed up\" as if to compensate for time lost, playing the move/shoot etc. animations in the apparent order that they occur (often with team abuse inserted). It doesn't happen with every game, ironically I had a game with a very high ping before and it didn't happen a lot either.\n\nIt can also appear to \"skip\" certain parts of battles etc. instead, with everything sort of freezing, and it becomes very confusing when you're trying to heal someone who was already dead. Especially when the other guy abuses you because you didn't heal him.","replies":[{"poster":"DrexelEden","date":"2015-07-31T12:17:05.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I am having the same issue.
