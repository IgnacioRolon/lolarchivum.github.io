Either by having, good poke team but the enemy would have great cc and mostly tank. Another example would be we became a mostly tank team but we get an outpoking opposite team. This brings me the question is ARAM really random or, some game master is playing with our accounts to have inferior champs?","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-09-20T22:08:22.737+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, you were disadvantaged when you had the poke team because they had a tank team. \nAnd you were disadvantaged when you had the tank team because they had the poke team? \nMaybe there's more to it?

I play like 30 different accounts on aram resonably regularly and you get groups of bots (scripts farming IP and XP) moving through the levels up to lev30. If you don't know about these or haven't seen them then just check their items (go out with an Oracles Extract as an initial item against a team with no champs such as Teemo/Twitch/Shaco/etc), how they follow each other or you around the map, how they often run along the bottom of the lane to take the relics when arriving from respawn (every time) and how they all go HAM.... \n\nThese bots almost invariably get the free champs on rotation as they are scripts with no champs owned, so they can only get the frees or maybe Kayle if they got one from RIOT. \n\nSo the 10 champs on free rotation are allocated to them by default as such. Then the players, such as me, with say 10 or 15 other champs owned, say on a lev20 acct, or with 20 or so on a lev25 acct, get the free champs on a far higher ratio than we should. That's why there must be a bias towards the free champs on rotation. There is no other explanation for this.\n\nBy way of explanation:\n\nI'd say I get a free champ allocated before any re-roll at least 1 in 2 times when there are 6 or 8 or even 9 other players that are bots and MUST have free champs. So what is the chance of that? There being 1 or 2 or up to 4 free champs available once the bots are allocated a champ each, with what should be a proportionate probability of being my champ (so say 1 out of 16, or 2 out of 17, or even 6 out of 19 - when I am playing with 10 champs I own, usually have more on those accounts). \n\nHow can this possibly deliver a 1 in 2 chance of a free champ landing for me? Unless the ARAM server allocates the champs in order with mine being allocated first? Which is not totally random, as the odds seem to be some form of \"prior odds\" not absolute 1 in X probability where X is the number of champs available to my account. I need to revise my Bayesian Stats to get the head around that but it does not make sense that I should land free champs from the rotation so often especially when the other players in the game who are bots must get free champs, thereby reducing the odds of landing a free champ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-09-24T06:50:39.580+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not sure but there might be something to balance out the teams \nall i know is that there's a higher chance of getting champs on free week","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2016-09-24T00:09:53.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think every certain day there's a poll and like let's say 10 champs.
