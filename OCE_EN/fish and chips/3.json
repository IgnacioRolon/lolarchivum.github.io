Computer just freezes for a brief time and runs again. Also game client's homepage is completely black (no pictures showing) but only titles like The 2015 LCS Season etc.\n\nIt could be due to internet or computer problem, however both of them are fine and are optimized for the game.\n\nI believe this happened from few days ago when I started playing LoL again in few months.\n\nCan someone from Riot help out on this issue please {{champion:17}} ?.\n\nThank you\nKind regards\nFish and Chips","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:56:59.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You on Windows?","replies":[{"poster":"Fish and Chips","date":"2015-01-21T18:26:01.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T23:50:46.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reset your Internet Explorer settings to default and then set its security level to \"Medium\".
