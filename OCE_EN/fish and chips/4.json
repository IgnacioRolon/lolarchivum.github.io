If you are plat on midnight (and not in a game about to be demoted) you will get plat rewards. If you are gold by then you only get gold. I suggest what I'm doing and wait to play ranked after, because end of season you get alot of trolls purposely feed to ruin others\n\n*Edit. If you are demoted after the 11th you still get what rewards you get from the division you were on the 11th. Also remember your end of season rank means nothing to your rank next season.
