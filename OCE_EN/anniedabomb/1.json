But hopefully you will understand more after reading this. So basically, theres one champion I&#039;ve always hated over others. And by hated, I mean half my block list is my friends after they played this champ. Riven, Le Blanc and others are champs generally recognised by many as op, but this one is my absolute undisputed #1 most despised champion, Vayne. I dodge sometimes when I see her locked in on the enemy team and always ban her. I don&#039;t understand how Riot made this champion and thought it was a balanced final product. Yes I am low elo but even in challenger, any high elo videos or montages and best plays, I can never understand how shes considered fine to be in the game. Her w shreds with true damage no matter what you itemise, she runs ridiculously fast throughout the whole game chasing people, during her ult even if you try to sweepers she tumbles away so many times its outside of any range. Her e stun is ridiculous, we could be fighting side by side on a wall and being condemned stuns me in the most awkwars position. So many vayne pentakills in such little time. I made this post to ask Riot if maybe she could be removed from just my client in the sense that if she&#039;s ever picked im immediately queue dodged or something. In ARAM she can never be picked in my champion select or something. Im just 110% done with vayne and vayne players.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-24T11:11:02.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a maths exam tomorrow and I just lost brain cells now I'm going to fail.

She can easily be harassed by people that know how to play against Vayne in High Elo. \nShe was one of the greatest ADCs a few seasons back but other ADCs do her job better. A number of champions can outrange her, and she doesn't have any skillshots that extend her range, unlike Lucian, Kog'Maw, Caitlyn. Tristana does well against Vayne, Caitlyn can outrange her all lane match.\nAll that Vayne has going for her is her tumble to dodge CC and skillshots, other than that she has pretty much the same damage output as any ADC during lvl 5 or 6 in lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pegasus","date":"2015-05-24T02:02:53.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, she needs atleast nerfs to her w health %","replies":[]}]}
