Gragas, 6 stack Cho Gath, Alistar) covering or standing over small sized ( Kog Maw, Ezreal, Annie) carries so using abilities like a Naut ult or some lock on is impossible due to the fact that you can&#039;t click them. I&#039;ve had games where a Kog was covered by Ali and Cho Gath and we couldn&#039;t do anything. Even unable to smite Baron due to Gragas on it and smiting him instead. Please respond Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-24T09:12:31.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gluttony does have some purpose after all :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-24T02:33:27.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that is the point of large hitboxes...\nIf Riot didn't want to it to be then why would they make a potion that would increase your size (25%)? {{item:2138}} \n\nIt makes tanks be better at their jobs (being a meatshield).\n\nLulu has that ability as well, as does Zac.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-05-24T02:30:45.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dafaq, you can't smite Baron when Gragas in on it?
