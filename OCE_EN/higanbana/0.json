After about 8 minutes i was harassed repeatedly by all 4 members of my team, being sworn at, spam pinged and anything else of a toxic manner you can think of. It doesn&#039;t bother me now, but it really raises the question of is riot really looking our for these solo players? Im someone who really likes to play out the game and try and make clutch decisions/plays that could turn the tides of the match, but when you've got your whole team sending you threats and just being an overall cuck it can be kinda hard to look past it all.\n\nConclusion; it would be nice to have some reassurance that something can be done about these players, nothing is more hard to play through, then a game where even when you are trying your hardest, your &quot;teammates&quot; will go out of their way to make the game harder, just to annoy/harass you.\n\nNever knew how frustrating it could be until it actually happened to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-20T13:09:47.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MUTE, report and move on.\n\npeople like that seek reactions from people. the best action to take is ignore them.  **( it actually pisses them off )**\n\nthey will abuse everyone while you have them muted and saying nothing.\n\nin post you report. they get a ban down the road and esp at this time of year. lose their ranked rewards.\n\n\nHopefully your next game is more enjoyable.\n\nPeace","replies":[{"poster":"Higanbana","date":"2017-09-21T01:15:52.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i usually mute as soon as i feel like there is no hope in reasoning, Still kinda feels shitty that 4 Douches most likely will not get punished for ruining 1 persons game, But what can you do aha ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-21T09:48:46.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This board is filled with tears of keyboard warriors and toxic players begging for a second chance after they recieve either a 14 day ban or perma.\n\nThe reporting system does work.
