When Clubs broke the fix caused some the club to not show up for the Owners despite everyone else seeing your name in it.\n\nYou must send a support ticket with the following:\n\nClub Name:\nClub Tag:\nOther members or the name of an Officer in the club:\nCan other members see your name:\n\nThe Officer will be granted ownership of the club as you have to be removed in order to be re-added. You will need to ask for ownership back from that person.\nIf your club does not have an officer, you must nominate a member to gain ownership.","replies":[]}]}
