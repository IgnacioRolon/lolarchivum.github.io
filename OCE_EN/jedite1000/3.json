Ancient Coin instead of the poke support item. Get the Corrupting Potion (500g) on first back if you want to have a lot more mana.

It doesn't really take any skill or risk to spam Darkwind on the minion wave, and it deals a lot of damage at low levels as well as the silence. If mana was never an issue the enemy adc would just be automatically forced out of lane after a certain time.
