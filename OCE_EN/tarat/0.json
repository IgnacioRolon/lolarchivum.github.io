In 54% of my last 50 lost games we did loose due to bad or terrible team-play in the late mid-game or late-game. In 38% of my last 50 lost games the chat during the game made it crystal clear to me that my team, sometimes including me, where not playing well together in team-fights because they where angry at each other, mostly still because of what happened during the champion selection. 2 &quot;lost games&quot; I am including here also, even though I did not play them, but I rather dodged the Que during champion selection, because the discussion during champion selection was sooo toxic, that I chose not play with that team. This leaves me with 8% (from 54%) - 26% (from 72%) where I cannot say for sure if my team and I played terribly together in team-fights because we were terrible at LoL or because of arguments that stayed unspoken off during the game. \r\n\r\nThree possible solutions I would like to suggest here:\r\n\r\n1) When joining the champion selection let every joining player see the entire chat since the chat was opened, not just since he has joined it.\r\n2) Block Auto-locking for the first 30secs in Normal Que and for the first 15-20secs in Co-OpvsAi. You can choose your champion, but not just not yet lock in, until the discussion about who plays which role is completed.\r\n3) Switch to a &quot;Preferred Role&quot;-system with 3 - 5 priorities.\r\n\r\nI encounter quite horribly behaving/toxic people in League of Legends every single day I play, but I would prefer for LoL to be mostly the uplifting and great experience that it actually can be. I would like to ask Riot here to implement urgently changes to the current champion selection system. I am sure that for most players the gaming experience would IMPROVE more due to less players having a chance to or a reason for behaving toxic in the team than their gaming experience would improve with a new shiny skin.\r\n\r\nThank you very much and I am looking so incredibly much forward to any improvement Riot will come up with and hopefully included in the next patch.\r\n\r\nBest Regards and thanks for creating this great game,\r\n\r\nTarat","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2017-01-28T16:31:23.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is if i get forced support and i don't really want it, i should be able to support as any champion i want without the team yelling at me.

In many games I can't say if people actually could choose their favorite role. \n\nBoth this post and the one above together state the simple fact that in the wast majority of Normal Que's people play below their actual skill level for no reason other than the current design of the champion selection system. Therefor, it would be incredibly easy to improve the LoL gaming experience by a few simple adjustment to that current system, e.g. switching to a \"preferred role\" -system.\n\nThank you for considering my point.","replies":[]}]}
