I have followed a few int accounts like this before and seen them still playing after ruining basically 90 peoples games, arguably boosting the opp team and killing their own teams placements or mmr. If someone ints like that they should be banned from ranked for the day, a week, or even longer. Seriously 21 deaths in 20 mins, you cannot do that without actually trying to feed, its pretty obvious 21 deaths in a 20 min game is intentional. But he has ruined at least 6 of his last 8 games and is still playing. Oh yeah reports work...\nI have said it before, ranked needs to be disabled faster for trolls and feeders, just turn it off for the rest of the day, followed by longer if the behavior continues. If they do it in their promos then ban them for a month so they can only play norms. Its only the ranked queue that needs to be disabled faster as thats where the competition and emotions run high which means thats where the trolls and feeders get the highest reward for their bad behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-11-11T07:22:05.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mortis Ex,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UJs6rr5k,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-11-11T06:46:05.860+0000)\n>\n> Except rito just doesnt do enough to screw these feeders over.
