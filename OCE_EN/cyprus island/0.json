I suspect it was one of my mates who kept reporting me for a laugh and this was back when there was rolling account bans going on. I got permanently banned and wasn't able to see why because I forgot the email I had used for my account. Just today I someone was able to recover my account on here by logging in with my credentials and changing my email to one I knew. I am still perma banned but am wondering if there is any way I can be unbanned or at least know the reason why I was. Any help would be much appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-30T04:07:53.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey'll be able to tell you the details of the punishment, and **if** it was issued in error, *may* be able to reverse it.","replies":[{"poster":"Cyprus Island","date":"2019-05-31T00:43:04.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you, really appreciate it.","replies":[]}]}]}
