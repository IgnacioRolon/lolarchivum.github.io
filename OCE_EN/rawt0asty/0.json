They did still try a reform tactic, basically good behaviour for a long enough period on a new account would earn you back your old one, but it had an almost 100% relapse rate. \n\nThose who earned their accounts back just went right back to their old behaviour because the threat and consequence of perma bans was made basically nonexistent. Needless to say they scrapped that pretty quickly.\n\nThat said, you aren't banned, your account is. There's nothing stopping you from creating a new account and continuing to enjoy the game, though naturally if the behaviour that resulted in a perma ban in the first place continues you will face those same punishments on any new accounts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-21T01:35:19.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It used to be 3 months.
