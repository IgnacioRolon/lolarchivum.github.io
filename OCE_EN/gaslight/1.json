I've slowly stopped playing and have started watching games a lot more often and even analysing just high elo games as a past time. I'm currently helping 2 teams with their game, and this is done by essentially spectating their games or watching replays that are sent to me. In conjunction with this, I also like to listen to the team comms. to see if there are any issues during champ select or during the game.\r\n\r\nIGN: Trinity Force","replies":[]}
