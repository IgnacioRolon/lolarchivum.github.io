I've slowly stopped playing and have started watching games a lot more often and even analysing just high elo games as a past time. \r\nI'm also studying management at university which is bound to help. \r\nIGN: Trinity Force","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-12-04T06:10:08.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What champions do you think will shine in 2015?

Why? The shield on second tier tower + the new item \"Zz'Rot Portal\" on the PBE seem to counter splitpushing. \n\n* {{champion:127}} - She's already being played a little bit but I think mid lane will start to move back towards mages rather than assassins. We could start seeing champs like {{champion:99}}, {{champion:143}}, and {{champion:25}} come back to mid lane too. She's also versatile and can be played top too\n\n* {{champion:50}} - Not played as often as {{champion:127}} but fills a similar role in that he can play top and mid and is team fight orientated which is where I think the meta will push towards.\n\n* If I'm right in assuming a more teamfight-orientated meta, then I think ADC's such as {{champion:22}}, {{champion:21}}, {{champion:222}},  and {{champion:110}} might become popular, but that is dependent on the jungle and mid lane (assassins played less).\n\n* I don't know how much support will change, but I can see {{champion:37}} and {{champion:16}} being picked a bit more often, but I think {{champion:40}}, {{champion:267}}, and {{champion:412}} will always stay relevant. \n\n* {{champion:31}} - I don't actually have a good reason for this, I just think he may become popular in the jungle or top lane. No real thought behind it. \n\n**How will the new Jungle affect LCS/OGN/Worlds?**\n\n{{summoner:12}} will still be vital because teams are going to want to secure those dragon stacks. The team's that are winning won't just put their focus towards Baron. With this, I think we might see possibly 2 people per team with the blue trinket, probably ADC and mid laner, rather than 4 red's and a blue. \n\nI think it's still too early to tell which champs are going to be strong in the new Jungle but I would not be surprised to see {{champion:113}}, {{champion:111}}, and similar tank/cc champs take over but I don't think Jungle picks will be as highly contested as they were ({{champion:64}}/{{champion:121}})","replies":[]}]}]}
