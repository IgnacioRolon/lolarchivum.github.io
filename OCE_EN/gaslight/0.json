I then uploaded the clips to YouTube and sent it off to Riot Support who are going to deal with it. \r\n\r\nThere is no point complaining about it on the boards or in all-chat, that won't have an effect. Riot aren't going to do anything about it. You need to detail what happened and send it to Riot support.","replies":[{"poster":"KelvinCanPwn","date":"2015-01-23T03:03:02.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm saying i'll ddos you as a joke because ya'll think i ddos.
