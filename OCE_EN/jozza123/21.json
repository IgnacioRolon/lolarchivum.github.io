Each year a specific number of codes are given and in recent years these PAX codes have an expiration date which is generally the day following the conclusion of the event. PAX skins such as TF are being sold at high value on sites such as www.lolskins.com and www.ebay.com but the legitimacy of these I do not trust.. Although, for people that are collectors of rare content it may seem like a thing to buy, I strongly suggest it is not worth it. But that is for you to decide.\n\nKind Regards\nlols =)","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Turner","date":"2014-11-26T23:20:46.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your just as stupid as them, the skins have all expired now and can longer be redeemed, old news now move on.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-02T20:43:51.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Teemo Turner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=v3xRcgoT,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2014-11-26T23:20:46.240+0000)\n>\n> Your just as stupid as them, the skins have all expired now and can longer be redeemed, old news now move on.\n\nmy friend has a pax Jax code","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-11-27T02:38:08.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"PAX Skins will never return, don't get your hopes up.\n\nIf you want to see them however you could always hope you face me as I play Jax or Sivir, or my friends as they play TF, Jax or Sivir.","replies":[]}]}
