[Practice your CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), optimise your masteries and runes, narrow your champ pool. [Watch videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX_xyl6qIlk) and read guides about objective prioritization/wave manipulation/other skills. \n\nIf you still aren't finding success, try queuing up with some friends. Playing with people you can trust not to troll/afk/have internet issues can definitely help a lot. it's also more fun this way. \n\nGood luck ♥\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-20T09:52:32.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upgrade trinket when necessary.\nYellow is ok, but red and blue are good too, its also free.\n\nWard up your own lane, buy a pink.\nMute assholes.\nget on with the game, less time typing means more time farming.\n\nMight look into your match history later.\nbut for now here are some generic tips.","replies":[{"poster":"Seemorecake","date":"2016-07-21T01:48:56.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the help, I'll have a go at implementing them later many thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-21T01:54:06.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fine. good luck.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-20T10:02:14.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right, first of all.\nYou do not have completed tier 3 rune pages.\nSave up some IP and buy some quints and try and buy another page, as you only have 2 pages.\n--\nYour CS is poor you need to work on it.
