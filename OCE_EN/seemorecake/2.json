I&#039;m not behind a firewall. i managed to log back in and finish the game but got a 20 minute low priority cue. why is this? i was in the game when it finished i had cs and kills. now I&#039;m being punished for something which is out of my control. after spending a small fortune on this game with champion and skins i don&#039;t feel that this is legit. how can a server error your end be my fault?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-02T02:46:05.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhat was the exact error you received?
