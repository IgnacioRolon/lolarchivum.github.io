I say in theory because you only need to know 2 roles if you so choose and play your best 2. It's  not working for me yet haha but I know it will","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-27T22:37:18.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are still plenty of potatoes choosing lanes they THINK they can play.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-28T07:43:08.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This x39290000000","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-01-27T21:51:56.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should be yeah i agree.

Ultimately i have myself to blame as during my placements I set myself up by playing poorly in first couple I died 22 times in first 3 placement games which was rubbish of me, and I ruined it for myself and the other 12 people who were in those games with me. \n\nCan't win every single game but can focus on what you did every game and hope to improve from that. That's what I keep telling myself anyway ha","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-28T03:37:01.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is designed to place you below where you used to be.
