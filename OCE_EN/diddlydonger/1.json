I wasn't sure if the 'he' was referring to the Poro King, or if the writers were referring to me as a 'he;' assuming that 100% of the League of Legends community is male. I don't think Riot should be using these pronouns as they are obviously incorrect for a lot of people including me; and even if it was referring to the Poro King I think it could have been worded better to avoid confusion such as this. Thoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Kajata","date":"2014-12-18T06:15:10.686+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DiddlyDonger, have you checked it recently? i feel they have changed the pronoun. because i remembered it as you said. but now it seems to be \"[summoner] and their team.\"","replies":[{"poster":"DiddlyDonger","date":"2014-12-18T08:26:11.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I did check it again and it looks like it's been changed.\n\n\"Their legend grows with every victory, DiddlyDonger, a true Champion of the Poros, DiddlyDonger tagged their enemies with 266 poros, enlisting the help of the Poro King 100 times and turning the tide for their team.\" \n\nAlso, my friend sent a support ticket to Riot and this was the reply;\n\n> Hi there Summoner,\n> \n> Sorry if it seems like you were offended with the pronoun that was used in the page were you and your achievement were recognize. Please do let me explain as to why we used \"his\".\n> \n> First off, \"his\" is generally the pronoun to any noun if the gender of the person being acknowledge is unknown. We are totally sorry if this gave you any inconvenience but if you have anything else to ask, please do let me know.\n> \n> Winter Miming\n> Player Support Specialist\n> Riot Games\n\nSo the 'he' used in the previous message was in fact directed at the player as I assumed. I guess the people in the thread who disagreed with me were wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Kajata","date":"2014-12-19T04:30:04.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hah, haters gon' hate hey. i am glad you figured it out. we need to embrace female players. i play with my wife and after a bad game an enemy asked \"what are you a bunch of girls trying to play?\" and i was like, so what if we are?","replies":[{"poster":"DiddlyDonger","date":"2014-12-19T05:12:50.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's such a shame that so much sexism exists in the gaming world.
