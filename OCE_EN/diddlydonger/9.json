(I'm somewhat new to league of legends so please bare with me if these questions have been answered a 100 times) [If anyone has info or can link me to a similar post then I'd appreciate it!] \r\n\r\n1. Do any other servers have a tribunal system? \r\n\r\n2. I heard the oce tribunal is currently under construction, If that's true, when will it be available to the public?  \r\n\r\n3. AND of course, what makes the tribunal different to the regular in game report system? How will the tribunal deal with players? Do people just get reported/ banned on it or is it more than that?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-07T08:35:14.585+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Do any other servers have a tribunal system?\n\nSimply, no.\n\n> I heard the oce tribunal is currently under construction, If that's true, when will it be available to the public?\n\nSoonâ„¢\n\n> AND of course, what makes the tribunal different to the regular in game report system?

Simply put, Riots rules aren't necessarily the ones that matter. Where Riot doesn't usually enforce the META or call/pick order reports that go through the tribunal would often result in punishment if someone was disobeying either the META or call/pick order since the community generally agrees they are to be followed.","replies":[]}]}
