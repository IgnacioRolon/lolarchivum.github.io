We're slowly going to ramp up the system until it can detect more nuanced intentional feeding but right now, you rarely see intentional feeding like the old days with 5 Zeals and 0-20 scores.\n\nQuoted from RiotLyte (post is brand new, too. just a couple days ago)\nYou can find a collection of posts about the issue on surrender@20.\n\nAlso,\n> We're trying to get to a point where servers get all features at the same time, but it's pretty difficult in a game as massive as League. \n> Because the new systems are all tuned by cultural standards, each system is actually quite different and customized to a specific country. So, as we do beta-tests and launches we try to focus the team on 1 server at a time. If the beta-tests go well, we can start batching servers into groups and doing them all at once. But, for the first beta-test we want to be safe. \n> The first beta-tests tend to be on NA because that's just the timezone the team is in. For all other beta-tests like OCE the team has to be at the office like 2-5 AM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DwarfGoo","date":"2015-05-06T07:45:41.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">** Intentional Feeder Detection**\n> \n> What about intentional feeders?\n> \n> There is a separate system that focuses purely on feeders.

But being 4v5 and giving the enemy team a free 27 kills eventually tipped the scales in their favour.\n\nLucky enough, though, the ranked server crashed or something once the game ended, and after being able to log back in a few hours later I see that the loss wasn't recorded. \n\n{{champion:40}}","replies":[]}]}]}
