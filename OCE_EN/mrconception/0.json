Last night I was playing a normal blind pick game, where I had just got home from work and was on consistent 1k ping. I was not vulgar until the very last 2 seconds I said \"ez %%%s\" which isnt justifiable but half my team said it (therefore assuming they were suspended too?), which ended in me getting a 14 day suspension. Here are the chat logs:\r\nGame 1\r\nMrConception: who hasnt mate\r\nMrConception: come on\r\nMrConception: yikes\r\nMrConception: nah i aint invading im lagging\r\nMrConception: got wrong runes too\r\nMrConception: sick\r\nMrConception: just got home from work lmao\r\nMrConception: lol\r\nMrConception: lol\r\nMrConception: we are fucking bot lane wtf\r\nMrConception: yikes\r\nMrConception: sure are ww\r\nMrConception: in same house\r\nMrConception: lagging too hard gonna b\r\nMrConception: legend\r\nMrConception: need 50 gold\r\nMrConception: 1k ping relax\r\nMrConception: i died bcz of my ping lol\r\nMrConception: didnt we all\r\nMrConception: i won like 3\r\nMrConception: dude\r\nMrConception: insta kill\r\nMrConception: malz just e and ignite\r\nMrConception: and ult me\r\nMrConception: his e did 950 dmg to me lol\r\nMrConception: i feel like ur the mad ones lol\r\nMrConception: ^^\r\nMrConception: ty\r\nMrConception: im 1k ping stop sweating ya %%%\r\nMrConception: guarantee this gnar has sweat dripping down his forhead rn\r\nMrConception: lol why are we throwing\r\nMrConception: i click to run away and just cant\r\nMrConception: ez %%%s\r\n\r\nI think this isn't sufficient for a 14 day suspension, had I been reported multiple times and had a collective of me insulting people, I would take the suspension gladly.

In the past two years especially, more and more people are speaking up about their experiences that are related to slurs. The community is adapting and realizing \"hey, its not ok to use these words even in a casual manner\". \nPeople see the stories of how these words are still used against others, and want to do their bit to ensure we can actually put (somewhat) of a stop to it. \n\n[This article here puts it quite well](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/casey-cavanagh/an-open-letter-to-people-_b_8011324.html), when we look at the word you used:\n\n>I think you should use whatever words you want. When you use it on stage, I can see it’s funny, and I don’t care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? Well, the word ‘f♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ t’ really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches? They used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other f♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ s. So that’s how you get ‘flaming f♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ t.’\n\n>**... You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they’re being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings that all back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means**. \n\nSo while some people here don't really care what kind of language you use, others you come across in your games might have a lot of pain tied to such a word. On top of this, others might know someone who words like this have affected to the point where there were dire consequences and for that reason it will also resonate with them. Finally, we mustn't forget people that just don't like the use of those words for other reasons and still report it. \n\n* Its a lot better to use \"mate\" if you are reffering to a teammate instead of using a slur.\n* If it is coming out as toxicity, its better just to say nothing at all. If people really can't resist \"potato\" is a great word to use. _(Although it can be assured that by calling out your teammate for doing something you wouldn't do isn't gonna make them play better.)_","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-17T18:33:12.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"I'd have reported you just to bring up cases like this.

And if they reported him and he didn't just get auto detected for profanity, then they were either trolling or they are a very angry individual and they are the toxic ones. \n\nRead through the whole chat-log again and honestly tell me he was toxic. He seems like one of the most laid back players especially considering he was lagging to such a high degree. It's disgusting that this decision can be justified by saying \"someone got offended, so even if he wasn't really offensive or intending to be offensive, he still gets punished\".\n\nThat logic is fundamentally flawed. I can virtually guarantee that no one was offended by what this guy said but if we assume they were, why should he get banned based on their subjective feelings. If he said something objectively wrong or mean, I would agree with a ban. He didn't though, he just used profanity that some people (whom, I am unsure of) might subjectively disagree with it.\n\nThis is not toxic and the only reason he got banned was because he used naughty words that Riot doesn't like, not because he targeted or accidentally offended another player with his language.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-19T09:16:17.809+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never said he was toxic??\n\n_**I literally just pointed out that slurs are treated more harshly than any other words or the typical garden variety flame. **_\n\nRiots IFS review system is based on reports, and even if slurs and profanity were used, if no-one reports then you won't get punished for it. Obviously someone in the game (regardless of \"friendly banter context\") **was** offended or recognized that word as something they didn't want themselves or other members of the community exposed to, a report was lodged, game was reviewed, words that people report a lot were found, and a punishment was issued. \n\n\nIt's not just Riot and members of this community that think slurs are naughty. I think you'll find you'll get in deep shit if you use that kind of language around work/school or any less than familiar social setting when you are with strangers.","replies":[{"poster":"Superior Profke","date":"2018-02-21T12:38:21.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Many people who are actually toxic would get tilted by losing a game and report enemy players for something that was obviously not offensive. The majority of young adults in todays society treat cuss words like they would any other word. Ive lived in both Australia and New Zealand and a common greeting could be something along the lines of \"sup c*nt\" . This was obviously not intended to be offensive and he was probably reported by an enemy player who was salty about losing a game. Bans need to be looked over by a human who can read in context and make an informed decision not a computer program that looks for words or phrases that are considered offensive. \n\n\nHere's an example, a player makes an awesome play that potential turns around a game, \"you are f%cking insane\" followed by \"that was awesome\" would obviously be a compliment. Computer system would analyze the chat and determine that \"you are f%cking insane\" is verbal abuse and hand out a punishment.

Regardless of the intent, the fact remains that the term used (specifically \"f*g\") is one that is, in modern society, often associated with a severe negative connotation that directly targets homosexual individuals. If people want to do that in privacy, in situations where those involved are ok with such usage, that's their business, but the very fact that the OP has received a punishment for the behaviour certainly indicates that someone in that match was offended by the use of the term, otherwise there would have been no report and, thus, no punishment.\n\nTo say that you think there is nothing wrong with what they did is not the point, that is your *opinion* and not consistent with *Riot's policies*, and since it is Riot's game, they are the ones to decide how harassment, especially when talking about things like homophobia, is dealt with. Yaia's logic on this is not flawed, it is based on how Riot treats their game, and how they \"translate\" behaviours considered undesirable by society into the game and it's systems.\n\nThe bottom line is that he did the wrong thing and ended up offending someone, whether intentional or not, and so Riot dealt with the behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2018-02-22T14:37:29.058+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your uptight attitude proves that you have no clue what could be justice here. \"f*g\" means a cigarette butt, but lets not beat around the bush, it is a shortened slur.
