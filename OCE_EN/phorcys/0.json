Game knowledge is obviously difficult to prove in terms of rank or stats, but I do love strategy games, and would say I have a good understanding for the strategy aspects of the game. I have been playing for about 2 years+, and also do keep up with the major leagues (LCS, LCK, LPL).\r\nWith that being said about me, I am looking for a serious team to coach/analyse, specifically more on the overall team-based game strategy (map movements, when to take fights, objective control, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis team should also consist of players who are preferably plat+, as I am not looking to coach on the individual player's mechanics. I think plat+ would generally be the point for having solid mechanics and being able to at least go toe to toe with higher ranked opponents.\r\nOn top of that, a solid replay recording (with team comms) would also be needed, and since I only speak English, I can only work with English speaking teams.\r\n\r\nDepending on the team, my gameplan is to:\r\n1) Establish baseline (~5 games)\r\nPlay all comfort picks (max. 3 diff champs for one player), and preferably not more than 2 styles of teamcomps first\r\n2) Identify team basic issues and problem enemy champions for target bans\r\n3) Work on team basic issues\r\n4) Identify individual player strengths / weaknesses / tendencies\r\n5) Have players list own priority champions with comfort rating upon 10\r\n6) Access overall team comp vs individual player traits\r\n\r\nI hope to apply and refine my game knowledge, to benefit a serious team with a consistent practice schedule and long-term stability, so that we can all improve together.\r\nIf any teams are interested, do contact me with the following: team rank, player ranks, practice timings, region, contact info.\r\n\r\nI can be reached via PM on reddit, link below.\r\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/TeamRedditTeams/comments/3028mv/englishregions_only_serious_amateur_coach_looking/","replies":[{"poster":"phorcys","date":"2015-03-29T16:18:15.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2015-03-27T10:02:51.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds great, add me, my username is my name here.

It's obviously impossible to prove that via any posts or ranks or stats, which is why I ask for a replay from interested teams for me to do an analysis on - which we can then both treat as the \"interview\".\n\nMore about me:\n- I have my own Gold-Plat team in Singapore, been playing together for a couple months, where I'm the shotcaller and I regularly post ideas on what the team should focus on (sorta like a coach)\n- Currently coaching a Plat+ team on a semi-regular basis\n- I'm in talks with 3 diamond teams, and after viewing footage I'm confident that I have something to offer at that level or even beyond.\n\nI do understand your concerns and I think the best way for you or any interested teams to get the best idea about me is to have a chat.  Apart from a PM, I can also be contacted in game, IGNs:\nNA - Kalyeos\nEUW - Kalyeos\nOCE - phorcys\n\nCheers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-03-25T20:27:03.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think anyone can really trust you if you hide your main league account. You don't get forum/boards banned on that account even if you get banned for negativity in game.\n\nDespite that the reason why you normally only go for a higher tier player as a coach is since a lot of time it's game knowledge that gets you to higher tiers. \n\nAll and all it's not an attack on you. It's just annoying to see someone asking for something that's halfhearted. I'm sure we've all done it before without realizing though.","replies":[]}]}
