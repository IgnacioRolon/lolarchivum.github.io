No matter whether it&#039;s clicking on the items portrait or price/unlock button, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nI can click the navigation buttons perfectly fine (tabs for the store sections and my profile buttons/PLAY are fine).\r\n\r\nI have run a repair on the game, and re-logged multiple times over the last few days, but nothing seems to be working.\r\n\r\nWould anyone be able to please shed some light on this situation?\r\n\r\nThank you","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T08:01:57.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long have you waited for a response?

I haven't been getting any out-of-place lag with the game or any other areas of the client. Only the purchase/view buttons on the products are not working, I can still buy RP fine however :P.\n\nI might have someone else log onto their profile on my computer to see if it's my account or files that is/are busted.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-23T04:11:34.251+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Try using a different DNS.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq5) Even if you just change solely for the store it might work.
