LOL what is going?? this isn&#039;t even fair. Is it even fixing the patch or is it just bullshitting everyone?? We just need one update per patch, not 300mb of updates every freaking 30 mins... Fix this, its extremely frustrating for a lot of people.... This is a really big issue!!!! Im very disappointed with you guys.{{champion:110}}","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-09T23:33:08.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry War Warrior - it sounds like you played right around the timing of our 5.13 update earlier this morning. We do try to minimize the amount of patching that you do, I know it's painful here to download large files. \n\nPatch 5.12 also had some pretty big bugs that we felt needed to be patched out sooner than later. Again, I am sorry for the pain this caused you recently and something that we are working to improve.","replies":[]}]}
