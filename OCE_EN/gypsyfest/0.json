I believe that this would drastically change the way the game worked in regards to easier coordination and cooperation among teammates, it will also allow teammates to bond more easily, creating extreme positivity within the community. This will ultimately only impact positively on the game as it will draw more and  more people into the community.\r\n\r\n It will mean an end to aggressive elitism, it will mean an end to  trolls who think they are untouchable and it will mean a drastic reduction in toxic behavior. nobody wants to have an argument with someone else when they can actually hear their voice and their emotion. Think of games like CSGO where they have voice chat. casual gameplay is more often than not, a positive and fun experience. \r\n\r\nIf Riot was to implement a voice chat system then people will no longer be able to use the game as a way to vent their frustrations through. peoples personality&#039;s change drastically when they are anonymous and I think one of the goals of Riot Games should be to find a way to connect all summoners together in a positive way. If people disagree with each other, there is always a handy mute button available. \r\n\r\nPeople always complain about the ineffectiveness of the tribunal, this is because so many people are reported each day. the fact is that the style of this game in terms of communication just may not be the most viable of methods. bad behavior on the rift needs to be stopped at the source and i think this is the best way to do it.  \r\n\r\nRiot - I have been playing this game since season one and i hate to see all the bad behavior in the game ruin the joyful experience it is supposed to be. I ask you to please at least look into this concept if you have not already. I&#039;m sure many within the community would agree with me. \r\nThank you\r\n\r\n-Vote in the poll below if you are with me!","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-10-03T20:19:59.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally disagree because people with really bad microphones exist and they really hurt your ears. Alongside that if it's forced upon you then that's a massive turn off for a lot of people for the game. While I think voice chat is helpful in the end with have other means already.\n\nYou took a sample from a game that has a lot of chill and collected players already where the game isn't as team focused. But in the lower ranks there are people who will yell and scream at other people anyway to vent their frustration, purely because you can hear their voice doesn't mean they can't hide it behind a guise nor does it mean that they can just not care that you have heard the sound of their voice. Because when you're angry your voice doesn't sound the same as when you're not angry.\n\nI do agree that it gives greater communication but if you're playing with dunces then it'll just upset you even if they heard you.\n\nAll up.\n- If it's forced it's gonna be bad.\n- If it's not forced it's pointless.\n- Not everyone has a microphone surprisingly enough.\n\nI'm interested in a solution to the problem but saying that voice chat has no negatives and it will end toxicity isn't true, I'm all for ways to get rid of it so do please give it your all and try your best at finding a solution that respects everyone and accommodates for those less fortunate than others.\n\nGood luck in the Fields of Justice and may you be Victorious!","replies":[{"poster":"gypsyfest","date":"2015-10-03T23:33:31.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make some good points. but don't you think it's at least worth some testing? And also the voice chat should be optional (probably should of said something about that) so something like the original chat will still be there. I would love to see a month or so trial for this on Oceania.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-04T07:55:15.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you SEEN what goes on in DoTA 2?

No offence to anyone but, voice chat is the only thing separating us from the COD community. I can just imagine it now... Hundreds of \"squealers\", douche-bags and people with terrible microphones. Also you can't moderate voice chat like you can with text chat, if someone thinks you should \"be gassed like a jewish %%%got\", what proof does the tribunal have? \n\nIt's much more difficult to record and moderate all conversations over voice chat. If you really feel you need voice chat though, download Cursed Voice.","replies":[{"poster":"gypsyfest","date":"2015-10-05T03:02:19.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is true but the idea behind voice chat is to eliminate toxidity in the community. Gamers are unpredictable and it can entirely depend on the vibe that is given off by the game. we might not have sqeelers and douchbags and their may not be a need to moderate the shit people put out. also bare in mind that league is a completely different game than COD where they have like what 15 v 15 player games. League requires close and personal reliance on your team members in which everyone has a vital role to play-unlike cod where winning or loosing doesnt matter as long as their is a try hard who is leading your team. the score and activity of other players can often mean very little. At the end of the day all im saying is that I really think its worth riot testing this in a zone or two to see how it goes. the state of the community right now is absolutely disgraceful and im just fishing for a way to make the game fun again. the other day i encountered a duo who told me to get cancer and to hang myself with my aborted sister after trying to break up a champ select argument. you make some good points tho dude","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-10-03T23:34:46.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always thought it was something that should of been there from the start but lets be honest Riot won't add voice chat and I'm sure they've got some premade dribbler excuse like they have with Sandbox mode.","replies":[{"poster":"gypsyfest","date":"2015-10-04T00:04:27.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a possibility-I think if we all use initiative and show them that we want it though they cant simply ignore it and we will know at least where they stand on it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rinsey","date":"2015-10-03T13:25:13.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is GOLD!
