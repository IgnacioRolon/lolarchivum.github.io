This is incredibly infuriating and has left me angry. I&#039;ve tried emailing the contact addresses for general questions to get the bot reply. I&#039;ve exhausted almost all resources I have in order to try and fix this and I cannot resolve it.\n\n My issue is as follows\nMy game has been experiencing incredibly high ping  (~800 ping), with the bare minimum settings,  when no other system in the house that can connect to the internet is on. \n\nWhereas I can play Dota with 45 ping with YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Steam, and all my various devices open and connected to the internet. I hate this because I love the game to death. But when I can run Dota, Cities Skylines and Just Cause 3 with high graphic settings without hinderance; I am assured there is a definite problem Riot-side.  {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}\n\nThanks,\nErictheViking311 {{champion:222}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-10T09:57:21.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFirst let's address your support login issue, I'm currently able to log in fine.\n\n* Have you attempted to log in with a different browser? \n* Have you tried an \"incognito\" window in your current browser? \n* Does logging in work as expected when trying the steps above?\n\nNext onto your connection issues, that's definitely odd. Could you do the following for me.\n\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP. (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes)\n  * 103.240.227.5\n* Once adequate time has passed, stop the traceroute, export your results as text.\n* Run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/).\n* Email a link to your WinMTR results (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this) and the ICSI netalyzr results link to **oce-wrenchmen@googlegroups.com** don't forget to include a link to your thread in the email :)","replies":[{"poster":"ErictheViking311","date":"2016-04-15T09:23:23.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sephiroth, sorry for the delayed response.\nAs for the former half of your response, as I've said somewhere else (probably reddit) I've tried those all before and I've now had success getting into support, through the standard route i'd take after contact with Riot Mindstar.\n\nAs for the Connection issues Netalyser isn't available for me(after numerous attempts)  in QLD. \nand I had a bit of an issue with WinMTR also, but i'll send that regardless.\n\nIts on its way now.","replies":[{"poster":"ErictheViking311","date":"2016-04-15T09:38:00.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As to follow-up, I received this email shortly after sending:\n> \"Hello eric31155@gmail.com,\n> \n>  We're writing to let you know that the group you tried to contact (oce-wrenchmen) may not exist, or you may not have permission to post messages to the group.
