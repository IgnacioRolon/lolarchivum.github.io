Cause I don't see the compensation of us the players who have to deal with a 4v5 or a 3v5 game, which most of the time results in a loss and even though it's a unfair match, you still lose like 20 LP. The leave buster system is only good in punishing these leavers but us players who have to deal with 4v5 and losing don't get any compensation, or unless there is a compensation that I couldn't see.","replies":[{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-03-15T08:34:37.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-03-15T10:08:08.224+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Crackdogrock,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=MEdoaFGh,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-03-15T08:34:37.319+0000)\n>\n> I'd wish they'd make it like dota where, if one person leaves, after 3 minutes or so of not reconnecting, everyone may disconnect without punishment.
