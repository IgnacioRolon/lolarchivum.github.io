Here's what you do. Go to an online store and buy a Windows 7 product key, then torrent the ISO for Windows 7 from somewhere else. Format your hard-drive and then install Windows 7.\n\nThat will legit speed up your connection. I am not kidding. Though it's probably not what you want to do.\n\nAnyway, as far as I'm concerned, there's no tangible difference between 33 ping and 45 ping. It's best to heed this saying: \"If it ain't broken, don't fix it.\"\n\nBut if you want to speed it up, try this. Make sure that you've recently not installed any Windows Updates or other programs which may run in the background. If so, prevent them from running.\n\nCheck your internet settings and make sure they're all in check. Mainly check for listening ports and how they listen to calls.\n\nHope that helps.","replies":[]}]}
