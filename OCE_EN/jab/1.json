As it&#039;s only up once a week, climbing above plat seems like it&#039;s near impossible. I know there&#039;s not many that play it but I also know there&#039;s a few people that play it non stop everytime it&#039;s available so some answers would be really appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-04T03:50:02.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TT ranked decay works as it does in SR, kicking in at least 28 days since your last played game of Ranked TT (for Platinum/Diamond players). So as long as you get one game in every 4 weeks then you should not decay.\n\nThere are much stricter decay rules for Master/Challenger players and that is something we're aware might not be viable with such a limited time queue, so we're going to assess what options we have to make this more appropriate for TT in Oceania.","replies":[{"poster":"Jab","date":"2017-01-14T12:03:24.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow thank you for such a quick and informative response, I was unaware Plat-Dia decay only kicked in after 28 days so that's good news to hear, as for the challenger/master tier I understand that's a tricky situation but I appreciate you guys allowing ranked TT in the first place, as I thought we'd never get it. Again - thank you for the information. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-14T14:55:54.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're welcome, glad it helped :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
