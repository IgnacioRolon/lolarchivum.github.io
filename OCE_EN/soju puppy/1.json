I&#039;m in queue but I want to do something away from my computer, but what if I don&#039;t want to miss queue? I&#039;ve been thinking that it would be awesome to have an app where you could log into your account and be notified of queue pops or even better, have the choice to decline or accept the queue. Obviously I wouldn&#039;t imagine a lot of people needing something like this as speakers are a thing and you could pump it up but I don&#039;t have the luxury so idk. Doesn&#039;t sound too bad especially if you want to get some cooking or exercise done during long queues.","replies":[{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-06-22T07:38:07.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow 80 min queue.
