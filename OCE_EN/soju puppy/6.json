However I have a guideline, why? because I prefer not to play with people   that aren&#039;t like myself. \r\n\r\n1.  Don&#039;t rage at anyone. Only rage at yourself for doing something bad, it means you have a passion for the game.\r\n2. Actually try to win and don&#039;t throw salt everywhere when a game is lost. \r\n3. Treat others the same way you want to be treated.\r\n\r\nYes I know.. this sounds like a criteria for a job application but really, I&#039;m just a lonely c*nt sometimes and would like to make some friends. {{champion:32}} \r\n\r\ntldr; add me if you are nice.","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-07-10T00:17:09.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I noticed that someone is feeding for too many times, I wouldn't just say: \"Stop feeding\" even though I may be disappointed if we lost and I played quite well. There's a difference between willfully feeding and unintentional feeding.\nRegardless of what type of feeding it is, it doesn't matter anyway, since the enemy team are real players as well, and if you killed your opponent multiple times, maybe someone in the team of your opponent would be disappointed as well, and they may even say to the one who were fed: \"Stop feeding\".\nThe fact that you are getting killed a lot is just like you killed your opponent a lot, overall, so it doesn't really matter.\nI would usually try to win, but sometimes if I am against counterpicks I may lose the game. I usually don't rage at other people just because we lost a game. If I get fed too much, I would not rage to myself, but I would identify what was wrong, and why I can't survive the lane. There are a variety of reasons that I could lose my lane, such as I am against my counter, or I am getting ganked a lot when I tried to fight my opponent. \nIf my team was not good enough (maybe they are below level 30 or they are level 30 but don't have enough runes to combat their enemies), we could lose the game anyway. Often, I could die a lot because I started the wrong ability in level 1 and my opponent was ahead of me.\nWinning a game does not depend on one player, it depends on the whole team.","replies":[{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2017-07-13T02:36:04.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get what this post has to do with anything related to the thread?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"About 9 Kenyans","date":"2017-07-07T03:23:06.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldnt go as far as to say im nice, but ive started a club and trying to completely fill it, aiming for non toxic players not gonna be 100% tryhard everygame, do silly strats like 4 supports or all top and stuff to clear the same old 5v5 meta games, add me if you are down for that fam","replies":[]}]}
