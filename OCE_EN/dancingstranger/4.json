To solve this problem, do what other games do. Let it count down 5 minutes, and after those 5 minutes of dcing you get  a leave even if you come back and reconnect you get a leave unless you redeem yourself by playing X minutes or getting a positive KDA something like that. It is better than your buggy system at the moment. Please don't reply to me saying you were dc for longer than x minutes. I know how to count and I know my maths. The one thing you guys don't know how to do is make a game good. The most massive online moba and still can't even make a leaver system flawless like CSGO and Dota 2. STEP UP YOUR GAME RIOT!","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-15T20:56:22.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the buster was delayed until 5mins already?","replies":[{"poster":"DancingStranger","date":"2015-01-16T02:11:09.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=v3Oub2xw,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-15T20:56:22.062+0000)\n>\n> I thought the buster was delayed until 5mins already?\n\nNo it doesn't, THey claim it does but nope.\n\nI want them to implement a system WHICH ACTUALLY counts down in THE CHAT saying 1minute until leaver buster... etc.  \n\nthey're not replying cause they know im right and their wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-16T04:26:22.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't replying because it usually isn't the oceanic team that actually creates these things, they just implement and monitor them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-15T10:43:22.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to admit that it is annoying when you leave a match because of something like severe lag, etc, for like 10 seconds and reconnect, you still get either a warning, or the 10 minute low priority queue or even 20 mins, and so on.
