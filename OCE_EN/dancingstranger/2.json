I got really annoyed and thought I'd share with you guys 20 patches later. With the old patcher 3g and the shop used to load nice and smooth now I cant even load it... Why is this?\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/9cc3d632e06fdb57efa2c34b47b0916e.png\n\nI'm using vodafone 3g.\n\nkind regards,\n\nDancing\nStranger","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-10T23:57:55.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That wouldn't be because of your 3G.
