However even though it said that it was sucessful, I did not receive any. People told me its instant once you &#039;&#039;submit&#039;&#039; the code however my balance is still 0. Do I need to reach a certain level to allow RP usage? Do I also need to verify my account first before inputting the code? If so... does that mean my RP is lost somewhere since I did not verify first?
