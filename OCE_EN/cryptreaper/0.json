I don't have any control over the money you gave to them. In the EULA, you agreed to the fact that any money which you pay to their online service is not eligible for refund period. It's still possible for you to get a refund via something like Paypass, if that was how you paid, because you could claim you paid for a service that was not delivered.\n\nLeaverbuster is very strict at the moment because of the lack of a Tribunal or any sort of manual banning. It's sad but required to maintain a relatively healthy game-state.\n\nHow about, try running a custom game first thing in the morning and see if you can connect to that? If it doesn't load the custom game, you won't get penalised. Then, after quitting the custom game, you might be able to join a ranked game no worries. By no means would this be a solution, but it would allow you to continue playing without getting constantly Leaverbuster'd.\n\nHave you performed any maintenance on your computer recently, such as cleaning out the case for dust, cleaning the hard-disk if it's near full, defrag (though that doesn't really do anything), registry clean, update graphics driver, etc.?","replies":[{"poster":"CryptReaper","date":"2015-05-13T07:48:37.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do all the things on that maintenance list monthly (or if i forget, every second month) XD i did a computing course so i know how dusty things can get in there XD...also i cant believe i never thought of custom games -_- thanks, i'll try that XD also, for not being a riot employee, you are very nice for helping others as i have seen you post on quite a few other problems :)\nand in the contract they did say no refunds, but if they are breaking the contract by penalising me for afk when it is most likely a problem with their servers, then they should be liable for any losses (or so i've been told). and before anyone thinks its just a way to get my money back...i only suggested that as a final option, i still want to play league, i like the skins i bought, i use every single one i purchased regularly and i continue to buy skins that i like.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptReaper","date":"2015-05-13T09:19:19.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok...so after 4 attempts to do the custom game (it kept quitting the whole thing cus of the dc >.>) i finally got in, played for 5 minutes and then quit...game completely froze for 5 minutes after that XD. but no problems once i get into my other game...not an ideal fix but will have to do for now >.<","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-13T10:26:09.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, so you have a way to play the game without getting punished. That's great, but not a permanent solution.\n\nA few things to try:\n\n1. Repair the client, via the patcher. Remember to back up your settings and item sets, as they are erased without warning!\n2. Update your graphics drivers specifically. Most commonly this is done by going to the manufacturer's website and dowloading a program which downloads and installs the drivers. Each company is different. You can usually check what manufacturer's site you should visit by running dxdiag.exe.\n3. Lower the graphics settings. It might just be stressing your graphics card out, initially, or blowing some sort of figurative fuse (which would explain why it's fine the rest of the day).\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptReaper","date":"2015-05-13T10:50:50.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what i dont get though...the only thing that is common with my first game crashing is the ranked reset...its the first game after that no matter what time i play the first game...(i experimented within a month XD) any theories on that part?
