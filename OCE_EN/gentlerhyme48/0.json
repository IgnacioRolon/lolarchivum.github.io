They lost lane\n2. His/Her team is feeding\n3. They have to go\n\nDid you ever think that just maybe that person and a very good excuse to why they left?\n\n1. Something very important came up and they had to leave immediately\n2. Someone called them and something had happened\n3. Their power went out for the night\n4. Their computer over heated\n5. They are home looking after their siblings and something happened\n6. Worst case scenario there's an intruder\n\nJust because someone leaves the game doesn't mean they should be banned permanently.
