Since then I get the RADS error saying to check the firewall and internet connection. Tried resetting my router, tried deleting lol.patcher, airclient etc folders. Nothing worked. Then things got weirder, I decided to try re downloading the whole game, but I can't. I get server not found in my browser. Tried different browsers and both computers in my home. I was going to submit a support ticket, But my browsers wont find that page either! Anyone else have this issue? I'm gravitating towards a firewall/ISP problem atm but Im not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-17T04:13:55.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Many people are getting this issue. The servers aren't down or anything, something is just preventing data from being sent to your computer from that particular site.\n\nHave you attempting changing your DNS yet? That solution has worked for many.","replies":[]}]}
