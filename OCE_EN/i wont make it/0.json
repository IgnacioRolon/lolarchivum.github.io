Hence I wouldn't say the matchmaking is simply being hard on you as statistically, if you are above the average of the elo bracket and you don't make too much silly mistakes, you really should win more.\n\nWin or lose streak, it should more or less, even out. If you're good for your elo you'll natually climb and same for vice versa.\n\nAnother thing is, the solo queue has some grinding incorporated into the system unless your skill is way beyond your current elo otherwise a swift climb isn't all that possible as there are other random factors, like teammates being one.\n\nSo if you wish to simply avoid the chances of getting bad teams occasionally, then play 5s.","replies":[{"poster":"I wont make it","date":"2015-04-04T18:19:31.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No man dont even think about it!
