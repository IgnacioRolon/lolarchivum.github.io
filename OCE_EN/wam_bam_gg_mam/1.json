Here are the details:\r\nPlayers with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this year&rsquo;s rewards.\r\nPlayers issued a ban of seven days or more in the three months prior to the end of the season (from August 7 on) are ineligible for this year&rsquo;s rewards.\r\nPlayers banned for boosting during the 2016 season remain ineligible for rewards.\r\nPlayers who experienced fraud-related and erroneous bans will still be eligible.\r\nAll players will have another chance at future ranked season rewards.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-17T23:45:19.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rules didn't actually change from 2015 to 2016 (or from 14 to 15 for that matter I don't believe), but it's worded that way to leave the door open to change if something new comes up or something in the punishment/reward systems changes.\n\nAs it is, you can expect the eligibility to remain pretty much the same. There isn't anything that has really changed all that much RE ranked rewards and punishments so I expect the requirements won't change either.","replies":[]}]}
