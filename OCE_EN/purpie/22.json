This requirement is specifically intended for platforms outside of Riot supported regions such as Garena. Some regions do not have 3 ranked queues, so they will receive their third chroma through 50 wins. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nSince we do have the 3 ranked queues (and as of recently ranked TT hours were extended in preparation for end of season rush), it will probably be the gold+ requirement for our region.","replies":[]}]}
