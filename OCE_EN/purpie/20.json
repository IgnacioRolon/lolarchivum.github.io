Sure a good janna is amazing, but a bad janna is still good (look at my op.gg, a player that incompetent shouldn't be gold, should be silver 5 at best). \n\nWith the ardent meta, her power has shifted from high value, flexible playmaker with stellar disengage and teamfight manipulation, to all that stuff, but far more impactful, press e, provide an extra item and a half worth of damage maybe two items worth, resistances and a massive shield. I've found that some teamfights I'm ulting simply to apply windspeakers and ardent to my team and a little bit of sustained damage control, rather than as a form of disengage or teamfight control. I'm picking up locket even though I haven't built hp, just so I can apply ardent and windspeakers to more targets, often I'm just using it to push damage in a teamfight with the ardent rather than mitigate damage. Remembering to locket ends up being more important than galing that kha'zix jumping on your adc.\n\nI don't see what there is to appreciate.\n{{sticker:sg-janna}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RequiescatinPace","date":"2017-09-13T09:14:54.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:darius-angry}} {{champion:122}} ...
