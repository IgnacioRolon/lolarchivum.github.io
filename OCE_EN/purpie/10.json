If it's obvious that the person is doing the wrong thing, or I've seen their negative behaviour exhibited, I'll report. This applies even if there's someone asking for a report against another player. I wont just takes someone's word that another player is doing the wrong thing, especially if the one making the claims is using offensive language or harassing others. As long as the person asking for the report actually reports, that's all that is needed to get the process started, so there's no reason for me to \"speak up\" when I have no idea what I'm \"speaking up\" about.\n\nAs for how often I report, *maybe* 2-3 times for every 5 games, average. Some games more than others, some not at all.\n\nThe kinds of things I'll report include, but aren't limited to, various chat offences (hate speech, harassment, offensive language, \"gg ez\" etc.), obvious intentional feeding, potential scripters/bots, ELO boosters (when applicable), AFK/Leavers.\n\nMind you, I rarely play ranked. Only done a total of 26 (SR) ranked games since 2013.\n\nI guess the point is, if you think a behaviour is directly violating the rules, or in general isn't acceptable, submit a report. The system will only be able to reach it's potential if there's players using it.","replies":[{"poster":"NGO Maleficent","date":"2017-08-04T01:03:58.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dTHme7TI,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-08-03T07:33:20.663+0000)\n>\n> The kinds of things I&#x27;ll report include, but aren&#x27;t limited to... \"gg ez\"...\n\nThe fact that this is considered ban-worthy on Riot's end is stupid because it's just hypocritical to what they do in other areas of their game. \n\nRiot promotes LCS players calling each other trash and saying how easy it's going to be for them to beat their opponent or how easy the set was and then turns around and says \"Oh, but you can't do that, it's actually a bannable offense and it's bad for the game.\"\n\nFor a company making money off their competitive scene and using that to try and entice players into the game, they should be drawing a line in the sand that everyone should be following. \n\nEither they're okay with people saying things that equate to \"GG EZ\" and it is therefore unfair to ban people for it OR they should stop promoting things like that in their video packages for the pro leagues and move towards actually removing that type of behaviour from all levels of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-04T02:38:10.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing is, there's a big difference between \"trash talk\" in the pro scene when compared with random matchmade games. In the pro scene, everyone knows it's not to be taken seriously. It's pretty much just showboating, used as something to try and \"psych out\" the opponent and to make things more interesting for fans/viewers.\n\nIn matchmade games, however, it's often seen and even intended as being offensive/harassment. It's not just there to \"psych out\" the opponent or make things more interesting. It's there to \"trigger\" people into toxic responses, such as flaming, feeding or leaving. If you want to do it in an environment where everyone understands it's \"just talk\", that's fine, you can go do that. The moment it's done publically, with people you don't know, who probably don't get that it's \"just talk\" (or just think it's unacceptable behaviour), *that's* when it becomes an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"NGO Maleficent","date":"2017-08-04T07:50:19.451+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few classics from the pro scene:\n> \n> \"They're a bunch of no names, I don't really respect them.

Because even in matches TSM wins, he doesn't look good. He doesn't look like he belongs on a top-tier team\" - Piglet on Wildturtle\n> \n> \"Honestly, it's a fluke, they're not the better team, not even close.

But if he doesn't cheese you, he just sucks\" - Akaadian on Inori\n \nA lot of these comments aren't showboating or \"psyching out\", they're toxic and regardless of the context it's said in, they should at least be removed from video packages on the games if Riot is really against people saying toxic things. The only one of those comments that Riot didn't have control over was the comment made by Dardoch in a post-game interview on a live-stream.\n\nThese are also only from NA, there are plenty of insults like this thrown in other leagues but they tend to be more light-hearted rather than actual flame of a player's skill so I will acknowledge that off the bat.\n\nHonestly, I'm totally fine with the pros saying these types of things because they're isolated comments and tend to not be a sustained attack against a player if that's the direction Riot wants to go. However, if you write \"GG EZ\" and that's the only thing you type to the opposition both during and after the game, you should face no punishment for that if we're going to let the pros do the exact same thing and promote the game through those comments.\n\nI agree with the rest of your initial comment completely, if people are using hate speech or sustaining harassment against players, then sure, go ahead and report alongside things such as intentional feeding and other serious issues and they should be facing punishment. However, just saying \"GG EZ\" as a one-off comment at the end of the game would ultimately fall into the same level of trash-talk as we allow the pro players in our community without punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-04T10:54:14.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose the only thing left to say is, we can agree to disagree.\n\nPersonally, I don't really see anything innately wrong with those comments you've picked out, given the setting they're being used in. It seems like fairly normal banter for professionals in that kind of competitive line of work. I don't ever recall hearing of someone in that position taking something like that to heart, they just understand it's \"trash talk\", in both a metaphorical and literal sense (maybe I just don't care enough too take notice). I still think it's safe to say that such behaviour in a pro scene is an entirely different ball park than the \"average match\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-03T07:15:19.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright you tell me then:\n\nYou just got into a game, your jg forgot to take smite, he proceeds to go top and farm, your top is angry, he does not like this, the jg is taking cs and stealing exp.
