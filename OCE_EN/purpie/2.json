Is it simply because of the new skin being released or is because of shes suddenly a top-tier adc with jihn becoming less popular well at least from what ive been watching off the LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-03T06:32:01.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's been pretty popular for a long time now.\nShe was no. 1 or 2 on the most played list not long ago I believe.\n\nI think its just because she has it all basically:\nLonger range than most others.\nCan completely zone an entire lane with traps, _(as if long range wasn't zoning enough already)_.\nEasy to plop a trap on a CC'd enemy to sign their death warrant.\nInsane damage on headshot.\nQuick escape from fights/chases, (accompanied by damage too).\nLong range nuke ult/execute.\n\nOnly Jhin and Vayne rival the utility and damage her kit has, so its natural that she would be high on the 'to-play' list for most people.\nBut for sure the skin wont help things. Its too cool to not get Cait players _(and others I'm sure)_ riled up and out on the rift.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-03T13:33:47.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the only adc I can't deal with, seriously ashe's range is far enough for an adc IMO and the fact that she can block off an entire lane is stupid. 3 traps on the field at once not 5.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-03T14:19:28.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea its the traps that I cant deal with.\nYou have to tiptoe around your lane which is completely blockaded, and squeeze between the traps in order to advance. But then squished between traps with no where to go, you're easy pickings for her support's CC, or even her own Q poke.\n\nShe still isn't as bad as Vayne though.\nI cant get over %-HP true damage.. its actually a really stupid concept when you \nthink about it.\n\nPlus invisibility and 2 second cooldown dashes.... really?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-04T03:31:06.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah if they are gonna design a champion kit that solely works around doing damage with autos then instead of doing  % health in bonus dmg every 3rd auto it should just be bonus flat dmg with an ad scaling. That way she still gains power as she builds more dmg throughout the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-04T03:58:08.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea exactly.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2017-05-03T14:36:22.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the simple reason is that Cait has been in just about every MSI game, either pick/ban.

With Lucian coming back his natural counter in Cait also makes a surge.\n\nShe's also a good all round champion. Strong laner, good mid and late. With nerfs to the former popular champs like Varus and Jhin as you said, she naturally rises up the order.","replies":[]}]}
