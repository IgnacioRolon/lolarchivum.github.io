Would love to know, I&#039;m kinda slack on reading patch notes and &#039;analysing&#039; it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-11T12:02:53.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I absolutely despise that Banshees Veil gives AP now.\nIt's suddenly become an essential buy on basically every AP mid laner, and while it doesn't really affect the strong champions like Yas/Zed/Kat/Orianna, it makes life absolutely hell for the normal champs like LeBlanc, Morgana, Anivia and co. who actually need to land their full combo to deal damage. It also makes easy to catch champs like Lux much much more slippery, without sacrificing damage, and so boosts them a bit more than it should. So I think that was a terrible change, also I've never seen anyone other than Gallo buy the new Abyssal.\n\nAdaptive helm, while It is a pain in the ass for my 3 main champs, was needed and is a fair llne of defence against champs like Cass, Azir and Teemo that previously had no counter except excessive stacking of MR. So I think that was a good implementation.\n\nGargoyles stoneplate seems fun and gimmicky, but i haven't seen anyone really use it to its full potential yet, so ill have to reserve judgement, but so far it feels more like a Gimmick than an core item.\n\nG.A. just blatantly made Lee Sin, Yasuo and Zed stronger.... Which ruins the very purpose it was made for _(helping ADC's)_\n\nI like the gold coins mini game, and the mana return is nice. \nI haven't tried the Blue one yet, but the Green one's extra shield seems like a nice bonus for supports. It certainly makes being a support more interesting, as you have a little bit more to do while your ADC just AFK farms.","replies":[{"poster":"SeenByTheSea","date":"2017-05-14T23:28:45.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually found Gargoyle Stoneplate works even on less tank oriented champs that have cc and engage. It allows you to engage, lay out some cc and withstand enemy burst pretty effectively, and then by the time it ends, your team is also on top of them and you've got your damage back with much less health loss.\n\nAlso 2500 for 40 of each resist is pretty below par, but when it comes to team fights, thats 80 of each, until 3 of the enemies have died or backed out. quite a nice boost for anyone from bruiser to tank (especially against balanced damage type team comps).","replies":[]}]}]}
