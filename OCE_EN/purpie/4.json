They need to put that feature back. Not necessarily the part where it is on the front page, but just the ability to right-click on a player in game and select 'spectate'. There's only so many Challenger people on a low elo player's friend list :) Plus this feature improves the region as a whole, because analysts can put in work away from scrim reviews.\n\n\"The gap is increasing\" is due to a small combination of factors that have really hurt the western regions. Dynamic queue and not being able to spectate are two key factors that have resulted in Korean teams increasing their lead on the rest of the world. It's time to put the skill back into the game for the other regions.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-30T02:01:18.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you right-click on their names, \"spectate\" does pop up, but you can't select it.
