As a primarily solo player It feels impossible to play a fair game when the other team can have a majority premade party. The old queue was bad yes but you knew that you were all in the same boat, with this new system however it is in no way fair to actually rank players where games are so one sided because one team has a group of actually co-ordinate players vs a ragtag group of people with limited ability to plan and respond. \r\n\r\nWith this dynamic queue there is no viable option to play solo with even odds against the other team. Making friends is not easy, finding friends that are actually consistent in their play and skillful enough to climb with is even harder and the previous distinction between a &#039;Solo/Duo&#039; queue and a &#039;Ranked 5&#039;s&#039; queue was much preferred. Please separate these queues again for the sake of ranked integrity as right now it is horribly imbalanced and quite frankly, not fun in the slightest.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-23T02:38:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot could learn a lot from hots, atm hots like x97 better","replies":[{"poster":"Quavelix","date":"2016-01-23T03:22:42.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=Lag9dEmN,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-01-23T02:38:54.314+0000)\n>\n> riot could learn a lot from hots, atm hots like x97 better\n\nLOL, you've gotta be kidding?
