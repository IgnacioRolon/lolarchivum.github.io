Riot, you have nerfed him a bit too much by removing his range to a point where he cant team fight without some serious peel, removed the knockup and nerfed his dmg. I beg you riot to buff at least one of those aspects of have mentioned to help Azir be a playable and &quot;carry&quot; champion that he used to be. Just check the stats from the link and azir when compared to other midlaners is terrible.

I myself, am a very passionate Zed player, and when he got nerfed during preseason, at first it felt quite different, but you get used to it really quickly.\n\nNot trying to flame here, but for some people, nerfs mean a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"yinnyman","date":"2015-12-10T09:44:48.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for commenting, i do agree with his late game power but i feel his mid is too poor my opinion atm.
