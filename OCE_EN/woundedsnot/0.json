The argument being that either Janna or Soraka do what she does better, completely discounting the fact that having a happy medium in the ever versatile Nami (whose CC I would personally argue is stronger/more reliable than Janna's) is a very good thing. \n\nThat's my experience with is as a Nami main since early S4 anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-17T13:16:39.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her kit is insanely good as a support.\n\ntons of cc(knockup and a slow ult,stun, grants allies slowing effects) and gives you a heal and gives you a move speed bonus through her passive.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-17T11:42:32.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, see I've played Nami so much now I play her on autopilot (and this isn't the best thing) so a lot of how I play her is more instinct and less something I could articulate...but I'll do my best.\n\nShe's a very versatile champion. She can play passive or aggressive, she can play well with any ADC if you know what you're doing and is incredible in teamfights. Not to mention she does very well with very support-y items like {{item:3504}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3050}} .\n\nThat said, she's also a champion that I feel takes a lot of practice to master. She can be very complex at times, and the things you can pull off equally impressive. The two biggest things I would say you have to understand are\n\n1. The range of her W\n - This is so very important for a few reasons. In lane, you want to stay within W range of your ADC pretty much at all times. If you are poking, you want to get the most out of it, so you have to know the bounce range, can you bounce it off the enemy onto your ADC? or at least onto you? Could you even bounce it off their ADC, then you, then their support.Understanding the range of her W lets you draw lines in your head of where you should and shouldn't be, where you can poke or engage on the enemy, where is the line past which you cannot get away if the jungler ganks. All of those are tied very closely to her W range (and understanding supporting in general, but I'm talking specific the fishy here). \n - Of course understanding the Q range is important here as well but the ranges are similar, and I would recommend playing with indicators on the Q if you don't anyway, it is the easiest way to watch and predict movements.\n\n2. Predicting the enemies movements, and to a lesser extent, knowing who to follow in fights.\n - This pretty much comes with practice, and with taking your experience in laning phase to get a decent grasp on how the enemy ADC is moving and thus be able to predict the bubbles, engages, disengages etc. Again, a lot of this is useful for any support, but predicting move patterns is incredibly important for bubble engage in early game, and bubble peels in late.\n - Teamfights can get very hectic as Nami, as support you aren't focusing down a target, but rather your ADC and/or your mid laner is relying on you for peel, so you have to be watching any who might be taking action against them and be ready with the Q. At the same time you also have to be watching your team and the enemy teams movement as a whole for good ult opportunities, or for when you need to disengage. As the support we're the ones who have to watch EVERYTHING, while the tanks are locking people down and the carries are focusing targets, so predicting team and player movements plays a big part here.\n - Is someone coming in from the side? Bubble them and collapse. The enemy team is forcing an engage that isn't favourable for your team? Your R Q combo can change that entirely. It's nigh impossible to miss the bubble after you hit your ult, so as soon as you see that knockup on a carry cloe enoughto you, bubble them and let your team destroy them. \n - Follow their teams movements and create opportunities for your own, that is the key to success in teamfights as Nami (and a whole lot of other heavy CC champs). \n\n\nThat ended up being a whole lot longer than I thought, but hopefully it helped a bit. I won't pretend to be some Challenger level expert, but I do play a lot of Nami :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-15T10:24:23.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Q - Predict where they'll be next.\nW - Use it when there is a crowd, it will be more effective.\nE - Try use it on the person who has no CC.\nR - idk, just surf?","replies":[]}]}
