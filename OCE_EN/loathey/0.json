Ask me anything!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":"The latest Tweets from Laura (@loatheypp). Aussie. Esports Coordinator at Riot Games Oceania. Herding cats (OPL players).

I&#039;ll be around for the next few hours answering any questions you have!\r\n\r\nI started at Riot just over 6 months ago after being a tax accountant and managing a Twitch League of Legends streamer. A lot of my role involves interacting with our OPL players - I spent 5 days with all the League of Legends: League of Origin players last week while they prepared for the event (side note: our pro players are awesome). I was also lucky enough to travel to Brazil with the Dire Wolves for MSI, and will be attending Rift Rivals in Vietnam with the teams!\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently a support player who dabbles in ADC - I don&#039;t get to play as often as I&#039;d like, so I feel support is easier to slot back into the game! My favourite champions currently are Nami, Zyra and Caitlyn.\r\n\r\nOutside of my life of computers I&#039;ve been into netball since a super young age, but unfortunately I haven&#039;t been able to play any this year so far. If anyone in Sydney plays somewhere reasonably close to Pyrmont and needs a fill in on a weeknight, I&#039;m in! I also love spending time with my family - they&#039;re mostly in Victoria so I don&#039;t get to see them as much as I would like... but there&#039;s always Skype.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and ask me anything :)","replies":[{"poster":"espork me daddy","date":"2017-06-09T05:32:37.220+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone wanted to do what you do, what would you recommend they do to prepare?","replies":[{"poster":"loathey","date":"2017-06-09T05:48:45.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A lot of what I do is about attention to detail and organisation. I think a great path to something like I do would be team management - regardless of whether it's esports or traditional sports, I think there's a lot of crossover between the roles. If you can get involved as a team manager of an esports team and do a kickass job, all the better! \nI think one thing that really helped me with being employed by Riot was the time I spent as secretary at my local football/netball club. Along with taking all the notes for our meetings I was also on our social committee, where there was a lot of planning and details involved. When I was applying for the position at Riot I had to do a practical task, and a lot of the things I took away from my time as secretary were applied to the task.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2017-06-09T05:10:47.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favourite OCE Rioter and why do they sit opposite you in the office? <3","replies":[{"poster":"loathey","date":"2017-06-09T05:18:50.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously you.

IEM Sydney was great to go to as a spectator, and I would love to see more big events in Oceania. \nHaving Adelaide Crows invest in Legacy is fantastic for esports. Personally, I would love to see more traditional sports teams investing (Richmond pls come love us) - if we can get the teams having really solid infrastructures I think that's a great step to OCE performing well internationally.\n\nHow do you feel about it all?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-06-09T14:05:58.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally and this is just my option. OCE will never be a competitive sever. For the simple fact we lack the ability to scrim with better teams. To put this simply oce will never do well internationally, we lack the money that all the top severs do and we lack the raw talent that they have. oce will stay near the bottom and we are never leaving there.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-06-12T05:30:19.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you think the only things stopping us from being competitive are that we don't scrim with better teams and we don't have the infrastructure in place, those both seem like things that have fairly straightforward solutions.\n\nI think over the course of the next 12-18 months, eSports is going to explode in Australia. Already there's a lot of discussion around what the next big investment for the Australian economy will be - mining is on its last legs and tourism is something that doesn't pay off immediately, so an industry like eSports is in a prime position to benefit from that hole.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-06-14T06:46:54.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So first of I would like to hear your straight forward solution to not being able to scrim better teams and not have the infrastructure. \n\nAs for e sports exploding in the next 12 to 18 months. I honestly find that very unlikely as 1 we honestly don't have the population to support it.  2 watching the OPL is not that great in all honesty. If of you watch an OPL game then say NA or the LCK the quality of game play  between isn't even comparable. It would be like watching a silver elo game and than a challenge elo game and saying the silvers are just as clean in how they play as the challangers are.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-06-10T08:10:33.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if anything is being done about the intent feeding and griefing that's rife in League of Legends?\n\nIt seems the only focus is on those who show toxicity instead of coming down hard on the actual players who ruin the game.\n\nA toxic person can be dealt with swiftly via the mute button yet we are powerless against an intent feeder/griefer.\n\nA 0 tolerance in ranked games should be adopted and bans dealt with swiftly and harshly.\n\nI have 0 faith in the reporting system and it's ability to punish those ruining the game on a constant basis and I'm sure a lot of others share the same disappointment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-06-09T09:48:50.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Laura, sorry if I'm late for questions!\n\nAs per my AMA tradition I have two serious questions for you, and two fun questions for you.

The things I'm involved in that affect broadcast (and therefore viewers) are mostly around the pro players being ready for stage, and the guys are all great about this. On the OPL weekends I try to do a bit of other work, but it's more important that our show runs smoothly and the players in the building are happy!

Initial reaction is to say Yasuo, but having a think about it, it'd be Udyr. The only time I've seen it played this season is when Spawn played it top yesterday, so I think he either needs a rework or to go bye bye.\n4. I actually came into the Oceania office without having a favourite team, so I'm not sure! I've cheered on the Chiefs when they've gone international in the past, but I don't think that necessarily means I'd be supporting them - there's a lot of great personalities that we get to see now that the teams are accessible for content in Sydney.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"altruistic serf","date":"2017-06-09T05:16:06.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What time is dinner, Mum?","replies":[{"poster":"loathey","date":"2017-06-09T05:23:43.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Story time.
