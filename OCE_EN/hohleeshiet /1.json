Please change it back to the normal version of the rift you guys keep adding changed to the game and now theres an incoming lee nerf ! you added stupid plants in the jg that dont fit in with the game and a new client that makes people connect about 4 seconds later in normal games usually resulting in last pick every time! stop changing things leave it the way they were, the way people want it to be! Im not playing normals until this snowdown overlay is removed it hurts my eyes and my mates have agreed with me there too and it makes not my pc lag but for people who have laptops just barely playing the game on 60fps you make it so difficult for them!{{champion:64}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Funinthesun","date":"2016-12-15T17:15:05.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That hurt my eyes to read; learn to paragraph please. The much needed lee nerf and release of a new fun champion are things that are separate to the topic. \n\nAs for the snow map, it has been begged for by so many for so long since the old map got removed and as a temporary map limited to normal games, I think it adds a nice holiday feeling to the rift. \n\nStay classy Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-12-15T22:07:23.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this sums up the lol community a bit to well.

If they are playing ranked they will still get the normal rift, so I don't even see the problem here. You get snow for a while in normals, which is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"HohLeeShiet ","date":"2016-12-16T15:35:37.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"its shit","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2016-12-19T05:06:33.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have no snowdown spirit, such a shame.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-12-18T01:01:18.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"HAHHAHAHHAHA YOU LOST ALL MERIT TO YOUR ARGUMENT WHEN YOU SAID LEE DIDNT NEED A NERF HAHAHHAHA\n\nI have level 5 lee sin, and play him frequently, but even I agree that his ult damage is total bs. Its supposed to be a playing making ability, which when used right can cc the carry or knock up the whole enemy team, but its just evolved into some dumb ass one shot ability. \n\nIt takes away the fun part of Lee's kit which allows you to make epic plays, in a sense you should be happy Lee is being nerfed because now you can actually make plays instead of just insta-killing someone every 30 seconds.","replies":[]}]}
