Maybe on the right-hand side when someone gets a normal kill, instead they get a special border or symbol. I don't know haha, but not a bad idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-11T08:16:40.542+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. But, after a quick 5 seconds of thinking. (and writing out that sentence.) I was thinking that a smaller avatar next to the killer could be a great thing. So for example Riot could add a small avatars of the assistants next to the big avatar of the penta or quadra killer.","replies":[]}]}]}
