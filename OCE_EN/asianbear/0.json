It seems to me that riot does control the game experience via \"no rage quitting\", however there are still people who get away with stupidity and offensive language. \r\nThe report button does not seem to be legitimate, or if it is, warnings given to players are just brushed off the shoulder. Besides after a warning players just do 1 good deed and they seem to be back in the good books. This is absurd if you ask me.   \r\nRiot should support a different banning program where chat screens are able to be sent straight to them and reviewed for unpleasant behavior. An example would be the image below. Its just disgraceful.","replies":[{"poster":"Problematictroll","date":"2015-02-03T00:49:21.631+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao the most populated race on the planet is 'a bunch of virgins'.\n\nWhy are you even mad this is gr8 comedy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:10:55.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">You know that time when your stressed from work and you just want to relax and enjoy a game or two when you get home?\n\nWho plays League for fun?
