First you must understand that OCE isn't as well monitored as the other regions are, so if you were used to playing on another region before coming here, you should expect the community to be slightly worse upfront.\n\nWhat could be happening is that the way your express yourself could be bringing out the worst in people, thus causing them to do things like troll and afk. You could try and refrain from swearing via text. There's no need for it and you can't say you can't control it, as you need a steady hand to type.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-03T05:20:10.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Do you think this is Help & Supports?\n\n%%%% off, you're being matched with people the same level as you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-03T07:55:12.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although this is what he deserves, it won't help anyone.
