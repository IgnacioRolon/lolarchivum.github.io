I was playing Shaco and trying out Sated, and in the process of trying to get stacks I had the thresh and Tristana clearing my bottom jungle throughout the entire game, I suffer from ADHD so this really got on my nerves but I tried to control myself. but then I tried to gank bot lane cause they were in dire need of help, so I headed down, Qd in and got behind Lucian (enemy ADC) I waited for thresh to engage but instead they both ran the opposite way of and easy 1v3 win. after that my Q ran out and the Lucian just managed to kill me escape. they then proceeded to type in all: &quot;wow noob Shaco&quot; and continued to do this every time I died regardless of how or why I died. this got on my nerves and I couldn&#039;t hold back so I insulted her, don&#039;t even remember what I said. it took like 30 minutes to get sated -_- because of this Tristana and thresh. my entire team other then them was playing really well except Nasus fed a bit early but picked up really well. us three were communicating but the premade bot had a different idea, they decided that in the fight where the enemy was storming out mid, they would sit in base and watch, eat some popcorn or something. then we lost, I asked the enemy team to report Tristana, idk if any did but my teammates did. then I leave the postgame lobby, and bam, &quot;play 24 more matchmade games...&quot; a chat restriction, because I was telling a Tristana to actually help...\n\nIf I could have the reason why I was chat restricted or if possible it removed that&#039;d be great. Im someone that enjoys talking to people and communicating, and this 24 game restriction will just make playing 24 games HELL for me and not worth playing just so some troll and go and get his premade to report me and get another chat restriction...\n\nThanks to any staff that read this and respond.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-04T06:18:13.318+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey XDjzz,\n\nBecause this is an account-specific inquiry, we can’t help you out here on the Boards. As such, you’ll want to direct this to Riot Games Player Support by [**submitting a ticket**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us)! As you submit your request, here are some tips that will help resolve this issue as quickly as possible: \n\n1. Create an account on the Riot Games Support website. It'll save you a lot of time in the future and keep your requests organized and easier to find/access. \n2. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n3. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n4. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[]}]}
