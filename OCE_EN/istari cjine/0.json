Reinstall the client?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-28T08:28:42.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nApologies for the delayed response.\n\nSounds to me like you might be experiencing an intermittent connection issue on your end/Your ISP's.\n\nCould you run through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues support article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for me, let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]}]}
