Now a whole game in ruined for 9 other people and i get afk queue because of that? Does my league need a reinstall? Has this happened to anyone else? What can i do if i just keep queueing afk queues will get worse if it keeps crashing on loading screen....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-28T10:49:24.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would recommend making sure you are running League as administrator, then running the repair.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/h2NTOH8.png?noredirect\n\nIf that doesn't work, or you are already running in admin, then I'd recommend doing a clean install through the Hextech Repair Tool.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool\n\nUnsure if this is the case with you, but it's also worth noting that if you use fullscreen mode then alt-tabbing in the loading screen is not recommended, because you're essentially telling your computer you don't want to load it yet which can cause problems. If you want to alt-tab in loading, switch to borderless mode.","replies":[]}]}
