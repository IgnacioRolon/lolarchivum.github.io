Now i am being asked to verify i am the original creator of my account but all the verification questions are very hard to answer as my account is about 5 years old and have owned all champs for a long time so hard to remember who my first champ was and what my first RP purchase was. I have spent alot of time money and energy on this account and i would really like someone from Riot to be able to work with me to get it back.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to use the support ticket system but the only replies i get are &quot;our information doesnt match please try remember more and email me if you do&quot; - I have many other ways i could prove it is my account but no one is working with me to help and it feels like riot are making it harder with every email  i send them\r\n\r\n-The guy never changed my password, i can still log in kind of, allthough i get the account banned/suspended pop up\r\n-my email has been verrified with my league of legends account since 2014 when they gave out the 4win ip boost (I still have this email)\r\n-my account has never had any security issues and i have never had to email riot or create a support ticket before \r\n\r\nAny ideas from any other summoners, or ideally some proper help from a riot staff (And not just telling me to create a ticket) would be very much appreciated, my account means a lot to me and I would forever be grateful for any help i can get\r\n\r\nI have many people that would vouch for me and records would show ive been playing with most of these people since season 1/2 \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[]}
