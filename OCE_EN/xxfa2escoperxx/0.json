I have spent over $100 on this game and I really love it. It&#039;s a really fun game I can play with my friends that I want to invite them to. I want to watch this game grow, so I thought the best way would be to get a PBE account, unfortunately, PBE isn&#039;t it Oceania {{item:3070}} . I believe it is unfair that NA and other servers get PBE while just as popular servers get absolutely no way to try out anything new, or no way to give back to the community. \r\n\r\nTheir input can never be heard, and that goes against the purpose of the PBE. Why catch the voice of the people, when you&#039;re going to exclude most of them. I know it&#039;s unlikely, but I hope someone from Riot sees this and how large the pole is (hopefully). Maybe then Oceania can properly express there love and enjoyment for this game, while still getting as much as voice as other servers\r\n\r\nCheers, James.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-07T22:15:43.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should we have a PBE for OCE?

Riot have been screwing OCE over since they started our server, what makes you think they're going to do something nice for us now?","replies":[{"poster":"xXFa2eScOpErXx","date":"2016-04-10T00:12:02.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the chances are incredibly low, but there are 30 or so other threads asking for the same thing.

Oce is put last on their say just because of the lack of numbers and well half of the oce players were banned because of toxicity (hence why oce ban system is rubbish atm)\n\nTo be honest its more likely for them to rework singeds passive, than making a oce pbe (singeds passive rework was confimed by a rioter 5 years ago, and yet too happen because the rioter in charge of it left{{champion:27}} {{item:3070}} )\nJust dont ask for something this big without knowing how much effort a company has to do just to fill the needs of a few thousand people, if you really want pbe go move your account to na then sign up for pbe, its never going to happen on oce, one testing zone is enough for a game.\n\nalso if oce had pbe everyone will just move to it, then ranked queues on the normal server will just be extremely (more) shit for queue times and well.... it will just be plain horrid (like really i dont want to wait another 30 minutes for my ranked game i would probably loose from riven mains being cocky :P )","replies":[{"poster":"xXFa2eScOpErXx","date":"2016-04-24T09:34:06.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more about \"it isn't fair for JUST NA to get it.
