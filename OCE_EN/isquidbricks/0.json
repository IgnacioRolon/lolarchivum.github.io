I have checked on sites like op.gg and the league match history to see if it is still in use and it appears to still be in use. I don&#039;t know how it&#039;s being used and don&#039;t know if there is any chance of recovering it but any help on the matter would be appreciated.\n\nAccount Username: *removed*\n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-06T02:25:15.194+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Squidbricks! \n\nI removed your account name since it is sensitive info that is used to log into your account and is probably best left unshared. Unfortunately we are unable to help you with your account specific inquiry on the boards. \n\nIf you haven't already, I would suggest you [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) explaining what has happened and your concerns about your account. Please note that if you ever shared your account with a mate or anyone else, you probably won't get it back. If it is a genuine breach then there is still hope. \n\n**When submitting a ticket: \n**\n>Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you (although majority of tickets are answered within 48 hours), so be patient\n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]}]}
