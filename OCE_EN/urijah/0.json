No website will have your MMR, only select few Rioters know the correct algorithm, meaning websites like op.gg can give an estimate, although are likley way off. \n\nAt the beginning of a season, every player that played rank the previous season endures a \"soft reset\" where their MMR drops a few tiers and they do their placements from there. Almost every single player during this period will end up in a rank that was lower than where they ended in the previous season, even if you go even or positive. \n\nI went 8-2 and went from P4 to G1. I have friends that won the same amount as me and dropped even further. For you, dropping from S5 to B1 may seem like a kick in the teeth, but in reality it isn't actually that bad. It is said that the \"true\" rank of a player isn't actually discovered until they play 100 games, since 10 is a pretty small amount to judge skill off when the player will likely be playing a lot more. \n\nKeep climbing, there is no reason you can't be silver (and maybe even higher) again ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"SollyTuatara","date":"2017-04-07T09:17:56.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same thing but end up in lowest b5 because i won 6 games and did well in all of them","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-04-08T00:45:27.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ended B4 last season, after the \"soft reset\", 6-4 placements would have indicated you were at the correct rank for you at that point in time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-04-07T12:54:03.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You wouldn't know your MMR, no one does (except Riot).

I just skimmed your op gg so I'm not sure, but if you lost the first 3 games then won the next 7 that would be why your mmr ended so low. Your first few placement games have the most impact on your mmr.  \n\nThe good thing is, you have the entire season to climb! Placements are only 10 games out of the perhaps hundreds of games you'll play this season so don't take that ranking too seriously :p Like you said before, you know you deserve silver, so get out there on the rift and prove it :D","replies":[]}]}
