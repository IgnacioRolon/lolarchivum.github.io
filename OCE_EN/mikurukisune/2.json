But at least all the skins fulfil the main criteria of being Legendaries.\n\nMagnificent TF etc. literally has nothing to classify it as a 975 (let alone a 1850). \nBut Riot have stated they will not be updating them or changing the price unless that champion receives a full Yorick level rework.\n\nWhich in my opinion is a very shitty move.\nAt very least they should reduce the price temporarily until they can be fucked honouring their own code.\n\n\n_________\n\nBut on a side note, Tryndamere is probably the most boring champion in the game visually, he has no particles except very slight auras around him, pretty much his only form of damage is auto attacks, and his model is just some dude holding a big sword. \n\nTheres not actually a lot they can change for a skin.\nThey can change the shape/colour/sounds of the slight auras, but thats the only VFX he has.\nI suppose they could make him spin clockwise instead of anti-clockise?\nAnd unless they want him to be un-recognisable at a glance _(which they don't like doing for skins)_, he still has to be some dude dragging a big-ass sword behind him. \n\nSo apart from completely adding evolving model ultimate level skin mechanics like Elementalist Lux, theres honestly not much that can be done to make a Trynd skin outstanding. \n\nThey can add a few particles to his spin, make his emotes more interesting, add little things like PROJECT: Ashe's hood. But Legendary skins for other champs have all of that and much much more anyway.\n\nSkins for champs like Kindred or Bard _(in the same price bracket)_ are just always going to be more interesting/higher quality than Trynd skins, purely because theres so much more to change. \n\nTrynd skins _(any trynd skin)_ can't really be that much more than just a model change.\n\nIm not saying they shouldn't update his Demonblade skin _(personally I think it's hideous, and needs a good makeover along with the rest of him)_ Im just saying that as a skin for that particular champ, it will always have much less potential than other skins for more interesting champions. \nSo theres not a huge amount they _can_ change.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-22T09:18:51.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah you just don't have any imagination, here's what I think they should do for DemonBlade Tryndamere:\n\nPassive - Pretty much the same concept, attacking and building up rage causes swirls of rage to orbit tryns model, as he builds more rage, the swirls become more obvious and intact and somewhat \"complete\".\n\nQ - As Tryndamere's health decreases, he gains attack dmg, so as his health slowly goes down he gets angrier and angrier, his model colour gradually gets brighter and brighter until he is red pulsing with rage. Activating Q causes all the swirls of rage to absorb inside tryndamere, healing him.\n\nW - Tryndamere lets out a deep demonic scream, any enemy champions in the area with their backs turned have a big demon face over their head instead of a chicken and have a black aura on them until the duration ends.\n\nE - The blade lights up a red and orange color, as he spins and for a brief time afterwards, deep red demonic runes can be seen on the blade, also after he spins the ground appears \"corrupted\" for a short time.\n\nR - Since this is his ultimate ability I thought it would be pretty cool if his model changes so he appears as though he is in some \"final form\" for a short time, like he has multiple \"tendrils\" coming out of his body, his blade is longer and pulsing like crazy.\n\nHis recall could be him going into a \"hell cocoon\" kind of like you see in some horror movies where little winged demons pop out of. After he enters the cocoon starts pulsing and you can see Tryndamere's model outline flashing like he's inside healing or something.\n\nThere you go, it's better then nothing, at least I have ideas. If you have any better suggestions go ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-22T09:35:47.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you misunderstand me.\nIm not saying you cant make an awesome skin for Trynd, I'm 100% sure that they could make one that is better than pulsefire Cait if they really wanted.\n\nIm saying that no matter how much effort you put into a skin for Trynd, the same amount of effort put into a more interesting champ, will inevitably yield a better skin. So while you can make great skins for him, because they are made for such a simple champion, they have less potential than skins made for other champions.\nFor example, I think there would be very few skins you could make for Tryndamere that wouldn't look just as good if not better on someone like Kayn. Just because Kayn has more stuff to play with and make look cool.\n\nYou have some great ideas there for the skin, but some like the runes glowing on the blade after the spin, or leaving corrupted ground, might be confusing for gameplay as usually glowing runes on a sword (say Riven) means that the sword has an effect active, and corrupted ground (Varus's E) usually indicates damaging or other unfriendly areas.\n\nSo whatever you do to him, has to be done without leaving any room for confusion about what effects are in play.\nThats one of the problems with making epic skins for simple champs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MikuruKisune","date":"2017-08-22T06:49:56.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree with pretty much everything you said, I also agree in the fact that there probably isn't anything they can change about his Legendary Skin, but I still want to believe there's hope for our ugly ass friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-08-22T09:01:12.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"All you need is hope, aaaaaaand a giant metal suit.\"\n\n-{{champion:68}} - 2014\n\n________________\nBut I'm sure that it will be updated eventually, _(at at the rate riot are reworking champion, probably sooner rather than later)_.
