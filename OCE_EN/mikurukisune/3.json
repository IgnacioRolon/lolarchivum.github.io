For us it was Sunday and Monday instead of Saturday and Sunday as far as I know since I could not get any candies on Saturday, but got them Sunday and now Monday.\n\nWith the weekends we get, we will have enough free candies to get the Penguin and Gingerbread icon, but the other two icons that give a special limited time emote won't be accessable without spending some cash to get extra candies. \n\nSeeing as the emotes aren't forever, I think two free Summoner icons is pretty good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-18T04:58:37.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why a trading system for the chest could help heaps.

So I won't say it's such a bad idea for Riot even on an economical stand-point. Considering customer flexibility time and time again, actually encourages spending than they would otherwise.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-12-18T07:52:16.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"YOU spent money on league of legends\nmoney that was used to buy a RANDOM collectable\nit's nobody's fault but your own","replies":[]}]}
