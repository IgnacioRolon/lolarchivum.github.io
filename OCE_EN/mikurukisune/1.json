You might be wondering what brings me here? Well, I'm glad you asked Jimmy, One morning (Today) I was browsing my emails and I received a wonderful notification that my account had been Permanently Banned for \"malicious 3rd party programs or modifications.\".\n\nNow, that's just ridiculous I thought, I haven't played the game for like 6 months how could I possibly get banned for something I didn't do so I investigated and to my surprise, my account was hacked as there was 2 VERY recent games played within the account. As you could imagine, I Instantly changed every single password on any fourm/program and emails I used. Of course It's too late for my League account sadly, hopefully Support will investigate this.\n\nI do not claim to have used any 3rd party programs or modifications towards the game nore have I shared any information of my account information with anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-04-19T03:43:29.094+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So your best bet at getting this sorted is probably to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) using the standard Account Recovery process (ensure you're logged out, then use the \"Recover my account\" option). Explain your situation to them, and they'll do their best to help. One of the things they'll do is ask you a series of questions about the account that can't be answered using 3rd party services (op.gg, for example) to confirm you're the original owner of the account (you don't have to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt), and after that they will probably be able to identify any users that aren't you, and ideally reverse any bans resulting from the actions of those users. One thing to note is that any history of account sharing is likely to result in the Support agents being unable to do anything, as it is an explicit breach of the [ToU](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and comes down to a responsibility of the user.\n\nA couple things I'd recommend in this situation is, firstly, ensuring the security of any computers you use regularly. This is basically using whatever anti-virus software you have to run scans (the more thorough, the better) and check for anything out of the ordinary. For that I'd (personally) recommend downloading Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and using the free version to run a scan, as that tends to pick up things that other programs might miss, in my experience (totally up to you, though). The other thing you can do is to check all your email addresses against the database on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as that site will generally be able to tell you when any of your accounts have been compromised (it's not perfect, but it is a great resource for situations like this).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-04-19T20:21:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still no 2fa btw. multi billion dollar company btw.","replies":[]}]}
