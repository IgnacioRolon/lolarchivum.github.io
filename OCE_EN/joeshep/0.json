Please consider the simple act of testing out your ideas and thinking about how the idea will effect the game. I am sure that there will be those who disagree with me and those who agree with me. Obviously I speak for those who agree with me, because I have come across some really really over powered champions this season.","replies":[{"poster":"Qweeeeerty","date":"2015-11-20T06:55:32.272+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Patch is fine, I'm new to the game and I haven't really come across anything I say is OP.\nFrom what I've heard and seen all they've done is just changed the game up a little and people don't know how to adjust.\nI know I'm new to the game and my option input shouldnt be seen as a overall option but it really isn't that bad.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Area2609","date":"2015-11-22T13:38:01.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the patch is pretty good all around. The buffs to ADC's was a massive improvement, however they could of done better on a couple of the reworks, as adc's all still feel very similar (besides from Graves, i really like his rework. The massive damage up close but no range and has to re-load after 2 shots was just a grate idea. However graves is a little bit on the OP side and now can almost win the laning phase with very little counters). I know a few older players will be a bit disappointed as the game is very different then it was in Session 2.","replies":[]}]}
