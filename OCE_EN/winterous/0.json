If there was an option to have the window permanently locked in the middle of the screen I would use it at all times.\r\n\r\nPLEASE, PLEASE fix this. You could add an option to centre the window, or change the drag bar to either be really narrow at the very top, or make it like a &#039;button&#039; spot as the only place you can drag it around.\r\nI don&#039;t care what you do, just please change it, it drives me crazy!","replies":[{"poster":"Winterous","date":"2017-02-13T23:00:17.716+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just measured it. On the standard window size, with the loot and store buttons, the drag bar extends all the way down to 6 pixels above the lowest clickable point of the button; actually the bottom of the words 'loot' and 'store'.\n\nIt's absurd how far down it reaches!","replies":[]}]}
