K/D/A is irrelevant.\n2. The order in which you win/lose games can affect where you are placed.\n3. It is possible for your MMR to be an entire division below your rank before being demoted. *Note: check your estimated MMR on OP.GG*\n4. It uses your rank from the end of season 4, not your rank from the end of pre-season. *Note that it still uses your MMR from the end of pre-season.*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-02T22:15:34.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost your chances in your first game. In the very first game of your promos I assume is the Vayne Game. You lost with a end game score of 6/13/8. You had a game MMR of 1130 and were placed with high bronze low silver. After that lose you've been placed with low bronze ever since. Your next Game MMR is 800. Which means you lost 300 in that one loss you had at the start. The order in which you lose and win your games is also a major factor to placements rather than just your win lose ratio. Sorry for your placements though. If you can continue playing like you appear to be. With the 8/2 win lose ratio I'm sure you'll make it out.\n\nRegards,\nFog","replies":[{"poster":"Syfeariax","date":"2015-02-03T02:08:52.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks very much, i will continue to try and get out of bronze it was just a massive bummer is all thank you for your time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ethereal Dracico","date":"2015-02-02T16:57:11.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What was your rank last season ?","replies":[{"poster":"Syfeariax","date":"2015-02-03T02:07:33.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze 3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-02T14:44:22.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for some reason, a lot of people were placed really long.
