I know for sure that it isn&#039;t my firewall because i disabled it to test if it actually was, I disabled my anti-virus and made exceptions to the ports that LoL uses so that it would actually allow the connections, I still come up with this error and i&#039;m starting to think that this error is unsolvable or it has no solution, and if that&#039;s the case, then that REALLY sucks.\n\nPlease help me fix this goddamned satan spawn of an error..\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"Boxoflemons","date":"2015-06-30T15:31:27.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Emreezy","date":"2015-06-30T04:08:56.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously need help with this..
