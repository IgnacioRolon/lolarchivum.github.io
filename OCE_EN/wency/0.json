I had a guy flame all game, cuss me out all different ways, and then threaten to kill my family, all because i was Veigar and kept stunning him with cage. \nSo i did post game report, then manual follow up as i don't trust the Riot bot whatsoever, and basically got told not to double report when their system works fine. I asked why he wasn't instantly suspended due to language and threats (when i had previously gotten a chat restriction instantly for defending myself against a duo and told them to stop inting and was told it was because i spammed in chat too much..), quoted the breach of guidelines from Riot's statements about hate speech, and they didn't care at all. \nI've had similar occurrences like that for years and nothing ever happens. Unfortunately the complete lack of followup is why the community is so toxic; they know they can get away with it because Riot doesn't enforce anything.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-23T07:14:02.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/NBhEWAwE-i-just-met-a-weirdly-disturbing-shen?comment=00010000000100000000 https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/AvuXWLZF-fucking-losing-more-rank-games-then-winning?comment=0001 I reckon they do because I report so many people so that must be the 1-5 reasons I find so many trolls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-22T04:43:33.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they would've been chat restricted","replies":[]},{"poster":"xEternalFeederx","date":"2019-11-22T06:11:43.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Also, the more you report that the system deems not valid the less the system values your report, plenty of toxic ppl who report someone every game after all.
