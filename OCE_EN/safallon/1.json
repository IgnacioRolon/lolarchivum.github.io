The vibe was so festive, and the Snowdown champion skins made sense; they had a proper context. It had such a great feel around the holidays. Even though we live in the southern hemisphere here in OCE, it was awesome to be able to participate in the snowiness of the season on the rift.\r\nA lot of us summoners spend so much time on the rift, and when you did make it snowy, it meant that we were still participating in holiday cheer as we whiled away our hours on the rift.\r\n\r\nI absolutely looked forward to it every year above any other thing you would release.\r\n\r\nIt made the game so fun! Like playing in the snow with friends! And I feel that innate &quot;fun&quot; is sadly something that is lacking at the moment in League of Legends.\r\n\r\nAnd seriously, last year&#039;s Snowdown event was a cop-out. Just a game mode on Howling Abyss (which is already snowy anyway)?!\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s been a couple of years since the last time Snowdown was actually decent. That means there are plenty of players who never got experience the joy of the snowy rift.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a 3D artist myself so I know how much work there is in creating a whole reskin for a map. To make it something of the same quality of what you guys are releasing now is a lot of work.\r\nBut it&#039;s not that much for a company as big as Riot. I mean you did a whole reskin of the Howling Abyss for the Gangplank event! That was cool!\r\n\r\nSurely a snowy rift for the holidays isn&#039;t too much to ask.","replies":[{"poster":"meme l0rd","date":"2015-12-01T13:16:56.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"snowdown? i want a swagdown!","replies":[]}]}
