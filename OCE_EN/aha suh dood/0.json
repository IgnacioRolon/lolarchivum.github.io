Why should I have to wait 10 mins in queue to get a sook who trolls, because one stupid team mate couldn&#039;t keep his mouth shut only to lose lp and a 20 minute game wasted. Why? Need report buttons next to names even in champ select or something and before anyone says &quot;just dodge it&quot; Aw yeah man, I&#039;ll dodge in my promos cause everyone else is too arrogant to do it.\r\nI /ignore all as soon as I get into game, only to find that top is sooking, afk and mid is ad sona cause he didn&#039;t like our top. \r\nPlaying in oce is literally making me lose the remaining brain cells I have left, pls help me riot","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-17T06:01:30.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man\n\nI think you're trying to fix your problems with solo queue in the wrong way. Sometimes solo queue can get rough, but there's always a way forward.\n\n+  **\"/ignore all\"**\nI really wouldn't recommend doing this at all, maybe only when you're feeling extremely tilted and just need a break. But if you're trying to win games, this is not a good option.\n\n Muting players doesn't fix anything. They are still in the game, and if arguments arise, they'll get angry or tilted, which might end up loosing the game for you. \n\n The best way to stop a _\"sook\"_ top laner is to prevent them from becoming one. If anything goes wrong or there are any arguments, you should try and disarm the situation ASAP. Get the focus away from blaming players, and back onto the game.\n\n _\"just farm top, lower half the map can comeback ez\"_\n_\"concentrate on the game guys, it's really winnable atm\"_\n_\"nah our top isn't noob, it's just darius op, we can focus him down though\"_\n_\"don't afk guys, it's not worth the ban, i think this game is almost over anyway\"_\n\n Also be sure to encourage and reward players when they do something good, a simple _\"gj\"_ or _\"nice\"_ can go a long way. Sometimes all the way to nexus ;)\n\n+ If someone is trolling in champion select, you can send in a support ticket with proof [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Remember though, tactical disagreements are not trolling. Only report them for threatening to feed or harassing other players.\n\n You should respect and work around other players tactical choices to reach an agreement. You might find that the **Urgot **jungle is actually a challenger smurf.\n\n+ See if you can explain to other players in chat, that they'll loose less LP if they dodge now. **5** LP loss rather than **20** LP.\n If not, then take your chances with the game, and hope for the best. Anything could happen.\n\n Also remember we now have **promo helper**, which helps players who deserve to pass promos, pass more easily. 1 loss isn't all bad, you can easily win 2 in a row, it happens all the time!\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Aha suh dood","date":"2016-03-17T17:45:52.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a good tip man, thanks for the comment. I genuinely don't get involved otherwise it just makes me tilt harder hence why I ignore all. I usually play adc, so I'll give the supp a chance but once they say something bad I genuinely can't be bothered dealing with them so I mute them lmao. I just find it easier, cause I myself do get salty at times and muting people is better than abusing them I guess\n\nVery good points you've got there though, appreciate it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Swordum","date":"2016-03-17T21:20:40.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE server is Toxic, just deal with that","replies":[]}]}
