People raging in champion select before the game even begins in 3 out of 4 games, afkers in 2 games and everyone blaming everyone for everything. I've never seen anything like it, it seems to me that people try to win more in normal blind pick than they do in ranked games which is mind boggling to me. Obviously I got demoted to Silver 3 and I felt super frustrated at this point and in the final game I flipped and became that super obnoxious person who started blaming everyone after the top lane Riven left for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nI feel super let down and quite depressed about this change of events and I feel like ranked is a place I never want to go ever again. I thought Bronze was meant to be the place everyone raged and afked and did all the obnoxious stuff, but turns out Silver is just as bad when people don't get their own way.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how I can avoid these scenarios when I play ranked? Is there times that are better to queue with a less likely chance of getting these kind of people on my team?\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry about the whiny post, but I felt like I needed to get this off my chest and get some other peoples point of view and suggestions.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-17T10:33:20.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play serious, play safe, make good choices.\n\nYou're on your way to Diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-02-17T09:47:35.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play AP Darius mid, if you need any helpful tips on it add me in game.
