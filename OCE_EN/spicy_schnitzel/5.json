The amount of points is just to unforgivable in those circumstances especially with an afk player who has rage quit or something","replies":[{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-06-19T04:44:34.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is more likely statistically that the other team has an afk than your team so it will even out over time even favour you.....","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Schnitzel","date":"2016-06-19T06:20:28.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again you still lose too much lp regardless.
