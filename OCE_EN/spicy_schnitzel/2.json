I played 10 ranked games so I could be put in a division. I won 5 out of 10 and got put in bronze one. I  remember I won the exact same amount of times in season 4 and I got put into silver 3. I&#039;m playing with people who are just a bit under skilled than I am and I always seem to be on the losing team most of the time. I do well most of the time in my lane but the other 2 lanes tend to always not do so good which is fine but it happens nearly every game to me, I get matched with people who aren&#039;t the same skill level as I am. its near Impossible to get back to silver 4 because of this season 5 and everything it reset. its just straight up annoying. I&#039;m probably just another guy with a common complaint but I cant help but feel neglected","replies":[{"poster":"Kimochi Senpai","date":"2015-09-16T23:17:43.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They made some changes to this system I believe, making it more difficult to get into a higher division/rank.
