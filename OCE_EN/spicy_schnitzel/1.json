I'm also a support main if that changes the perspective.\n___\n1- Positioning and timing is huge on Yuumi because she's so squishy, and because you aren't in total control of your positioning. Only a bad Yuumi is not using her passive, and only a bad Yuumi is staying in their ADC when skills are on CD and halving the lane's effective health. Given Yuumi will basically never have flash or boots and is extremely squishy, knowing when and where to pop out is very important.\n\nIf a Yuumi isn't popping out, that's a good thing for you. Abuse the ADC, punish it hard, cause her heal is too long a CD to keep up.\n___\n2- I don't know whether this applies to you, but the mistake I see bot/supp make the most vsing Yuumi is trying to dodge behind the minion wave. You want to dodge *into* it. If she fires it up, move below the wave, and don't just stand on the edge for her to turn it around, sit in it so it hits a minion.\n\nHer Q is a long CD early. If she's popping out when it's on CD, punish her, if she's not, punish the ADC. Q is all she has to hurt you with, so punish when it's on CD while you don't have to worry about it.\n___\n3- It is big, but it ticks down while she's in someone. If you see her pop in then pop out straight away, punish hard. She's stupid vulnerable in that scenario. When she first attaches, punish the ADC, she'll either pop out to help putting herself in big danger, or you'll get free harass on the ADC while all she has is a Q and her long CD heals.\n___\n4- The ult does basically no damage. In no way should you be scared of the damage from the ult. It's also not a stun, it's only a snare. You can still attack, you can still use abilities, and you have more than 2 seconds to get out of it before the snare will even hit you. It's far from the strongest support ult in the game. It's not hard CC like Nami's, it's way slower and deals less damage than Sona's. It's on par for peel with Janna's but isn't also a heal etc.\n\nEssentially, you handle her ult in much the same way you do any other control mage's.\n___\n5- The alternative is her either not being able to attach to those champs, or to ruin them by making them visible. You should be playing around the invis to begin with, so while it is an extra consideration, it's shouldn't be that much of a gamechanger.\n___\nYuumi is a generalist. That means she can do a bit of everything, but she'll never be the best at any one thing. Use what you know from versing other mage/enchanter supports against her. Break it down. How do you handle sustain lanes like Nami/Soraka? How do you handle mitigation/empower lanes like Janna/Lulu? How do you handle poke lanes like Sona/Zyra?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-06-09T15:18:49.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> does not need to worry about their positioning becuase she attaches herself to the adc's during laning phase and is completely safe from harm.\n\n1. Yuumi shouldn't really be sitting in her ADC all the time in laning phase.  Her W is one of the best dodges in the game, she should be sitting out there in the open being another target drawing the attention away from the ADC, and when she draws the attention of skill shots, she should W into the ADC to avoid them, both wasting enemy abilities, and setting her own lane up for the offensive.\n\n2. If she is in the ADC, SHE is safe from harm, but the ADC just became the only target in the lane.  So they are now taking double the flak, and they are a lot more valuable than Yuumi.  So by sitting in her ADC at inappropriate times, she actually weakens her lane instead of strengthening it.  She has nice heals, but it doesn't make up for being constantly poked.\n\n> second issue. during early stages of laning phase where nobody has boots, her q that follows the cursor is extremely hard to dodge, because we dont have boots and it does a surprising amount of damage\n\nHer Q is strong but its also her only damaging ability _(aside from an ult)_.  And it doesn't follow the cursor exactly, it has an arc, quick sharp movements make it hard to land.  Also it can't pass through minions, and its turning circle makes it difficult to weave through too many minions.  So it's far from having counterplay.\n\n> her ultimate cant be stopped or interrupted, damage output seems a bit high as well as a stun on 3rd hit seems busted.\n\nIt doesn't stun, it snares. It's not even a particularly long snare either.  Enemies hit by multiple waves take 50% reduced damage from waves after the first. So except the first wave, you're only taking 50 + 10%AP damage from each wave. So even if she has 1000 AP _(which is unlikely)_ you're still only taking 150 damage each wave. So unless you're standing in it for all 7 waves _(which I wouldn't advise)_ you're not taking a lot of damage.\n\nI cant speak about interrupting her ult.  In truth I've never properly tried, there's usually a bigger threat that needs more immediate action. _(like the Tryndamere she's sitting in while casting it)_. I would imagine a silence would stop it though, that is the usual interaction silences have with channeled abilities, _(although I haven't tested this)_.\n\n> this is me just being picky. when she attaches herself to twitch and hes goes invisible, she too also goes invisible!! absolute nightmare to deal with when they both ult\n\nYes this is strong, but no stronger than Malphite/Yas or other strong synergies.  Champion combos are an important part of picking strategy.  If you see the enemy pick Twitch, then your team should secure Yuumi to stop them from abusing the synergy. It'd be a boring game if none of the champs complimented eachother's abilities. _(also twitch hardly needs Yuumi anyway when he appears right behind you and shreds you)_.\n\nAlso consider the reverse interaction.  Yuumi goes inside twitch and when he goes invisible, the enemy still see Yuumi floating around giving away Twitch's position.  Which of course completely nullifies the entire premise of that champion.\n\nSo the options are: Make them a strong pair, or make them a complete liability to eachother, and be a complete waste to pick them together.\n\nAlso remember that Yuumi is near useless if she's alone, so her kit cant be that broken if she cant even hold her own against an angry Janna or Nami.\n\nMy only major issue with Yuumi so far, is that in a big team fight with lasers, explosions and death rays shooting off all over the place.  It's actually very hard to see where she is.  I've seen so many people fighting in a \"1v1\" _(myself included)_ who didn't even realise it wasn't a 1v1, because they just couldn't see Yuumi sitting inside them.  But thats just a visual clarity thing, not so much a balance issue.\n_________________________\n\nSo in my opinion, I don't think Yuumi is a balance issue, she's a neat champ with a very unique play style who is the first support in a long time to actually be a designated support, and not some kind of bruiser/mage/assassin hybrid excuse.\n\nThis is of course my opinion too though, not hard fact.","replies":[]}]}
