Remakes don&#039;t occur if the player has moved once and then just disconnects again. Its already hard to enough to climb in ranked and if there is 1 or 2 afk&#039;s you still lose like 18-20 lp. I mean seriously?? they need to sense an afk player and adjust how much lp we lose... remakes was a good idea but its not enough. If they move a tiny bit at start of the game remakes are out of the question, its only available if they don&#039;t connect at all at the start. I&#039;m honestly keen to hear what you guys reckon about this. I cant emphasise enough that this is only MY opinion","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-15T10:23:45.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Okay, so if my friend is boosting me on an account he doesn't really care for, we're going to lose he feels so he afks & i lose less LP. Is this balanced? \n\nThe amount of LP you lose is based on your MMR, get a higher MMR and you won't lose as much... \nBasically git gud.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Schnitzel","date":"2017-09-16T01:30:33.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well sounds to me in a sense that you are at a disadvantage for having one less player so its harder for you guys.  you know if your winning a game and 2 of your teammates are flaming each other and 1 afk's ..why do the rest of u have to suffer and lose so much lp. I don't know brother boy, just not does not sound fair to me. you should get some sort of compensation if you are down a player","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-10-02T22:50:44.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, no. It would get exploited to boost bad players. The chances of you getting an afk is the same as the enemy getting one.

Riot would have already implemented this had it not been for one imminent problem which could potentially ruin ranked if this were to be implemented.\n\nThe problem: Let's say Riot implement this. Yay! No more losing LP because of those filthy AFKers! But then some very sly and devious players discover a loophole in the ranked system. Every time a team faces an unpreventable loss, one player simply afk's and the rest of the team lose less LP. People would abuse this loophole like there is no tomorrow!\n\nAll we can do to fight AFK-ism is report any AFKers and simply not do it ourselves. A mindset which has greatly helped me in ranked this season is that 'the enemy team is just as likely to get the AFKers, toxic players and intentional feeders on their team as you are likely to get them on your team'. \n\nBest of luck in your climb!","replies":[{"poster":"Spicy Schnitzel","date":"2017-09-18T11:04:24.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers man, I thanks for your feedback. you did make some interesting points about people abusing this system\n\nmuch appreciated","replies":[]}]}]}
