He also would have a black hole in his mouth. His extra limbs coming out of his back will look like snakes with no eyes and his hands and arms would look like the arms and hands you see from dark star threshes ultimate. and his legs will be the same as well as his body. (you can change what the body and legs and feet look like i couldn&#039;t think of a thing to replace them.)\r\nHis tail would be really celestial like, like aurelion sols lower body except much more darker.\r\n\r\nAbility appearance\r\n\r\nQ: His Q is the spikes that come out of the ground right? So instead of spikes he roars and parts of the earth beneath the place you targeted goes up to space and stuff. (the earth will regenerate to its normal form.)\r\n\r\nW:is the basic attack one right? So instead of spikes there is dark air going in a cone.\r\n\r\nE: is the roar i think. His roar will not be a roar instead he will open his mouth and inhales. the black hole inside his mouth will be visible when he uses this ability.  But you cant make a ability that nobody sees right? So when cho&#039;gath inhales bits of earth go flying into his mouth, you would also be able to see the dark wind back in  ability W.\r\n\r\nR: So Cho&#039;Gath Eats the target, But instead of blood (because the black hole would suck the blood in) theres the dark wind, Again.","replies":[]}
