While I endeavor to improve and understand the need for\r\nautofill I believe giving people the option to clear the autofill could lead to better results. Or even perhaps a \r\ncounter to let us know when it might activate. I realize there are times when there is no need for a player to fill\r\nand so can go on for several matches in a row before it activates, but I would like to see a way that could prevent\r\nunprepared players.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-21T07:28:55.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to play all 5 roles, it's kinda simple really, not knowing how to at least not feed on all 5 roles isn't good enough.\n\nAnd not enough champions is only really an excuse for ADC, and even then, you can at least have something like Ashe on an account and your cleared for that.","replies":[]}]}
