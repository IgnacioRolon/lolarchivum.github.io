Later, I would use oce.op.gg to find that they have no ranked games that month. \r\n\r\nSo if there is no activity requirement, Riot Games please make one. REPEAT: I DO NOT WANT LP decay to affect gold. I just want there to be some activity requirement (just like they did with the 10 year anniversary mystery gift they gave everyone. Requirement was to have played within the last 60 days.) \r\nsource: http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/thank-you\r\n\r\nI think It&#039;s counter-intuitive making the exclusive ranked skin an easy let&#039;s gold 5 0lp and just sit there and hibernate till next year. Even hearthstone with their ranked rewards requires you to be active to gain the ranked exclusive card back (though i find it easy, but requires attention if you want each month&#039;s ranked rewards).","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-16T05:08:40.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no there isn't. you can get gold from placements then log off for the year and still get the rewards.\n\nI honestly think they should just bring decay back to gold. If its a tier at which you are rewarded, you should be able to prove you belong.\n\nHonestly think the 0 decay in gold just mad elo boosting a year round job, rather than every paying for it at the end of the season.","replies":[]}]}
