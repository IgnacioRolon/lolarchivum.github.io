(Dreams are free!!) and I am a support main. I recently got demoted for some minor toxicity which I am addressing, and am constantly trying to improve (Go me!!) I feel my in-game play, and comms is now pretty good (Specially cause I am transitioning to the use of pings only) and I normally come out with a respectable kda. I&#039;m not a real flashy player but I feel I have good game knowledge and can carry out my core role really well. (Clear wards, gain vision, manage lanes etc..)\n\nMy point is... as a support player I do not receive much honor, because I feel at this elo or level, a player has to carry, and have like 20 kills, or have &quot;flashy&quot; plays, in order to receive honor from your team. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s just because of where I am on the ladder, but thats the general impression I get from the last xxx games I have played. Therefore, I feel that support players are slightly disadvantage when dealing with the honor system, and as a result, doubt that ill ever be able to climb it. \n\nDo other support mains have this sort of issue? Do supports at higher levels receive honor? \n\nInterested to read some thoughts.\n\nVirilhitus (Gold 3, Support Main)\n&lt;3 XX\n\ntl;dr Do support main players, receive honor at the same rate as carry positions?","replies":[{"poster":"Canc","date":"2017-07-31T04:16:00.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"the only time i received more than 1 honour as support was I ditched the ADC and went to other lanes to made more presentence in game,.... so people actually can remember my existence and  honour me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-07-31T18:03:28.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you don't say anything, then yeah, in a silent team people are most likely going to be honouring whoever carried the game. i don't think it's an issue though, because it's a lot easier to be consistently nice than it is to be consistently carrying games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-31T04:31:35.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a support main, I tend to play only Normals I've not completed provisionals this season, but I got to Honor level 3 last week. I've found it to be the easiest position to get honor as carrying games and getting fed is quite the unreliable prospect, but taking care of your marksman and saving some lives is something that can happen nearly every game. If they are satisfied with how you supported you're likely to get an honor from your ADC, or others.\n\nI think the support role above all others has the most opportunity to show honor in their actual plays, real team-oriented stuff where you're following other people's lead instead of playing for yourself; leaving the kill for others, dying so others can escape a fight, and so on.","replies":[]}]}
