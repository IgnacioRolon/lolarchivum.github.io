For example, you could get an ARAM skin boost from the hextech box. No need to upgrade, just add a button in ARAM to choose whether you want to activate it if you have a shard of it. If you can give 3250rp skins, I think a 100rp skin boost wouldn&#039;t cause too much harm if you were to add it into the lottery.\r\n\r\nany other ideas like this would be pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-10-06T19:16:25.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a really good idea, especially considering you can already get temporary rewards such as renting skins for a week. Would it just be for ARAM (where the skin boost option exists) or would it be a generic token that could be used for other queue types? Not everyone plays ARAM, but I suppose you could reroll it just like any other reward.","replies":[]}]}
