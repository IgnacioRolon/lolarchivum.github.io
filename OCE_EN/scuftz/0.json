So here is a solution I thought of:\r\n\r\n(I don&#039;t know if this is already in place) I was thinking how about for a new beginner, at every 5th level they get to (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) they could ~2000IP, this will help em get some of the 4800/6300IP champs they want.\r\n\r\nPossibly for ranked players, if promote themselves to the next division they could get 500IP as a small reward. This can&#039;t be repeatable so you can&#039;t demote yourself intentionally then climb back up.\r\n\r\nAnd for normals just increase the amount of IP earned by +50 or something","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-08-31T20:55:07.099+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want the double IP weekends and themed events to come back ♥\n_furiously hints at Rito_","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-31T23:19:46.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=oUhfHQE7,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-08-31T20:55:07.099+0000)\n>\n> I want the double IP weekends and themed events to come back ♥\n> _furiously hints at Rito_\n\nGo get em :^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-09-01T03:23:11.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is the reason why I don't want to directly purchase champions anymore (maybe I would directly purchase champions that are cheap IP, ones that are below 2000 IP).\nPlus, once you purchase a new champion, you will have to master them as well, and I find this kind of bored.\nThe best way to get champions quickly (with only IP) is to purchase Hextech champion shards, and then you get a random champion (one champion shard costs 1700 IP).\nOnce you purchase 3 champion shards, open it (you will obtain some essences once you opened a shard), and you can do one of the two things below.\n\n1. Disenchant two champion shards to turn them into essences, and upgrade the remaining champion shard to champion permanent.\nYou will get extra essences to use some time in the future, once you get enough you may be able to get two champions.\n\n2. Re-roll the champion (select a champion and click reroll, a picture will appear on the right side, click on the other two champions and click reroll, and a permanent champion will be unlocked.\n\nI encourage you to keep the remaining shards after you reroll your champions (this way, you only have to purchase one champion shard to reroll again, unless the champions that remains are the ones you don't really want), also note that rerolling may not cost you any essences.\n3 champion shards (altogether) costs less than the most expensive champion (in IP), but costs more than the second most expensive champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-08-31T20:51:04.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it would be great to get IP bonuses on significant levels ^_^ Maybe not for ranks, as Sloth mentioned you can already buy IP boosts, but it would provide a nice incentive for levelling players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-31T11:19:08.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or, you could spend 10 bucks on some rp if you can't grind enough ip.\nI for one, have no issues with the amount of ip given.\nAnd now, with hextech crafting and chromas, there's more than ever available for free.\n\n\"You want it all but you can't have it\"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG_k5CSYKhg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-31T07:43:45.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This takes away the requirement for an IP boost though.
