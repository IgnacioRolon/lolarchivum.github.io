So like i said it looks great but where the hell is our previous honour?? oh right &#039;Gone to&#039; that&#039;s all you have for us? I have played for quite a few years and have amassed a ton of honour. More then most people who have played for the same or even longer time than i have. Now its gone. no record of it not even a little boost in the new system not an icon for different amounts of honour people obtained in the old system. nothing. So thanks for scrapping years of being a non toxic player much appreciated think i might turn over a new leaf and be toxic now since apparently it doesn&#039;t matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-06-14T02:07:06.334+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad you are enjoying the new honour system =D\n\nHope this helps\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/f8cb16b49600d23ecf83ebb1a2d5c173.png\n\n\"FWIW we're planning a proper funeral for Honor 1.0 that will have some small goodies involved.
