It'll take us a few patches to re-integrate spectate (for your friends and custom games) and the ability to join publicly hosted games using custom games. We're currently not planning to bring over the item set creator feature from the legacy client. Basically only an incredibly tiny percentage of players ever used the feature, and we've heard from many players that y'all don't care whether we bring item sets over so long as we continue to support 3rd party item set customisation tools like Championify—and we will!\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}
