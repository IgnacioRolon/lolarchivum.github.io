Enter stage left leagues ranked matching making system. After initial pick and bans we have an amumu jungle that decided exhaust rather then smite was a good idea. Upon load in, our pantheon top disconnects immediately, followed by our amumu jungle (who remember has exhaust) and our mid le blanc to say fuck this i&#039;m out and go afk in the base. Leaving bard and myself to 2 v 5 for the torturous 20 mins before we were able to surrender. This le blanc probably wont get banned because they came back every five minutes to buy items but remained in base (to avoid leaverbuster). But seriously, in a team game when your opposition has a 250% personnel advantage after 10 seconds why the hell can&#039;t we quit. I lost 21 LP simply because Riot is so dam shortsighted it took them 6 years to come up with a system that should have been obvious from the outset of ranked play. \r\n\r\nSorry for the rant but I have never posted on the forums before and can handle the odd 4 v 5. But 2 v 5, sort your shit out please Riot.","replies":[]}
