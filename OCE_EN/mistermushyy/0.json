While that in itself might work for most champions, Talon is an assassin, and opening even a second of extra opportunity could in fact be enough to get him CC'd and killed within moments before even being able to do anything. In fact it's even scarier when you consider that assassins like {{champion:238}}  and {{champion:107}} exist who can still kill someone without any real counterplay. Sure, you can react to a Zed ulting on top of you but most of the time there's very little you can do to stop him before he escapes and you better have lightning reactions of your entire team being able to save you from a rengar at any stage of the game. \n\nOn top of that the vibe i've always gotten from talon is this go all in, no escape style gameplay because it added a sort of strategic thought process in order to survive a fight because your rake isn't enough to save you if you fail your assassination attempt and your ult is probably already on cooldown. In fact Talon is probably the one assassin who has the most risk when going in.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
