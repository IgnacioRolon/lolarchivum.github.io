No launcher appears or anything, just nothing. I tried searching for answers that might fix it but so far I have not been able to find a fix this problem, so I decided to try the uninstalling and reinstalling thing.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t say it&#039;s fixed because it&#039;s been a while. 13 seconds remaining has always been 13 seconds remaining 20 minutes ago. I just want to know what the heck is taking it so long, I only wanted to play some LoL.
