Unfortunately from threads i have read,\r\nRiot isn&#039;t allowing anyone to receive a mystery skin before this time, despite the fact that the official website for LoL OCE purely says that the event begins on the 23/12. This implies that it should be available at 00:00. unfortunately not...that si the time for NA. Wanted to get this out so that people stopped getting ripped off by Rito.","replies":[{"poster":"ColinZ","date":"2015-12-23T08:52:18.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg I purchased Galaxy Rumble, then got Spirit Guard Udyr  Pulsefire Ezreal and the new gragas skin :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-12-23T08:04:07.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It starts at 19:00 AEDT on December 23.
