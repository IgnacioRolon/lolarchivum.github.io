A few seconds later it said that I was unable to connect and the my firewall was blocking it. I tried reinstalling the client, disabling UAC, disabling firewall, allowing league of legends in firewall but none of the methods have worked.\n\nEDIT: Ok, I fixed it. Open up league of legends launcher. Click the question mark in the upper right corner and press fix. This worked for me atleast.

Playing ranked, game suddenly froze up, no attempting to reconnect etc. Quit, relogged and tried to reconnect to the game, but just keep getting a black screen and the \"unable to connect\" firewall error message.
