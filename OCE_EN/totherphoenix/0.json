{"poster":"Totherphoenix","date":"2015-05-11T05:27:19.810+0000","title":"Request: Don't let us get put into a match with people on our block list","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel like every second or third game I have to block someone due to their disgusting behaviour and/or attitude. I had my last post removed due to it potentially causing a &quot;witch hunt&quot; (which, in retrospect, is a reasonable premise upon which to remove it) for calling out the most disgusting player I have ever come across. I write this post now because it seems as though I have changed my attitude when it comes to this game. To explain, I&#039;ll go back in time 3 months where I was duo queue with my friend doing our promos for the season. We got Bronze 1 because of the usual (every second or third game we had some d**chebag either afk, feed, or just ignore our team). After 4 weeks of trying to get out of bronze, we began to notice a pattern - 2 out of every 5 games of ours had at least 1 player who was detrimental to our team&#039;s loss, be it either due to lack of skill (how do some people reach summoner level 30?) or just all out trolling (I swear draven jungle is a thing guys, smite&#039;s such a sh*tty summoner anyway). I gave up. After 4 weeks of being stuck at Bronze 1 (dropped from silver last season), I quit and went back to Dota. This was where I began to realise that it isn&#039;t just the League of Legends community that&#039;s disgusting, rather, it is the Australian gaming community as a whole, and I came to the realisation that if I didn&#039;t begin to change, I&#039;d become toxic. So instead of raging at these *ssholes who seem to go out of their way to ruin my day, I just mute them and kindly ask the enemy team to report them &quot;lest they be matched with them in a game in the near future&quot; (that line works about 50% of the time). I of course now block every toxic player I come across (as should any gamer who isn&#039;t toxic themselves), but after my last encounter in which a Renekton was flaming our first time Lee Sin for not camping his lane, gave up and decided to feed every other lane, and then afk walk to the enemy base for the rest of the game, who I blocked before searching for another match only to find him on our team again in the champion select screen, this time locking in Xin Zhao with smite after someone else called jungle. I write this post to request that Riot fixes the matchmaking system so that we don&#039;t have to get matched with people on our block list. Now I know people could potentially take advantage of this system and just veto bad players, but the fact that someone would have to do something like that to not get matched with people of less skill shows how broken the matchmaking system is in the first place, doesn&#039;t it? Obviously a system like this would need to be thoroughly tested before it is implemented in the Summoners&#039; Rift, but I think I speak for a lot of other players when I say that I am tired of being matched with the same Trolls and downright toxic people who make the game a bad experience for me. In a perfect world, toxic players would be reported by everyone else in the game, but this isn&#039;t a perfect world, and when a player causes the enemy team to win, that team is not very likely to report him/her. I play video games to have fun, and I play ranked video games to feel good about myself, but when people go out of their way to screw me over in a game, I&#039;m gonna stop playing that game. So please Riot, hear me out: stop allowing people to get matched with players on their block list. Stop making me hate myself every time I play League of Legends... \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTotherphoenix\r\nAustralian Bronze Division Representative","replies":[{"poster":"Bravo Bird","date":"2015-05-11T05:42:36.263+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think its gonna work.

It should be enough that you won't see any of their messages and can just play your best to beat them minus the trash talk or poor behaviour.\n\nAt any rate, it's about fixing the system so that these players are brought back into line properly with the appropriate disciplinary action being taken, rather than the previously ineffective tribunal. That seems to be Riot's current aim: to reduce the number of toxic players, and to reward positive behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Totherphoenix","date":"2015-05-13T00:01:23.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, my main concern is that in order to avoid someone who makes the game a poor experience for everyone else, I have to avoid the game for minimum 10 minutes (to make sure he/she is in another match).

It's no easy problem, and there posts every day complaining about matchmaking or what have you. Riot has at least dumped the whole tribunal idea and is looking into rewarding positive behaviour - even when they gave a free skin to people who had not been banned or otherwise I found it to be pretty damn awesome. I abhor toxic behaviour and usually just pop a mute - it's good to have incentives to play in a friendly and cooperative manner.\n\nHaha, I've only recently actually started posting here myself, just got curious one day. :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LooLoom","date":"2015-05-11T06:00:02.001+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBF some people are still learning, and skill levels will not necessarily be the same, sometimes people have off days. I main support, and I am not the  greatest, I made it to bronze 2, and I am pretty stoked with that, but apparently no matter how considerate, how much I try and work with the team, someone invariably starts bitching about someone, whether it be me, or someone else on the team.\n\nI just want to play League. It is a fantastic game, but the community is so damn bad. With the most negative, horrible attitudes. \n\nMy first game today, started with everyone fighting in lobby. I should have dodged. The fighting continued throughout the whole match. I believe those three people spent more time typing than playing.\n\nMy second game today, started nicer. I had a nice adc who communicated what he was doing, played well, things were going great, then we lost Dragon to an enemy smite. A few people died and our top laner decided we were all shit, and didn't want to play with us anymore. He farmed top lane solo, died repeatedly. Called us all bad, fed the enemy team, intentionally, tried to solo baron because he didn't care anymore, since we were all so bad, he then went on to ask the enemy team for honours, because he helped them, and some of them agreed. \n\nSo much sigh.\n\nI should have taken your advice totherphoenix and blocked him.\n\nMy point is, people are going to be varying skill levels, don't rage just because someone is not quite as good, misses a skill shot, or dies due to a single misplay, they will get better with practice. Bad behaviour, negative attitudes and rudeness are much worse in my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Totherphoenix","date":"2015-05-11T06:30:15.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it could be exploited for that, and perhaps I didn't iterate enough in my post that this system should be for trolls, not bad players.

This means players who are chat restricted will only be able to interact with their teams through gameplay, pings, and very limited messaging opportunities.\n> \n> **How does the system work?**\n> \n> Chat restrictions take multiple reports over a series of games into account. Players with normal behaviour will never be affected, and there are a number of protections in place that sort out false reports, premade abuse, and other potential issues.\n> \n> If a player is continuously displaying negative behaviour they will then receive chat restrictions on that account.\n> \n> You can find more information about Chat Restrictions in the knowledge base article: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752984-Restricted-Chat-Mode\n\nAnd\n\n> Intentional Feeder Detection\n> \n> What about intentional feeders?\n> \n> There is a separate system that focuses purely on feeders.
