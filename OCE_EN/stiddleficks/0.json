(wasn't playing srsly just having fun) \r\nMy question is will my MMR being tanked down in norms effect my MMR when I play ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-12T01:15:08.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR is calculated based off of the difference of MMR your opponents have. If you were versing opponents with MMR of around 1,200 and you *lose* to them, your MMR will very easily go down to their levels.\n\nIt's just chance and coincidence, really.","replies":[]}]}
