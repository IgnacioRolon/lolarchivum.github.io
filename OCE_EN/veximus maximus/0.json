I think all champions should have to do this _(which is why I think Cho'Gath is spoon-fed a cop out!)_\n\nThat way a champion requires a little more skill from the player. \nThat being said, it is quite hard to judge how much damage you are doing, as it is very hard to see just how many spears you have in someone, unlike Cho/Darius who have a set amount of damage you can get used to.\n\nPersonally I think the best thing they can do for Kalista is to make her dashes unable to be slowed. _(why the hell can they be slowed anyway?)_.\nAlready she is worse at kiting than many other champs like Lucian/Ezreal etc. _(and her whole niche is that shes supposed to be **THE** Kiting champion.)_\n\nIt's already hard to dodge things with them, seeming the windup and throw all happens standing still, and THEN she jumps. \nEven without being slowed, she actually gets chased down so easily by melee fighters, and if you cant kite them, actually what use is 'the Kiting champion'?\n\nAs for the othsworn, I agree that there needs to be a bigger connection between them! _(something more visible)_. But I think a recall might take away from the specialness of Zayah/Rakan, I'm not sure.","replies":[{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-07T21:59:42.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with bork her kiting is already bs though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-29T12:51:50.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean an indicator which tells you when you can kill the target?\nDarius's ult doesn't have that, the only thing that pops up is an axe/hoop when you have 5 stacks on a target, you have to actually predict and know when your ult can kill. Wish Riot added that feature though, I know cho gath and zed get those kind of indicators on their ults which makes it so much easier to play them.","replies":[]}]}
