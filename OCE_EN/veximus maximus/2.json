His w is on a 26-18 second cool down and lasts for 4 seconds. If you cant wait for Yasuo to block something less important such as Syndra W, then wait 4 seconds for it to be gone then don't play the game; Simple. And for anyone that claims Yasuo is broken, he is not. The fact that he needs specific stats to be useful (crit/attack speed) which can be easily countered by a Randuins Omen, ninja tabis and even some more armour if you want to completely cock block him makes him easily countered (or just ban him if you please).","replies":[]}]}
