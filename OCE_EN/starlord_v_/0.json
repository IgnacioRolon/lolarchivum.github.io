It has been a challenging issue across all regions with how to actually handle it. Each behavior results in different situations for each game.\r\n\r\nLets look at the most common issues that happen day to day:\r\n\r\nVerbal Abuse - Comments towards another player that may not be constructive or appropriate\r\nLeavers and AFK&#039;s - Players that leave the game when losing, don&#039;t join the game or sit in the fountain till game ends\r\nTrolls - People that just was to make other players mad and are usually so over the game they don&#039;t care anymore\r\nInsta-locks - People who lock in champions and go a lane even though the lane is taken ( resulting in the above ) \r\n\r\nTriggers of the above:\r\n\r\nFeeding - Players that get out played in lane and constantly get killed causing havoc\r\nRefusing to communicate - Players that focus on what they are doing and don&#039;t care about the team\r\nPlayers that want one role - Usually join q and are Mid or feed, they then lose lane and whoever wanted it has an above moment\r\n\r\nNow lets look at a game normal or ranked doesn&#039;t really matter. Game starts and nothing is really said, sometimes some barter goes on between both teams or just on your team alone. The game continues and either your team is winning in kills or heavily losing and kills and as soon as it reaches a score that is 0/5 someone says gg its over and its been about 8 minutes. It is then followed by Verbal abuse, Leavers and trolls. Sometimes people over come it and come back but usually a game like this ends at 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow look at yourself now and think to yourself. Do I get angry when my team is doing stupid things? 100% Yes. Everyone gets frustrated. Then you tell yourself you aren&#039;t toxic and probably rip on that player or abuse them somehow and start an argument. This hasn&#039;t changed and you do it for the next 100 games or so wondering why you can&#039;t climb the ranked ladder or win more games, you then blame artificial things like elo hell and think riot is trolling you. Cementing that mind set into the losing mindset, one loss and you&#039;re on tilt. \r\n\r\nLets take a different look at this. I have tested this and it works great. You can&#039;t tell me you see a lot of it, it happens like 1/20 games. As the game starts in the first minute say &quot;Goodluck everyone and have fun&quot; start the game with a positive reinforcement. \r\n\r\nThe other team might say the same or they might say stfu. Its okay, ignore it. You have done your part to influence a positive game for your team and your mindset. If your team gets a kill follow it up with &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;good work&quot; show appreciation for good play. This boosts morale of the team and when a team morale is high the performance of the team is boosted. If something bad happens, tell them its okay and follow it with constructive criticism &quot;its okay, maybe try this next time&quot; (like place a vision ward)\r\n\r\nDon&#039;t rip on your team. Boost it up and keep the team focused on victory. You will have players who ignore you, hate on you, verbally abuse the other players but as long as you focus on keeping a positive mindset and influence more positive games you will get more wins.\r\n\r\nThese are my thoughts on how we can change player behavior.\r\n\r\ndRiven","replies":[{"poster":"Me Summoner Name","date":"2015-07-19T14:31:54.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you stop bad supports pushing your lane by hitting minions, not warding and over extending. \nSometimes being positive will still not help bad players play better. \nYou can communicate as much as you want but if someone does not want to play that role then you being positive is not going to help them play better.\n\nThis is a game of skill, no matter how nice you are it still depends on your teammates skill in the game.\n\nBeing nice means nothing if your whole team are toxic.\n\nThe only way to fix the problem is a better system. The current feedback relies purely on players reporting. \n\nIn fact, I have been reported quite a few times for being nice by \na) a premade team\nb) a couple of trolls who ganged up against me \nc) the enemy team because I carried and they were being toxic to me in all chat\n\nAt the start of games I generally say \"Please ward, don't push your lanes and last hit minions. Spending 75 gold on a ward is better than giving 150 gold\"\nThis is not toxic but yet I have been told a few times to \"STFU noob\".\n\nThe attitude of the community needs to change as once we have a system that is showing to work, only then will we see toxic behaviour fade.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-19T15:35:59.934+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes kind words are what it take to become a teacher to someone","replies":[]},{"poster":"Starlord V ","date":"2015-07-20T02:52:52.940+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Your positive influence in your games will help the community as a whole.

Stop being a bitch and exaggerating that people negatively influence your games every second game. Some one thinks your a dickhead and wants to abuse u and you cant take it mute them like the pussy you are. Someone trolls in ranked? Maybe get good at the game so that one loss doesn't tilt you to the point where u become delusional and believe this 1 game that happened outta 50 is the reason you are still in silver 5.\n\nYou don't like it, tough luck. The simple answer is if you are good you will win more than you lose, When your winning your team isn't going to flame often. ANY competitive environment is going to have tensions, LoL just has the benefit of users being a name on a screen so they feel there is no shame in venting them because of the element of anonymity ","replies":[{"poster":"Starlord V ","date":"2015-07-20T02:55:33.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You understand that how you replied to the post is what I am talking about? and because of this it actually results in more losses then anything else.  People are trying to get better at the game and improve but can only do that in a positive matter. The community is somewhat just generally toxic like yourself. \n\nSome people play the game for fun to enjoy it and play with friends but when there are people like yourself that verbally abuse a conversation by being toxic it doesn't make the game enjoyable anymore. This is about the wide spectrum of change to benefit the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-07-20T07:03:01.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"What you're looking for is unrealistic rofl. POSITIVE COMMUNITY, no one cares about you or your dreams in this game. 99% want one thing which is victory. If you don't win then it is certain that you and others on your team could have done something better to win, hence criticism. What your looking for is some real life friends, a single player game, or a game where the most rewarding result is not victory but score. When you learn that criticism stems from a competitive environment, you may finally realize that this isn't the game for you. There is no changing the community when the goal of the game is to win. You don't get more IP or LP for your individual performance, its all about the end result and it doesn't matter how you get there as long as you achieve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Starlord V ","date":"2015-07-20T07:51:48.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It has been proven that toxic players lose more games then most players who aren't toxic?\n\nYes the result is you win or lose, but the experience of playing the game is what I am trying to talk about here in an efficient manner. The difference between criticism and someone being toxic, there is a huge difference.\n\nCriticism still needs to be given in a productive and positive matter where most people verbally abuse other players which isn't constructive. There issue isn't resolved and the player hasn't learned anything apart that another player is more then happy to verbally abuse, troll or threaten to leave the game because someone made a mistake.\n\nLeague of Legends has a competitive side which we all know is Ranked. So if you want to win and climb the ladder being a positive force for your team is huge. Not putting the team down, its why people lose.\n\nNormals is about trying new things and basically having fun. A lot of people just play normals because they want to have fun without any stress but even this environment is ruined by people that be toxic, ruining the experience for a lot of people to the point that some people will just leave or stop playing the game. \n\nWhere there is a will there is a way and positive reinforcement being pushed into the community will change it and move it into a better direction. Fortunately League of Legends has a more favorable community then other games like HON or Smite.","replies":[{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-07-20T19:33:51.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a bullshit stat btw, teams become toxic due to losing","replies":[{"poster":"Starlord V ","date":"2015-07-21T00:22:23.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teams lose most commonly because of the things listed above.
