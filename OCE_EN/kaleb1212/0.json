The feeder post the videos online on YouTube all in Chinese. He records and bots in the games with sometimes one video being about 10 hours long and even that is sped up so almost 15 hours straight of feeding. There has been threads of reddit on him, not that popular I think. The YouTube channel goes back to almost a year I think of 1000s of hours of passive inting up to 10,15 hours at a time. If you go to the YouTube channel bare minimum there a videos posted of 6hours being very short for this player of them passive, inting feeding on all servers non stop. He just sets up a bot, sets up a recorder and must do something else for that day.

One of the games that was in my chat log was me and an enemy team mate having a laugh together spamming emotes and having some general light hearted banter. Hardly anything remotely close to verbal abuse. Infact no one called anyone anything and it was all in good fun. Someone obviously got salty over it and reported me, probably because they lost. I reckon it's because I called the enemy team's jungler a noob in our own team chat the system picked that up as me being toxic. Who knows. It's just pathetic.\n\nAn automated system also cant pick up on human emotions and can easily takes things out of context.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-09T06:23:30.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the automated system is shithouse. Pure and simple. The problem is as mentioned earlier, how does an automated system differentiate between a bad player and someone doing it intentionally? Simple, it can't. The only thing that works ok atm is the chat ban and thats because it's easy for an automated system to pickup on keywords, phrases etc.\n\nI've been saying this for a long time now and Riot simply turn a blind eye to it. Feed all day long, ruin people's games but don't you DARE say anything half toxic to them otherwise you'll be the one receiving a chat ban. Pretty sad, but that's league for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-04-09T09:02:31.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You get punished harder and faster for chatting then feeding, passive inting. Ruining the game completely is punished less then something where someone can mute and have more control over. Read over what I've posted on why I got 2, 2 week bans a couple of months ago, and the rioter response in the support ticket. You can chat all game but as sons as someone finds it annoying and reported, punishment soon follows, however feeding passive inting non stop hours on end and nothing happens.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-04-03T02:12:05.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Firstly you should remove his name as you arent allowed to name and shame on here.
