Now thats OP. She have been reworked and is definitely not Op like she used to be a long time ago where she was a monster which terrorises all lanes. Her W use to give Armor too but all of that is fix in her rework and she is quite balance right now except that she still feels a little UP like seriously she actually needs a buff instead of a nerf. There are people who complained about her E's small AoE and also the weak 15% slow, people also complained about her slow ass Q skillshot which is really hard to land. OP ? i think not. Why don't you use 450 ip and buy her and then try her out and tell me again if she is OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-05-09T06:22:55.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think she's actually really weak, she needs more impact through something other than heals.","replies":[{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-05-11T11:51:41.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a {{champion:16}} main i can't agree more because she actually takes quite a bit of skill to play and she doesn't have a lot of damage even with a lot of AP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T07:24:58.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TY","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-05-11T06:31:27.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a {{champion:16}} main and i will tell you exactly why she is not OP.\n1) Her Q is easily the hardest skillshot to land in game\n2)She is very very very squishy\n3)Almost no damage skill at all\n4)Aoe Silence only have 15% slow and the root only comes in after like after 1.5 sec (seriously just walk out of it)\n5)W heal requires 10% hp to cast therefore cannot spam\n6)E and R have really long cooldown even with max CDR\n7)No proper self sustain (unless you can land the Q very well)\n8)one of the lowest if not the lowest health regen in game\n9)No damage and have a long cooldown CC\n10)Neither of her skill do a lot of damage unless you go full AP (still no damage actually)\n11)No escape \n12)Stun ? grab by thresh or crank ? almost 100% death rate\n13)Slow move speed \n14) Health at lvl 18 =1855 (better than sona but still meaningless)\n15) Her passive is useless unless your teammates is low on health and you need to be pointing exactly where your team is to get the speed boost (her only runaway skill)\n16)Her E have a slight delay before cast (kinda like a skillshot)\n17)if you have bad positioning you will be sure to die hard as Soraka\n18)Pretty much 4 v 5 because you can't do any damage.\n19)The best thing she can do is heal people\n20)Even build full offence the best thing she can do is poke and nothing else.\n21)Q cooldown is also quite long and is her only damage source (because your E deals peanut damage).\n22) A problem with all supports which is no money to buy items because need to buy wards or sightstone (support items Etc)\n23) She have very slow attack speed = very difficult to CS if you play her as mid lane (she is useless even if u go mid)\n\nAlso the Aoe slow + silence is only 1.5 seconds for all levels not 3 secs. \n ","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-11T11:35:04.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"karthus q is the hardest skillshot to land in the game but the rest i agress","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arcane Azmadi","date":"2015-05-09T14:35:52.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say unto thee, sirrah, thou art a cretin!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-09T06:59:24.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think i'm starting to see a pattern.\n\nStill, i'll indulge you.\nA support can shut you down, but not blow you up.
