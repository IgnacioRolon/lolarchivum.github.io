I think we've figured out what is causing it and I've reached out to someone to see if it can be resolved. Basically right now if you are logged into the boards when selecting a ticket type, but you aren't logged into the support site, then the Login button under the ticket type selector does not work.\n\nAs for bots, we've been dealing with them in various ways for years. Unfortunately since it is so easy to create LoL accounts they've just been a persistent problem that we've had to resolve on a banning only basis. Eventually, things like [mandatory email verification](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/mandatory-email-verification) and multi-factor authentication may reduce the ease of botting but as long as its profitable then botters will continue trying to find ways to bot.\n\nWe do have an automatic bot detection system that after some time will find and ban botted accounts, which we're always trying to keep up to date. But of course this means that bots will always impact some or many games before we can catch them.\nHowever, these days botters at least have to do a lot more than they use to in order to keep their bots hidden. It's essentially a constant battle: we develop new detection methods, they develop new ways to hide, and so the dance goes.\n\nI used to personally look for bot IP's on a daily basis and banned all associated accounts, eventually botters just started spreading the accounts across tons of different IPs so finding one IP often only catches a small amount of bots now. It's just not an efficient use of time anymore. Hence the move to automated detection systems which will continue to be updated.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-05-02T23:39:33.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No name and shame buddy","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-03T00:56:35.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, the \"name and shame\" policy was \"adjusted\" to exclude obvious bot accounts relatively recently.

There isn't a group of people who just go through match histories and accounts trying to find bot accounts in Co-Op vs AI or even Norms. The only way I can see them getting removed is by accumulating reports and submitting Support Tickets.","replies":[]}]}
