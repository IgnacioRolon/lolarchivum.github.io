BUT, you can customise it If you use a summoner icon from an ultimate skin.\n\nI'll set mine to an ultimate now, so if anyone is interested, you can look me up and see what it looks like!\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-06-18T09:28:26.384+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what both of you are saying. To add, what about using an icon that is not an ultimate skin would change the background. Example: Any of the project icons (Zed, Fiora, Leona and Yi) the background would be the splash for that champion skin (same would go for the Dark Star and Battlecast icons, sion so forth). Other icons like the Draven Draven icon can have the Draven Draven and friends art that was featured on the loading screen on your profile overview. The kindred icon for kindred, the blood moon kalista for blood moon kalista, the mecha icon for the mecha and friends splash, Chinese new year icon for the respected character if not loading screen art that it was used for or debonair for the debonairs, urf icon for the urf loading screen picture, bildgewater event, there is so many out there I can think of. \n\nI think it is an interesting thing to enable because it gives more customisable option for the users. Not everyone will have the same icon and background, some people will have rare icons, some people can support their favourite teams like Team Liquid, Dire Wolves, SKT1 as an icon, but can have the wallpaper art thing on their profile if they use that icon. \n\nTL;DR some icons that are released with a specific theme would show that theme as the profile background picture (e.g. team icons, event, champion icons) weather it be the picture from a loading screen from that event by using said icon, a specific champ/skinned champ icon to background picture. Giving users the ability to customise their profile to be different to others out there.
