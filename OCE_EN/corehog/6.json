I&#039;ve taken upon myself to create this (and possibly more) posts that list the known bugs that everyone has reported on the forums.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n**KNOWN BUGS**\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n- Connection to the champion select chat is delayed\n\n- Not all splash arts are displayed in champion select\n\n- Post-game IP sometimes does not display\n\n- In-game status remains after finishing a game\n\n- Chat messages are not displayed in chronological order\n\n- Client links are not working for some\n\n- Music continues to play when leaving a game lobby\n\n- Post Game chat does not always display\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIf any more bugs are reported, I&#039;ll edit this post and add them :)\n\n**_A few things I&#039;d like to make clear however:_**\n\n- I am in no way affiliated with Riot. I am not employed by them, nor do I monitor or administrate the forums. The only connection I have with Riot is playing LoL, and now Alpha testing this new client with you.\n\n- I am human, I will make mistakes. Let me know if I do, and I will endeavour to fix them.\n\n- I will need to scour these forums for the bugs that are reported in them. If I continue these &quot;bugtracker&quot; posts I will need time to find the reported bugs\n\n- I do have a life outside of League. If I don&#039;t respond within a reasonable amount of time, I&#039;m sorry.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nHAPPY ALPHA TESTING EVERYONE!! :D","replies":[]}
