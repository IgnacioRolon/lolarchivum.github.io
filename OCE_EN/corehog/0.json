Ich mag est. Maybe increase clay generation as Kaolin goes up in levels and decrease the cap on the empowered abilities.\n\n_Q_\nSo basically point and click damage that decreases armor. Personally, I think armor decrease is a boring benefit. Maybe the ability could have a few more mechanics to it? Dealing more damage the more armor they have or add some weak CC. But if they are a mage support, why do they have a melee point and click damage that breaks armor?\n\n_W_\nOh god the range. With infinite mana, this would be a pain in the ass poke. IMO, the super high longe range manaless poke is just crazy. Maybe make it a bit more mechanical than damage.\n\n_E_\nThis is a pretty weak considering they are a support mage. The only makeup for it is that it is 5 seconds, which is a really long time to be slowed.\n\n_R_\nIMO, this would never be used on anyone it's built for. Imagine Nasus getting this.","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2015-12-13T04:51:19.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for late reply, been out for a couple of days. But thankyou for input.\n\n\nGreat point about the Q, any suggestion as to ratios or damage based on armour/MR? I'm not good at numbers.\n\nWith the W, do you mean like a brief delay and a shorter range? Maybe a higher cost as well?\n\nI understand the E is weak, but it becomes stronger with full animated clay. Is 50% max slow to little? Again, I'm not so good at numbers.\n\nAny suggestions for an alternate R? \n\nThanks again for your input and quick response. Any other suggestions?","replies":[]}]}]}
