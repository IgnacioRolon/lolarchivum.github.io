I am really enjoying so far. \n\nThe champ select is beautiful and the friends list is clean and clear. I know this is very, very early Alpha, but I am a little disappointed that clubs can&#039;t be accessed. I&#039;m sure that will change soon :)\n\nThe chat box was a little strange to me at first, and some of it&#039;s functions still confuse me. I&#039;m unsure if I should call it a function, or a bug, because when I message people, it ends up randomly among older messages?\n\nhttps://imgur.com/5VuluPa\n\nThe &quot;yay&quot; is from yesterday (18/05/2016)\n\nAs for in game I notice almost no difference, except for a couple of random lag spikes which turned out to be people logging in and out.\n\nWhen creating a game, I don&#039;t like that it puts me into the Summoner&#039;s Rift selection instantly. Other than that, it really is a nice looking lobby screen.\n\nEdit: Just noticed that when I exit the \"create game\" lobby, the music does not stop. This is somewhat annoying, not because the music is bad, but because it doesn't fit the main screen.\n\nOn a final note, again disappointed, I can&#039;t visit my profile, set up runes and masteries, look at my latest list of games, etc. I&#039;m sure that&#039;s not far away though, so keep up the good work :D","replies":[{"poster":"Cardboard","date":"2016-05-19T23:19:45.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey and welcome to Alpha,\nMake sure you report the chat randomly appearing as a bug through the ingame bug button inside the alpha client. I have seen it too.\nAlso, profiles will be coming next week I believe, so be ready for that. Keep in mind they are sectioning parts of the client 'out of bounds' so that we aren't overwhelmed with things to test. This is all a user test, and by doing it this way Riot are able to stay on top of things. :)","replies":[]}]}
