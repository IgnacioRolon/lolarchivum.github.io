And that&#039;s fine, I&#039;m not, and I&#039;m sure others aren&#039;t, going to lynch you for not releasing an update on time because of complications.\r\n\r\nI also don&#039;t want to start a whole &quot;we should know everything that&#039;s going on at Riot HQ&quot;, but it would be pretty cool if we could go &quot;hey an update is coming soon, yay!&quot;\r\n\r\nEither way, love your work guys &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-05-31T06:54:28.168+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nGlad you are liking what you see!

Reminder! We'll roll out more fleshed-out Profile pages in the coming weeks, so until then, please continue to keep your testing focused on Summoner's Rift and ARAM. \n\nThanks again for joining us on the frontline!\"\"\n\nI would recommend you to check this site out in the future.
