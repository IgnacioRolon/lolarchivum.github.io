The best way to deny him stacks after the first 5-10 minutes is not by staying in lane and trying to zone or harass him. It's by taking tower early and pressuring the rest of the map. Either:\na) you take a bunch of towers/kills/dragons and get a massive gold lead for your team while he farms his q\nb) he tries to push top and get your tower, which means he doesnt get that many stacks\nc) he tp's/roams to help his team and doesnt get any farm or stacks\n\nhaving 400 stacks by 20 minutes isn't enough to carry the game if his team is getting crushed\n\nIf you're in bronze or something where the game will go on for 40+ minutes regardless, just play darius or something and kill him repeatedly (and his jungler if he comes) until his team starts flaming him for being useless.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-30T00:46:56.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's not going to work as well as you might think.\n\nThe roaming has to pay off or else Nasus will be getting free farm at top for nothing.\n\nI've seen many Nasus games were he rejects the pleas for help from his team and still keeps stacking and mid game he destroys everyone.\n\nIt's better to harass him with champions that can take his Q damage or kite him, Vayne/Quinn. You can also take Pantheon to negate his Q damage pretty much completely.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-30T07:24:23.594+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to play a lot of nasus. once it gets to the 10-15 minute mark, he will have a defensive item and will outsustain most poke and is going to free farm whether you're in lane or not. Continuing to devote resources to keep him down will only be moderately successful and will make it significantly more likely for your team to lose on the rest of map.\n\nAnd the champions you listed are all VERY risky. Vayne and quinn are both easy to gank and are going to get crushed if they get behind and pantheon is even MORE reliant on roaming after 6 since his ult is useless in lane and he will actually lose all ins unless he already got several kills (plus his shield is never going to block a q unless the nasus sucks, its easy to pop it with a normal auto first).\n\nIf you leave him in lane for 10 minutes and fail to get an advantage for your team, it's not because nasus is op, it's because you weren't able to take advantage of being 5v4 on the rest of the map and you probably deserve to lose that game. Nasus is just better than most at punishing people for wasting time and not taking advantage when they can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-28T08:21:55.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kJs,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=59iv6gQV,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-05-28T08:02:37.426+0000)\n>\n> You can't really beat him, assuming all he has are armor/MR/health items.
