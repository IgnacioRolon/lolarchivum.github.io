I play any role, in order from strongest to weakest: Top>Mid>Support>Jungle>ADC. I really enjoy playing tanks in the top lane, Sion is by far my favorite but I have a decent toplane champion pool. \n\nI'm currently Plat 4, peaked at Plat 1 (20 points i think) this season:\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Krauser%20San","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sweddie","date":"2015-09-06T07:06:32.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"helloo.
