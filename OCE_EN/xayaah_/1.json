Um recently i just been placed in a team with a vayne top lane and i played jg. When i play jg i try to help all lanes and be friendly but this vayne is just so annyoing. When she asks for a gank i give it to her but she feeds and kills herself. Then she blames me for standing there still and doing nothing and waiting to clean up but in truth  i was running to her lane but i wasnt fast enough. Then she just kept complaning and complaning and saying how bad i am but i was doing good. She fed the whole team and says that its all my falut even my teammates and the enemy team say that shes being stupid she keeps blaming me. I even tried to apologise( even though she was the one who needed to apolosgise) she said no. I hate these kind of people and anythging i say they keep complaing. Also when i die she just laughs. I need to deal with these people becasue they are the reason of my losses.

It really just that people have no map awareness and no ping when going in. That vayne is bad because 1) making sure your close enough and pushed back for a successful gank 2) he/she allowed themself to be tilted and therefore made bad calls. Just mute them and listen to music or something and don't forget to report her cos no one wants this kind of idiot in LoL.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-05T23:08:52.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my advice is since they are bad at decision making, you should tell them that when you gank, they should only engage when you ping their lane. This will prevent them from going in too early. It sounds pointless but trust me this trick is a god send in bronze. With this, it's not necessary for both of you to judge the situation, since most low elo laners have 0 map awareness, since if you think you can get them, you decide the engage timing. If somebody is losing lane they generally get tunnel vision anyways and won't expect how quickly they can be blown up, so the timing of the engage or bait needs to be spot on.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-08-12T09:42:01.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually when I play rank/norms, I ping multiple times ( I don't bloody care if its annoying) to 1) show that I am coming for a gank and when they should be ready, 2) where I am going to allow the laner to position himself to be close enough to close in for the kill and obviously make sure the laner has enough Hp cos people legit go in at half hp and gets instant bursted down.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Xayaah ","date":"2016-08-06T06:11:15.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks guys for your help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T12:30:30.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use the mute button. You are instantly free of toxic players and you can now focus on the game.\n\nIf they continue to feed, try and help them. If they still continue to feed, just try and help out the other lanes and leave her alone. Yeah it sucks and it's unfair, but it's also out of your control.\n\nAs much as people say Riot doesn't listen to reports, they really do. People do get banned if they are reported multiple times, and the satisfaction of reporting some jerk who was toxic in chat is real.","replies":[]}]}
