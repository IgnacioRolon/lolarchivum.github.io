Get rid of Toxic/AFK/Trolls NOW!","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Seriously Riot do you not care about any other servers but NA? Must be favouritism, sad how you guys do nothing to help the community out but you&#039;s just sit back on your lazy arses and do nothing but laugh at people who get reported for a legit reason and then do nothing to them. You seriously need a better support team, OCE the most toxic server in all of League and you&#039;d rather help out your favourite server which is NA and can&#039;t even help your other servers besides OCE, and yet when this is been viewed and posted, you&#039;s are too scared to actually reply because of the community coming down on top of you and giving you abuse, well I don&#039;t blame them for doing that.\r\n\r\nRiot, You do nothing to help us, you just sit back and let the fireworks take place. Do something for your community for once instead of ignoring them all. It&#039;s no wonder we are so toxic as a community, Cause there is no tribunal. The amount of people I&#039;ve reported for legit reasons and you&#039;s do nothing about it and I still see them in game. \r\n\r\nShow some respect to the people who are making the game what it is today and making money for you, help us out for once in your lives.\r\n\r\n-Sincerely the pissed off OCE community.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-03-10T06:35:07.795+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm just going to expand on to what **Yaia** has mentioned, because she missed a few things that you might want to know.\n\n+ Riot is working on a tribunal right now! \n**Riot Lyte** has said that the tribunal has been a top goal for a while now. You can find links to a few quotes [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134415323842), [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/134200448962) and [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133897083842).\n\n **Riot Lyte** basically says that after the new champion select, the tribunal will be the top priority of the player behavior team.\n\nSo, since the new champion select just got wrapped up on this patch, that means that Riot is currently hard at work on the new tribunal ;) \n\nWe don't know how long this might take, but I suspect we'll be notified when it's in its final stages of development.\n\n>  _**One last thing to be clear: **_\n> \n>  No one has a tribunal ATM, **NA** had one a few years ago, but it's since been removed. We're all in the same boat on this issue, **Riot** has given absolutely no special treatment to any servers over others.\n \nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Leeeeeroy","date":"2016-03-10T12:49:36.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this, logged in to one up this!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-03-10T03:52:12.580+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"**NA has the same punishment system as us. **\n\n[You can read about the punishment systems and values here.](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/Edu7E6Bp-introducing-the-emissaries) (Its one of the comments)\n\nJust because you are still seeing these players in game, doesn't mean they haven't been punished. They could currently be playing out their 10/25 game chat restriction, or have reformed their behaviour.\n\nSaying this, you can actively contribute to lessening the toxicity of the server by continuing to report negative behavior.\n\n You can also remove yourself from toxic situations by [creating/ joining a premade 5](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) for either dynamic queue or norms. This way, you can learn each others play styles, build long lasting friendships, have A+ communication and less toxicity. You even get bonus IP and mastery points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A Flying Brick","date":"2016-03-11T04:36:46.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main issue is that toxic players assume because there's no tribunal then they can be as toxic as they want with no punishment, add to that alot of players don't see the point in reporting if there's no tribunal and its just a cycle of toxicity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"catraven","date":"2016-03-10T16:16:11.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you add me in game.
