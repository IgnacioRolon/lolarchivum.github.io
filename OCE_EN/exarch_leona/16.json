Pretty much up to Diamond and then some the rule \"comfort over counter\" holds true basically always, but it may be wise to really pick up a tank support (looks like you play a pretty good Leo) or shield/cc enchanter (think Lulu, Morg) to supplement in matchups you know you struggle against with Soraka.\n\nYou're reaching the point where people know that counters are a thing, and have broadened their champ selection enough (for the most part) to utilise them to some degree.\n\nYou play some really good other picks, but not often. The tl;dr is basically, focus on learning your matchups and practice those other champs you enjoy and get more comfortable with them. \n\nIf you can't name off the top of your head at least two champs you hate versing, and two you love to verse, then you're only playing your champ, and not the matchups. Having that information helps you improve those more specific skills.\n\nI made the mistake of climbing into plat with only one champion that I was properly *comfortable* on, with some others that I was semi-comfortable but nervous to play actual ranked with because I didn't know the matchups, and it cost me.\n\nBut that's my personal advice. I'm not that much higher than you are so, grain of salt and all that.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-14T08:02:26.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a degenerate and if its a champ, its a support lel. \nPlay plenty of brand, morg, just playing raka since a lot of people forget shes an inbuilt heal machine. \n\nUsed to play Leo heeeeeeaaaaaaaps, but theres not enough follow up from ADCs to be viable anymore. \nUsed to play all the tanks heaps but gave up solely for that reason, no follow up. Makes laning near impossible.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-14T08:14:03.525+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh me too. New champ released? Oh it's a top laner? Sorry I'm playing it support. I do have a duo and I only do it in normals tho :P\n\nAs much as it pains me personally to say because I absolutely despise versing him, Brand is a spicy one to pick, but he v squishy. I agree though, playing Soraka against people who don't know how to play against Soraka is a fun time.\n\nI would argue that Soraka struggles from lack of ADC presence as much as Leo, since she has even less kill potential. At best you kinda just survive your lane and then help whoever is strong in teamfights. It works, but not super fun in my opinion (even as someone who doesn't play support super aggressively.\n\nIf you're worried about your laner, I would recommend taking a look at Nauti. I feel he has more kill potential than Leona (assuming you're versing a squishy lane) and gives your ADC a bit more time to react to your engages than Leo does. Personally, I would say Leo is generally the superior CC tank, but she struggles far more from lack of communication/synergy than Naut does.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-14T08:51:32.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Oh me too.
