He successfully ganked a few times, warded for his team, and didn't die intentionally at all.\n\n Of course, I don't know the pre-game context to this. If he let people know what his strategy was, then this is fine. But if he didn't even try communicate with the team it's kinda douchey and probably punishable.\n\n\n+ _You had a 1/12/0 Fiora Top with 68 CS_\n\n I thought this was the game you were angry about until I realized this player was your duo partner. So I'm assuming this was just a really bad game and not int. feeding, since you went on to play a few more games with him after that.\n\n__*\n\nAlso could you expand on why you think we're disconnected with the community?\n\nI do what I can to understand all perspectives and see why people think that way. But I imagine I often slip up in many cases and completely misunderstand what's going on.","replies":[]}]}
