Already lost 50LP because of this error and a promo game. \r\nits a major screw you to me.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, you should address these other issues too:\r\n\r\nA) Champion select is bugged. You go to lock in champs and (for me at least) has had a good 80% invalid ban error forcing a dodge (thanks RITO)\r\nB) 2 Days in and I&#039;ve had mostly intentional feeders and trolls. Flamers had heaps off but i just mute that crap rather than listening to them cry.\r\nC) When choosing the champ to play, I&#039;ve had the same error as banning forcing dodges (THANKS AGAIN RITO)\r\nD) Lobby consists of people wanting different roles non stop, so there&#039;s nothing but trades and role swapping different to the ones the &quot;prioritize&quot;\r\nE) While selecting the roles wanted, ive only ever gotten them probs 3-5 times a day. Choosing Support and Top to only often get jungle and mid.\r\n\r\nIf anything, ranked is more buggy than fixed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise RITO is just a satire group at this point","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-21T10:21:56.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Blaster Joker,\n\nSorry to hear you've been experiencing some issues with the game, to rule out any issues with your install specifically could you please [run a repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq6) on your game for me.\n\nOtherwise this might be a bug with the new champion select, if that's the case this thread would be better suited for the [Bug Reports board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)\nNow, onto your other points.\n\n>B) 2 Days in and I've had mostly intentional feeders and trolls.
