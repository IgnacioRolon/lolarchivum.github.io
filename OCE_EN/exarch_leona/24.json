Religions clearly Trollism hue. Or some other BS reason. \r\nNow this is what im finding ridiculous. Its perfectly okay to do this, but god forbid if you call people out for it. \r\n\r\nSeriously, how tf is trolling, int feeding and afking ok, but not wanting that BS in our game is against everything people stand for?","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-07-15T13:39:11.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rising salt levels have slowly been driving jungle mains from ranked, leading to more autofills.
