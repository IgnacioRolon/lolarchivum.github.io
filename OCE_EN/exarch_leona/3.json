It was available for what? 1-2 days of the 1 week offer (roughly, was like 5/6 days or something). \n\n\nWhat will happen?\nWe miss out of said sale because bugs? (Which is the champ, not just the skin as it occurs whenever thresh is in a game from what I&#039;ve observed)\nDoes the sale get extended?\nWhat&#039;s gonna happen?\n\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for proving my down vote theory right too guys.
