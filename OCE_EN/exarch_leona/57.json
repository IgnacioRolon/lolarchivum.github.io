Nothing gone, nothing added, nothing changed. \r\n\r\nNot sure on what to do.\r\n\r\n(If the people I played with see this, just wanna say sorry, didn't know it was gonna happen and was outta my control)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-23T11:15:34.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regrettably, the hardest kind of issue to nail down.\n\nYour best bet is going to be taking note of any relevant info (game, PC and connection-specific) you can think of and then comparing it if it happens again.\n\nIt could just be a freak accident, they do happen. It's usually a PC hitch in those cases but connections can do that too.\n\nFor now, you could run a proactive client repair, but unless it happens again or you are noticing issues in other games/programs, I wouldn't get too worried about a once-off issue.","replies":[]}]}
