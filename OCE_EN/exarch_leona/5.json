Seems as though you're on tilt. Play a different game for a while. It's never a good idea to play League (if you want to climb without a level head). Even if it's for an hour or two, it's better then playing while tilted. \n\nIf someone is toxic just mute and report them. It's not worth getting all worked up over. Focus on what you can do better. It helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-02-14T09:37:49.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, i'm not. \nIll sit there as the only none feeder, winning lane, and getting other lanes fed and ready to roll, just for some mentally handicapped child to afk, or feed harder than they were. \nThere is a limit of stupidity that I can tolerate, and silver just push it with just one player 99% of the time.","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2016-02-15T04:55:21.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blaster Joker,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=h6V0ZcuW,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-02-14T09:37:49.678+0000)\n>\n> Sadly, i'm not. \n> **Ill sit there as the only none feeder, winning lane, and getting other lanes fed and ready to roll, just for some mentally handicapped child to afk, or feed harder than they were.**\n> There is a limit of stupidity that I can tolerate, and silver just push it with just one player 99% of the time.\n\nComments like that is what makes you lose. I hope you realise that. You're too busy focusing on other people rather than yourself, which is the only way you can hope to win games. Until you learn to do that, expect to lose.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-02-17T10:42:27.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I should feed to win?\nill try that next promos then :)","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2016-02-18T05:17:55.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blaster Joker,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=h6V0ZcuW,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-02-17T10:42:27.410+0000)\n>\n> So I should feed to win?\n> ill try that next promos then :)\n\nNo. I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying you should focus on yourself. It doesn't matter if you have feeders on your team. Regardless you should be playing to improve, not to win. Eventually you'll get better and won't even have to worry about feeders because you can carry.\n\nIf that's all you get out of my comments then sure. I don't really care.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-02-14T23:18:25.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop bitching about teams, your at your rank because your bad, not because your teams are bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-13T13:04:11.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know in Low elo solo que, every time you que its like fipping a coins its 50/50 you get good teammate or bad and toxic as fk teammate. so just relax and enjoy the Game its OCE Toxic people will always in the game, every game got aleast 1 toxic player just mute the toxic and enjoy the game.
