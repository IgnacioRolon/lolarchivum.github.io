They sit there and go, and I quote, &quot;They&#039;ve done nothing wrong&quot;.\r\nThen you got people who want to climb. They get stuck with these delinquents and suffer for it. I&#039;m seeing people get chat restrictions and hearing of perma bans for people who actually want to climb, myself included. \r\n\r\nI got a chat ban for saying Leeroy Jenkins. Someone was going to be permabanned for playing a non meta support. People who name and shame in the name of making the community better are censored.\r\n\r\nRitos as crooked and Killary and we both know it. \r\nNow the board mods will rush to Ritos erection and ride it just because they have a daddy kink, and defend them because they refuse to admit riot have no faults magically. These, are funnily, the same people who don&#039;t actually play with the community, they just sit there being trashy people and trashy players. \r\n\r\nYou all can deny it as much as you want and argue it with no evidence like you have before like the SJW cucks you are, but we both know i&#039;m right.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-08T12:19:11.634+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ...15 intentional feeders...And roughly 7 afks\n\n**Game 1 (playing Darius):**\nQuestionable scores are **Darius **(3/8/1), **Kha'Zix **(2/6/2) and **Thresh **(0/5/9).

Permanent suspensions are not issued for climbing.\n\n> I got a chat ban for saying Leeroy Jenkins\n\nIf such is the case then it is a false restriction, and you can have/could have had the restriction reversed via ticketing player support. Alternatively you can post the chat logs for the restriction in question and we can let you know what would have triggered it.\n\n> permabanned for playing a non meta support\n\nThe threat of permanent suspension was an error of miscommunication that was admitted and revoked.\n\n> People who name and shame in the name of making the community better are censored.\n\nGood intentions or no, naming and shaming helps nobody. It risks witch hunts for players that may or may not be guilty and encourages holding grudges and not moving on from a negative situation once everything that needs to be done has been, which is not ideal. Naming and shaming causes more problems than it solves.\n\n> because they refuse to admit riot have no faults\n\nPresumably there was not meant to be a \"no\" there. Riot do have faults. They made a mistake with the Singed player when they threatened permanent suspension. They need more transparency in the report/punishment systems and in decisions like dynamic queue. Their biggest fault lies in their communication with the players. Comparatively (relative to other gaming companies) they do very well.\n\n> people who don't actually play with the community\n\nBoards moderation on OCE is largely managed by volunteers, all of whom are active players across all levels of play.\n___\nI hope the evidence I have provided is sufficient for you to consider a different perspective.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-09T02:08:09.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game Set Match","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-08T08:33:12.663+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is anything but real talk.

What about the 9/3/3 **Lux**? Or the 8/3/6 **LeBlanc**?\n\nThey didn't AFK either by the way, their EXP and CS rates are constantly rising. For example, [here is Ezreal's EXP graph](https://i.gyazo.com/fee6a89ade4fc48504deecfe931a0f8f.png ). If he did AFK it would have been super briefly.\n\nYou just straight up lied, or your definition of a troll is meaningless. \n__*\n\nIf you want to make a point about trolls in ranked, I'm with you 100%.
