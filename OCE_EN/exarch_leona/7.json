Why you specifically?\nBecause you seem to think that going right up to the enemy turret and fighting the enemy team is a smart idea. \nWRONG. \nWard it and don&#039;t push too far ahead. You will get ganked. You will get killed. And everyone will flame you. And hate you more than they already to. \nYou need to be able to retreat to a safe spot and be able to fight under YOUR turret (not theres, there turret isnt going to focus them).\nJungler, help ward lanes, its not hard. I get its rocket science but still. \nADCs, help ward the river for your support. Don&#039;t use the &quot;BUT MUH SUPPURTZ JEWB&quot;. Its not just the supports job anymore and you start with a warding trinket. \n1+1, guys. \nNot rocket science \n\nGank;\n\nJungler, Mid. AFK farming = bad idea. \nYou&#039;re letting your team down. \nMid, if you&#039;re against someone who roams, you have 3 options. \nA - Roam to counter gank your roaming laner. \nB - Roam to gank the opposite lane. You can help your team a lil bit that way.\nC - Shove your lane and take that turret. You are alone, there is nothing to worry about. Good chance their junglers helping with that gank. \nReally depends how you are going. \nIf you&#039;re behind, take advantage of this time and shove yo lane hard so you can roam and leech off other lanes later, you&#039;ll catch up. \nYou even? Go gank the other lane, you&#039;ll have help from top or mid. \nAhead? Go counter gank that roam, shut their roamer down and then shut that lane riiiiiiiiiiiiight the hell down. \n\nJungler, gank. AFK farming all game isn&#039;t going to win you the game. \nI&#039;m not seeing many ganks from you guys, all most at all. \nI have a higher chance of winning the lottery than getting a gank from you guys a good 99% of the time. Also not seeing you guys gank lanes as a whole much. \n\nCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMBO (whether its alone or solo);\n\nFun fact guys, did you know that melee champs such as Tryn, Diana, Yorick for example can stack Sej E. It&#039;s true. If you guys EVER get a Sej on your team, and IF she ganks (yeah, big if I know) help her stack up her E so she can get off a stun and deal a nice chunk of damage. Yes children, her E is a stun. If you have a support that can combo of their own skills (Brand E Q W, Leo E Q W Ulti Q, Vieg E W Q/ E Q W), good chance they can finish the enemy for them, giving you a kill, and them an assist and gold. \n\nHealers;\n\nFun fact. Theres healers in the game. \nYeah, I know its a shock to a lot of you. \nYa know how often I&#039;ve come across people that did not believe Nami OR Soraka had a heal inbuilt to their kit?\nAlmost EVERY. GOD. DAMN. GAME.\nADCs, go for them. You need to kill them otherwise you&#039;re letting them deal damage while you do nothing to them. They are outhealing the damage you&#039;re &quot;dealing&quot;. \nSupports, IF you see one of the enemy teams have a healer, get CC. Keeping healers CC&#039;d enough so your ADC can pop them so you can turn and beat stick the enemy ADC is pretty important. \nADCs (again), get an item that inflicts grievous  wounds. It reduces healing. Reducing healing against healers = good. Enemy healers = bad. They are not going to heal you. \n\nBecause apparently this needs to be said. I have no idea why people do not know this from all the playing that needs to be done pre-ranked. \n\nADCing;\n\nIncluding this because I&#039;m a support main. I get there&#039;s a little selfishness in there, but hear me out on this one. \n\nMost ADC&#039;s I&#039;ve been getting have the firm belief that roaming early will win a game. Well, you&#039;re both right and wrong. \nRoaming early is ok so long as you have that much of a lead. \nIf you are losing like all hell, don&#039;t go roaming, you&#039;re just gonna feed other lanes or their jungler. Don&#039;t be going full twat because you got destroyed as hell and wanna make it harder for everyone else. Ya know how uncool that is?\nHINT; VERY. \n\nThat&#039;s all the tips I can think of. \nBut the only one that I can not stress enough is the ADCs going WAY WAY WAY too far unwarded then flaming everyone because they didn&#039;t think something through.\n\nDrop more tips for people. Dunno bout half you guys, but clearly people need the help since 1+1 is advanced mathematics for people.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2018-03-10T22:15:22.837+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry but jungler is not all about ganking lanes. They have other important things to do like finding enemy jglers, stealing camps and controlling vision around objectives and securing them. You cannot simply blame jgler for not ganking if you are losing ur lane so bad and didnt ward any bishes in your lane. There is only one difference between good and bad jgler and it is soley determined by his pathing, not by a number of ganks. If jungler ganks all the time sacrificing his exp killing camp, then whos going to secure baron and drakes?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-20T01:43:06.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I will entertain you. \n\n1. Wards: This goes beyond just saying \"omg ward when you overextend\". There are very specific spots that you should be warding throughout the game and its only something you can learn if you are taught. Poor vision control will continue all the way to diamond and to be fair you have more important issues to worry about if you're silver than just warding.\n\n2. Gank: No. (i am jungle main) On my yi only account i went from unranked to plat just afk farming until mid/late game then completely stomping every skirmish regardless of how fed the enemy was. Jungling isn't all about ganking and if you're struggling so much you NEED ganks then you obviously have a problem with your play. I would almost advise any jungler wanting to get out of bronze to NEVER gank. As ganking for bad players will just put you behind and you'd be better off farming up for mid game. \n\n3. Healers: Or just get executioners and kill whoever you want? Half the time you dont even need it if you play well enough. Obviously you should never tunnel on a target you can't kill, healer or otherwise. Healers are extremely underpowered in the meta which is why people prefer shielding over healing.\n\n4. ADC: Support is my second most played role with a fuck tonne of mastery on thresh. Roaming after losing or taking a turret is the correct thing to do. If you get the turret first then you should swap with top. If you lose your turret first then support should go mid and adc should solo farm bot until they catch up. If neither turret is down then you shouldn't be roaming at all.","replies":[]}]}
