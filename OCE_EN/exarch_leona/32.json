Certainly it's a factor, and you can just get unlucky of course. But the main skill in TFT is playing to the strengths of what you get, knowing when to cut your losses, and knowing when to commit to a certain build.\n\nYou might want an imperial/blademaster team, a Draven with Rageblade, bloodthirster etc.  But if you keep getting defensive items and few blademasters, then at some point you have to make a decision, and maybe sell your Draven and take that Braum that keeps popping up. Or else you might keep drawing a blank until you're out.\n\nPeople keep saying _\"I don't get what I want, but the enemy always does.\"_\nNo. Thats not the case, the enemy probably isn't getting what they want either, they just know when to let go of what they want, and play to the strengths of what the game is actually giving them.\n\nI like going for Glacial, get Braum to lvl 2 and give him a Thornmail, aim for that lvl 3 Ashe and a rageblade.  When I get it, it's amazing.  But sometimes (most of the time) the game just won't give me the components, in that case, I have to explore the other classes the glacial champions I already own have.  Are kindred and Varus popping up a lot?  Time to sell that Lissandra and aim for the ranger bonus for your Ashe.  Maybe I want that rageblade and I have the needlessly large rods lying around for it, but I'm starting to lose and theres no guarantee that the recurve bows will appear, so maybe its time to sell Ashe, turn the rods into a deathcap slap it on Liss/Anivia and head for that Elementalist bonus.\n\nThe game will always give you something.  It may not be what you want, but you'll always get something.  What separates the good strategists from the bad, is how they use what they are given, and how flexible they are to changing tack mid game.\n\n\n____________________________________\n\n**Always Re-assess!**\n\nIt's RNG, which means you'll always get exactly what you want.. _eventually_.  \nBut we don't have until 'eventually' we have about 20-40 minutes, so you have to constantly re-assess your army: \n\nMaybe you've got that Knight bonus going, a lvl 2 Morde and Garen, it's getting into later game now, and karthus pops up.  Do you switch out your lvl 2 Garen and Knight bonus for a lvl 1 Karthus and Phantom bonus?  Its late game, Garen is less likely to show up now, but Karthus might well come round in the shared draft, so theres a chance at a lvl 2 gold champ.  If you do take Karthus, can you swap out some of the rest of your team to get sorcerer going too? All of a sudden, in 1 round, you've gone from maybe a Knight-Bruiser team to a Phantom-Sorcerer one.  Maybe it's worth it? Maybe not?  What does the enemy team have?  If they're running assassins, you've probably just fucked yourself.  If they're running Yordles, maybe you've just turned the tables.  \n\nThese are the decisions you need to make every time you get something significant in a round.  \n\nEvery time you get an item.  Every time 2 or even 3 of the same champ pop up in the store.  Every time the shared draft comes around.  Every time an enemy makes a big change to their team.  Re-assess the situation, and consider your options.\n\n\n____________________________________\n\n**Positioning**\n\nYou also can't under-estimate the power of positioning.  If you're getting champs who don't move. Maybe the way you've positioned your team blocks them in once people start moving _(although sometimes there are bugs where they are in the open and still do nothing)._  If you want to change the focus of your team, you can do that by splitting them up, put the bulk of your team closer to the enemy, but place the flankers in the corner under where their carries are.  Once the game starts the enemy team will move to the closest threat and your flankers will automatically close in on the rear because of their location and because they take longer to get to the fight.\n\n\n____________________________________\n\n**Luck**\n\nSo yea, RNG is a factor.  But it's what you do with what the RNG gives you that counts.\nif you're having problems **_\"a good 95% of games\"_**, well.. the common factor in all those games is you.  The 'R' in RNG stands for 'Random', which means its not intentionally spiting you, the chance of getting _literally nothing that works together_, while everyone else gets _perfects rolls_ in 95% of games, is so astronomically small, that either you're the single most unlucky player in history _(to the point where scientists need to study you)_, or the RNG is not _actually_ your issue here.\n\nRegular 5v5 games have a hell of a lot of randomness to them as well.\nWhich team does the game put the 3,000,000 mastery point Vayne on?  Which team gets the Top lane Janna that AFKs at 15 minutes when the team wont surrender after she feeds Nasus.\n\nNeed to ward a bush?  Maybe it's empty.  Maybe the enemy Rengar just happens to be there?  Unless you can somehow keep the entire map warded, there's always luck involved.\n\nAre you first pick?  Last pick?  Is your champ banned/picked?  Did the last tick of their ignite kill you?  Did the last tick of your ignite leave them on 6 HP?\n\nTFT just doesn't hide the innate luck of gaming.  It tells you exactly where the luck comes into play, and in my mind, thats much better.  You can plan and allow for that.\n\n_**TFT is essentially rolling dice and looking for patterns.  There are always patterns, you just have to look for them.**_","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-19T08:47:10.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play to your strengths\n\nYes, ill play with nothing usable.
