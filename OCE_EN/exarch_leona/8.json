They'll get placed in bronze/iron, play for a few more weeks get demoralised and realise they're not getting out, then stop playing ranked til next year.  Also you have the actual good players who get placed lower than usual, and spend the next couple of weeks or so moving back up to where they belong.  Either way, right now while the system is in flux, is the time where you are most likely going to have to contend with these people.\n\nSo why, in the name of \"logic\" would you start your grind when theres a very high possibility that these two demographics will be placed in/against your teams? It makes absolutely no sense.\n\nBe patient.\nWait a month:\n\n**Wait for** the tiers to even out, give it time for the bad players to fall below your elo and the good players to rise above it. So your games aren't likely to be negatively affected by either.\n**Wait for** any huge balance anomalies to be evened out over the next two patches.\n**Wait for** the new champ's hype to have simmered down so you don't have to waste a ban.\n**Wait for** any ranked issued (theres always some; LP gain/loss bugs, placement errors, etc.) \nto be ironed out. \n\nLet everyone who jumps straight into ranked on day 1 without thinking take the fall for all these problems.  Then once everything has calmed down and evened out, then start playing ranked.  The people in your bracket will be people who actually belong there and the system has had a month to put them there.\n\nWhy take these unnecessary risks by starting ranked on day 1? \nThats what really makes no sense here.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2019-02-12T18:26:45.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but riot employees are on record claiming these things only happen in less than 2% of games","replies":[]},{"poster":"GamexOver","date":"2019-01-27T09:41:04.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=q1eX91ZA,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2019-01-26T07:12:35.995+0000)\n> \n> Why take these unnecessary risks by starting ranked on day 1? \n> Thats what really makes no sense here.\n\nWhy you ask...  I will finally get placed into master tier... It is 50/50 if I get them on my side or vsing them. \nAll jokes aside thou.\n\nDay 1 heck even week 1. Is the truest form of 50/50 matches ever. Dont get me wrong it is very tilting. But Riot has always said that each match is 50/50. Win or lose it is up to you.\nRight now since I have been in rank since day 1. It is really 50 50.. Normally it is a one sided thing. One team really melts face and the other team just crys about it as they watch.\nRight now I can go into rank and face someone higher skill level then me { AKA Gold } and watch replay on what they did and what they didnt and leant from it. Not someone on youtube making some video \" PLAT SMURF IN B5 \" and watch him rip them.\n\nIt is me vsing the gold.. Trying everything to not feed. Trash talk to them. Try to freeze the wave on them. Call for a gank and camp them. IT IS FING GREAT!!!!!! I vsed a gold 3 Yorkic in one game I played and held my own for a bit. Then after that  match I took a break and then played again. This time trying to do what he did to me. Then a silver 5 called me a smurf.. THAT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD!\nI was silver 4. But they said I was a smurf.\n\nI would never have had that ever unless I did rank day 1. \n\nAs for OP as I dont want to side track your post.\n\nEveryone is more edgey during placements and promos. Riot them selfs could back up this. Only because of investment.\nDont take it personal at all.\nPeople afk as they want the game to end. They FF'ed and you didnt want too. So this is time they could have finding another match or maybe even a win. Once again this is due to the investment of the player.\nPlayer wants to win and climb higher. This can only be done with another game as the game you are in right now is not working. Same goes for promos. \n\nYou want to climb. Riot said \" Congrats. Lets see if you can make it \" and now the player is like \" YES I WILL \" then gets a team that isnt going to make it to the finish line. Now this player feels like they have been short changed. So they start to act out to the people that are short changing them. Dont take it personal. I am 100% they do not mean it that way.\n\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}\nWell one would hope!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-02-12T11:18:08.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best game ever:\na jg that int feeds EVERY lane. \nfor amusement. his amusement.\n\nkind reminder rito do nothing about the community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-02-11T09:18:39.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Start again, game 1:\nAFK jg after inting mid\ntrolling sup\nadc giving up because sup trolling\n\n10 bucks on no one gets punished","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-02-09T12:13:52.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game just now; \nAFK jg\nADC that intentionally baited ally team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-02-01T12:05:26.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back home to play. \nGame 1:\nrefusing to communicate/help team/anything TOP and MID. \ngot counter jungled hard, did my best but went full wood IV despite working with what I could.\n\nGame 2:\nint feeding top that then afk'd. obviously a booster.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-01-29T08:53:29.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, from tonight, when i get a troll team, ima \"call\" them out till rito address the issue.\n\nTroll top who refused to help anyone.
