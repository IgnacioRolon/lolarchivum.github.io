If anything happens to your client or game while using them, **Riot** is not resposible. \n\nThey may also change their stance on this in the future and start punishments for its use, so be informed about **Riot** policy when using custom skins.

When push comes to shove, if Riot can't tell from their end whether a 3rd party program is giving a player an unfair advantage they'll most likely punish the player in question just to be safe. Also, as Telecasterdude mentioned, Riot *may* change their stance on \"aesthetic mods\" in the future to be fully punishable despite not giving any advantage over other players, which is another risk.\n\nThe risk of virus/malware software being in such mods is something to be expected and has nothing to do with Riot, but of course still a risk.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-26T12:13:43.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While you are correct in saying that it's a third party software, Riot has never really confused the two or when they do, it's always resolved.
