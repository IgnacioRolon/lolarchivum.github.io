Top is demanding someone picks them Akali or he will troll. Sure enough Akali gets banned by the other team and he decides to lock cleanse ghost janna . Obviously I dodged, this guy is calling himself a D1 smurf and has a 50% WR, locking in a new champion on the first day and trolling..\r\n\r\nSo this is all normal and fine. You can&#039;t report this kind of behaviour so you just have to eat the lp loss and move on..\r\n\r\nIf only it ended there -.- \r\n\r\nI queued 20 minutes later and got this human scum again. Surely enough, he does the same thing and I&#039;m forced to dodge at the last second again. I queue 30 minutes later again. Low and behold he is there again, trolling the lobby. Once again I am forced to dodge because this guy seemingly has more fun requeueing after every dodge he forces just to grief and ruin someones day. \r\n\r\n[](https://imgur.com/q47lou8)\r\n\r\nMaybe it&#039;ll be another ten years before they add some way to punish gutter trash like this who take lobbies hostage.. oh well.. guess I&#039;ll go wait out this obnoxiously long queue timer for helping my team not lose lp. Nice game Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"o  W I T C H  o","date":"2018-08-03T01:40:53.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds like a normal day on OCE","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2018-08-02T12:37:42.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is why id rather wait like 2 - 4 weeks for the champion hype to calm down by keeping off ranked aha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2018-08-01T23:09:36.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I ended up several times with a guy who said he would troll if he didnt get akali.
