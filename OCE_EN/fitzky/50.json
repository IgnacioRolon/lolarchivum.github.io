I lose promos and go down to 60LP, then I get back into promos again and BOOM everyone on my team is shit again. Lose promos for the second time and AGAIN I&#039;m back to 60LP. What&#039;s up with that?","replies":[{"poster":"Mr X","date":"2017-10-16T14:29:32.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You normally go down to 75LP but times change.  \n\nBy the way,  blaming a loss on your teammates being \"shit\" is exactly how you are going to lose games especially in your promos. \n\nYou should never play and expect your teammates/enemy to be on the same level as you are,  everyone has a different skill level.  So stop complaining and just play your best game of ranked you can.  \n\nRant finished \n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-17T03:36:28.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, I went from 0LP to 100LP in a single day of just constant wins. I can easily win lane and solo carry in silver, the ONLY thing that I require from my teammates is to be decent at the game. As long as no one feeds too hard I can win the game for them. Unfortunately every game that I had in promos magically everyone had scores like 1/8 and 0/12, almost like it was done on purpose. Unless during promos you are somehow matched with people lower than your division, which really doesn't seem likely to me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MysticLlama","date":"2017-10-17T01:16:03.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine you are gaining ad losing LP when you are in series....\nm guessing you got into series and lost 2 games in a row both times. Think of it like you got -20 then another -20 so you end up on 60LP. It is a slight flaw in the free win system so if you lose the series you will automatically register as two losses and not count you for your \"free win\". \nSo that is basically it tbh. If in your first series you won 1 and lost 2 in that order you will end up at 60LP because you cannot go above 100 but if you lose you will go to imaginary 80 then win and go back up to imaginary 100 then lose again resulting in a failed series then you will end up with real 80LP on the other side of your series.\n\nBest of Luck summoner :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-17T03:32:51.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh well that's weird, I've been through many divisions and that's never happened to me.
