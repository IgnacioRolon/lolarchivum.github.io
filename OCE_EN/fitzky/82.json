Can we do that again pls :D","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-26T09:20:17.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup! Riot did do this last year, but it's quite a possibility they might not distribute free skins again this year. The mentality is to essentially distribute gifts pretty much whenever the team decides to without necessarily setting a precedence of giving free content on a regular/scheduled basis. To be fair, positive players were recently given the handshake positive behavior icon! I would of course be very happy with getting a free skin, but would definitely understand if it didn't come around the New Years :P","replies":[{"poster":"UseIess","date":"2015-12-26T10:02:55.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is this hand shake icon?","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-26T10:36:21.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://am-a.akamaihd.net/image?f=http://news.cdn.leagueoflegends.com/public/images/articles/2015/september_2015/PPIU/pb_icon_final.jpg\n\nWhen 5.18 dropped, we powered up the instant feedback system and shared that positive players would earn an exclusive Summoner Icon.
