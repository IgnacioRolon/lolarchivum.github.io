One of the biggest issues with low ELO is that no one ever communicates effectively. If you see something as being a potential issue, such as a heavily physical (or magic) damage biased team, say something. If people don't appreciate the fact that you've tried to help turn the game into a win, that's their problem and you can report them post-game if they're going to be a d!ck about it.\n\nThat said, me explaining this to you shouldn't result in comments like \"are you stupidly arrogant\" or such. That just makes you a d!ck and will probably result in you getting hit with some kind of punishment, which is something you would probably want to avoid.\n\n> Regardless there a few select champions who can abuse that fact they can do more damage building defense then offense and in most games is no way in which a tank should work, but in this game it seems perfectly acceptable?\n\nYou're thinking of this in too much of a \"black and white\" situation. It's not as simple as \"tanks deal lots of damage\", it never is. It's extremely situational for a (more typical) tank to be dealing lots of damage, such as the scenario you encountered with the Malphite who was only able to deal significant damage while still being massively tanky because your team didn't come together and do something about the heavy physical damage bias of your composition. In a more typical situation, that Malphite (more than likely) would've just been dead weight with that build.\n\nThat said, we also have different kinds of tanks, such as Bruisers (who can deal a bit of damage while still being massively tanky) and Fighters (who are more balanced between defense and offence).","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-17T10:16:18.738+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":5,"body":"> That said, me explaining this to you shouldn't result in comments like \"are you stupidly arrogant\" or such.

True, that was a bit of an assumption on my part, *however* that doesn't mean you needed to resort to insults. You could have simply explained how the situation differed (and based on your next comment, it seems it did differ).\n\n> im not even going to go into the tank thing anymore because your obviously fixed on that one instance, in which i have had hundreds of others were tanks have dominated , with 1 or 0 damaging items as have countless other people.\n\nAs I've pointed out, you're thinking of it too much like \"black and white\" and seem to be ignoring the \"grey\" areas.
