I suggest just wait for s7 to settle in and some balance changes to hit the rift, hopefully she will recieve a few nerfs and her win rate might drop a little bit.

Lategame vayne can still be beaten by adcs such as sivir and caitlynn who have tools to deal with her and can also just beat her in terms of raw damage during teamfights with the right peel. Supports like leona, alistair, nautilus, lissandra and lulu are also pretty good at picking her off and nullifying her, but this only lasts a few seconds at best so you'll need to kill her quick. I find even though I don't especially like them, having a knockup and a yasou is a pretty decent way of shutting a vayne down.\n\nIf you're reallying having trouble with vaynes though the most reliable solutions are to have either a knockup+yasou with an r key, a caitlynn+heavypokesup, Burstydamageadc+Leona, a very good Fizz, a Vi or a bursty stealth assassin who has half a brain.\n\nDon't play things she can kite unless you have a sivir+zilean+karma+kled+ascenciontalisman+rightrousglory.

Things such as a stun from an Annie can be very effective for shutting down a Vayne along with exhaust. There might be situations where a Vayne has a QSS and is able to remove one crowd control, but this is where the team aspect comes in. Once Vayne has used the QSS you can coordinate with your team for her to be immediately stunned again.\n\nTo comment on what you were saying with ganking her early, this can be very effective early on but there is always time after laning phase in every league game. The main thing that you need to keep in mind is that Vayne is strong when she gets a lot of farm and is able to get items. So therefore your goal should be to end the laning phase as soon as possible meaning taking towers and dragons to force her to group with her team before her power spikes.\n\nWhen you gank make sure you get damage on bot tower if you can if you get some kills and force your bot lane to rotate mid after pushing bot with the tower down to make Vayne make a choice. Group mid with her team and lose out on farm, or get farm and her team lose towers.\n\nAlways consider other lanes though. Your top lane doing really well? you might be able to gank for him, get top tower, rift herald start him snowballing even harder and create yourself an anti-Vayne player in team fights. Plus if that top tower dies he can roam bot more easily and force team fights earlier and the earlier team fights start, the sooner laning phase ends.\n\nI hope this post made sense and if you have any questions about what I said let me know. Always keep in mind that Riot always has to balance around both the competitive aspect of the game a long with the casual which can be a hard thing to balance especially for a champion like Vayne. \n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-01T03:37:19.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem is that most of the vayne players you run into these days are lvl 5-7 and have a blitz/naut support, so ganking their lane or trying to pick them off after laning phase becomes almost impossible since these vayne players are already god kiters and you have to deal with a 4000+ health tank constantly grabbing you and using CC on you so vayne just finishes you off in 3 hits. It's in teamfights where I'm trying to turn the focus on vayne but the rest of her team just locks everyone down and we're all dead. It's the experienced vayne players who are smart and can 1 v 3 easily and it becomes frustrating to play against because even when she ends up 0/5, the good players are able to comeback and end up dominating everyone. It's the same situation with Yasuo, sure he's a hard champion to learn and play, I accept that, but as someone who has him on lvl 6 I can see the amount of power you have over a game when you know his powerspikes and his weaknesses. It's a power that's too strong and unfair to other players, both in and outside of lane. Overall it just really pisses me off to the point where I don't feel like playing the game anymore, having champions like this just takes all the fun away, the vayne and yas players are enjoying themselves but the people who have to deal with them aren't. Everyone playing the game should be having fun, not just the people taking advantage of stupid champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-01T04:27:18.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"things vayne is not good at/weak against: \n\n - dealing with multiple point and click cc\n - wombocombo based teamcomps\n - knockups (qss ain't going to save ya)\n - stealth assassins like rengar, khazix and shaco (maybe not in S7 though since shaco's 1shot potential is being nerfed)\n - siege comps (have a caitlyn and a velkoz and stuff, don't let her get close enough to fight you)\n - tanky divers who don't really care much about cc (mundo, olaf, ect...)\n - Lane Bullies (Miss Fortune, Caitlynn, Karma, Lucian, Leona, Zyra in botlane, Yasou, Irelia, Teemo in toplane)\n - Vi\n - Teamfight AoE adcs (Sivir, Caitlyn, Lucian, Miss Fortune, Twitch) who just do much more raw damage\n - 5v5s in Lane without a dive teamcomp to initiate for her\n - A good Fizz\n - Pink wards (for now)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
