So some good runes would be attack speed Marks, scaling armor seals (if you just want to farm and play passively) or just flat armor seals, 3 flat magic resist glyphs and 6 cooldown per level glyphs. Quintessences would be flat Ability power. So, you should have about 14% attack speed, 27 armor at level 18 OR 9 armor, 4 magic resist, 10% cdr at level 18 and 15 ability power.\nMasteries would probably have to be fervor of battle, 18/12/0. \nAs for her build, I recommend taking Dorans Ring with cookies, followed up by her core item Nashor's Tooth, sorcerer boots, guinsoo's rageblade, runaans hurricane and zhonyas hourglass. this should give you 40% cdr with the runes provided. Last item would probably be void staff or rabadons, and situational items such as guardian angel and wits end are also preferable.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-08T12:09:07.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ this\n \nT lords is also a good option. \n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-09T07:34:03.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much everybody!
