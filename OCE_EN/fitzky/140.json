How do assassins work? How does Riot utilize this in their game?\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/dev-blog-classes-subclasses\r\nTo Riot, assassins are champions that &quot;infiltrating enemy lines with their unrivaled mobility to quickly dispatch high-priority targets&quot;.\r\nWith this idea, Riot have designed and shaped their &quot;assassin&quot; champions with this kind of playstyle that players ultimately have to learn to adapt to, to effectively play &quot;assassin&quot; champions well. Now the point of interest is, are these type of champions healthy? Have Riot created a balanced playstyle around these champions that work both ways and are equally in hand for both oppositions? Of course a 13/4 fizz is gonna be at an advantage against a 4/13 zed but does that mean zed still has a fair chance of making a comeback? Fizz is ultimately designed to run into a fight and throw everything into it, that&#039;s what his kit is based around. Zed is designed in a similar way, ulting into a fight while unleashing his shadow and throwing everything onto one target in hopes of eliminating it, usually in this case the adc or the &quot;highest priority target&quot;. Now the current elements of these assassin champions include: changing positions in an attempt to outplay and &quot;fool&quot; your opponent (Zed, LB), becoming untargetable or &quot;hidden&quot; to escape or surprise an opponent (Fizz, Akali) and finally, the most powerful and most utilized, stealth. Similar to becoming &quot;hidden&quot; to escape or surprise an opponent, with akali being an exception since you still know where she kinda is just in a small area, the stealth mechanic is probably one of the most op elements in the game since the target essentially becomes completely invisible, opening them to countless outplay opportunities. Now I&#039;m aware that Riot are working on an assassin update and are targeting the element of &quot;stealth&quot; and how to effectively make it balanced. With this in mind, I thought I&#039;d look back at a champion creation I made around 5 months ago \r\n\r\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/ngNNFz73-phonos-assassin-of-the-void\r\n\r\nNow this design was ultimately just shitty and next to no thought was put into the stats and lore but what I was most interested in was the abilities. I kinda just hit me one day when I was thinking of champions like Swain and Anivia who use **toggle **ultimates which I was very interested in and wanted to see more of. So I thought, &quot;why not a toggle stealth ultimate&quot;? But of course this could never work surely! This is just going back to making the stealth element more broken and absurd as it already is! But lets first just take a look into it, currently most champions have temporary stealth (Rengar, shaco) lasting between 3 - 7 seconds with evelyn being the only champion with &quot;unlimited&quot; stealth if she is not near an enemy champion. Now evelyn is the only champion in the game with a &quot;free&quot; stealth while the rest have to use it &quot;wisely&quot; and &quot;effectively&quot;, needless to say evelyn too has to pick the right situations to reveal herself to the enemy. Now on the basis of having a toggle stealth costing mana per second on an assassin, would this be breaking the boundaries too far? Or is this an opportunity to introduce a new and balanced way of stealth? Currently the way my champion, Phonos, is designed, is that his ultimate has a 1 second delay and can only break stealth from running out of mana or using an ability. Of course in its current stage, its broken, in any situation Phonos predicts that in the next few seconds he&#039;ll most likely die so he uses his ult and boom, he&#039;s gone, and the enemy can only predict where he has gone and mindlessly fire skillshots in hopes of killing him. So how can we balance this? Lets try something like this:\r\n\r\nR: Passive: Using q behind an enemy champion to exit stealth instead Backstabs them and does double damage.\r\n\r\nTOGGLE - X mana per second - After a 3 second delay Phonos becomes one with the shadows of the void stealthing himself. Using an ability/autoattack or running out of mana will unstealth him. When Phonos is within 1000 units of an enemy champion, soft dark whispers can be heard signalling that phonos is nearby. This ability has a 3 second CD (after he breaks stealth). \r\n\r\nSimilar to facing a Rengar, with the exclamation mechanic signalling enemy players that he is nearby, only instead giving players more &quot;space&quot; and opportunity to outplay. Phonos is melee, but he doesn&#039;t leap, meaning he has to get right up behind you to actually do damage (unless he wants to blink straight on you but in that case wouldn&#039;t do much since the slow only applies to targets hit by his e which would in turn unstealth him from a distance anyway). When players are signalled by the &quot;sounds&quot;, the handy pink ward can be dropped and boom, there goes the sneak attack. Even without any pinks if your a Hecarim or your fast enough simply outrunning him would mean he&#039;s long gone and your home safe. Of course this isn&#039;t necessarily rendering him useless. The enemy knows that Phonos will try and approach from behind to backstab and do a lot of damage so that&#039;s what they&#039;ll be expecting. However, if the Phonos player is smart enough, they&#039;ll choose different angles of approach and ultimately fool the opponent and exposing their &quot;weak&quot; spot. Even without going in for the &quot;kill from behind&quot;, Phonos can still choose different methods of eliminating a target. Using his e + w as a good gap closer while using q to quickly finish off a target, he&#039;s still open to opportunities.\r\n\r\nPhew, well that was a lot! Probably the most I&#039;ve ever written, I probably could of explained more but I&#039;m tired and It&#039;s late. I hope I at least got some Idea across. Have fun in the comment section folks\r\n\r\nFitzky,","replies":[]}
