I was top against a graves and the fact that I was unable to 1 v 1 him and had to tower hug my entire lanning phase is quite frankly a little stupid. And I&#039;m well aware he is ranged and I&#039;m melee but before his rework I could most certainly best him even when he was fed. So riot I&#039;m asking you this, do you honestly test your champions before reworking/releasing them?","replies":[{"poster":"Gragozz","date":"2015-11-16T02:09:23.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the last bit, and i agree with ya, do you test them riot, or do you just put them onto the PBE and hope for the best","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-16T04:32:11.356+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"The PBE cannot, and never will compare to the live servers, it does not have the population or the diversity to be such, thus Riot has to take and balance data from the PBE with many grains of salt.

I believe they did tune him down while he was on PBE if memory serves, but they would always rather underdo it than overdo it, because while its underdone people will still play them and they can get data, if its overdone people just stop playing x champ. It's not that they aren't listening, it's a process. They'll tune him down again next patch. I'm sure there are plenty of things people on PBE thought were stupid or OP but were fine or even too weak once they hit live. Selective/circumstantial evidence doesn't really count as evidence at all. I'd honestly like to see what would happen if some people on here were given the opportunity to input their own balance changes for a day...I can guarantee you it'd be a trainwreck.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-16T06:18:41.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Selective/circumstantial evidence doesn't really count as evidence at all.\n\nThere were several pro players, Several streamers, there was just so much of everyone telling them he was OP.\n\nThey may have toned him down slightly, but their balance team doesn't know how to balance, or actually care to, and this is probably one of the few times where they actually listened to what they were being told and the \"nerfs\" were no where near enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-16T06:29:53.034+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm clearly not gonna change your mind ==\" You do you m8.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-11-16T02:23:32.550+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you build to counter him or did you just build your standard damage build, a little defense go's a long way. after 6 you should definitely have his number, 2 autos on minions, Q W auto couple with the Corrupting Potion is a ton of harass, then you can E to get off a stun to provide enough time to run into the brush and escape or parry his autos and run into the brush, i would recommend the latter as you would most likely have minion aggro and he will most likely try to chase you down with his dash and autos. the delayed explosion from his Q is easy enough to move out of the way of. Would definitely come down to player skill, graves is strong but he can be outplayed easily, problem is people aren't familiar enough with the changes to counter play.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-11-17T10:19:59.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the fact that he dashed away every time I activated my E?
