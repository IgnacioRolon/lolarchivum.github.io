So we will enter a game and there is a pretty positive environment, everyone saying &quot;glhf&quot; and all and joking around about stuff. Then we move on to the early-mid game and the people you knew from the start of the game are completely different. Someone will be 1/3 and spamming ff as much as he can because he believes the game is over and theres 0 chance of us winning. But sometimes its not just &quot;someone&quot;, its the other 4 people who 3 of which aren&#039;t even tilted, but because of this stupid idiot who is crying because his lane didn&#039;t go his way he&#039;s putting that 100% effort into trying to convince the other 3 that theres no hope. Theres nothing you can do because 4 against 1 the game is forfeited and you get a free loss. The attitude of some of these players makes me cry {{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-03T04:57:17.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they focus on what they need to do to win the game, it would do a hell of lot more good than whine or say \"ff@20\".
