You introduced the role selection system so we could get the roles we wanted yet I&#039;m still forced to play support which I utterly despise and always end up losing. I&#039;m playing in low elo here which is full of autistic children so I have to play my carry roles so I can actually climb. Yet somehow someone dodges and suddenly I&#039;m autofilled into support and it&#039;s pretty much an instant loss for me. It&#039;s fucking bullshit and I&#039;ve had enough. What happened to the idea you had where you could select one role you never want to get? Why was that scrapped? NO ONE LIKES AUTOFILL. People have said time and time again that they would rather wait 10+ minutes to play the role they want. Why won&#039;t you listen to us? I don&#039;t want to play support, I don&#039;t want to have to dodge every time I get support. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s ruining the experience for me, I want to have fun and autofill isn&#039;t helping. Please listen and understand where I&#039;m coming from, I play League because I enjoy playing top and mid, I like playing darius/jax top and talon/vel koz mid, I enjoy those roles. I never have fun when I&#039;m playing support. Frankly I just feel like going afk, but of course I&#039;m just gonna get banned so I play out the stupid match anyway. Video games are suppose to allow the player to enjoy themselves so why are you forcing us to play something we don&#039;t enjoy?","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-23T04:33:12.055+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out this article from within the month: http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/06/ask-riot-autofilled/","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-23T05:34:54.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I don't care how \"fun\" they try to make support I hate the damn role, I can't win games and climb playing support because everyone in my elo is trash.
