As any other marksman she outranges all tanks and pokes them into oblivion but the issue starts when she hits 6. Her ult gives he too much snowballing potential, shes able to outrun anyone and burst them down in a blink giving you no chance to outplay. I&#039;ve tried stunning a quin, causing her to lose her ult, then flash and run towards my tower and she still was able to cast her ult after and run me down even after everything I did to get away. I&#039;ve pinged teammates to come help me, I had the midlaner come when I was in the river but quin just ults e&#039;s then boom shes dead and I&#039;m left to be picked off. My last option was to try playing teemo top and try and out-cancer that stupid champ but of course my blind made no difference and I was left under turret again helpless and quin left to roam around the map picking everyone off. I just got out of a game where I decided to play vayne top and guess who I got matched against. Adc vs adc toplane and quin always wins. For the love of god just nerf her ult less movement speed and not a ridiculous  0 mana cost at lvl 3 that basically allows her to just keep using ult instead of normal movement.","replies":[{"poster":"Arf Arf Arf Arf","date":"2016-06-04T09:13:00.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn's a lane bully. It's like expecting to win vs a Heimerdinger, if he knows what he's doing it's not gonna happen. So how do you win the game? By losing lane gracefully. Buy fucktonnes of potions, build tank and sustain items, make sure you take teleport. Use that teleport to win bot lane if you can. As long as you don't fall too far behind, the Quinn will suck during the mid-late game due to her squishiness. You can ask for help from your jungler, but don't feel like you're entitled to your jungler's assistance. When you go solo lane, you should be prepared to survive solo. Otherwise go play support or ADC.","replies":[]}]}
