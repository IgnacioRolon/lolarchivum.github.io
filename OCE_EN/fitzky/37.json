I&#039;ve had multiple quins ADMIT shes unfair. I think her passive and ult needs to be nerfed -  lower scaling on passive (I&#039;ve seen her do more then half of an opponents health in dmg with it) and lower movement speed and increase mana cost on her ult (She has too much mobility with it allowing her to outrun most other champions). Quin shouldn&#039;t be allowed to have as much roam as she has (1000+ movement speed from base) especially when she can ult, rush onto an opponent, jump on them/slow them then deal ridiculous passive dmg and finish them off with q and a basic attack. All of this is done in under 3 seconds.

Maybe someone more like Poppy. ","replies":[]}]}]}
