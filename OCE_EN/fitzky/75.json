{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-13T03:44:32.929+0000","title":"CHAMPION IDEA","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard recently that sometimes riot takes ideas or \"bits and pieces\" off of different champion concepts that players make so I thought I would try and give it a go. This is my first time even attempting to construct a champion idea so BARE WITH ME.\n\nName: Phonos (Dolophonos is the Greek word for assassin) - Assassin of the Void (Like kassadin and malzahar he&#039;s not void born).\n\n\nRole: Assassin\n\nABILITIES\n\nBasic attacks: Phonos attacks with a dagger in his right hand and slashes in a similar way to yasuo\n\nPassive: Phonos prepares to strike his enemy&#039;s vital areas, every 10 seconds his next basic attack will strike with a forceful stab dealing a bonus 30/40/50/60 (Plus 30% of bonus Ad) in physical damage.\n\nQ: No cost - Phonos&#039;s next attack swiftly slashes his opponent with his long blade (Present on his back) dealing 40/80/120/150 (Plus 60% of Ad) in physical damage. Does not trigger passive.\n\nW: 40/50/80/100 Mana - Phonos dashes at a target enemy dealing 20/50/80/100 (Plus 50% of Ad) in physical damage.\n\nE: 20/30/50/70 Mana - Phonos throws a void-infused dagger in a target direction dealing 20/30/40/50 (Plus 30% of Ad) in physical damage. If it hits an enemy it is marked for 5 seconds. Phonos&#039;s next basic attack on a marked enemy instantly triggers his passive (Enemy is no longer marked after that).\n\nNow on to the ultimate, this is the abiltity that got me into designing the champion because the idea of it seemed really cool. Now keep in mind the numbers and scaling are big (Like katarina&#039;s ultimate) so nerfs may come, but if I had to choose 1 ability to keep for this champion it&#039;s this one. So, here i go.....\n\nR: 50 Mana per seond - Toggle: Phonos instantly enters a reality between the void and the real world (While in this reality he is still on summoners rift but everything looks all dark and chaos-like). He instantly becomes \"stealthed\" to everyone (even his own team, however when he is near any champion they will be able to hear his laughter signalling that he is nearby). If he stays behind an enemy champion he will start to form an \"assassination mark\" above their head. If the enemy champion moves too far away from Phonos or he is no longer facing behind them the mark will start to degrade (It takes 6 seconds of total time for the mark to fully develop) When the mark is complete Phonos will enter back into the real world or \"break stealth\" and assassinate his target dealing 250/500/1000 (plus 100% of Ad) in physical damage. Oh and also phonos has to manually \"toggle off\" the ability to be able to use his other abilities and basic attacks, ie he cant use basic attacks and abilties while ulted. \n\nWell that&#039;s it, if you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments :)\n\nEDIT: changed the mana cost of ult from 25 to 50 hopefully that makes it a little less overpowered since he will be draining mana faster and have less left to cast his other abilties :)","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-01T07:32:27.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o dear pls, buff the Q, i mean 40% ad ratio? that makes it worse than a basic attack with certain damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-10-02T02:46:27.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember this was my first time constructing a champion idea and also I left most of the statistic up to Riot, I just wanted to give an overall \"idea\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Senpai Papi","date":"2015-09-16T02:46:10.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a real assassin, cool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Godlikenot","date":"2015-09-15T00:12:07.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd recommend changing some of the scaling things, such as his passive to be maybe bonus ad rather than just flat ad because although the change may seem small a ad oriented champion usually ends up with over 100 natural ad and it is possible and quite easy for people to another 300 on top of that so if every 10 seconds your dealing an automatic 180 bonus damage assuming the attack doesn't crit he would end up being played less like an assassin and possibly more like a skirmisher. \nAnother possible change is that the passive would only build up like Ashe's old passive used to and would only tick up when he isn't attacking to try and force the player into relying more on using that burst of damage in assassinating rather than being able to fight a tank casually.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-13T10:51:53.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ult would either be really OP or super lame. Like, would one Lee Sin Q reveal him and cancel ult? Or is it a different kind of stealth? Can he be CC in Ult?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-13T22:51:08.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea at the moment it's kinda op but remember this is just an idea nothing that would be finalised and yes while he's ulted he cannot be cc'd because he is not technically \"on summoners rift\" but he has vision of it. It's kind of hard to explain it but maybe increasing the mana cost would even things out a bit. I just want riot to see it and maybe take bits of it into there next champion or something like that...","replies":[]}]}]}
