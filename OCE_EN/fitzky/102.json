You play as a ranger in Mordor in the Middle Earth universe along with an Elven spirit which is tied to your body. You basically get to run around exploring Mordor while killing orcs and carving your way through their endless armies. The Elven spirit which accompanies you allows you to perform pretty cool parkour stuns and awesome abilities in battle. You also get to control orcs and build up your own army  which is the best thing about the game imo. I won&#039;t spoil too much for people who haven&#039;t played it. It&#039;s also the sequel to Shadow of Mordor which is the first game, I recommend you play it first if you&#039;re new to the series.","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2018-02-02T01:37:19.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I'm slowly playing through SOW atm. I prefer the mechanics is SOM better so far but I haven't got to the nitty gritty part of the game yet either so perhaps I'm just making the call too early. Definitely would recommend Shadow of Mordor first if you are new to the series, plus it is super cheap to pickup as GOTY edition. I think I got mine for $3 USD.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-02-02T05:28:08.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"SOW for me is pretty much SOM but better, you have all the same mechanics and abilities but a whole new 20+ hours of story plus building up an orc army and conquering forts. The whole army system adds so much fun into the game imo","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-01-31T05:03:49.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, definitely a great game, as is Shadow of Mordor. I really like how the nemesis system has evolved into Shadow of War, and the epic battles you can have as a result of that. Also really like the gear system, and abilities. Great all-around game. Only thing I don't like is the loot boxes, but they're completely optional and aren't necessary for progression, nor do they take too long to attain just by playing.\n\nJust wait until you hit that (end of) act 3 plot twist though, just seemed so unexpected when it happened, but makes sense in retrospect.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-31T07:51:10.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah hold on I'm only up to Act 2 don't spoil me haha, yeah I don't like the loot boxes either but they aren't essential in the game which is ok.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-02-02T03:54:11.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a bit of Shadow or War. It was pretty fun but I just never really managed to get fully into it.
