On his model it shows darius wearing a kind of mask over his mouth so I thought it would be cool to change his VO a bit so his voice sounds kind of distorted and radio-like. If this is indeed a gemstone skin, which is really hard to get, and is probably worth more then a legendary skin, then it shouldn&#039;t be too big of a deal to include something cool like this? Would make the skin 10 times better in my opinion, but regardless you&#039;ve done a good job on it. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-22T06:47:43.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a new wave of skins and still no {{champion:83}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}\n\nbut still this skin makes me wanna take up darius","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-22T23:37:03.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do it.
