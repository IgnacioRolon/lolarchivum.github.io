I never rage (unless rage at opponent) and i forgive all mistakes just not too much :P. I'm objective player so i focus more on taking objectives rather than piling up kill count. I'm pretty decent shotcaller and usually use ping system to do that.\n\nCurrently i'm doing my placement (5W - 3L) but i should be around in silver 4 or 5. I main support (name the champs i make it support) and control/tanky jungle/top. Usually i don't get my main role so its kind of frustrating and i got my pref role in a team. \n\nI'm free in the afternoon and sometimes at night","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-27T23:05:35.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice!
