Thats jungle, adc and support. Now what if riot introduced ultimate skins for a top lane and mid lane champion? Then you could form an ULTIMATE SKIN TEAM.

I would pick Zac. I already made a bid for PROJECT: Zac about half a year ago ( [http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/s4EeVVRE-project-zac](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/s4EeVVRE-project-zac) ) but with the recent addition of Project Skins I think this would be better as Mecha Zac. Click the link for the full description of the skin. \n\nIf you were to pick a mid lane champion I think Azir would be a good champion to pick.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-17T06:39:10.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zacs more popular as a jungler than a top isn't he? (I haven't really seen him played too much but so idk)\nMecha Zac would be awesome as hell but I don't think it'd be ultimate teir\nProbably go for 1350ish RP","replies":[{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-26T11:36:31.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, he is, mainly because of his W.. He's also really good at clearing the jungle especially as his abilities drop health blobs so he doesn't lose too much health clearing camps.

Karthus hasn't had a skin for a long time (team skins dont count according to riot) and this theme could fit along with Pulsefire Ezreal I guess.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-17T11:35:38.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a rengar main I'm disappointed at the fact that he only has 2 skins, THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER RENGAR SKIN.
