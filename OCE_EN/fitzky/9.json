Everything is already as bad as it is, you have a miss fortune in the jungle &quot;experimenting&quot;, a zed whose dying every 3 minutes and a garen top saying gg constantly because he&#039;s against a tank veigar. Theres not much hope left, but amidst all the crying and complaining, and as much as it angers you; you stop, take a breath, and think. They have a shaco jungle, tell your support to buy a pink, ward up tri bush. Make sure you ward bot bushes yourself so fiddle doesn&#039;t try any surprise ults on you. Tell your zed to ignore all the &quot;noob zed&quot; remarks from the enemy team and hug turret, tell your mf to camp bot side jungle. Stay under turret yourself and keep farming, ashe and fiddle have both recalled and shaco is top, this is your chance to take their turret. Keep on pushing, team has called for a surrender, but don&#039;t give up, not now. Rotate mid, take farm and turret, enemy team is grouping, group fight fails, but don&#039;t lose hope, we still have a chance. Just a few more items, with good peel you can kill them; we lose the team fights but we can outnumber them, pick them off. Time is ticking, death timers are rising, we&#039;ve held out for so long, 1 minute until their back up, this is it, take baron, take towers, we have their inhibitors. 3 inhibitors down, 3 lanes of baron empowered minions, it&#039;s over, gg.\r\n\r\nJust like my team wouldn&#039;t give up trying to surrender I didn&#039;t give up trying to win, I knew from the 20 minute mark we were capable of making a comeback. It only took one person to put their hope into me hoping I was right and I was. 50 minutes of what most would spend flaming others and complaining, I spent thinking and strategizing. The game could have ended at 20 minutes, a complete loss, but instead it ended at 50 mintues, a proud victory.  It took a lot more effort, but in the end I got 4 happy and relieved teammates. \r\n\r\nNever Give Up, Never Surrender","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-10T07:54:38.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather lose than sit in a 50 minute+ game, what a bore.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-07-10T08:17:14.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you just like to throw LP away like that?

I&#x27;d be surprised if you manage to climb at all\n\nI'm not going to AFK when a game hits 50 minutes, but if the match is obviously one-sided then it's wiser to just forfeit and and try a new match. However, if I know our team scales better then I'll brave through the mid-game and try and get a healthy late game.\n\nThis match, for example: http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/139834955/201943586?tab=overview\n\nWe got destroyed early game and mid-game, but our late was 100% better. You can see the gold difference and how it changes once late-game comes. All I had to do late was toss myself at Vel'Koz and 100/0 him and we won teamfights. 9/10 I hit Sivir with a flash ult and two of them were either low or one died. If our comp wasn't what it was, I would have FF'd at 20 because the match was done. I couldn't even farm early game without Vel chunking me (160 ping).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-10T07:32:41.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a 70-minute game that we brought back when we could've surrendered, but by that point no-one cared what happened, whether we lost or won was of no concern to anyone on either team, we kept taunting the other team to surrender, the same they did to us. I could've gained more LP from just surrendering early and moving on to the next 2 games. \n\nPeople who never EVER surrender are just as bad as people who always surrender and don't even try to mount a comeback. Sometimes a game is unwinnable, and those extra 7 minutes I could spend in queue definitely help me. And I'm not saying games where we could end if they threw, or at least get closer to it, I mean when we don't have a single dragon, they have a really fed carry like Yi that also can't be picked off, they have all our inhibs, our Nexus is exposed, and we haven't taken a single one of their towers, might be time to call it quits.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-07-10T08:19:20.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd still keep playing because I know we can win, I won't just throw away LP like that.
