I notice it has a small update, probably nothing much, I open up my browser and do my internet things ( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;). I soon hear the sound of the update finishing and the launch button appears before me. I click it. I says yes, then yes again. I log in, while gazing at the sexy man on-screen ( ͡&deg; ͜ʖ ͡&deg;). I am then brought to the main screen where I then click play to begin my league journey for the day. But. Something greets me. Big bold yellow letters gazing into my eyes as I read these magnificent words clearly. Then I realise. I prepare my anus for what&#039;s to come....\r\n\r\nUltra Rapid Fire, it&#039;s finally here....\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/vJZobBM","replies":[{"poster":"Wordmustard","date":"2016-04-22T16:12:06.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why dont i see urf!","replies":[{"poster":"PineappleReject","date":"2016-04-22T16:39:41.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk if this guys trolling, but URF actually isnt appearing in my client!!!
