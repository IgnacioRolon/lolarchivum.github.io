This just goes to show you&#039;re scared, a bunch of cowards who can&#039;t face reality. You know your game is going to shit and more and more people are fed up, and yet all you continue to do is spend more of your time creating cinematics to get $$$$$. You think you&#039;re the most popular gaming company in the world, you think everyone loves League of Legends, you think you&#039;re raining in cash like a bunch of fat greedy pigs. You&#039;re none of that, you&#039;re a disgrace, and so is this game. I&#039;m not a toxic asshole trying to ruin everything for the sake of trolling. I&#039;m a person who is fed up and disappointed that my once favourite game has turned into a steaming pile of shit run by lazy worthless money grabbing imbeciles. I&#039;ve had enough, for real. Unless this game manages to make a complete DRAMATIC turn around I&#039;m not playing your game. I&#039;m not touching League of Legends. It can sit alone in its little folder for months or years until this game actually becomes fun again and is run by actual proper genuine people. Have fun Riot games, running the most popular and toxic video game in the world.\r\n\r\nYou can delete my post, but you can&#039;t delete the truth, it stays there forever, until something is done about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-02-06T05:32:43.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some of my posts have been removed as well.
