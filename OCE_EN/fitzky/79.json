Yasuo, Yi, Kalista, Lee, etc, all snowball well in the right hands and have relatively fine early games, but this stays consistent with many other champions. \n\nNerfing relatively balanced yet popular champions is never smart, if they are popular people will become more experienced in the art of counterplay and while these fun champions are nerfed the 'sleeper OPs' will simply supersede them. \n\nThink Diana, Darius, Volibear, Ryze.\n\nSlightly off topic, but Riot is also quite stupid when it comes to item changes and champion reworks. \nFor example, they metamorphised Gragas from an AP burster to an AP bruiser with the justification that it is more fitting for an ugly corpulent drunkard  to be more tanky than damage based. \n\nIn terms of item changes, Riot is quite stupid in that they nerfed ryalais with the justification that it should not be a key item for APs which do not have DOT effects, I suppose they should extend that logic and nerf death cap so it better synergises with champions which 100-0 rather than play the war of attrition (Ziggs), oh wait they did play that game of creating specific items per champion but then they removed DFG.\n\nWhen will Riot gain even a modicum of sanity in the game changes they implement?","replies":[]}]}
