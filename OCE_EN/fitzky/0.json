Now I know you tried to fix the problem in ranked matches with the &quot;role selectors&quot; which honestly was the right way to go, but for people who play norms the majority of the time having to deal with this utter mess of team management is frustrating. I find myself every time I queue up to play I have my fingers on &quot;top&quot; ready to race against the other players to type in chat as fast as I can and we run into all these issues such as buggy chats with people arguing over who called the lane first and people who just instalock a lane because they can&#039;t be bothered trying to &quot;call their lane&quot;. Ever since you released the role selector for ranked matches it feels like you left all the norms players in the dirt having to continue to put up with this horrible system. So I ask you, why do we need to have blind pick in the first place? Why can we not just have draft mode for both ranked and normal? I have never liked or enjoyed blind pick but I need to practise my champs a lot for when I play ranked so I have to pray whenever I queue up that I manage to call my lane otherwise I&#039;m wasting 30 minutes of my time, because that&#039;s the only reason I play. And yes, I would queue up and wait 10-15 minutes if it guarantees that I get my lane, I honestly couldn&#039;t care about queue times as long as I don&#039;t have to start arguing with my team before the game even starts.\r\n\r\nPlease hear me out Riot this is a serious issue that I&#039;ve discussed quite a bit with the community of people who are fed up with this unhealthy system :(","replies":[{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T15:24:55.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would also allow the client to accurately analyze your data for rank etc for supports that are also laners, off roles for the champin top or jg (cs, wards etc) Lux support vs lane, voli lane vs jg, etc etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2016-12-10T15:21:55.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In one of the latest patch notes, I suggested (admittedly in probably the wrong spot) that when the champ select pops up, it shows a lane assignment map similar to the ranked display that allows to to select the role you want.

You say you like to practice your lane in norms for ranked. If this is the case then you would get good practice from trying out other roles as well, even if that means you have to support a few times. Even if you play ranked you're not guaranteed one of your two preferred roles so you might as well try and perfect them all.\n\nOh and they're not going to bring Normal Draft back since they're removing it from all regions.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-09T01:34:46.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure the majority of the community is over autofill so it's unlikely Riot are gonna keep using it.
