I understand that, however you can&#039;t just make a change to role selecting like that &quot;because of high elo&quot; and not expect low elo to be affected. Do Riot understand that high and low elo are that significantly different? I was often told that to climb out of low elo &quot;you should focus on two roles&quot; yet now I&#039;m forced to play every role including the ones I don&#039;t enjoy? No League is not about &quot;learning and playing all roles&quot; League is about having fun, even in ranked I play semi-competitively, I play seriously to win but I still want to have fun. Unfortunately I don&#039;t have fun playing support, support can be left to those who enjoy playing it but god forbid don&#039;t force me into it. Listen Riot you got a problem with high elo queue times? Take a look at this -----&gt; Autofilled enabled in Diamond+\r\n\r\nIf you see or have anything wrong with that idea please, feel free to let me know in the comments, I&#039;m curious if anyone else can solve such a simplistic problem.\r\n\r\nJust a side note, yes, I would rather wait 10+ minutes to get my roles then play support :)","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-12T01:46:10.850+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then\nThan\nPlease know the difference.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-01-12T02:20:34.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty sure everyone on the boards gives 0 shits about grammar","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-12T04:06:21.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=yfAXRr7N,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-01-12T02:20:34.097+0000)\n>\n> Pretty sure everyone on the boards gives 0 shits about grammar\n\nLol.

Autofill is turned on anywhere there isn't a high enough population of x role. Low elo experiences enormous queue times as well when autofill is not enabled, for the simple reason that most people only know how to play 1-2 roles, and since supp/jng are not popular roles, there are very few people who want to queue as/play as them.\n\nHigh elo struggles without autofill because there isn't a high enough population period. Low elo struggles because there are specific role deficits.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-01-11T12:01:15.352+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then explain to me, while a support main (Myself) gets auto filled to MID or ADC (My two worse roles)\nWhen I Q up as a support / top?\n\nI once even had a game where I got mid, autofilled.\nAnd the support was auto filled, while I q'ed as a support.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-11T12:28:38.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Das some janky as stuff then.

The 3-6 minutes is essentially ensuring match quality, i.e matching your mmr with your team and your enemy as closely as possible. \n\nYou are filling that void, so you get essentially the \"minimum\" queue time, but there are still the constraints of match quality for the system to consider. It has to come up with 10 players who's positions all line up (or failing that autofill some) who are also within x MMR of each other. Hence the wait.\n\nI have heard a couple complaints about some weird autofill stuff like you describe but usually it came down to the perfect combination of role selection and timing or a misunderstanding of the situation. You'd expect it to fuck up every once in a blue moon but not often (and certainly not often for a single player), so if it happens a lot I'd like to take a deeper look.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-01-12T01:22:05.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, I want to look into this and see if something is going wrong when this happens.\n\nAre you able to identify which game this occurred in?","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2017-01-12T01:54:59.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The most recent one, is the syndra game in my match history.\nI believe that was a FLEX game.\nI Q'ed as Support - Fill.\nI think the amumu game was the same.

Putting in your sense when you state that league is all about \"Learning and playing all roles\" actually does help you improve in league. Roles tie into other roles -> example can be when you play support you need to have good timing, positioning, map awareness etc. Map wareness is generally needed, positioning can be taken anywhere and good timing as well. Learning all roles actually give you an advantage and you become  more flexible.\n5) Playing support doesnt mean actually playing a champ that is categorized as support. I've literally thrown riven down in bot lane,ahri,brand,lissandra etc (cass in bot lane was surprisingly op lol) when i got support and heck that was funny (we also won). Support can be defined as anything or if not just like the other roles.
