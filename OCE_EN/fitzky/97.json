Even if the ban had nothing to do with his playstyle and it was the fact that he was leaving his adc to 1v2 Riot you forget that its still all within the &quot;meta&quot;. Is a support really suppose to be supporting the adc or the team as a whole? From what I see he&#039;s clearly giving his jgler and toplane a lead and putting the enemy behind which probably explains why he actually has a positive winrate and actually MANAGED TO CLIMB TO PLAT. He provides evidence that he communicates to his team before every game what he&#039;s going to do and as farfetched as a lot of random ass strategies, his has been proven to work. You forget that your company itself has the rule &quot;Don&#039;t ban summoners for not enforcing the meta&quot; you silly cucks now you know how much you&#039;ve screwed up. I hope you feel ashamed of what you&#039;ve done because this is ridiculous and I actually feel sorry for this poor guy. He was positive to his teammates, he communicated effectively, he was nice, so why do you have to suspend someone for playing the damn game?

If riot followed their own rules, the people who would be receiving punishments would be the people who reported this singed.\n\nSecondly, this singed actually has evidence that he always communicates with his team and only plays singed support if his team agrees to it.\n\nHe isn't breaking any rules, he's actually being extremely nice about it and communicating with his team, and he managed to climb to platinum with this so called 'off-meta' pick. He is in no wrong, and Riot definitely should not be banning him.","replies":[{"poster":"DwarfGoo","date":"2016-11-17T11:23:18.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been talked about a lot.

Meta pickers need to be a bit more understanding and play around meta breakers a bit more. BUT meta breakers need to also at least sometimes be flexible and be a team player. \n\nIMO in this case he was just declaring what he was doing and picking it regardless of what was said after his copy paste (although in Riots response thread it sounds like hes getting better!).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-17T13:32:41.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">His singed support is ~40% win rate\n\nThere is no proof to what his win rate is as any singed lane.\n\nAlso his only \"change\" is taking exhaust instead of smite.\n\nThis is not a good compromise, and this is what they are saying is an \"improvement\"\n\nTo me this \"improvement\" is him being the bitch in the scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-11-17T13:54:48.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gpgqpAKB,comment-id=000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-11-17T13:32:41.827+0000)\n>\n> There is no proof to what his win rate is as any singed lane.\n> \n> Also his only &quot;change&quot; is taking exhaust instead of smite.\n> \n> This is not a good compromise, and this is what they are saying is an &quot;improvement&quot;\n> \n> To me this &quot;improvement&quot; is him being the bitch in the scenario.\n\nGotta conform strictly to what the meta is!!!! or else Riots gonna ban you.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-17T23:53:10.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well I feel alot of the community is too focused on what is 'meta' or what the pros do, it really bothers me since I feel there are some real hidden gem builds and stuff out there like the discovery of tank fizz and tank ekko. I personally had alot of fun playing my own special variation tank shaco build (rip strength of ages you will be missed) since I felt it was both more reliable and more team oriented than full ap or ad shaco and was definitely not what you'd expect and had a very tank ekkoish feel to him. That said even though I can't entirely agree, I don't think you should be playing support if all you are going to do as singed is counterjungle, but I don't think banning the singed main was fair either.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-11-16T11:45:15.998+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"lol, i think they're banning him because they think he's trolling, but i don't think Riot even knows that trolling is, because if they do, than this wouldn't be happening, thats like banning someone who mains Bard and does the same thing but it's fine because he's Bard and that's his play style.

The issue is that he continued to use that strategy in situations where even the vast majority of his team (4 players) were directly opposed to it, which is *exactly* what defines a \"troll\".","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-17T23:01:38.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dude no offence you're actually annoying..

They have an above average win rate, so why is that against the rules?\n\nSimply put, it ruins the experience, which is exactly the issue with players like this \"support\" singed. They don't care about actually being part of a team, all they care about is what *they* can do and the enjoyment *they* get from the game, never mind the 4-9 other players in any given match. They simply don't care about anyone but themselves and they justify it with \"above average win-rates\".\n\nYou get someone announcing \"mid or feed\" in champ select, you put it down to them being a troll. How is this really that different? This player was simply announcing their intentions to perform a particular strategy and that they were going to continue with it regardless of how the *team* felt about it. If that's not trolling, then you have no right to complain about *any* \"strategy\" they players might employ to get their way, which includes the \"mid or feed\" bullsh!t that certain trolls might do.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Worrior697","date":"2016-11-19T03:44:26.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support.
