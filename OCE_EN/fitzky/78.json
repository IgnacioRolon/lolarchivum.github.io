This has happened to me countless times and has cost me my life on many occasions (yes one stack of bleed can make a huge difference). And no this is not me miss-clicking because it has happened far too often, so I would be grateful if Riot could take a look into this please.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8UEjTz3\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8UEjTz3.gifv\n\n(sorry gif doesn't seem to be working)","replies":[{"poster":"nochillgamer","date":"2016-11-29T10:33:34.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure that you aren't using any form of attack move?
