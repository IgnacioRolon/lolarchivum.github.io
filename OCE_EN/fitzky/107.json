I was playing a ranked game as teemo top and unaware of my internets current state I entered the game with 200 ping. So I tried my hardest to cope with it but it got to the point where I was disconnecting constantly. I tried to inform my team of the problem but of course they were so &quot;concentrated&quot; in the game apparently none of them saw the clear &quot;An ally has disconnected&quot; call about 10 times. So it&#039;s around 30 minutes and I&#039;m 0/7 trying my hardest to do something useful by defending top lane since the inhibitor was down and suddenly I see my team is in danger around the edge of the base around top so I run quickly over and set down a few shrooms behind them to cut them off. I was hoping they would try and run since more of my team was coming and they would eventually run into my shrooms and my team would get them. But of course a 7/1 garen had no problem tanking right through and decimating me with his ult.\r\n\r\nThis is the point when suddenly my team wakes up and realises what my score is and the verbal harassment starts. Of course I was accused of feeding and the entire team goes full out trying to get 9 bans on me because they are sick of trolls. The next 10 minutes of the game was probably the worst and most verbal harassment I have ever received. It got to the point where the enemy team was in on it too, so I&#039;ve got 9 people giving me absolute sh*t that I just could not possibly try to channel out.  I&#039;m trying to tell them that they can&#039;t ban me for something I haven&#039;t done and Riot won&#039;t issue the ban but the only answer I got was &quot;shutup fckwit&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo I just officially just had the worst game of my life. Yes I have had tons of games where I have lagged. I&#039;ve had games where I was 0/13. But this was just living hell. Could I have just muted them? Yes I could have done that and continued to try and make do with horrible ping but I didn&#039;t. Simply because it made me realise just how cruel and stupid people who play this game are.  Here&#039;s me trying to be the nicest person and calmly trying to explain what was happening but all I get are ignorant d*ckheads who care for nothing but seeing the word Victory next to there stats on the end of game screen. I did nothing to make them angry, I presented myself as a positive player but I get treated as low as a hacker or troll. You know what I think? This community needs to grow up. This game wasn&#039;t made for 12 year olds, it was made for sensible mature people to enjoy themselves and have fun. You can call this a rant or rage or whatever but I&#039;m just giving out my opinion on the current state of this trash of a community. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve honestly ever seen it good in the 2 years I&#039;ve been playing. I might just have to move on, which is something I really don&#039;t want to do since league has become a big part of my life. But if it starts to become more than that, a depressing issue, then I will have to hit the uninstall button......","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-01-14T09:52:50.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I posted a week ago about how league is becoming too aggressive due to peoples opinions that league is nothing but a competitive game.\nI think its one of the main problems league is causing for itself, and not a community based issue.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/Pge3fsuR-league-is-becoming-too-competitive-for-the-broader-community","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-12T22:31:48.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it really sucks when you met people who don't understand:( Honestly I have had loads of games in the past where I got into a game with over 500 ping and then I just felt totally terrible because 1. I was making my teammates lose a game and 2. 500 ping does not equal fun...and of course a load of people who called me an idiot and blah blah blah, a whole load of things I didn't really listen to coz it's just not worth it. As you said the mute button is there for a reason, if you're lagging and your teammates don't really communicate about strategy or communicate at all, just use it. The thing that honestly helped me a lot with lag is to always check ping in a mini custom game, it's worth it when you find yourself with 1000 and be like, phew I'm glad i didnt go into a game like that!\n\nTo be completely and utterly honest, one of the things that helps with verbal harrassment is...just don't play Teemo. People tend to be 1000x more toxic against Teemos than...say Namis for some reason-.-.\n\nKeep in mind though, not all of the community are like this, a lot of people are REALLY NICE:) Just keep playing the game, check for lag in customs and try to enjoy it!:D Remind people from time to time that this is a 'game', everyone has bad days from time to time and there's no need to rage just because satan is on your team(sorry Teemo but it's true..) :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-13T09:39:43.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really cuz every game I enter there's always 1 guy raging","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-01-13T02:26:04.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is bad that other people are over toxic but on your behalf, it is advisable to start a day by playing co-op vs Ai before playing normals or ranked. Your are too selfish to even start a game in such high pings. I always start a bots game csing for 10 mins before playing with humans as I will fill so bad about myself if I am the one who lets the team down because of my bad internet or poor form etc....
