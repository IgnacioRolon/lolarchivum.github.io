It&#039;s like they&#039;re implying that your feeding on purpose and you&#039;re not even trying. Ok I lost lane, I got camped, I&#039;m trying to play safe and farm up, I&#039;ve built resistance. Can&#039;t you see I&#039;m doing everything I can to NOT die? But because I&#039;m 0/3 I&#039;m suddenly told to &quot;stop feeding&quot; like &quot;oh ok sorry I didn&#039;t realise, I&#039;ll stop playing around now and try to win this&quot;.\r\n\r\nHow often have you been told this?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-24T20:55:38.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im so happy for you that you've never had an actual feeder on your team. i think \"please stop feeding\" is one of the best things you can say to someone whos dying too frequently. those 3 words are so effective at getting the exact response, reaction, or information you need to determine the context of why that person is dying so frequently. but the best part of this is, its a wake-up call. its a pull-yer-head-in-m8, and its exactly what people need to help them improve\n\nit seems like you're not be willing to accept criticism or your online mindset is too cynical, and your ego supercedes your judgement, depending on if you're a troll or not. you shouldnt be offended by it, you can always just read it and interpret it in your head as \"this person is kindly asking me to focus and play better\", because sometimes thats probably what they mean, especially if it comes from me\n\ni dont think you should take the statement so seriously. its much more effective than \"Hello Fitzky! How are you today? It has become quite apparent to myself, a fellow teammate of yours in this game of League Of Legends, that you have not had the strongest of starts to this game. May I perhaps, ever so begrudgingly, suggest, that you perhaps cease this dilly-dally of yours so that we can work together and defeat our common enemies in a much easier fashion, for it was my desire from the start of this game, to actually win\"\n\nby someone else saying please stop feeding, you can at least find out whats going on, without having seen how they died. if you get a response like \"fuck u im beta than u kys\" you'll know its a troll, the game is lost, and you should try to put it behind you and lose any emotional investment into the game, and hope that your potentially selfish teammates will surrender at 20 and not drag it on, letting your enemies farm in every corner of the jungle, toying with them, giving them hope that theres a chance, but there isnt\n\nif you get a response like \"i got tower dived 3 times, and another time i ran from outer to inner turret and got solo'd by the mid laner who cut me off and killed me\" then you'll know the person has gone to the effort to tell you why they've died so much and hopefully if they know they can do better they'll apologise to the team and try to play smarter.\n\nif you dont get a response at all, he couldve already broken his keyboard and his enter key, or hes chat restricted cos hes a toxic troll, and he might actually be intentionally feeding to speed up the game so theres a bigger incentive for people to surrender\n\n>Can't you see I'm doing everything I can to NOT die\n\nno, this statement is just false, and its another big reason to remind people to pull their head in and focus. you're obviously NOT doing \"everything\" you can to not die. you're doing everything you can to either farm, get ahead, trade effectively, save up your wards, or something similar like that. if your main focus, if your main and biggest priority, was not dying, then by the magic of your mouse and keyboard everyone is physically capable of moving their champion out of harms way. there are no ganks in lower-than-diamond-oce that are impossible to outplay. if you dont agree or understand, then you can expect to hear that statement more, especially from me","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-25T02:21:10.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seriously just wasted 10 minutes of you life writing this bullshit that I'm not gonna read.
