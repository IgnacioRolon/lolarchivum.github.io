Since most ADCs play the same and a good ADC should be able to play any of the 15~ adcs with little extra practice and a slight change of playstyle. For top lane tho the champ pool is massive, also encompasses most junglers and most mid laners as well, making the role very flexable. This makes making many videos about roles with very specific mechanics like ADC, jug and support sooooo much easier than trying to making lots for mid and top.\n\nDyrus doesn't do guides.\n\nGbay is a 1trick.\n\nThe best thing is to find videos on your champs you want to play top from a variety of youtubers. I recommend looking up scrapcomputer's channel to see if he has done the champ you are looking for since his guides are very detailed.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-01T06:24:25.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you this was the reply I was looking for!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-07-31T03:05:30.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BoxBox","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-07-31T03:18:38.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't play riven","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-07-31T06:38:54.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red mercy ?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pingcobra","date":"2016-07-31T04:23:17.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dyrus is my 3rd favourite","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-07-31T03:28:22.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno, I hear UberDanger does some insightful stuff like once a year.
