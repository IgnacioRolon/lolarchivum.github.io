How do you beat a Vayne top building frozen mallet? I legit picked mundo and rushed thornmail + Sunfire Cape and both me and the jungler were unable to do anything except both die constantly trying to gank her. Since everyone in the game just decided to call me &quot;trash&quot; and a &quot;monkey&quot; I&#039;m taking it to the boards to ask on how to beat this.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-02T08:32:21.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Don't build Thornmail, build Frozen Heart (AS slowing Aura)\n2. Get the whole team to hard focus the vayne\n3. Buy pinks/get an upgraded Sweeper","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-02T10:44:34.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frozen heart hmmm, I'll take that into consideration","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-10-02T10:15:25.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Max Cleavers, call for help, get boots asap, continue buy some health and armour because early on Vayne will be dealing more physical damage than true damage. This is especially true at level 6. Use your cleavers to either last hit creeps or harass vayne given the opportunity. \n\nVayne might be mobile but she is vulnerable to ganks especially if the jungler/toplaner has ranged CC.
