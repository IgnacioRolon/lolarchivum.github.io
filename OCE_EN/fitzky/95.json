Is this how League is now? Is there just no point in adc anymore since tanks seem to be the better option? Should we just all play tanks now? Look who did the least damage as well, the full ap veigar....","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-04-11T01:59:37.577+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If tanks were so strong, pro-players would have abandoned the adc concept a looooooong time ago. the problem with tanks is that lower elo players (such as you and I) can't deal with them as efficiently. We simply don't have the mechanical, micro-play skills required to kite them out and position correctly to take full advantage of our possible damage output.\n\nI see where you're coming from though: a 'tank' is meant to be a front-line wall that soaks up damage and crowd control for their teammates. They're meant to draw aggro off of their carries. Unfortunately, in a game where half of all damage is coming from point-and-click commands, rather than skillshots that can be blocked, this means that in order to draw aggro, the tank has to pose some form of threat, and the easiest way to do so is by having a high damage threat. Hence, we are left with the tank class. Busted in low elo, and manageable in high.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-04-11T02:40:50.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except the ridiculous tank in this scenario was Hecarim which is pretty much impossible to kite or escape from for an adc. He was running ghost as well and by the time he was in sight he had already E'd onto me and did half my health from that. Not very much counter play I would say...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2017-04-08T04:03:16.553+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tanks just don't tank anymore, they just do a shit load of damage, its just how it is. I can build full armour on pretty much anyone and still destroy a full AD crit whatever Yasuo or anything, in a 1 v 1. I personally would love a tank champ that had no damage at all, just like an 8000 HP bar and then just build MR and AR. That would be the dream.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-04-11T02:12:22.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the problem is that tanks are building tank items and still dealing out insane amounts of damage whilst being hard to kill.\n\nEither you build tank and sacrifice damage or build damage and sacrifice tank.
