Then they proceeds to roam around, sell all there items and buy 6 dorans rings, or just afk because apparently it&#039;s just normals it&#039;s not gonna affect their league in any way. Yeah well your affecting a lot of people like me who actually care and TRY to win. How am I suppose to get good for Ranked if every game it&#039;s just &quot;let&#039;s have some fun and f*ck around&quot;.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-01-06T08:28:38.673+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now, I have to disagree but, that being said, I do think you make some valid points. The 'line' you aren't supposed to cross is drawn differently in norms than it is in ranked. In ranked, playing an off meta champ or trying Annie jungle is reportable and punishable, whereas in normals it is not. The distinction in normals lies in their intention. Are they playing Annie jungle because they are legitimately curious and want to try it out? Who plays a champ in a new role well the first time? If they don't do so well, it doesn't mean they're trolling. OR are they playing Annie jungle because they're some moron who feels the need to mess with 9 other people and ruin their leisure time?\n\nI don't think there should be a problem with off meta champions or champions in weird roles or trying out new builds etc etc. I don't think there should be a problem with say, ultimate bravery, so long as they care to tell you in select. It is exactly why there is a distinction between Ranked and norms in the first place. Saying people should take norms as seriously as ranked is an incredibly narrow view. Most people don't play this game to win, they play to have fun. Now generally speaking winning is fun, but that doesn't mean winning is always fun, and it doesn't mean losing can't be fun.\n\nDenying people their fun is just as unfair as someone trolling you in ranked and losing you the game. It's an utterly ruined experience in either case. I understand your desire to practice champs, and I think perhaps it could be beneficial to introduce a limited time 'practice mode' kinda like they do with TT for ranked-level serious games that aren't actually ranked, with the same social rules as ranked applying, that said, such a mode does not exist. \n\nYou don't get to dictate how they have fun with League anymore than they do you, so instead of looking at is as \"Now I can't practice this champ\" instead try to see it as \"okay well this is just a fun times game I'll practice next time\". A majority of people still play to the meta, even in norms, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding games to practice in, and you should take the others as a break from the pressure instead of a punishment. And if someone is legitimately trolling/feeding/afking etc. then it's just as reportable in norms as it is in ranked and you should do so. It being norms doesn't magically make that behaviour OK.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-06T04:23:54.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I feel ya...these people are especially affecting people like me who aren't lvl30 yet so the only thing we CAN play is normals(or bots...but that is so boring IMO) and want to WIN. I had a game where sivir went mid even tho I called first, and when I asked her to return bot she was like, 'no calm down it's only normals try duo mid' and I didnt argue coz it would probably turn into an argument which would be extremely distracting. She proceded to build full ap(with mejais, which did not help since she died so much) and went something like 2/16/1...:(\n\nGuys PLEASE play normals the way you would ranked(no ranked trolls this does not apply to u...), properly and with a mindset of I WANT TO WIN, not 'whatevs its just normals lets mess around like a complete idiot and throw the game coz that will totally not affect your teammates in any way...'
