I even went into a game where it was just me and one other teammate who DIDN&#039;T have thunderlords. I know this is sounding pointless but in a game where we want diversity having everyone constantly using the same mastery every match is a little absurd. Maybe thunderlords needs a little tweaking perhaps?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-30T21:37:59.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you should get on the bandwagon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-30T14:38:49.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" Riot has already addressed the issue, You just need to open your eyes and red.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-12-31T01:16:48.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Link?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-31T23:59:55.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pbe 1/2 the na posts, 1/3 the euw boards, its been addressed, it is seriously not hard to go and look\n\nand if you really need it, i'll give you a preview on the mastery fixes to balance them with thunderlord\n\nWarlords Bloodlust: Heal increased to 10-25% of critical damage to champions and grants 30% attackspeed\n\nFervor of Battle: Stacks ~~14~~ 12 damage per basic attack maxing at 8, stacks are doubled on melee champions, spells that hit an enemy champion grant 2 stacks (2 sec cd)\n\nDeathfire Grasp: 60% bonus attack damage and 25% ability power\n\nStorm Raider: 2.5 seconds to deal ~~25%~~ 30 max health for a 3 second 40% movespeed buff with a ~~100%~~ 75% slow resist for the duration. \n\nBond of Stone: Damage reduction increased to 4%\n\nStrength of the Ages: health granted from killing monsters is doubled, and the heal is increased to 6% max hp from 100 flat\n\n~~strike through is to represent the parts nerfed after their buffs because they were too op~~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2015-12-30T14:34:27.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO WHAT!?
