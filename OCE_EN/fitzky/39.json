Played a match where I was mid as Zed vs a Katarina and once I reached lvl 3 and had my w,e,q combo I could almost kill her because I would do about 60% dmg with the combo then thunderlords would come in and boom she&#039;s been hit with almost 90% of her health in dmg. This wasn&#039;t just early game it continued through mid game where it finally fell out a bit at late game. So the thing is, thunderlords right now is doing a bit too much dmg to squishy champs consistently and is pressuring their lanning phase too hard. I propose the early scaling&#039;s on thunderlords get nerfed a bit to better balance out lanning phases between assassins and mages.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-03T10:52:54.731+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"check the mastery in game, it has been nerfed\n\n20>30 sec cd\n\nthe 30% damage scaling seems to have been reduced also possibly to 20-15% for ad not sure on ap.\n\nrip t lords decree, rito plz.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-03T10:57:24.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito doesnt update the in game tips. so thats still 30 sec and 20% bonus ad scaling for the in game tool tip.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-03T11:41:08.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":" seems to balance out that early game dam everyone complains so much about,i mean if your getting hit 3 times every 20 seconds maybe you should assess your play style {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-04T13:08:06.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's called trading, even pro's trade about as often.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-03T11:53:19.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"assess*","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-03T05:58:49.524+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thunderlord's is fine.

To be fair... thunderlords might not be \"OP\" but compared to all the other masteries it kinda is... I'll give you an example:\nSay you were playing Sivir and you were doing pretty well and you got your Essence Reaver at around 14 mins and you had a dorans blade. Well you now have around 157 AD so about 80 bonus AD, you are also level 9 that means thunderlords would be able to do 90 + 24 = 114 dmg on your third attack or spell.. that might not sound like much ... and sure its not a huge amount but when you think about the other masteries... that you should have taken as an ADC well, blood lust doesn't really do any extra dmg, just heals you and gives you extra attack speed.. which does increase your damage out put from 120 DPS to 145 DPS .. but that is only an extra 25 DPS.. so long as you actually crit.. every 4 seconds to keep the affect going. As for fervor, well even at max stacks.. which isn't very likely at all, especially at level 9, you can only do up to an extra 40 damage per hit... So after all that.. when you are sitting there in lane and you get hit with a Sivir Q and a couple of autos and she just did an extra 40 dmg from fervor and now has 4 stacks.. do do another 20 extra dmg if she even can hit you .. or say she took the bloodlust... and just crit you well now she can attack just that little bit faster.. but after all that initial dmg .. you are just running away so her extra attack speed doesn't even matter ... but taking thunder lords... she has just done and extra 114 dmg!! ... see how it works... thunderlords is super powerful not because it does a lot of dmg but because it does like 3 times as much damage as the other masteries. .. so why would you take the others when you can have thunderlords.. So I agree with you.. because I could be bothered to put in the time to work things out and not just.. come up with some salty reply that makes you sound dumb and ignorant.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-03T10:58:47.601+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me give you an example.

Obvious exceptions are those that take warlords. But it is rather funnelling the majority of people to take the full cunning tree instead of the other two. \n\nProbably the biggest factor for me is that it's almost invisible power for the most part since it feels like its hard to judge how many stacks you have on you till BAM you're struck by it.
