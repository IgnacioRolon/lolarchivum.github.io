Since this had really never happened before I went and played another game hoping the issue wouldn&#039;t occur again, bad luck it did so that was 2 games total I dc&#039;d. At this point I was mad and decide not to play league so I waited about 3 hours and the internet didn&#039;t disconnect so I thought &quot;ok maybe the internet service has resolved the issue&quot; WELLL BAD LUCK FOR ME STRAIGHT INTO ANOTHER GAME AND BOOM INTERNET DISCONNECTED. If you think thats the end of it well around it was about 10 pm and no disconnects in the last 5 hours so I figured everything was alright and tried a game AND MY COMPUTER TURNED ITSELF OFF. GG I GOT A LEAVEBUSTER","replies":[{"poster":"A Nocturne","date":"2015-09-14T12:16:35.198+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should have played a custom game to test first. \nLeaverbuster smashes leavers. And you did indeed leave THREE games.\n\n\nThe facts are:\nYou AFK'd for THREE games. It may be entirely not your fault, but the act is done.\nYou essentially made 16 people miserable (left 4x3 teamates)\nYou should still be punished.\n\nIf we went by your logic, I can go get drunk and do something stupidly illegal, then blame the alcohol. \nLet's say I killed sixteen people.\nCan I just blame the alcohol and get off scot-free? Will those people come back to life? No.\nObviously this example is of a significantly greater magnitude than your act, but the same principles should apply.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-14T11:54:36.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its just the system you know how you get a afk in 2 out of 5 games well if they got rid or this system then your gona have a afk in 4  of 5 games  so its sad and all and its happened to me but if they get rid of this then then we wont play a game without a afk and don't try to say but there are afk in every game because there is not I get in so many games and don't get a afk","replies":[]}]}
