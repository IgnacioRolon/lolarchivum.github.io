So I send in a support ticket along with a little poem asking nicely and the response I get is &quot;Sorry, I can&#039;t give you anything for free&quot;. Excuse my language but are you fucking serious? I knew Riot was uptight about their money but this is ridiculous. You earn tons a day and I can&#039;t get a little extra RP? Come on Riot, please give me the RP, I won&#039;t ask again....","replies":[{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2016-02-05T10:15:19.772+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's already 70% off so ur basically asking for a further discount. lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-06T04:12:17.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got 5RP for a 2 minute {{champion:55}} drawing.\n[](http://i.imgur.com/2DqOXUz.png)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2016-02-06T01:18:56.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though it might sound ridiculous, 63 RP is pushing it a bit- out of my years of scrolling through boards and FAQ's, I don't think I've seen anybody get more than 45 RP from Riot.\n\nHowever, with that said, maybe you could go for the extra mile and draw a league-related picture, or write a creative short story that might enthrall the Riot support desk. Logically, unless they were cold-blooded, Riot probably wouldn't dismiss a fan-made art which was created through hours and hours of time and dedication.\n\nHowever, don't take my words as gospel, because I've been known to be wrong. If you can't devote the time and effort to create a piece of art or writing, (which is perfectly understandable- school, work, limitations, etc) then it's probably best to buy $5 worth of RP and maybe wait and buy until another skin that you want, that is on sale in the future.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2016-02-06T01:12:39.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol people normally ask for like 5 rp, this nigguh asking for 60 and complains when they say no lool","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluffyBurgerMan","date":"2016-02-05T09:19:36.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u want the rp earn it yourself not everything is free in life","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-05T09:50:03.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's 63 RP why should I pay money for a minimal amount?","replies":[{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-05T11:25:53.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why should they give you that minimal amount?","replies":[{"poster":"FluffyBurgerMan","date":"2016-02-06T00:48:08.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just buy $5 worth or rp not much","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-05T17:28:51.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Sorry, I can't give you anything for free\".\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cpzYXCI.png?1","replies":[]},{"poster":"Voxie","date":"2016-02-05T10:01:50.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"boohoo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-05T09:52:35.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=3Eu8gB74,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-05T09:01:04.208+0000)\n>\n>I won&#039;t ask again....\n\nThat's their goal lol.\n\nPretty sure anything over 50 RP Riot is hesitant to give.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-05T09:53:26.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea cuz they lose that much money","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2016-02-05T09:52:29.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hm maybe you can try again and this time you draw some sort of league related picture?","replies":[]}]}
