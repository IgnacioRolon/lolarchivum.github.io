Yes I got the email and I saw the chat logs but how is this fair? Ok I&#039;ll tell you exactly what happened in the game. So I go vel&#039;coz mid and I&#039;m up against a morgana which I know is gonna be a bit of trouble if she lands her q on me. So I play relatively safe until at one point she was out of mana and flash spell so I went in and unlucky enough just as I engage an exclamation mark appears above me and I know rengar is coming so I proceed to run back under turret quickly but he had his mobility boots on then because he jumped straight onto me with his empowered bola and morgana managed to get a q on me and I was dead. So from that point on that&#039;s when the hell began. I had rengar camping mid and constantly jumping out when I went to far out of the turret so I&#039;m standing under turret waiting for help and our jungler skarner doesn&#039;t come, at all. He&#039;s just roaming around the jungle like he don&#039;t care so I was done for. Then we move on to the main problem, the support, blitzcrank. At some point him and the adc have a huge argument which, in turn, I ignore, as I don&#039;t want to get involved. So then blitzcrank apparently &quot;gave up on the adc&quot; and started roaming around the map taking cs and kills from lanes. When we tell him to get over it and go back bot he verbally abused us. At one point he called me a &quot;mutt&quot; because I was apparently feeding and I was a bad vel coz. So I told him that I would report him for verbal abuse and he just said &quot;go ahead&quot; &quot;I&#039;ll report you too&quot;. So I&#039;m guessing by the chat restriction I got he did report me but did Riot actually check what happened in the game? How was this any fair that we had a verbally abusive blitzcrank who I ignored for half the game and I&#039;m the one that gets punished? Please share your thoughts and feel free to say &quot;you deserved it&quot; as much as you want. I think Riot is being a bit harsh tbh I was talking just as normally as in any other game. I also refrained myself from making this less of a rage post as possible but more of a &quot;seeking justice&quot; post.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-11-23T12:51:09.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you give logs?","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-11-23T12:58:37.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"capture the flag gamemode lmao\nlmao\nwhere u been\nits his passive\nhe can take control of them like zone control\nfcking hell her q is annoying\noh wow\nso fkcing lucky\nscarner gank pls\nthis rengar has ganked my lane at least 5 times and ive gotten no gank\nrengar camping mid much\nblitz shut up\nskarner gank when im actually alive\nnot after\nfck sake stop trolling\nhelp her\ncait how many times has skarner ganked bot\nwow\nhe ganked my lane once after i died\nhe has barely helped at all\nbecause rengar camped my lane and i got 0 ganks from you?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nblitz is a straight up raging troll skarner just cant gank properly\nholy fck blitz do u give out cancer to children in need?\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\ntry supporting bot and not roaming because ur mad\nthats exactly why she lost\nTHATS WHAT THE JG IS FOR BUT HE CANT GANK\nlmao ill wreck u in 1v 1 any day\nomfg blitz do u know what role ur playing\nSUPPORT\nU GIVE KILLS TO US\nU DONT TAKE THEM\nand why do u think that happened?\nbecause my lane got camped and i got no help\njust mute blitz\nblitz i can report u for feeding, trolling and harrassment so say another word and ur fkcing done\nlmao\nchecked the new report system?\nthe servers read the game b4 issuing the report\nif u report me for somehting i havent done it wont work\nthe flashes\nholy fck\nvayne is too op\nnope\njust surrender jeez\ngg bg","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-11-24T11:24:06.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=kfitz45,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=sfeNpUPV,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-23T12:58:37.366+0000)\n>\n> capture the flag gamemode lmao\n> lmao\n> where u been\n> its his passive\n> he can take control of them like zone control\n> fcking hell her q is annoying\n> oh wow\n> so fkcing lucky\n> scarner gank pls\n> this rengar has ganked my lane at least 5 times and ive gotten no gank\n> rengar camping mid much\n> blitz shut up\n> skarner gank when im actually alive\n> not after\n> fck sake stop trolling\n> help her\n> cait how many times has skarner ganked bot\n> wow\n> he ganked my lane once after i died\n> he has barely helped at all\n> because rengar camped my lane and i got 0 ganks from you?\n> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> blitz is a straight up raging troll skarner just cant gank properly\n> holy fck blitz do u give out cancer to children in need?\n> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n> try supporting bot and not roaming because ur mad\n> thats exactly why she lost\n> THATS WHAT THE JG IS FOR BUT HE CANT GANK\n> lmao ill wreck u in 1v 1 any day\n> omfg blitz do u know what role ur playing\n> SUPPORT\n> U GIVE KILLS TO US\n> U DONT TAKE THEM\n> and why do u think that happened?\n> because my lane got camped and i got no help\n> just mute blitz\n> blitz i can report u for feeding, trolling and harrassment so say another word and ur fkcing done\n> lmao\n> checked the new report system?\n> the servers read the game b4 issuing the report\n> if u report me for somehting i havent done it wont work\n> the flashes\n> holy fck\n> vayne is too op\n> nope\n> just surrender jeez\n> gg bg\n\nYeah, you can get reported, but you actually had to say something toxic to get chat restricted.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-24T10:02:16.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not trying to be a douche here, just giving out legitimate advice.\n\n1. I know it's hard to admit, but Skarner was making the right call. A Morgana lane is very hard to gank. You said you were playing safe, so chances are she always had her shield up, essentially making the lane un-gankable for Skarner. Then you got behind and it wasn't worth dedicating resources to your lane anymore. **It's not the jungler's job to win lane for you, that's your job.**\n\n2. You should always try to your best to diffuse arguments. But I understand typing and laning can be hard. Just for next time though, see if you can sneak a _\"shut up and play guys\"_ between CS.\n\n3. Don't keep arguing! I cringe every time this happens, Blitzcrank is not going to magically understand the depth of the support role and Skarner will not learn to gank in that game. **It is pointless trying to teach people through chat.** It's good to ask your team to do stuff (promotes pro-activity) but if they clearly can't do it, just focus on picking up their slack yourself.\n\n4. If you're still having trouble, just mute everyone at the start of game :D","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-11-24T10:22:10.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem I have is I TRY to ignore the trolls, I really do. I usually just mute them and keep on playing the match but then I go into the next game and there's ANOTHER troll. Frankly I'm just fed up to the point where I can openly admit League of Legends has the most toxic community I have experienced out of any game I have ever played. If this keeps up I may have to do the one thing I really will regret doing, uninstall LoL.","replies":[]}]}]}
