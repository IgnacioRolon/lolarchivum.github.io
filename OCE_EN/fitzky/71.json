It almost makes me wonder what League of Legends could have been. Looking through all the artworks makes me wonder how League would of been if it was a single player fantasy RPG, taking you into the world of Runeterra and exploring each champions background and story. Exploring each city and interacting with the environment. With the world of gaming evolving it would truly be a masterpiece of a game and definitely something I would love. But nevertheless, League, in terms of art, has most truly evolved over the past few years and I&#039;m looking forward to it going further. The game, and the people who play it, may not truly be in balance, but the artwork is definitely something I will continue to appreciate. Keep up the great work Riot,\r\n\r\nFitzky","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-03T02:52:56.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Annie backstory artwork was amazing!
