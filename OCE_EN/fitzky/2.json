Or strategy?\nLeague atm is basically a 1-hit free-for-all, that rewards people sitting back letting their teammates be cannonfodder, and then coming in to clean up.\n\nThis has been all of my fights for the last few weeks:\nThe mages and supports smack bang in the front lines _(because they lack the mobility to be anywhere else)_, clinging to each other for dear life, cowering in fear of the shadow of the Titans who are doing the actual meaningful fighting. One titan _(usually Jax or Nasus)_ wins, immediately dispatches the whimpering mage and support, then the winner now on low HP and their cowering mage/support, gets cleaned out by the ADC or assassin lurking far enough away from the fight to get kills, but not close enough to actually be useful, who then boasts about getting pentas and quadras.\n\nLong gone are the days when each class had an even role to play.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:03:09.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait.....you literally just described what happened to every FPS ever.

It just shouldn't exist, full stop. No excuses.\n\nIf you build Brand with no damage items, he _should_ do shit-all. If you build Ornn with no damage items, he _should_ do shit-all. If you build Vayne with full damage items, she should do a heck of a lot of damage.
