Keep in mind, you're going to need to work double as hard too keep improving from here. Keep at it and you'll make gold. \n\nJust remember that, it's not advanced mechanics and big plays that's holding you back form Gold +. It's basic decision making and mechanics (CSing, landing skillshots etc). \n\nIt's bit of trap some players fall into when they reach Silver, and think they need to master Lee Sin insec and godlike mechanics to win games.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-19T01:09:20.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze 3 but I climbed out, am now silver 3.
