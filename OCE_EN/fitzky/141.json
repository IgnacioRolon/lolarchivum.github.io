The other day I decided to buy kha zix and try him out in the jungle, I went through 3 champ select phases, finally got into game, they remaked, queued up again, another dodge, got into game, ANOTHER remake, got into another game, we surrendered at 15....\r\nI&#039;m not sure what is exactly causing it but over the course of the last several months there has been more and more dodging happening in draft pick and it is ridiculously frustrating having to waste a whole 10-20 minutes of just trying to PLAY THE DAMN GAME. There needs to be stricter dodging punishments, not just losing 3LP in ranked or 5 minute wait time in normal. Hell even I never dodge in ranked and RARELY in normals, if there&#039;s a troll in champ select I play the game out and sacrifice my LP to get another shit banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-29T06:48:23.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Player's shouldn't have to be punished for dodging in the first place. Like when im playing adc and i get a troll or support or someone gets mad and decides they're going to troll. I'd rather not play with people like that","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-29T06:53:18.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And some people actually want to play the fucking game and not go through 10 champion selects, you think if you dodge once a day that's fine but that's only YOU. Now think about everyone else who is also dodging once every day, queue times are already 3 minutes, plus the 3 minutes it takes to go through champion select before you load into a game, that's a long enough wait for me. Otherwise I might as well go play another game that I can hop instantly into and not have to wait AT ALL.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-29T12:10:47.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I'd rather wait and get a good game then rush into shitty games","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T07:32:44.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe Rift games should adopt the ARAM model, where the first dodge is 15 mins wait and it goes up from there?","replies":[]}]}
