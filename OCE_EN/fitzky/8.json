This kind of crap just shows what a bunch of fickle, salty, whining babies there are on this server... and there are a lot of them. The irony that can be seen, by anyone who has competed at a high level in just about anything, is that this is a loser's mentality. That said, just be better than them. When they do it to others, stand up for them. In my experience on other servers, (sadly) there is a disproportionate amount of them on the OCE server. The only way that I can see that changing is if better people speak up when they have the chance (in-game). Will it always be effective? Nope. But the more good people speak up and bring a positive voice to the community, the more it will grow. I have little doubt that would then expand the player base (since fewer new and old players will be inclined to leave a less toxic environment). A bigger player base means better competition, a chance to actually have world class players coming from OCE, Riot paying more attention to the needs and wants of OCE, and on, and on.  So many problems with the server are actually connected to this issue (believe it or not). Yeah, no doubt stupid people are a problem on this server. Though, it isn't a problem that can't get better. The community needs to choose to make it better by speaking up when it happens and counter-acting it with positive support of our teammates and the community.  ~ quoteth The Guru","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-28T10:43:07.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The irony that can be seen, by anyone who has competed at a high level in just about anything, is that this is a loser's mentality.\n\nI just want to point out, that though you may be right, we are human's and not robots and it can happen, hell i was on Nightblue's stream last night (Challenger jungler in NA) and because of how he was feeling he had sub mode on (much to the annoyance of non-subs) and was fairly tilted.\n\nIt does happen, and while it's the wrong thing to do to actually say it to your team, it happens none the less to everyone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeartFlame","date":"2016-01-28T09:47:07.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Probably female ... ;-)","replies":[]}]}
