After darius&#039;s rework people have been complaining a lot about the Q cast time because it essentially ruins darius&#039;s combo. I myself am a darius main and after playing a few games with his new rework I can understand why adding the cast time was necessary but what I feel is that it&#039;s wind up time is too long. I&#039;ve looked into it and noticed quite a few other top lane champions can simply dash/escape out of his Q range the moment the indicator appears {{champion:266}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:64}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:58}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:23}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:157}} . This is why I believe the cast time shouldn&#039;t be removed but simply reduced a bit, just enough so he can&#039;t instacast it but also not give enemies time to quickly dash out of it&#039;s range (I&#039;m sure a few of you are mad about the flash+Q combo now).","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-08-26T02:47:05.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to be a Darius main quite a while ago (last season) but although he was strong he lacked any escapes and the only defense you could get was by building HP (AR/MR) and although he was still strong I just felt like he lacked something.. so I was excited for this new update but like you said with his main trading tool (Q) (in lane) getting a cast time he has become pretty nasty to play. I think it would be interesting if his Q had no cast time when he was outside of his rage mode but when he gets his 5 hemorrhage stacks he gains a cast time on his Q, that way you could still play a lane phase without getting punished to hell for slipping up, but in a team fight he starts getting rolling and does more dmg but cant cast his Q as fast... this isn't making to much sense even to me but I agree with you that his Q cast time is way to long but he would be ridiculously OP if it wasn't. That being said I am pretty sure the new Skarner is way to strong (I play him a lot) especially if you try and fight him over his little shines :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-08-25T14:25:23.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's absolute garbage. Until someone can show me how exactly I'm meant to play this champion effectively, he is beyond shit in my mind.
