But every game I play people just have to argue with each other and someone either ends up trolling or going afk. I&#039;ve been playing League for 2 years and only just before season 5 ended I made it to s5 (With the luck of getting matched with experienced players). But now I feel as though I won&#039;t make it back there again unless I&#039;m with people who I can trust, people who are positive in the worst situations and actually stop and think instead of spending 20 minutes &quot;talking some sense&quot; into another player. I&#039;m not looking for anything serious, I still want to have fun while playing but at the same time have some goal or sense of achievement to work towards. A team maybe? Or just a group of people I can play with. I just done playing a game with a bunch of randoms.","replies":[]}
