Potential idea","subforum":"Miscellaneous","embed":{"description":null,"url":"https://www.zengaming.com?r=5253856121","image":null},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I recently discovered this little cool thing, pretty much a site where you sign up, link your League account, then 1 v 1 randoms to earn &quot;coins&quot; which can later be used to buy RP. Sounds like a scam? Funny enough its not, only catch is, its gonna take you A LOT of wins before you can get anything. But it&#039;s still worth it in the long run if you&#039;re willing to put time into it. \r\n\r\nNow this also got me thinking of a cool idea, having a 1 v 1 game mode where you can earn weekly rewards. Say every 10 wins you get a key fragment? Also adding a reward limit for those players who try to abuse the system. I think it would be awesome and would give a fresh new vibe for players who want a quick fast paced game while also having something to work towards. Would also save me from having to use 3rd party programs as well hahaha.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-05T13:19:39.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ive always wanted a 1v1, bo3 (so 3 champions to play) game mode...  and possibly even a ranked mode (just get rid of tt ffs)\n\n* fast games \n* fast queues\n* no obligation to stay if the other person afk's( automatic win after x time)\n* no teamwork required\n\nwould be awesome","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-05T22:02:26.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"M8 TT is never leaving me again.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-05-06T02:05:52.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bruh it leaves you for most of the week on a weekly basis","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-06T04:45:47.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it always come back ðŸ˜‰","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-08T11:41:23.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine if league implemented a weekly 'prize' type thing, similar to overwatches arcade modes where you can farm loot boxes.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-08T12:32:16.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's pretty much what I was thinking of","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Machismo","date":"2017-05-05T22:58:49.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn good idea!
