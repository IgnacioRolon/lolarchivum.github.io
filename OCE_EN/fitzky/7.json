These champions are all **mages**, their damage and utility comes off of building items such as {{item:3089}}, {{item:3165}} and {{item:3285}}. They're not champions like Mundo so why should building full tank benefit them just as much? Don't you think its just a little game breaking?","replies":[{"poster":"KingJamesMike","date":"2016-09-28T10:56:31.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Building tank doesn't benefit them lol. Akali has nothing in her kit that building tank benefits her except for pretty decent base damage. Tank benefits someone like malphite because of his passive, his w giving % arm increase and e doing more damage with more arm. He also has lots of cc so that getting behind doesn't cause issues for him. Akali has a garbage lvl 1-5 and is exploitable and shouldn't get ahead for building tank to be a viable option. No, it's not game breaking. I dare you to play tank akali in high elo and see how well you do. I can tell you really need to focus on your own issues in game rather than blaming things such as champions for not being able to climb, or teammates for that matter.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yatsume","date":"2016-09-28T06:37:07.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cool story bro, let me call in my buddy who is an expert on cool stories.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-09-28T07:15:39.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"If you have nothing to contribute to the discussion then don't comment","replies":[{"poster":"Yatsume","date":"2016-09-28T07:40:40.844+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=VdlR7AEA,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-09-28T07:15:39.825+0000)\n>\n> If you have nothing to contribute to the discussion then don&#x27;t comment\n\nBest I can do is 1/4 of a comment.
