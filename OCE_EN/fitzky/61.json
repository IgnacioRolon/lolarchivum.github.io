Currently most people run AD Tank/Attack speed but I also thought maybe going hybrid could also work since his AP scaling on his Q is 1:1 making it quite powerful in damage and healing tons if building AP. So here are some builds I have thought of might work:\r\n\r\n{{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3115}}               \r\n{{item:3117}} or {{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} \r\n\r\n{{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3812}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3072}} \r\n{{item:3117}} or {{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} \r\n\r\n{{item:3931}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3146}} \r\n{{item:3117}} or {{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} \r\n\r\nThe first one is my standard build I would go for giving a good mix of AD and AP with the added heal from Gunblade and the bonus damage from Nashors, plus Guinsoos OP.\r\nThe second build is if your looking for a bit more AD with some extra life steal.\r\nThe third build gives you a bit of extra health with the added movement speed and armour reduction from Black Cleaver. Also which boots you build I would get according to your matchups but it&#039;s up to you.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate your feedback and ideas of anything better I could add to these builds!","replies":[{"poster":"JaimeeK","date":"2016-01-06T08:30:25.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've actually played this build before and it's pretty hilarious just one shotting any carry with your ult. xD\nI rush Devourer and a Nashors tooth so it's basically like a more convential wits end start  except with cooldown instead of MR stealing. Then I just get a gunblade for the much needed lifesteal then Guinsoo's bla bla whatever, really fun build tho!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-06T06:45:39.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is nobody more easily kiteable than warwick. theres pretty much a literal 1% chance of getting an enemy team and ally team comp where this build would be optimal for your game. after you use your Q its a 3.6 - 6 second CD, thats a long time. thats only for rank 5. before that you have a much larger CD. theres a lot more to say but ultimately, just please dont. the Q heal isnt worth it, warwick needs tanky stats","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-01-06T07:12:27.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anywhere below 5 second CD isn't long at all, maybe in quick skirmishes yes, but in lane and team fights it has a chance to be used 2 or 3 times. Also with a 1:1 scaling it's quite op. Say you had 200 ap and it did about 50 base damage. It heals for 80% so that's 200 health you heal back instantly. I say it's worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-06T07:52:27.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"200 AP means you have at least all 3 of your specified AP items, which means that the game is minimum 20 minutes in. 20 minutes in absolutely any ADC can destroy you in less than 5 seconds. 200 health on anybody means absolutely nothing at that point. again a lot more to say, but hey, you can always spam it in norms, since noone takes that seriously anyway :P","replies":[]}]}]}]}
