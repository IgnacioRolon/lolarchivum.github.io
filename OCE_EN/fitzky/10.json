Because sometimes people have stressful days and get mad. Who does that bring to mind..... oh that's right...\n\nYou. I met you a few days ago in a game, and if you can't recall, you were incredibly toxic towards me and my friend. I didn't report you, because I knew that some people have more depth to them than the game that you meet them. Now, to be fair, you aren't been hypocritical because this player was clearly a continuous offender, but I just want you to remember for the future, that no matter how much preaching you do on the boards, you are never guaranteed to not end up as the person you despise so very much.\n\nAnd yes, this comment is written out of JEALOUSY that you SOMEHOW GOT SOMEONE PUNISHED with this BROKEN report system.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-29T11:09:35.811+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which game was this please inform me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-29T10:40:54.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your reports are helping to contribute to the detection of toxic players every time you report, even if it doesn't seem like it.
