I picked soraka and I had 0 idea what to build so I just went spirit visage and ardent censer because they seemed to make sense with soraka&#039;s kit. Surprise we won the game AND I got an S-. Maybe I got lucky or maybe it&#039;s not actually hard to get an S playing support.

Hope that made it clear to some people that don't know the system yet.\n\nSaying that popular supports like Thresh, Leona, Sona, Braum etc. yes its a high chance you're going to get an s when you let your team carry you and you throw just an ult in a team fight and say all you but you are not doing the full support role and cause sooooo many people play these champions is hard to be getting S  and S+'s \n\nI've gotten plenty of S's on supports I'm not complaining, well lately I've been trying with leona to get my level 7 but dam all leona is to throw her stuff out and you basically die to get your adc fed which decreases your score not increase it cause you died many times, close I've gotten is S- since the rework lol.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}\n\nps. Soraka to judge the ranking system is kinda bad due to all you do is heal and run. Zed and Yi has so many kills so healing them then staying back will easy give anyone an S","replies":[]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-07-21T07:42:37.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a S+ on Braum this season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"smooth69e","date":"2016-07-19T16:43:25.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they all just trash","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-19T12:33:07.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support mains who mains lux?
