The rest is to be decided\n\nVisuals - Phonos wears a black leather suit with a hood, a steal plated mask that covers just his nose and mouth and visor goggles. He carries a dagger in his right hand and a long sword on his back (Facing left so he draws it with his left hand). As he moves he leaves brief shadows behind him (Like their radiating off him).\n\nAbilities\n\nQ: Phonos slahes his long sword instantly to a target enemy in X range dealing X magic damage (Numbers to be decided).\n\nW: Phonos blinks to a target dealing X magic damage if it is an enemy (This has a 0.25 cast time), if phonos hits an enemy he may recast it again within 1.5 seconds (Does not count the 0.25 cast time it takes to cast the ability)\n\nE: Phonos throws his dagger in a target direction dealing X magic damage and placing a dark ring around the target, if phonos blinks to the target within 2 seconds he slows them by X% for 3 seconds\n\nR:  Passive: Using q behind an enemy champion to exit stealth instead **Backstabs** them and does double damage.\n\nTOGGLE - X mana per second - After a 1 second delay phonos becomes one with the shadows of the void stealthing himself until he either runs out of mana or uses an ability.(I would imagine to make it fair something such as a lee sin q would also reveal him).","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-07T04:00:27.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the appearance wont pass for shit. A, you cant say \"Like this champ\" thats an auto fail, and the way the his weapons go, sounds alot like fiora\n\nWord the abilities better\n\n>Q: Phonos slahes his long sword instantly dealing magic damage (Numbers to be decided) This works like kha'zix's q as it doesn't activate unless there is a target in front of him. This ability has a low cooldown as phnos uses it frequently in a fight\n\nQ: \n\nPhonos slahes his long sword dealing (X) magic damage to a targeted enemy in (X) range. \n\n>R: TOGGLE - X mana per second - After a 1 second delay phonos activates his suit and becomes one with the shadows of the void stealthing himself until he either runs out of mana or uses an ability (Such as toggling his r off). ULTIMATE ASSASSINATION - If phonos uses his Q behind a target to exit stealth he instead backstabs them with his dagger and it deals double damage.\n\nR: \n\nPassive: Using Q behind an enemy target to exit stealth deals a multiplier of  (1.25/1.5/2) damage to enemy champions\n\nActive: After 1 second delay, phonos goes into stealth, consuming (X) mana per second and gaining 10/15/20% bonus movement speed until he either runs out of mana or activates a spell\n\n(rebalance, starts weaker, old r was say 1/1/1 new r goes 0.75/0.9/1.25 power spiking, starts weaker, ends stronger)","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-04-07T08:12:31.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thanks the abilities sound a lot better, as for appearance it's hard to describe what I'm visually seeing in my head without using other champions as a source but if you have better ideas feel free to improve it in any way you can","replies":[]}]}]}
