In hindsight was it a bad idea? Yeah, sure. But I get what they were trying to do. They were going for the classic 'nerf the base damage and buff the scaling' shtick. Did they go a bit far? Definitely. Should they have hotfixed it by now? Definitely. But their initial intentions really weren't that questionable.\n\nIn hindsight, Riot should have just nerfed the Flat Base Damage, buffed the % HP damage slightly and left it at that. They didn't need to make the % HP scale. They didn't need to buff the Flat Damage scaling.\n\nAnd in all fairness to Riot, I'm pretty sure they were looking at the likes of Zac W and Maokai W when they made this change but they didn't really thing about how unhealthy it could be on a Ranged ability.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost1c3","date":"2017-11-03T23:39:09.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No everyone who had seen the PBE changes (let alone played in the PBE) thought the changes where stupid and overdone before he got into live, hell I remember seeing somewhere that riot was told this by the PBE players but just ignored them, I understand that the PBE isn't the most reliable pool but come-on at least look into it, The best way to create a bruiser is to buff base damages or the rate to which he can spam, not scaling (remember the Bruiser ekko was based on his passives base damage and repeat-ability), an idea would be giving him a maokai esq cooldown buff on his passive, or decreasing cooldowns, NOT buffing scaling, RIOT is either lying, or is just really poor at thinking (and they aren't 3 year olds so I am going with lying) they fucked up, plain and simple.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-04T04:41:15.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE is only about catching bugs, they have made that perfectly clear time and time again.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost1c3","date":"2017-11-10T03:50:13.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if it is they were still TOLD about it, they can't feign ignorance on the issue, and more to the point with all these problems it clearly shows that they meed to change their balance testing anyway, since so many bad decisions get through. I don't fault them for things like the Tank meta's (since most where made by major item updates and took the live servers 3 patches to develop) but still these kind issues highlight why they need blind balance testing (which is basically there entire argument, \"cause we didint expect it\" )","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-10T03:57:25.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Oh it's not like i am defending the balance team, the balance team is a bunch of bronze dumbasses no matter what their fake OP.GG's say.","replies":[{"poster":"Frost1c3","date":"2018-06-29T03:13:16.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to this we can evidently agree.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-03T22:31:40.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> It&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to say they made NO sense. \n\nDid you watch the video?

Whenever they did something I didn't agree with _(Buff Lethality again and again and again, or even just small things.. like keeping Lee Sin in the game of example...)_ I would always be mad, but i'd always doubt myself and think:\n_\"No, they will know more about this than I do, I'm only looking at my own small piece of the puzzle here, and however frustrating it is for me, they are probably targeting these changes at the much larger picture.\"_\n\nThen they gave Kat's ult a 15 sec cooldown on the PBE, and any shred of faith I would ever have in them, shrivelled and died that day.\n\nLuckily, Akatosh or some other form of kind and merciful god interfered, and stupidity incarnate did not reach live servers.\n\nBut the fact that a thought of Kat with a 15 sec cooldown, not only left someones head and actually came out of their mouth _(a flippin wonder in itself)_, but the rest of the team actually signed off on it being coded and upload to PBE as well, just shows the clear and utter ignorance _(or indifference?)_ they have for this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-03T11:51:35.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember in the video it is also mentioned that Riot provided evidence that these people are DIAMOND, so no, \"they are silver\" is not the correct excuse. \"They are retarded\" is more like it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-03T22:18:39.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its all fun and games to joke about it.\nBut tbh I think the game would be better off if it was balanced by silver players.\n\nFor one, 90% of people who play this game are between bronze and gold.\nSo if they can get the \"Pros are gods\" view out of their minds, and start actually balancing for the vast majority of players, we might actually see some real positive change.\n\nNot to mention the bronze-gold league, is a completely different game than the diamond-challenger league. So we have a few boffins who have literally no idea what goes on in 90% of games, balancing around the top tier gameplay that only like 1% of the population actually plays in.\n\nIf they were silver, theyd balance around 90% of players, and the pros _(less than 1%)_ would just have to deal _(theyre supposed to be good aren't they? then I'm sure they can deal with Lulu being too strong, more easily than Bronze/silver players can with Yi or Riven beign too strong)_\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\nI think the problem, is that they aren't silver!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-03T22:23:14.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean the problem really is that they are too dense, and don't think about builds or anything.\n\nTheir excuse being \"oh we thought that players would build a few AP items and a few tank items\" is just plain stupid, if even one of them thought \"oh someone is going to build this Full AP, let's have a look at the damage possible in that case\" this wouldn't have made it through to live.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-03T12:10:32.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair though, they are on riot's balancing team, what's to stop them boosting themselves?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-11-03T11:54:35.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- make a tank who already did decent damage do more.\n- build two ap items with full tank items. still have one shot potention with a combo.
