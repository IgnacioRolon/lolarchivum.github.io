Magical footwear does not seem that strong, it is not taken nearly as often as stopwatch, and actually helps out a lot for champions with low mobility in the game. Meanwhile we have cases in high elo where 90% of the people in the game have a stopwatch and causes stuff like this to happen. Are you seeing this Riot? Anyone on your team coming across videos like this yet? Why focus your attention on free boots over a free **Zhonyas&#039;s**? A really useful and handy rune at first but now becoming the old Thunderlords Decree keystone, where you either take it or be really disadvantaged.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:06:32.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just make it so that Stopwatch isn't allowed to be built into anything if you use it. That way you're not getting a 300 gold discount on GA/Zhoyna's/Gargoyle's AND a broken active.\n\nBut, another thing to consider is that Zhoyna's is 2900 gold. There's a reason for this, the active is absolutely gamebreaking. Now everyone gets a gamebreaking active for free/600 gold???? What is Riot thinking lmao....","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-27T05:56:22.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually people take STOPWATCH and MAGICAL FOOTWEAR","replies":[]}]}
