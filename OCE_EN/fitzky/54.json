I built full armor items including {{item:3143}} and {{item:3075}}  until I had 322 armor. I was taking roughly 73% less physical damage and 10% less damage from crits. Now despite all of this {{champion:157}} was still doing roughly 15% of my health per auto which against a tank is utterly ridiculous. Because of his 100% crit chance I was basically negating 10% of his damage AND I had thornmail reflecting some of the damage back as well. So even when I&#039;ve counter built as much as possible he&#039;s still able to shred through me so easily. And keep in mind we were both really fed so we had around about the same gold and this guy was able to 3 v 1 us so our only option was to try and catch him out with all 5 of us together and 5 v 1 him to actually kill him.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-13T04:14:02.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"because to kill yasuo as darius you build ad not armor idiot, that was all your fault not his, the counter to yasuo is damage and hp not armor, he has 50-95% bonus armor shred you dingus.\n\nThe only \"problem\" with yasuo is dingus's not knowing how his kit works and how to fight him","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-13T07:34:54.240+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Toxic Talon12 strikes again","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-13T10:46:48.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tQZFioQz,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2016-08-13T07:34:54.240+0000)\n>\n> Toxic Talon12 strikes again\n\nthen why you gotta complain about the most obvious things dingus","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-13T12:03:23.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well obviously I wasn't aware that doesn't entitle you to be a dick about it","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T06:26:05.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whilst you do know your stuff you aren't very civil when responding. Yasou can be really hard to beat in some lanematchups whilst very easy to beat in other matchups. Whilst knowing what his abilities do and the approximate cds is important, there is a reason his ban rate is pretty high in most low to medium elo whilst still seeing play in higher elo suggesting that he's quite powerful at the moment.\n\n Also Yasou is one of those champions who the playerbase tends to be more toxic than average and his frequency in normal games makes you get a little bored of him. I'm not going to say he's not a really high skillcap champion because he does require alot of mechanical skill, I do argue though that beating him in certain matchups can require more overall skill and can be incredibly frustrating to lane against, especially if he get's ahead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-13T04:15:51.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is really overpowered at the moment, but don't fear, he is getting nerfed last I heard.\n\nIts funny because even Arkadata admitted that yasuo is too strong at the moment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-08-13T02:49:59.944+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yasuo is a dog shit champ...","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-13T07:54:27.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a showing that % pen on any champion, is stupid as fuck.\n\nDoesn't matter how much Armor you get % pen takes it all away.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-13T07:58:36.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"% anything is kinda stupid tbh.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-13T08:44:13.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i'm just mostly sick of playing tanks and having an ADC build one item to make my entire build worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-13T14:00:09.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, and because they can't survive through tankiness, they end up needing lots of damage to survive....

Also in ranked at low elo I don't care what people say cho'gath counters yasou trust me it works, so take cho'gath mid, take him jungle or take him top. If there is a lvl7 yasou on the enemy team you want to have a cho'gath, I don't care what mastery or elo, any semidecent cho'gath can easily keep a fed yasou in check. Top laners work against yasou because they generally can get up close to him without dying and then mop his face with huge damage and fighting power. Why do you think yasou's top counters are {{champion:92}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:2}} {{champion:80}}  when they build bruiser. Tank darius is not going to stop yasou, bruiser darius should be able to though.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-13T05:03:42.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played Darius vs Yasuo, and to be honest that was actually an even match up, I would say a yasuo with one or two kills would demolish a Darius regardless.  I wouldn't even say Darius is bursty per se because he has to actually land 5 autos or kill a target with his ult to maximize his output. I would say match up in Darius's favour if Yasuo didn't take warlords bloodlust. Now if Yasuo lets you hit him 5 times, that's a sure kill. \n\nAnd I've played Pantheon top and actually got 3 kills, enemy Yasuo also got 3 kills and I was actually killed by him even though I was sure that I should be able to burst kill him.  I don't know if it's a bug, but he i swear at one point yasuo took no damage from my heartseeker strike when he wind walled. :l\n\nI would also put irelia with Jax up there for a counter to Yasuo since that really is a hard counter. Garen is also a good pick against Yasuo. \n\nChogath's silence though really fucks with yasuo followed by his knock ups really facilitate ganks even when losing lane so that's always a plus.

Shaco is very good for dealing with yasou since yasou's tend to be pushed and since for shaco it's an easy camp and helps him snowball and yasou can't really handle falling behind, so basically it's a goodlane to camp early. Also the clone and popping a box down in the middle of the fight can be devastating for yasou, not to mention yasou won't really be able to outplay your e with windwall since you'll be in his face and so he wont have time to react so he has to kinda just throw windwall out and hope, whereas you can use e whenever you want.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-13T03:06:04.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favourite yasou counter cho'gath generally won't win against yasou building full tank either. You want offtank, not full damage but maybe 1 or 2 tank items and the rest damage. You want to be able to get up close and wreck the squishy guys face. He's basically a melee, assassin fighter adc, so treat him as such and jump on his face cause he's not durable he just does alot of damage. Adc's can beat toplaners but you jump on their face and you'll win almost every time regardless of whether they're fed (unless it's vayne cause she'll condemn you).","replies":[]}]}]}
