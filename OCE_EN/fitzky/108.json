This question has probably been asked a million times but always receives the same answer:\r\n\r\n League is too toxic to have in-game voice chat and doing so would only make it worse. \r\n\r\nNow, what if we thought of a solution to this? I have an idea, **Voice Chat Rooms**\r\nLike normal chat rooms except everyone can talk to each other via mic and also includes a mute/unmute button for each member in the group.\r\n\r\nNow, how does this remove the problem?\r\nOnly people on your friends list can be invited to **Voice Chat Rooms** and you must of been friends for at least **24 hours** ; this removes the likelihood of some random toxic kid adding you after a match and inviting you to his **Voice Chat Room**  just to tell you how bad you are. Plus if anyone starts to be toxic in the first place the mute button is always there.\r\n\r\nSo, what does everyone think? I&#039;m open to all ideas if anyone can think of something better","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-20T09:37:31.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Plus if anyone starts to be toxic in the first place the mute button is always there.\n\nYes because people use the mute button as it is now, and don't always come on here complaining about toxic people.\n\nPlus there is no need for voice chat in league, because there are so many ways to have voice chat right now, Discord, Curse, Teamspeak, Skype and i'm sure there is more.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-20T13:16:26.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"But not everyone has or wants to download these other programs so implementing it in-game makes it a lot easier to use and access","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-20T13:26:01.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you **want** voice chat, download the program.\n\nimplementing it in game is still not required no matter what you say.\n\nRiot doesn't **want** to implement voice chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FyreFox666","date":"2016-05-25T05:23:20.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Fitzky,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=kNc5PhG3,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-05-20T13:16:26.077+0000)\n>\n> But not everyone has or wants to download these other programs so implementing it in-game makes it a lot easier to use and access\n\nThose who want voice chat download these programs. Those that don't just use the league client. Why force this on all league users?\n\nI enjoy listenning to music while playing, I dont want to have to download extra bytes the next patch upgrade because you were too lazy to google \"Discord\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-05-20T14:31:20.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been really reluctant to get new voice com software too but I've found Discord and TeamSpeak are actually really lightweight (compared to Skype).
