Has a passive which blocks autos meaning any melee opponent can&#039;t trade with him as he uses his point and click stun to just reset it after it&#039;s been proc&#039;d. Has an ultimate which pretty much stops any lane opponent from leaving their tower as he will walk up and ult on top of them and since the radius is so huge unless your flash is up he will get you no matter where you run. Rushes lethality and ghostblade so even if you do manage to get away he will activate it every time he see&#039;s you and catch up to you. Oh did I say his ultimate stops you from leaving your tower? Nevermind I just had one ult on top of me under my own turret and walked out since his passive BLOCKED THE TURRET SHOT. This means when you are under your own turret he can keep spamming harass at you when his passive is up because his fun little passive will protect him. So by 20 minutes he is 8/0 with full lethality and he has already ulted botlane and got a doublekill, congrats the game is over.\r\n\r\nAll of that into a champion whos only weakness is the fact that he falls off late game? Oh wait the games already over before late game? NEVERMIND THEN. This is why pantheon is my perma ban in ranked because he is the only top lane champion who pretty much beats 90% of his melee matchups (excluding some very tanky champions such as sion who can take the harass but still have to sit back and farm safely) so why has this champ gone unnoticed for so long? Ever since the changes to lethality items he has become stronger then ever before and he has just as much global pressure as twisted fate but completely deletes people within a second since after laning phase he will most likely be fed and have a ton of lethality. The last time I remember playing pantheon a while ago I remember ulting into a teamfight and the ult alone killed 2 people instantly and I ended up with a pentakill. \r\n\r\nSo Pantheon is the biggest lane bully, has global presence, and can tear apart a teamfight...... but he falls off late game? Is that really enough? I&#039;m seriously on the edge here with this champion, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been this angry since pre-nerf Yasuo was destroying everything in every game he was in. I just can&#039;t play against the champion, I will admit I just raged quitted my last game because I was ready to go ballistic so I had to stop myself before I started being toxic.\r\n\r\n\r\nInb4 This discussion gets downvoted by salty kids who can&#039;t provide a reason for why they think I&#039;m wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-27T22:58:17.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hes only annoying if your not a tank otherwise by lvl 6 he cant do shit once you have some decent armour.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-28T08:36:01.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main darius and I can still never win, I disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-07-28T08:37:26.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"darius isnt a tank lul\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-28T08:50:13.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhhhh, what?
