As a top lane main for the past 3 years I've never seen top in such a horrible state, and as much as a lot of people hate hashinshin, he pretty much nails every point here. It's no secret that top is now the least popular role, it's quite obvious how stupid tanks are right now, especially regarding ORNN. Who Riot STILL can't balance properly. To be honest, as often as Hashinshin gets angry and overreacts, I'd be yelling just as much, this shit is infuriating. There is no point in playing Bruisers anymore, tanks are just an auto-win in lane. They need one 1000 gold item to just completely stomp their opponent without actually having to be good at all. Gnar spamming q is something I've experienced recently myself, getting chunked down by a boomerang he can just continually throw at you without any punishment and having a leap to easily kite if you dare to ever get so close. His kit is pretty much a hybrid tank/adc which rushes frozen mallet and you can do absolutely nothing. The runes reforge has gutted bruisers while empowering tanks, and Meddler's post is just laughable. I don't want to waste time continuing on with this when the rest is pretty much explained in the video.\r\n\r\nFor any of you stupid fanboys who dare to try and argue against this and somehow come up with some bullshit excuse, read these:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/IreliaCarriesU/status/955960901441433600\r\nhttps://twitter.com/scarra/status/953016002870063104\r\n\r\nThis is not just low elo retards crying, this is high elo players and the top lane community who are fed up with the state of our lane and Riot who are barely doing anything to fix it.\r\n\r\nHere is a reddit post about this discussion, read through the comments:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7soxse/hashinshins_response_to_meddlers_24th_january_post/\r\n\r\nSo now that the evidence is all here Riot, you better make a decision fast, Dyrus has moved to playing Vr chat and plays jungle now when he plays League, other popular streamers are fed up. Do you want to keep your current player base or lose a good portion of it?","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T13:12:48.484+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Top lane bruiser players: \"Our class lacks an actual keystone right now, we need one....\"\n\nRiot: \"It's on the way!\" (during preseason)\n\n*8.2 hits*\n*no bruiser keystone*\n\nTop lane bruiser players: \"We really need a keystone guys....We don't want to just run Grasp....\"\n\nRiot: \"We currently need more time to design and implement a keystone for bruisers!\"\n*proceeds to rework every single support starting item and their final items*\n\nTop lane bruiser players: \"Looks like we're just going to quit....\"\n\nRiot Meddler: \"Top is actually not the least queued role and it's actually fairly fun and well balanced right now. Look here, STATS!\"\n\nWhat top laners hear from Riot: \"Just play tanks and you'll win :ok_hand: :laughing: Otherwise go to another lane.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, maybe if Riot stopped being so blatantly biased towards tanks and showed bruisers some actual love people would queue up for top lane more. Why learn someone like Riven, Fiora, Irelia or Darius when you can simply learn how to press 2 buttons over and over again as a tank and beat your lane opponent simply for picking a non-tank?\n\nSame applies to ranged top laners, why pick them when you could pick a tank and just simply not die in lane, have immense lane pressure and have arguably the biggest contribution to teamfights out of ALL the game's roles.\n\nI personally think the icing on the cake is that Riot is defending all of their antics with statistics that we can neither agree with nor properly refute because they aren't showing us where they're getting them from. The same thing applies to the controversy surrounding Blue Essence, we have no idea where those graphs are coming from and/or what the working out in terms of maths was used. In the context of that issue they completely forgot to include Blue Essence being completely RANDOM post 30.\nAs for the top lane statistics they are extremely likely to be false since support has been one of the more popular roles as of late. I've legit never autofilled to support following the Ardent meta, only top lane. That should tell Riot something...\n\nIn saying all of that their use of statistics is a sneaky business strategy which is in short, lying to the players on every account. This we cannot say to their faces since they've provided us with apparent \"statistics\" which they used for their graphs and their fanboys will defend them to their graves.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-31T22:41:18.124+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"we need something like fevor back because comet on Camille and electrocute or PTA on tryndamere feels so wrong with what the champ is actually about","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DougStanhopeFTW","date":"2018-01-25T13:28:15.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Hash crying again what is new LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-25T21:05:54.783+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I do agree Hash cries a lot about unnecessary stuff, in this situation he is actually right.

While also shielding him for 12% of his maximum health? I've been playing a lot of Ornn recently to help understand him better and his W is the most overtuned ability in the game. It is not fair, I've out- damaged and out-traded every single opponent I've been up against. Don't forget you also rush mana and cd so like Hashinshin said you can just mindlessly spam W over and over and over and your opponent can't get anywhere near their minions without losing all their health. This happened to most of my opponents, they would attempt to farm and I would just whittle them down until I could ult and dash in and kill them. It's far too easy to beat everyone, he feels like an actual Raid boss. \n\nI do agree that tank itemization is also an issue, which again is talked about in the video. But Ornn himself is also strong and this deadly combination is making Ornn too powerful. And yeah the change that they made by removing his unstoppable just ruined his uniqueness, they removed what was special to Ornn instead of fixing the actual issue which is it's damage with low mana cost.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-25T13:24:16.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh i agree it's overtuned, don't get me wrong, i don't think the right way to fix it is to remove the unstoppable (or change the cooldown up like they did last patch).\n\nThe issue is more that there will always be a bunch who are better, because they can abuse the strong items better.\n\nIf the W was base damage and then % on the auto (probably the same) i think he would be easily balanced.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-25T21:17:04.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been theorising some possible tweaks and if Riot are refusing to change his W initial damage then I think there's a way to balance other stats of the ability without touching the initial damage.\n\nShield - 12% max health --> 10% max health\n\nCD - 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 --> 15 / 14 / 13 / 12 /11\n\nTarget Range - 550 Units ---> 500 Units","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-31T22:37:42.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"man if your opponent isn't abusing the fact that you're spamming your W (which is easy to dodge) than you deserve to be out trading them. early game ornn can be out traded so easy if you're not going in balls deep or letting ornn free farm. and if you really wanna beat ornn I have no idea why people aren't using this fkn tree {{champion:57}}  he literally can out duel you over time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T04:22:02.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/7VOAaqsF-quick-gameplay-thoughts-january-24\n\n>So, to try and sum a bunch of things up, we believe top lane needs some improvements at both the tactical and the strategic level. Tactically some things are distorting the lane and need to be addressed (a range of Runes, some individual champions, ranged harass that doesn’t draw agro). Ability to be aggressive on some champs, and get damage to stick to others, may also need further work too. At a strategic level top’s impact on the game at really high MMRs is likely too low. Addressing that likely involves increasing the benefit of winning top lane and looking at how dependent on TP top lane is.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2018-01-25T04:35:36.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://imgur.com/SPuP6bZ\n\n\"We are aware there are problems and we will look into it but no ETA on when we'll actually do something about it\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-25T04:39:50.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Fair enough.
