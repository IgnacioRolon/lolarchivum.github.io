Probably hit 1 ultimate in the entire game because champions like zed just use their shadow every single time. At least her old ult actually had some use in some situations now you just have a skillshot execute that everyone in the game can avoid.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-20T21:28:18.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As explained in another comment here, Rek's ulti was only changed because it made no sense.\n\nI really don't think her current ulti is bad tbh. Think of it this way: it's got good range, has a global announcement (which doesn't mean anything given the range is nowhere near the point where it needs a global announcement, but hey it's a headsup for the enemy nonetheless), has another fixed delay after the announcement for the enemies to prepare themselves, which I guess are cool for a chase ability that could potentially 1 shot most people below 30-40% HP, but then it also for some reason **the spell can also be VERY EASILY dodged after all that**. That last part is the killer of this combination imo.\n\nI think all it needs is making it much harder to dodge that it currently does atm in some fashion (some form of auto-tracing/tracking for the leap which makes the target being required to do dedicated escapes by doing a dash AND escape to get out of being chewed on perhaps?) and it's good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-21T05:13:53.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what I was thinking, I found it stupid that Rek'Sai just randomly leaps forward instead of actually leaping AT THE TARGET. I get that they wanted some kind of compensation for it's large cast range but I would happily exchange a nerf of its range for an auto-lock on.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-24T07:52:10.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her ultimate makes her untargetable for nearly 2 seconds and you're complaining? Yes, her damage can be dodged by small teleports but so can many other ultimates? \n[(correct me if im wrong but i don't think dashes can dodge her damage?) - if they do it still takes some skill to do so, timing etc.]","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-24T12:07:32.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh it makes her untargetable that's really great ,hey guess what ever heard of a champion called zed? Except Rek'Sai is far weaker and with an ultimate like hers the least they could do is make it somewhat useable. You should try it out yourself and see how easy it actually is to dodge, the only champions that will actually be hit by it is champs with 0 mobility. Hell you could activate a garen q right before she leaps and run to the side and dodge it, it's THAT easy. It's pressing q on GAREN require skill?","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-24T12:49:26.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol? Yeah I would say using Garen's Q to dodge a Rek'Sai's ultimate does take skill, havent seen anyone do it yet :o would be epic. \n\nI don't get why you're comparing zed to Rek'Sai when they are two completely different types of champions. Rek'Sai's kit doesnt revolve around her ultimate, & her ultimate is fine as is.. The damage it does (which is instant if it hits) is far more than it should do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-20T05:42:41.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didn't understand the need for a change considering her w knockup is basically better and she no longer has the map presence advantage of hitting lvl 6","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-20T21:13:36.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=prrlQceZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-08-20T05:42:41.858+0000)\n>\n> i didn&#x27;t understand the need for a change considering her w knockup is basically better and she no longer has the map presence advantage of hitting lvl 6\n\nHer ulti was pressured to be changed because it literally makes no sense to her design and just seemed contrived.
