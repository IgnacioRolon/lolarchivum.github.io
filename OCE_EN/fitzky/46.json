Packed full of stuns in his kit with major harass in lane with not much you can do besides dodging his q. Kennen just simply has to dash into the enemy team, maybe flash, then ult and the enemy team is done for. Massive aoe dmg similar to fiddle but along with a 1.25 second stun on your whole team and theres 0 mechanics to it. Its not like a sej ult skillshot or an ashe arrow you just fucking be there in the middle of the enemy team and zhonyas and their dead. It doesn&#039;t help that kennen is an energy champion as well. Kennen right now is the secret bullshit way to climb the ladder I have not had one game against a kennen where we haven&#039;t lost. Can we have some small nerfs on this champion please","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-20T07:53:16.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-20T08:14:59.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/VkPqT0OEN6jKM/giphy.gif\n\ntime and adress? ill bring the frying pan\n\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-20T07:34:20.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play urgot top, never be bothered again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-20T07:28:28.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-20T07:33:47.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-only plays aram\n-comments on post obviously about summ rift\n\nanother a+ shitpost , well done","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-20T07:11:50.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kennen is one of those champions that is best countered by someone who can knock him away. You **absolutely** need a Janna, Alistair, Gragas or Lee Sin if you hope to survive team fights. The player on that champ needs to be on point, waiting for Kennen to use his flash and/or protobelt before knocking away, and your entire team needs to be coordinated enough to not die before Kennen hard engages. If it's done right, Kennen becomes pretty useless because he can't stack stuns on as many targets as he would like and his single target damage isn't exactly a threat if he's built a few tanky items to begin with (Protobelt/Zhonya's/Rylai's).\n\nI'm not saying it's foolproof but I don't think Kennen needs nerfs either.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-09-20T05:04:42.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk. i'd call a win rate of 51.5% pretty balanced, I mean its only 1% off what would be considered perfect","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-09-20T03:54:13.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm starting to see a LOT more Eve players also carrying games hard!
