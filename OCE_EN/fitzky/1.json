Rengar is such an awesome champion and is certainly up there with all the other popular champs so I think he deserves another skin. Maybe one that really changes his animations and visuals quite a bit. A legendary skin maybe? I have an idea for one:\r\n\r\nShadow realm Rengar/Dark Assassin Rengar\r\n\r\nRengars eye patch is replaced with a black, red, evil eye and his knife becomes a long,black scimitar. His body is covered in a dark metallic coat with his claws becoming sharp knives. His Q animation would possess his scimitar with dark energies which would release onto the victim, his W would shroud him in red eternal anger which would explode around him, his E would throw sharp, two ended knives which would wrap around the victim paralysing them in darkness. And his Ultimate would shroud him in darkness as he hunts for his prey and they hear his grim laughter as death approaches.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-10-23T00:13:31.759+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would like another skin for Rengar, myself, as I kinda main him too :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-24T22:36:41.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want a cute kitty Rengar, cuter then Gnar","replies":[]},{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-10-23T19:42:38.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Kitty Cat Rengar.
