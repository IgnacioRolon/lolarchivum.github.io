Unfortunately I believe that at his current stage Pantheon and his entire kit is just anti-fun to play against and should be considered for a rework/ability adjustment. With the introduction to both lethality items and the corrupting potion, pantheon has been able to deal high amounts of damage constantly with only one ability, without the cost of running out of mana. Add an ignite to that and he can pretty much force the opponent to immediately tower hug for the rest of the laning phase. But it doesn&#039;t stop there, the range of his spear throw, combined with his passive enabling him to BLOCK turret shots, he is still able to consistently deal damage and wither you down under your very own turret you thought would be safe. Even if he strays too far under the turret from time to time, with his passive up he gets a free trade off anyway and it makes up for his mistake. At this point your jungler HAS to camp your lane or you pretty much have to just leave top for him to take freely, otherwise you&#039;re just gonna keep feeding him and the game will end BEFORE it even gets to late game. After he&#039;s done there your midlaner is screwed because he will just ult on top of their own turret and get out because again his passive BLOCKS turret shots.\r\n\r\nPantheon&#039;s entire kit is just designed around being the most annoying champion to lane against and makes it pretty much impossible to do anything against unless you pick after him and own like the 2-3 champions that can do something against him. It doesn&#039;t make it fun for the rest of the team who has to deal with an 11/0 pantheon crashing down on top of them and killing them instantly from half the map away either. He&#039;s also still sitting as the 4th highest winrate in toplane according to champion.gg, which apparently went up since last patch.\r\n\r\nIf you do not agree with me, and you think pantheons kit is not annoying and anti-fun, tell me why and what exactly you do. And no I don&#039;t want to know about the few champions you could pick against him to actually have a chance of beating him, I want to know what to do when the enemy picks pantheon after you and that the game isn&#039;t already an instant loss. Because that&#039;s how its always been for me for a very long time and I&#039;m sick of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ryestorm","date":"2017-10-10T08:41:02.401+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Git gud{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-10T09:35:34.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When I ask for help I expect either a valid helpful comment or no comment at all.

But you can't die to him early on. If he doesn't get the early gold he quickly becomes a stun bot. Ideally you'd pick someone tanky but if he picks after you I'm unsure how much you can do. \n\nDepends on who your playing I guess. If your playing someone he's gonna dumpster play super safe and ward your jungle. Your gonna have to accept you can't fight him early. Try to farm up under tower (I know his spear is annoying but you don't have a ton of choices). If he pushes up to tower see if your jungler will gank him. \n\nQuite frankly it's a lane that depends pretty heavily on the jungler. I like playing him and if the jungler leaves me alone I pretty much always get ahead and then use my ult to roam. If the jungler ganks and I get behind then I'm in for a rough rough time. \n\nAs a side note (Im not saying you do this but I see it a lot) don't push all the way up to his tower and sit there autoing if he's level 6 and you can't see him. The number of times I've ulted in killed the minions and then the laner with the help of the tower is really high.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-11T12:29:52.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks at least you bothered to provide some advice","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-11T23:15:49.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I can't be more specific it does depend on the match up.
