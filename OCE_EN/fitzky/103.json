I thought my day had gotten shittier when I was in a game with a vi who forgot smite so she proceeded to duo top with me and steal all my exp, after many pings telling her to back off she says &quot;stfu&quot; and continues to farm until we are both lvl 5 then leaves me to deal with a level 8 yorick. After a few deaths and telling her that she was a troll and she ruined my lane she decided to &quot;teach me a lesson&quot; and went afk.

Riot does not endorse fight-fire-with-fire when it comes to in-game toxicity for many reasons.\n\nOtherwise, you can always dispute it via a support ticket. It can even be from other previous offences that's just catching up now. Ask them to clear it up for you.\n\nSince it's not about 3rd party software ban, I wouldn't think given your information here, so they should be quite open to discuss it in the support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-02T08:57:46.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep had to re-login to get the chat logs, for everyones entertainment I'll post them now:\nFitzky: reported\nFitzky: you ruined my game\nFitzky: you cant jg\nFitzky: you legit cant\nFitzky: you need smite\nFitzky: too late now\nFitzky: just report her so maybe next time she'll pay more fucking attention when in champ select\nFitzky: you ruined my game!\nFitzky: WHAT ARE YOU DOING\nFitzky: report vi please\nFitzky: holy fuck you're all braindead\nFitzky: she has no fukcing smite\nFitzky: she cant jg\nFitzky: and you just let that happen\nFitzky: no\nFitzky: fuck off\nFitzky: your stealing my exo\nFitzky: exp\nFitzky: go mid\nFitzky: id rather you go afk\nFitzky: legit fuck off\nFitzky: nah\nFitzky: go away\nFitzky: get out of my lane\nFitzky: sorry yorick this bitch wont fuck off\nFitzky: shut up\nFitzky: I want a normal laning phase\nFitzky: not this shit\nFitzky: no\nFitzky: YOU CAN JG NOW\nFitzky: GO AWAY\nFitzky: how would you like it if I followed you around jg and took every camp?\nFitzky: you like that?\nFitzky: you tried to\nFitzky: I had to make sure you didnt steal\nFitzky: look yorick is level 8 now\nFitzky: im level 5\nFitzky: look at this\nFitzky: you think id be happy?\nFitzky: no by standing in the lane you take exp\nFitzky: good\nFitzky: what?\nFitzky: the fuck?\nFitzky: \"report urgot useless\"\nFitzky: fuck you dude seriously\nFitzky: you come into my lane, steal exp, ruin my lane, then ask them to report me?\nFitzky: hahah you are\nFitzky: a joke\nFitzky: hahahah ^\nFitzky: me?\nFitzky: nah im actually skinny\nFitzky: lol so whats your issue now?\nFitzky: you legit trolled me now your the one making the verbal abuse\nFitzky: yeah the one that takes smite when jgling\nFitzky: \"report urgot verbal abuse\"\nFitzky: \"sad sack of shit\"\nFitzky: your funny\nFitzky: you made the decision to come into my lane\nFitzky: and steal exp\nFitzky: mate just because you made a mistake doesnt mean you ruin my lane\nFitzky: bye\nFitzky: she forgot smite, ran into my lane to steal cs, then proceeds to flame me\nFitzky: I think all the boxes are checked here\nFitzky: report being issued after\nFitzky: she stole all the exp\nFitzky: ^\nFitzky: nah farm jg and suffer yourself because YOU forgot smite\nFitzky: SO DONT RUIN OTHERS LANES\nFitzky: COOL STORY\nFitzky: vi you've made it worse now by going afk\nFitzky: ok cool\nFitzky: im having a laugh here haha\nFitzky: nah i want to win\nFitzky: you're not making it easy\nFitzky: come play vi\nFitzky: really?\nFitzky: not the one whos afk and not helping the team?\nFitzky: now im telling you to play\nFitzky: come\nFitzky: alright then\nFitzky: okay\n\nYep I was toxic, Vi was being a shit, trolled, and ruin the game, but you know what?

But hey, idk.\n\nEDIT: I think another reason for your ban was from you quoting their flame, which the system mistake it to be from you instead. I think you can actually dispute this case.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-02T09:07:41.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait really? Can I get Riots confirmation?

Can I get Riots confirmation? I&#x27;d like a Riot to comment on this\n\nI read a case on NA where there was a guy being verbal abused and called a N-ger, which while the attacker was banned, the victim themselves were banned also because they were defending themselves while saying things like (paraphrase) \"why are you insulting me and spam this N-ger shit\" and actually type the term out in its complete form. And the system thought they were also the insulter instead of the victim defending themselves.\n\nTheir ban were lifted soon after.\n\nThe automated word matching system may have some context sensitivity built into, maybe, but most likely it's not great (I mean seeing google still has issues with translation of any line with more than 4 words in it) or may even just be absent and it's just a string-matching algorithm.\n\nYou might want to check with Riot support by submitting a support ticket on this one. I really do not believe that your chatlog there definitely deserves a ban on its basis tbh. I mean, yeah it's angry, but I really don't think it's offensive at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-02T09:16:38.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Sekai, of course if theres a chance to redeem myself I'll take it, I'll see what I can do","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-02T13:02:41.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From the looks of it, the... \"attitude\" you've shown isn't too extreme. I doubt this would be something to skip punishment tiers over, so if you've not received a 2 week ban before you'd probably have a case to get your ban reduced. If you have received a 2-week ban previously though, I doubt there'd be anything there for the Support staff to look at that would change the outcome. Just don't get you're hopes up that it *will* be changed, there's no guarantee.\n\nThat said, if this is consistent behaviour (even if its not), you may want to consider finding an outlet for that rage/frustration. Try yelling at your screen or getting a punching bag and pretend it's these kings of \"trolls\" that you're hitting. Maybe join a martial arts class. Much better option than losing an account you've put lots of time, effort and potentially money into.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-02T13:14:12.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have received a 2 week ban before however that was a little while ago and I believe by that time the punishment tier would of gone back down at least. Still currently waiting on a response though, I still think it's pretty unfair, sure trollers, feeders, people who go afk on purpose, and people who flame others for being bad are understandable. But being trolled by someone who is ruining your lane and using chat to tell them to go away after pings failed? Why do I deserve to not play the game anymore because my game was ruined by someone else? At very most it should be a 2 week ban. I never did anything to troll my team, I played it out and tried as hard as I could, I never flamed anyone unjustly, leave the perma bans for the people who troll and intentionally try to ruin the game for everyone. At most 90% of those chat logs were me trying to get the vi out of my lane and defending myself after she tried to get everyone to report me.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-02T13:57:59.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I never flamed anyone unjustly\n\nI just have to comment on the because while many players share the sentiment, Riot certainly doesn't. It's one of those things I don't necessarily agree with outright, but understand the necessity of. In situations like these, it's always best to leave the \"punishment giving\" to those responsible for doing so, which in this case is Riot. You contributing to the conversation with such comments just makes it worse for everyone, even those who just want to keep playing. There's no reason to be putting your account on the line just to get back at a troller, feeder, AFKer, whatever.\n\nWhether or not you manage to make progress on appealing the ban, I can't stress the importance of having an outlet for that kind of attitude enough. Having something to put that rage/frustration into will mean you're not needlessly putting your account on the line to \"teach these people a lesson\", and it doesn't just help in-game. Find something, and use that as your \"punching bag\", instead of just letting loose at everyone you *think* deserves it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-03T03:24:28.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except like I said I started out by using pings to tell her to go away but I was told to \"stfu\", I never outright stated flaming her in chat, I thought if pings weren't going to work I'll try using the chat afterwards, when that didn't work and she tried to get everyone to report me I had to defend myself, then she went afk and that's when I actually tried to get her back as you can see I start to be positive towards her in chat. There is a difference between someone outright flaming at someone else for making a bad play or trying a new strategy, and someone being trolled by another person and trying to get them to stop ruining the game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-08-02T22:30:20.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wonders why people are so toxic.\n\nTheres no incentive to play games like this.
