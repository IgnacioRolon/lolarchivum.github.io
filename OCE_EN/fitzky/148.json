Used active items every teamfight, funny thing is the system probably didn&#039;t even register me as support because I took ignite botlane which gave us tons of kill pressure early. Best part is I never play support, I hate it, but I got autofilled into the shitty role and still ended up with a top tier grade, how do you feel support mains?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-06-22T13:54:29.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive got 7 m7 champs through playing them supp. Getting an s+ is easy peasy.\n\nFor christ sakes i got m6 mordkaiser after    playing him supp for 2 games.
