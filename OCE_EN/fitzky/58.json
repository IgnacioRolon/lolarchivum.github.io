But when your bot lane, and you are the ADC. The enemy jungle has ganked 4-6 times already. The enemy ADC and support are ON your tower all the time and you ask for assistance, and your mid cant come, but your jungle isn't busy. But yet your jungle never ganks. I think it is okay to be pretty angry when your jungle says \"Okay ill come help bot\" when you have already lost your tower and the enemy is fed to the teeth.\n\nSo many times i have had this happen. Lost my tower then the jungle FINALLY pulls their finger out their butt and comes to help and i get annoyed then they say \"oh then i wont come bot then\" like a child. You know what. If you are jungle it is your damn job to punish the enemy if they push to hard. It is your job to apply pressure on lanes EVEN IF YOU DONT GET A KILL. It is your job to cover for a lane if they die and the lane looks like it could pop your tower. \n\nDon't play jungle if you are only in it for your self to get fat and only want to get kills out of ganks.
