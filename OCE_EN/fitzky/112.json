Maybe putting on the front profile page or on another tab, adding in a **bio**. The player can write in 200 words or less a little bit about themselves and what roles they like/what their playstyle is etc. Maybe even have a little fun and tell people what favourite foods you like, hobbies, interesting facts about yourself. Just things for friends or players trying to recruit others for teams to get to know players better. \r\n\r\nSo,","replies":[{"poster":"JimmyBoy","date":"2016-09-21T08:49:13.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like this, could be like the Twitter bio system.
