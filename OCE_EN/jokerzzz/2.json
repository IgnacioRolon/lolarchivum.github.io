Lobby fights are all but gone with the assigned roles (you get the odd dipshit here and there but the chaos rage of norms lobby is gone from ranked). 10 bans means everyone can ban one they want banned and that is also reducing aggro.\n\nThere is still some salt but the number of intentional feeders is definitely down from what I remember but that could also be an ELO thing as bronze is horrendous for this (I'm only silver but the difference is noticeable).\n\nAll in all I think riot are doing good things with player behaviour. You're always gonna get the odd dipshit here or there but these are the exceptions and not the rule.\n\nkey thing is not to be the dipshit.","replies":[{"poster":"JokerZZZ","date":"2017-06-15T17:41:33.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i am super unlucky then when i am still getting rage quit and inten feed ever since i posted. \n10 bans is good when everyone can ban a champ but this is not the problem (well even my team counter pick enemy and still lose like shiit), i don't see there are improvement about the behavior from players, it is odd after every game and show up who am I going to honor. \nI am silver too and I do know there are still lots of thing that I can improve, I climb from b5 and S3 is thats all i can climb up with the trolls in my team.

I've had about 6 games straight where a dipshit has ruined it. But then I get games where the team is on point and we dominate them. But on balance the other team gets them about the same amount too.\n\nDont let it get you down. It is much better than what it used to be.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
