If you aren't using an exploit like scripting, then you won't get banned for it. In the *extreme* case that you're boy-cotted and a large sum of people work together to try and get you banned for something you're not doing, you can always apply for an appeal. A red will then investigate and deduce if you were really using an exploit or not. If you weren't, then you have nothing to fear.\n\nBest of luck on the fields of juice.","replies":[]}]}
