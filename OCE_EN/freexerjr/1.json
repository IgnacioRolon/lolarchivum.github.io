I'm surprised custom games don't have more of a following really. I'm sure Riot (Pendragon, Guinsoo im looking at you, i still remember playing Dota with you around 2004 mark with Guinsoo! think it was 3.26 or there abouts. You were using Lion for his Finger of FU and Die!) remembered their gaming/design days of using the Warcraft 3 platform to create Dota back in the days, custom game features from War3 became so popular that the main RTS component was generally overlooked by the vast bulk of gamers back then. (South Korea excluded... they actually set up colleges for SC2 and WAR3/Dota).\n\nHonestly, with leagues graphic system, i'd probably use it to play some tower defense games or RPG style dungeon crawler more than i would play the rift.\n\nWhen you get around to it today/tomorrow toss me an ingame invite, same name. \n\nI reckon if there number's aren't really there and people are more or less in the same skill zone, do 3v3 version of this in TTL. \n\nBoth modes imo should be draft pick, i do see a slight issue with ham assassins just facerolling soraka as much as possible.\n\nGood luck trying to stop Talon/Katarin/Shaco from dominating (box for a .5second of dmg time) triple stealth / dash engages, massive opening dmg... Soraka bot never gets a Zhonya so unless you have an on the dot Kayle/Taric to make her immune (or Tham to eat her into protection)... Yeah.... See the issue? \n\nDraft pick should be essential i think, i know we'll end up with 3-4 champs on permaban, but i can really see them making it unfun unless all players agree prior to game.

From there ill help people out joining our TeamSpeak server. \n\nIf people come who say they are, the event might end up having two games running at same time. \n\nYeah I will be playing around with the modes, problem with Draft mode is it takes sooo long. Ill probs do like Bans but blind pick I think thats possible. If not blind picks and bans in lobby. \n\nThanks for your incite and food for thought :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chiefy","date":"2016-07-26T04:50:51.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yer sounds good.\nBut i'm only coming if there is free food.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
