Although a little hard to learn and use when you first pick him up, there is nothing like rushing into a lane, e, qing through a champ and then ulting them and watching the laner do the rest of the work. complete satisfaction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-14T23:13:33.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nocturne sounds like he'd fit the bill for you, as you can build him either damage or more tanky. Plus his ulti is like the assassination ultimate that dreams are made of and is virtually the best gank in the game. Gragas is always incredibly consistent as a jungler and brings a lot to a team too.","replies":[{"poster":"Krimzonn","date":"2016-09-15T00:07:32.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now im crazy torn between nocturne and gragas ;-;","replies":[{"poster":"Cuddly Panda","date":"2016-09-15T01:54:04.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You did say you didn't need another AP or tank jungle. I would go for Nocturne or Graves, both are similar.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
