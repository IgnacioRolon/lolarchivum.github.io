Xerath is an immobile long ranged mage who plays on the backline whereas Zac is a (fairly) short ranged tanky fighter who dives in the front line. Since I cannot compare their roles, I’ll do my best in evaluating each one in their own field\n\nAssuming you can hit a lot of your skillshots, Xerath will always be under-appreciated. His raw damage isn’t directly overwhelming but definitely very sufficient in becoming a carry mage. What he lacks in mobility he makes up for in range. So if your enemies can’t get to you, they’re dead. If they got to you, you’re dead. His range can pressure off almost any other champion in the game (except another Xerath). His mana isn’t too much of a problem either with his passive. Early game you’ll be able to easily win lane as long as you don’t over extend, with a jungler with moderate CC, he has good kill potential and snowballing potential. Mid game you’ll be able to assist all lanes without needing to be there due to his insane range. Also because of his insane range, he’s one of the mages (or champions overall) who can dish out his full damage combo across a thick wall. Late game, with the protection of his team, you’ll be able to poke the enemies so hard that, instead of winning a teamfight, completely negate the enemy’s chances of initiating one at all.\n\nZac on the other hand just just the blobby tank who gets in the middle of everything. Literally. Depending on where you play him however, the different stages of the game will be different, but not all that different. His most notable CC is airbornes which cannot be cleansed, thus Zac makes for a very good disruptor. His passive also allows for some funny moments. The only problem with Zac, is that he’s fairly medium ranged and his main mobility ability is a channel windup, which means it can be easily cancelled. To counter-argue that however, his mobility ability is absolutely amazing if hit. Early game in the jungle, you’ll be farming and ganking as always, your E basically allows you to gank from weird and unexpected areas so you have less chance of being spotted by wards (still depends on where you gank from). Your sustain in the jungle is nice, however you gain the most sustain when you’re on low health which makes you susceptible to being counter jungled. Your mid game and late game then should be around the same, trying to disrupt as many people as possible. You’re not the carry, don’t chase after kills if your presence can be needed more somewhere else.\n\nHopefully this clears some things up for you. Both are quite reliable as long as you can hit skillshots.\n\nMy personal bias however goes towards Xerath just because I like skillshots :P","replies":[]}]}
