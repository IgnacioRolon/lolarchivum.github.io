Getting a good ping in the Indonesia region is hard, because of the geographical spacing between the server and your location. If Riot were to get superfluous funding one day, maybe they would expand it to reach further up north, but for the moment the best is to make-do with what we have.\n\nWTFast *may* improve your connection, but not always. It's because they route your connection through their servers, which are located in more areas than Riot's servers in Indonesia specifically. In areas such as Australia and New Zealand, the improvement you get from using a proxy like WTFast is negligible (around 5 ping) because the servers are much closer. In addition to this, playing League with a proxy is actually against the EULA, but I'm pretty sure you won't be pulled up for it because of your legitimate use of it (to get reasonable ping and nothing else).\n\ntl dr; Riot will need a lot of incentive to expand OCE's servers to the Indonesian region.","replies":[]}]}
