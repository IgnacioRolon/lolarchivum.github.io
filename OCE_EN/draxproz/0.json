If you're going to make a thread about something, black out ALL names (apart from your own if you wish) but even then there's little point.\n\nLeaverBuster has been tightened up recently, you don't even need to make a thread/support ticket because he'll quickly get punished if he leaves more games. Since it's ranked I believe you get punished after a single leave, but I might be wrong there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-18T11:48:39.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket if it annoyed you that much.
