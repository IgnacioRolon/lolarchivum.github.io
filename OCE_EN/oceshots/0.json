(oops no tokens left)\nThen those chromas/borders went away, but you could still get the halloween skins? Then 2 of the skins went away, but one is still remaining?

Yeah he's bought tokens but relative to everything he's bought not that many (that he's shared anyway) and still had heaps for Prestige Kai'sa, he was asking what it was like for others.\n\nFor the record this isn't the first time a themed skin has been left off the legacy list. Snow Day Bard was the same, left off the list because it was for a new champion that only has a few skins to their name.

It's just a matter of how many $$$ are you willing to spend.\nIt removes the easy/difficult equation.\n\nIf you only bought the pass and have to work for every token, then it's a matter of how easy/hard it was to get.\n\nHow he managed to get the Kai'sa skin, and all the other stuff, while playing less hours than me per week, however, is a mystery. and I want in on that secret.\n\nI wasn't aware that Bard was left off the list.\nEither way, it still doesn't make the event any less rollercoasterish.\n\nThey need to seriously revamp the way the indicate how long things are staying in the shop, and when/if they will return.\nThe way ESO does it makes so much sense, just put a timer on the item \"3 days left\", complete transparency.\nWho knew how long non-skin content like orbs and bundles were staying for. And I don't remember seeing a date on the Khaâ€™Zix chromas _(but I could have missed that one)_.\n\nAlso league almost never specifies what is legacy content, and what is 1-time limited content.\n\nIt seems like these chromas could return every year right?\nExcept that I couldn't help but notice that Ashe wasn't among them (which isn't explained), which suggests that her chroma/border is limited, which poses the question, are these ones also 1-time only?\n\nWill the Kai'sa skin remain available through crafting?
