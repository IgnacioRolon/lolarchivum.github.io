I've only played a few matches (coop and blind) but it just seems like they take so much damage now, even though their defences have actually gone up. One of my friends whom I played with yesterday feels the same way.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-21T04:02:37.874+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be a couple of things attributing to this feeling:\n\n- Turret plating gold rewards makes players want to prioritize damaging the turret especially before plating falls off. Meaning that even with the extra resistances they may go down around the same time if not earlier.\n- The Health bars look bigger, so damage dealt looks like it comes in bigger chunks than before.\n\nJust my theory.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-21T22:51:17.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'll play on this account after work to check if it is just i'm hitting turrets more often or not (I play differently according to accounts.

Even the temp \"Bulwark\" buff after a plate is destroyed feels inconsequential, and all of this from both an offensive and defensive perspective. I really feel like the defensive \"buffs\" from the turret plating could be scaled up significantly without making too much difference.\n\nThat said, it is still early, so I don't really know whether to put much \"weight\" behind that observation at this point. I'd like it to actually feel like it's a significant change, and that it actually makes a defensive lane more viable, but it just doesn't seem that practical in-game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-21T02:25:12.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree they don't feel that much harder to kill for the rewards it offers, though I do think it shifts focus a little bit.
