(didnt get to got to gold2 when i wanted plat).\r\n\r\nFrom mastering the cheese with the old rune system to de-ranking to silver experimenting the new rune system.\r\n\r\nFrom being a Top/Jungle main to playing everywhere and anywhere i&#039;m needed. \r\n\r\nThis season has been massive. This year has been massive. \r\n\r\nI feel like i&#039;m only satisfied with this season because i made it midway Plat on this account.... Because looking back at all &quot;punishment for verbal abuse&quot; they added to the oceanic server just felt unfair and discouraged me to even play this game and being punished for having passion for this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough after many personal reports i feel like i&#039;m finding a lot more people that just want to pay to win instead of pointless flaming. \r\n\r\nand before people say &quot;you said pointless flaming before how did you get perma banned?&quot; well if i can see someone talking shit about me i need to reply its a personal thing that i&#039;m dealing with by muting all and playing the game. \r\n\r\nOverall tho i&#039;m please with my personal performance and happy to see where league if going as a game just un-pleased with match making, what riot focus on punishing and a few champion tunes (taliyah mainly). \r\n \r\nhopefully i hit diamond in pre season but hopefully see you all on the rift :)","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-11-14T08:27:43.301+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I’m no longer a bronze scrub so that’s exciting","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-14T20:43:22.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AYE!!!! gj my friend you'll be climbing in no time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T08:54:39.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never had particularly high ranked ambitions, but finally bothered to make the push for plat after...how many seasons in Gold now? So that's kinda neat.\n\nFor me the most exciting part is all the new preseason stuff coming soon and a shiny free skin (and this year, chromas!) for a champion I actually play!. I can't pretend what colour my border is means all that much to me, but the fact that the Victorious skin is actually for a champion I play more than once every never is a nice time.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-13T20:56:16.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you certainly picked the right champ to support with (Nami mian >.>) good job tho!\n\n\n\nyeah I'm yet to have ANY champ i play have the victorious skin but im sure its well off that happening anytime soon as the champs i play are new or i personally think far off.\n\n\nI guess we're counter parts with league as i want to be up there in the ranks and personally i dont think the victorious skin feels very \"victorious\" i feel like it's a glorified \"gold\" skin for a champ (but that's between you and me)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-14T00:50:59.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean the Victorious skin kinda *is* a glorified gold skin if you've never had to struggle to gold before. I didn't play ranked at all for years. Placed Bronze first year and just said \"nope that's not happening\" and waited a while more while I improved (the pro tip being, don't play ranked out of the gate with unrealistic expectations). \n\nWhen I finally went for the climb I wasn't new to the game. I only spent a few games in Bronze, and not all that many in Silver, so Gold wasn't the huge achievement that it is for some people. I think that's why Plat means a bit more to me this year, because it felt like an actual accomplishment rather than just my rank rising to match accumulated skill. I was much more actively focusing on mistakes and how to fix them, improving things I'd been too lazy to improve before, and it paid off. \n\nWhich I suppose, is the whole point of ranked in the first place :)","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-14T03:06:23.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i did struggle hard when i first played the game, i got placed in Silver 4 in the pre season of season 6 to season 7 had a month of silver game play then the reset started and i got placed bronze 4... played that season and actually had a mate that was challenger and ranked in the top 50 of OCE solo Que at that time and we played a lot of in-house games with ranked from bronze (me) to challenger and actually learnt that i was best in top lane as i could keep up with the gold player (he was a top laner). So basically a little struggle but i was technically \"trained\". \n\nWith all that said and done i really don't really think a skin that has a whole year to make should look so plain when you can literally NEVER have the chance to get them again. \n\nI agree that plat is an amazing feeling to reach and cant wait to reach diamond before the next season starts","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-14T03:52:18.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing with/against higher rank players imo is the fastest way to learn and gain experience. Not too much higher mind or you have no idea what's happening, but my most significant improvement occurred just from playing normals with Gold-Plat players (as a relatively new player).\n\nYou can only get so far without actively improving of course, but I think a problem a lot of people have is a lack of perspective. They believe they should be ranked higher than they are because they perform consistently in their rank, but have never experienced higher ranks to really see the difference. This is especially true for solo players who never really stray from their mmr range. \n\nSimply put, less exposure, so less experience. I realised real quick that I wasn't hot stuff, because I was playing with people who relative to me, were, and they were a lot better. In my mind playing normals with higher ranked players is a *really* good way to earn some experience.\n\nAs for the skin, I'm a big fan of the aesthetic of the Victorious skins, which I suppose is a big bonus, everyone has their different preferences. I really don't like the wrestling skins for example, but my partner thinks they're great. Ultimately, they're 1350 tier skins, and I can understand not making them higher given their limited availability. It needs to be good enough to strive for, but not so good that losing out is a game-wrecking experience.\n\n(They also don't take the whole year to make it, since they have to determine which champ gets it first, a champ that has been influential in the ranked scene in the first half of the year. I gather from dev blogs and such they actually sometimes have an alarmingly short stretch of time to develop the skin.)\n\nI'd love to hit Diamond, it has the best borders/motifs/visuals/etc. in my mind, but I don't really have any realistic expectation of it. I'm just not dedicated enough to the game or to ranked. Maybe one day :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kurinth","date":"2018-11-13T06:32:35.600+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made it to gold for the first time in an actual attempt to climb up just before the start of Worlds.
