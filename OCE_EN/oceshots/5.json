If it's normals, then complaints are irrelevant. And mute flaming teammates if they are doing that in normals.\n\nHowever for ranked, it's about time how Riot thought about how newbies are placed. Also the balancing of players with similar rank should be enabled for that ROLE. To avoid an op support vs op jungler (with everyone else roughly even) situation for example.\n\nAnd also they should take up the suggestion that a champion has to be at least level 5 mastery before a player can pick them in ranked. A serious suggestion that will avoid trolling and give the player some experience before using it in ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-10-09T09:35:21.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was ranked no one should be sad over norms. \n\neven my game that i play on my phone (vainglory) it has a system where you wont vs people out of your rank, and if 1 player afk's you dont lose any ranked points","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-29T02:04:25.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that newbies should probably be started a little lower, or at least take some cues from their normal MMR for their start of ranked. The role matchups are the purpose of next seasons ranked changes (you'll have a separate rank for each role).\n\nI also agree that players should have to be *at least* mastery 2 with a champion before they can play it in ranked. It really doesn't take that many games. I appreciate the reasons for the freedom, but having someone play a new champ in ranked for the first time just because \"the new champs are always OP\", *especially* when it's a high skill cap champ like Azir/Aurelion/Zoe is infuriating.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
