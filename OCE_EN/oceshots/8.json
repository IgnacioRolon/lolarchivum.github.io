(what ever- next game)\r\n\r\n4th game:\r\n&quot;Kai As&#039;s wet dream team&quot; - this game with every hero on my team shouldve been a team game stomp as everyone of my teammmates in one way or another apply a stack to my passive in a team fight.\r\n- naut gets dove countless amounts of times the poor guy. \r\n- gragas from the moment he was able to just wouldnt stop asking for an ff (even when we were winning at one point) \r\n- jgler for some reason from the get go kept spamming &quot;we wont win this&quot;\r\n- sona... well low elo support poor guy didnt know where or how to stand in a team fight\r\n\r\n5th game:\r\ni was heavily suppressed by the pressure lee had on me but did not die until yi roamed and i was dove under tier 2 tower while my first tower was over half health.\r\n- udyr jg was bvery clearly trolling, pinging that he was coming. would stand in lane wait for you to engage, walk up then walk off and if you died from the engage he would start fighting and int.\r\n- fiora.... man this player... inted. plain and simple\r\n-bot lane actually won but lee and yi&#039;s power and skill out matches up all especially considering they were hand fed.\r\n\r\nGame 6:\r\ni get the Lee from last game (i am so excited I&#039;m actually going to win one) \r\nlee- REFUSED to gank at all, even refused to gank his duo (jax - the ryze from last game) i would let akali push i blew both her sums lee would no joke sit in the bush and i would engage then he would no joke watch. \r\njax - somehow hand fed the ornn and came out of lane 0/3 (but of course i get the only jax in OCE to take grasp on jax) \r\nbot lane were good players not sure how they went so poorly in lane but they did flame lee for not ganking at all \r\n\r\ngame 7: ranked is down had to play norms \r\n\r\nevery lane wins and i get a quadra kill...... the fuck","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2018-10-10T05:47:47.314+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I've had the same the past few days.\n\nI play support my top and mid combined got 25 deaths pre 20 minutes so that game is done.\nI play top next game, my bot and mid lose towers in sub 8 minutes.
