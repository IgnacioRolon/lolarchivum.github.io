If this sort of person is still unwilling to change their ways they will face the law once again on their new persona. If we still compare this \"felony\" to league/esports then this is the reason why some players were sanctioned before worlds for breaking rules. And those challenger players were named and shamed on Riot's own news page.\n\n> To encourage reform, you have to make it as easy as possible in the short term.\n\nTo encourage reform, a person firstly must be remorseful for what they did. Proper punishments are essential.\n\nLet's talk about why Riot hold this double standard with esports professionals and the average player. From their point of view, they do not want to spend the finances needed to make such proper punishments. They have obviously calculated the numbers. So prohibiting naming and shaming is simply to draw less attention to their ineffective system and keep costs down.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-09-05T22:06:06.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Your point is as follows: \n\n\"Suffer the loss in time and effort.

The only power we have is on these boards, and we are tasked with maintaining a peaceful and constructive environment, which obviously requires certain rules and guidelines to achieve. There is no reason to believe that players coming onto the boards and pointing out the shitty behaviour of others (often without proof) is constructive in any way, as it often leads to abuse and harassment, as well as individuals misrepresenting the truth for personal gain. If you want to discuss the flaws in Riot's systems, you can do so without breaching the \"name and shame\" policy, and I would encourage you to do so.\n\nIf you want players in-game behaviours dealt with, you need to take that up with Riot directly. You are free to report those players and follow up with support, and there is nothing Riot can do about you \"naming and shaming\" on platforms they don't control. **That is not something we can help you with**, beyond giving advice and guidance (which, let's be honest, is not going to change the outcome).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-09-06T08:03:49.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=OCEshots,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=wY8Ejqot,comment-id=00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001,timestamp=2019-09-06T04:05:42.987+0000)\n>\n> just direct a person the right way to bring this up with RIOT or Tencent\n\nI get the distinct feeling you're not going to like what I have to say about that.\n\nThe primary approach of bringing something up with Riot is to go through [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (which I'm certain you have been told personally on more than a few occasions), during which you can feel free to discuss the issue in it's fullest, without being restricted by things like the \"no name and shame\" policy. You're not likely to get much/any discussion from it, though. It's not as if it's impossible to contact Rioters directly, either, but they'll probably just tell you to go through Support (or the boards) anyway, since most of them wouldn't be getting payed for that kind of thing.\n\nWith that said;\n\nThe boards themselves are a good approach to bring up issues within the community, **so long as it's constructive discussion**, though are much more of an indirect approach of bringing an issue to the attention of Riot. This is something that will incite discussion and support from the community, which in itself may draw Riot's attention to pressing issues. Things like going on a rant, complaining \"for the sake of complaining\", and \"finger pointing\" are *not* constructive, they simply detract from the point that's being made and annoy or anger people.\n\nYou can also attempt to discuss the issues in other official platforms, such as the Official NA Discord Server, of which several Rioters are involved in. There are also other platforms available to you that can act to incite discussion and support from the community, such as Reddit, Youtube, Twitch, various social media platforms, etc. Though those are somewhat less likely to attract Riot's attention than the boards. A united community is *much* more likely to incite actual change than a single individual  (or even a few individuals) who just appears to be ranting.\n\nThere is no shortage of options available for you to discuss the issues. The way I see it, the main thing standing in your way is the way you frame your posts, you consistently fail to make them constructive. Just look at the original post in this thread for example; all you've done is basically say \"hey, I got these shit players on my team, obviously Riot's systems are fucked\", and that's it. You've said nothing that explores the issue any further than that.\n\nIn future, I'd recommend you seriously consider actually putting effort into your posts to actually *try* and be constructive, explore the issues beyond \"shit's fucked\", and you might actually see a difference in the way that others respond to that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-09-06T04:05:42.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you guys have to consistently be told that being a rep for this company you will be referred to as \"you guys\" you guys are in the wrong domain mate.\n\ni had pure proof of their shitty behavior and fuck personal game i want something to change for this shit. this is becoming bullshit stop fucking defending this shitty way and just direct a person the right way to bring this up with RIOT or Tencent \n\nI have taken every issue i have ever taken to boards to riot as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-08-31T03:14:15.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That is strange, i recall that a certain someone said he would quit this game months ago. \n\n> WHY is there no policing on this shit?? \"it's hard\"? bro you have billions because of this game get your shit together tencent and riot.\n\nAnd on the matter of making money and using it to hand out punishment, you would know about that 1st hand. \n\nWhen you got banned, it is them being unfair.
