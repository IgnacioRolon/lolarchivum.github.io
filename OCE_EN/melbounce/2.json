I call before two other people join but one calls after they join not seeing my call and instalock or argue with me they got the role and the other support them because they did not see my call.\r\nEven worse still being chat locked because everyone spams their role.\r\nCalling your role is a stupid idea but the only way to actually get the role.\r\nCalling roles creates toxic behavior in chat because a person wants that role but didn&#039;t get it.\r\n\r\nThe system is really stupid and either needs to be removed or updated.\r\nJust use the team builder style where we pick our lanes and go into blind pick so no arguing occurs.","replies":[{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2016-09-02T07:58:38.087+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree role calling is stupid... but instead of complaining I just became a fill main.","replies":[{"poster":"Melbounce","date":"2016-09-02T22:10:12.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with that is watching your team feed over and over again. The adc has no idea about lane positioning, you get non stop blame as a support from bad adc's and I really don't have many support champions. It also reverses as well where your support lets the enemy support zone, your supp non stop farms or they simple try for kill lane not getting a sight stone. A good jungler will see that the enemy support has no sight stone so they will camp that bot lane.\nThis is why I totally stay away from playing adc or support since the changes in 6.15.\nI now hate top lane due to non stop Darius, Yasuo, Riven and Kled so I don't bother.\nI am also sick of seeing Yasuo and Zed mid so I don't both their either leaving really one job for me and that is jungle.\nI have many jungler to choose from based on the team comp. Shaco, Eve, Xin, Rammus and Amumu to mention a few that can easily fill what is needed.\nI just want draft normals where I am not losing lp because of some premade or smurfs.\nI am very scared of getting put into bronze. Moving back to Aus after working in the EU, I was playing on EUW and was high silver there, I really don't want to deal with bronzies in OCE. Seeing bronzies in norms do the most stupid stuff which makes me laugh and sometimes cry.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Melbounce","date":"2016-09-02T06:10:31.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lobby after lobby of non stop arguing and toxicity over lane calling.\nYou are not even allowed to spell the lane name wrong. If you spell otp dac or anything like that you don't get that lane.\nWhy have you not addressed this stupid way of trying to start a match.\nAlready most players are on tilt because of this.\nInstead of communicating and working out a good team comp we are all fighting over a roll or busy calling roles.\nJust plain stupid.\nI would not be normally complaining but idiots at riot brought in dynamic queue removed  solo queue.\nI don't want to play ranked at all until they bring back solo queue.\nSo I am stuck playing blind normals.\nOther game modes are boring as I like the rift, I like jungling, I like the strategy being on the rift.","replies":[]}]}
