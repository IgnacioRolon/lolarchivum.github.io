I get told to kys, learn to play a skilled champ, I am a noob and many other abuses by my team or the enemy player.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t mind a little bit of banter but game after game of the abuse just gets too much.\r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t know if I can continue to play league any more.\r\n\r\nThis is not a troll post, this really happens.\r\n\r\nWhy am I not allowed to play Heimer when other people are allowed to lock in their favourite champ and not get berated for it. \r\n\r\nI just don&#039;t understand this community.

Heimer mid is so much more annoying to play against and if done right he can just lockdown the enemy mid and stop them from roaming with push pressure and force the entire enemy team into grouping too early giving your team the advantage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-23T10:03:13.031+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah just mute them. When I play Garen top, if I start dominating my lane I get toxicity about how easy Garen is to play, he is an op champ, he is broken, anyone can play Garen play someone hard and see how you go.... I just laugh to myself and continue to dominate lane. Then late game, single out the toxic ones EVERY team fight and watch them get madder at life xD\n\nI enjoy reading the hate tbh, I get a good laugh from it. I never reply, just enjoy the read. But if it gets to you, best bet is to mute them and enjoy your game.\n\nSee you on the rift\n{{champion:74}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2016-08-22T11:01:37.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There happens to be a negative connotation around champions like Heimerdinger and Teemo.
