Ekko, the boy who shattered time, hummed tunes from his favourite rock band that he _totally_ didn&rsquo;t make up himself. He was perched on a small cold stone just outside the shallow river, staring aimlessly into an open cavern. Soon the cavern would have a gigantic purple worm dripping boiling green acid all over the floor, until then however it was hell of a good place to stretch and relax. \r\n\r\n_If only it wasn&rsquo;t so cold._\r\n\r\nNo one had been able to explain the freezing cold that had swept through the rift only a few hours earlier. It crept through quietly, robbing warmth and spreading out a low thick grey fog all across the land. Ekko secretly thought it was a little intimidating, not that he was about to go admit that to anyone; he&rsquo;d rather fight Baron Nashor on his own. \r\n\r\n_Huh, a noise?_ \r\n\r\nEkko turned quickly to his right side, almost falling off his rock in surprise. He had reflexes unmatched by most mortal man in Plitover but nothing had trained him from what he came face to face with. The source of the depressing cold? Almost definitely. \r\n\r\nIt somewhat reminded him of that crazy pyromancer Brand&#039;s Zombie costume but the mage&rsquo;s silly outfit was nothing compared to the real deal staring back at Ekko with lifeless dead eyes. Flesh hung uselessly from the creature&rsquo;s jawline. Blood dripped steadily from its left eye socket. One leg was dragged behind its body, twisted just enough for dull yellow bone to jut out from the flesh. The robe it wore was ripped to pieces, covering hardly any of the pale green body underneath it. Only a few hours ago, this creature was fighting aggressively to take down a nexus on the rift. \r\n\r\n_A minion&hellip;_\r\n\r\nThe small humanoid creature opened what was left of its mouth, still staring directly at Ekko. Time slowed as the thing&rsquo;s stare became almost hypnotic, rendering Ekko completely immobile. A shrill screech started to emit from the creature&rsquo;s mouth, getting louder and louder. Ekko found himself unable to pull away from that empty stare. It was like being suppressed by Malzahar&rsquo;s ultimate Nether Grasp - stuck, unable to fight back. The haunting screeching zombie minion ambled towards him. It was a twisted jolting movement. Its head never once breaking eye contact, continuing to suck him in. \r\n\r\n_Maybe I used up all my time._ \r\n\r\nDread coursed through Ekko at the thought that if this twisted little thing touched him, he might never respawn on the rift again. Desperately he willed his body to move as the creature inched closer, as if enjoying the trauma it was causing, playing with its food.  He could feel its icy breathe on his cheek, choking on the stench of rotting flesh as blood began to drip onto his arm from the minion&rsquo;s eye socket. Suddenly the minion stopped screeching and crumpled to the ground, its head leaving a disgusting smear of flesh and blood as it slid down his side to the forest floor. \r\n\r\nSomething stood behind the fallen minion, bent over and shaking slightly. Ekko slowly becoming undazed shook the fear and dread from his mind and watched the newcomer curiously. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;OH MY GOD, DID YOU SEE YOUR FACE? HA! I guess not since you don&rsquo;t have a mirror! IT. WAS. PRICELESS!&rdquo; The shadowed figure yelled out playfully through laughter before they fell to the ground and broke into a long burst of insane high pitched giggles. \r\n\r\nEkko dropped to the stone behind him and regarded the crazy blue-haired lady with a mix of disbelief and admiration. &ldquo;Jinx?! What on Runeterra is going on? Never seen anything like that in my time.&rdquo; He called over, sternly but friendly. \r\n\r\nJinx picked herself up from the dirt floor, still shaking somewhat with laughter. She glanced at Ekko with a wild eye and pranced towards him. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s simple, dummy!&rdquo; She stopped to pat him on the head like she was talking to a small child. &ldquo;All the minions on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift got mutated! They are all zombies now!&rdquo; She said, glee shining in her eyes. \r\n\r\n_Maybe befriending one of the crazier people from my hometown wasn&rsquo;t such a good idea._\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Zombies? That&rsquo;s impossible, Jinx. The rift was perfect only a few hours ago when we wrecked the Noxus team in a game.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ah, yes, my Ekko. Then the cold happened! I believe in Bilgewater they call it the Harrowing. Never seen it myself, but me and darling Fishbones here have wanted to visit for so long!&rdquo; Jinx drew out the last few words trying to emphasise how much she wanted to visit the Harrowing, Ekko just thought it made her sound crazier. He kinda liked crazy. \r\n\r\nJinx grabbed his right hand with hers, not seeming to care that he was covered in minion flesh on that side. Ekko was mildly surprised she hadn&rsquo;t tried to roll in the dead minion, seems like the type of thing crazy does. Jinx pulled him to his feet in one quick movement and began checking him over, assumedly for damage but Ekko couldn&rsquo;t help but warm somewhat despite himself. She stepped back and nodded to herself, dropping his hand. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This has been fun! We should do it again sometime. Zombies, watching you almost die, good times!&rdquo; Jinx said too cheerfully for the subject matter, as far as Ekko was concerned. &ldquo;I need to leave now. Got to bag myself one of these delightful zombies! Just imagine how much fun we could have with one of these beauties in Piltover.&rdquo; She laughed evilly, like a mad scientist that had just created a chaotic army to control. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Good luck? I suppose.&rdquo; Ekko murmured, watching as Jinx swung Fishbones onto her back and darted off towards the Blue Sentinel. \r\n\r\nThe young man soon found himself pacing along the riverbed, absentmindedly playing with his Zero-Drive. He was still twirling in in his hands when he came across the next zombie. \r\n\r\nJudging by how long it had taken the creature to find him, they must be sticking to lanes, following some kind of long-lived instinct. This time Ekko wouldn&rsquo;t be taken by surprise and let the zombie control him. He started by throwing out his Z-Drive towards the creature, slowing its odd shambling movement. The zombie seemed to shrug the attack off, continuing its quiet walking. \r\n\r\n_It isn&rsquo;t screeching. Must only do it when it immobilises its victim. As long as I don&rsquo;t look at it&hellip;_\r\n\r\nEkko ran at the disgusting rotten minion from a slight angle, getting ready to dash at it with a well-aimed Phase Dive. If he aimed at the slightly broken-looking neck, he should be able to cleave the thing right off. \r\n\r\nOne.\r\n\r\nTwo.\r\n\r\nThree&hellip; \r\n\r\nEkko blinked over to the minion. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Four!&rdquo; A deep voice shouted from the general direction of midlane and a bullet came screaming towards the zombie minion, exploding its rotten head. Ekko reappeared just in time to get a nasty wet spray of brain, flesh and bone all down his front. As he stood, weapon still raised to kill the minion, a piece of skull slid down his nose and fell to the ground. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Greetings, young Piltover boy. I&rsquo;m afraid you have my art all over your pretty little face.&rdquo; Jhin announced as he appeared gracefully from between two large trees, grimacing slightly. &ldquo;I am rather disappointed, that one was truly a masterpiece. Zombies are so interesting to slaughter. So different from normal. I can kill as many as I please, but they have those horrid lifeless eyes. I just want to create something beautiful from their existence in this world.&rdquo; He spoke quietly with a calm authority that made Ekko want to listen to more. He shook himself to rid the idea. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh, hi&hellip; Jhin. What do you mean, your masterpiece? That zombie was mine!&rdquo; Ekko said, angrily pointing at the dead body of the minion. \r\n\r\nJhin observed Ekko silently for a few slow seconds then began to laugh. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yours? Dear boy, nothing belongs to anyone in death but the one who blessed it with death. Which was me, therefore it is my zombie artwork.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nEkko rolled his eyes sarcastic. &ldquo;Oh sure, go ahead. It&rsquo;s all yours.&rdquo; He stormed away from Jhin towards midlane before turning back. &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;m done. You and Jinx can have all the zombies, I&rsquo;m done with this crazy train.&rdquo; He stuck his tongue out at the assassin and stomped off. \r\n\r\n_Childish but effective._ \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go that way if I we-&ldquo; Jhin&rsquo;s warning was cut off by the humming of a bomb&hellip; a Mega Inferno Bomb headed straight for him. Ekko froze.\r\n\r\n_How much crazy is there on Summoner&rsquo;s Rift today?! I know&hellip;_\r\n\r\nEkko quickly got his Zero-Drive to start and sighed. \r\n\r\n_Time to restart the day. Stupid zombies._","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:36:14.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creepy and gory. Superb. Such an entertaining read! The interactions between Jinx and Ekko is so amusing. Who else will use the corpse of a minion to play tricks on other people?
