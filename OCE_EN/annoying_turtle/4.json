I know the amount of unban me spam that is posted here and Im having a hard time figuring out if its even possible to appeal it. Anyway, there is one game listed for the ban with these messages;\n\nGame 1\nIn-Game\n: gah\n: out of range rat\n: %%%%%%%%%%% CHANG\n: ???\n: sell ur scimitar you wimp\n: WIMP\n: k\n\nNot sure exactly why I was banned here, probably thought %%%%%%%%%%% chang was racist I guess. Not sure if it was in reply to someone on discord or some other language, is that really bannable? Or because I called them a rat? I mean sure. Pretty harmless in game URF banter. \n\nSeems pretty odd to me that after hitting honor level 5 or something from having no honor without ever getting a warning or anything at all, this is what ruins that :/. Makes me pretty scared to type in game.\n\nEdit: Holy shit, the words chi-ng cho-ng together are a banned??????????????????

They'll manually review the case to determine if there's any cause for a reduction/removal, and will be able to provide any additional context that is relevant. In saying that, it's quite rare for appeals top be successful, which is due to the fact they only go through if there was an unnecessary punishment (or over-punishment), which is rare in itself (though, there's no harm in checking).\n\nSo far as your case specifically, I'd imagine it was the racist comment that pushed it over the edge to trigger the punishment here (note; racism is categorised as \"zero-tolerance language\", alongside things like homophobia, suicide encouragement, etc. and is treated with significantly more scrutiny). Considering the logs provided here, it *may* be possible to get a reduction due to the fact it appears to be primarily only one comment that has triggered the punishment, but it may also be possible that there is additional context that hasn't appeared on the reform card (the Support staff will be able to verify that). I would recommend you submit an appeal just to be sure.\n\nKeep in mind that the next punishment after a 14-day ban is a permanent ban, so it would be beneficial for you to reflect on this situation as a good example of why it is important to avoid such \"extreme\" language in the future. Ultimately, if you can't say anything nice and/or constructive, it's best to say nothing.","replies":[]}]}
