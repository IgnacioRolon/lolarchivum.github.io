At one point my jungler came to gank while she is in her parry stance i use ignite on her but i didnt see the ignite affect her at all and she already blocked my stun and she survives because of my ignite not landing on her. is this a bug or was this intended?","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-21T23:49:00.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe it block all skill","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-21T13:38:06.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes. for the 800th time this week\n\nit blocks **EVERYTHING**","replies":[]}]}
