The added filters here make it so that the system has to be some lenient sometimes to avoid monstrous queue times. The balancing will still try to match the MMR of most teems as appropriately as possible regardless of your party size. So although you may be against a higher level trio, you may get one yourself!\n\nIt's unfortunate that it happened to you twice in a row, and I understand it may seem unfair, but when you take into account how small our server/playerbase is the Dynamic Queue matchmaking does its job a good amount of the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kevin Rudd","date":"2016-05-11T14:56:36.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:266}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:83}}    {{champion:89}}{{champion:57}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:2}}","replies":[]}]}
