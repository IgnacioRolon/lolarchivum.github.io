Not custom, co-op vs ai, or normal games.\nWhen i start the game, instead of having the champion loading screen, i have a black screen, forcing me to cntrl + opt + escape, and when i tab, the client says \"You have left the game... Reconnect\" \n\nI've repaired client, restarted computer and internet multiple times, to no avail. \nAnyone have tips/ experiencing same thing?
