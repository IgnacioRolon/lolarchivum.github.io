I had 284 ad and I read the dmg that Runnans does and around 149 or something like that. Thought my main AA was doing 149 and the bolts did 24 dmg all to minions (without Barron Buff) now that isn&#039;t right. So my real AA dmg was only doing 149 when i should be doing around 274 per AA (The dmg that each bolt should be doing is 149 yet thats what my AA dmg was doing while the bolts then instead were doing 24 dmg per AA) This bug lost me the game, as twitch is a item dependent champ and i realised this at the end of the game.
