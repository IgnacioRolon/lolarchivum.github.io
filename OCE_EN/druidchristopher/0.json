Duoing artificially inflates MMR so if you were consistently able to perform at this level then it would indicate your natural MMR is somewhere at the level (unranked MMR starts at a sliver 4/5 level and adjusts from there, with the biggest LP gain and loss happening in the first three games. Duo MMR would be high silver and would probably reach low gold as you continue winning). \n\n* What was the order of your wins/losses? Apparently the biggest gains/losses in MMR are made in the first 3ish games to try and match you to more suitable opponents instead of making you suffer versing lower/higher skill opponents than you should be matching.","replies":[]}]}
