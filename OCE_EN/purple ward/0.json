They use bandaids to fix problems because it costs too much money to properly investigate what they need to in order to accurately balance this game, I have been playing this game for 5 years now and recently got permabanned for toxicity, what did I learn, let people shit all over you and smile or lose your account. They constantly ignore the fact that the big problems are still big problems and are still there 5 years later. One of the biggest causes of ill written text stems from their horrid match making which again in recent patches has once again been bandaided and still does not function. If they unban perma's it just proves they are wrong. no matter what it was that caused the action that brought about the ban in the first place. \njust play on your smurf mate and don't invest anymore cash into this game they will soon get the idea, I also lost almost 2 g over 5 years. shame is on you riot.
