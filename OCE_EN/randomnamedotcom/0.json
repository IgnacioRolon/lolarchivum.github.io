I am starting to really enjoy the game and would like to purchase a champ named Ahri who is on sale but I am 40 riot points off and was wondering if you could give me 40.\r\n\r\nIf I have to ask somewhere else or I&#039;m just not allowed please could you inform me thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-13T01:57:08.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do sometimes, but there are a few things you should know.\n\n1. Go through support with this, you can open a ticket [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\n2. There is no guarantee they will agree, Riot has no obligation to give you anything.\n\n3. You will have a much better chance if you submit a piece of artwork or a poem or something along with the request (anything you have created that's LoL related). You can find some of the works the community has done in the past for this [HERE](http://rpart.riotgames.com/na/en/).\n\n4. This is a one time deal. Riot will only do this for you once, so I'd be damn sure you want to use it on a champion which you can eventually get for free.\n\nGood luck :)","replies":[{"poster":"randomnamedotcom","date":"2016-03-13T18:13:39.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where do I submit art?\nAnd thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-14T01:06:37.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit it with your request through support.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"randomnamedotcom","date":"2016-03-14T18:22:51.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Up to how much rp can you recieve","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-03-14T21:37:34.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware, there's no hard limit; however, the higher you go, the less chance that you have of receiving that amount. Additionally, it's best to be clear with the amount of RP you need to purchase whatever you're looking to buy, as ambiguous requests for the highest amount they can offer will likely result in a negatory response.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-15T08:53:23.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe they have said in the past they won't do anything more than 50, but you're right in that there's no 'official' limit because the whole process isn't really an 'official' thing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
