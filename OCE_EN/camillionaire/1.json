CCleaner as suggested in FAQ (no effect)\n7. full repair through client after loggin in directly. brings up alpha client once again, bug persists\n\nnormally id just delete the riot client folder and log into league directly until a patch or something fixes the issue but i want to play legends of runeterra when its reopened, ive looked everywhere on how to uninstall/repair only the alpha client or how to fix this issue but all ive seen are \"run as administrator\" or \"fresh reinstall\" which have not worked for me\n\nplease someone help me ive run out of options\n\nEDIT: only thing i can currently think of is something in the last patch changed in the alpha client and my antivirus doesnt like it, going to mess around with it for a bit (seems unlikely since i havent seen 500 of these posts)\n\nEDIT2: firewall and antivirus are not interfering with riot alpha client. also if i try a fresh reinstall of league without the \"riot client\" folder being deleted, it brings up the alpha client login screen and bug persists WITHOUT starting the install (same deal if i try to uninstall, brings up login screen then bug)","replies":[{"poster":"Camillionaire","date":"2020-01-09T19:41:18.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"been over 2 months now, no change yet still cant log in","replies":[]},{"poster":"Im0nMcDonldsWiFi","date":"2019-12-20T10:12:49.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"love how riot doesn't even try to help \n{{sticker:sg-shisa}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Camillionaire","date":"2019-12-15T06:52:33.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its been over a month and this is still happening. would love some suggestions{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
