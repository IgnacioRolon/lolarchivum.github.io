They int on an Unranked account for 30+ games in a row.\n2. They obtain the account from another player.\n\nBoth these cases break ToS and the Summoner&#039;s Code for either inting and intentionally losing or for account sharing. And it&#039;s not like they&#039;re keeping it a secret. They actively admit to getting the account from another player in most cases, so Riot clearly have the evidence. And it&#039;s not like they&#039;re obscure players with only 2 subscribers... these are pros/ex-pros, people with hundreds of thousands of subs, and people in the League Partner Program.\n\nIf a low elo player were to do these, they'd immediately be hit with a ban, especially if they declare their actions to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nAre high elo players somehow exempt from following the ToS and Summoner&#039;s Code?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-09T04:50:59.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"buying, trading or sharing accounts isn't allowed, but the rules are a little more lenient for receiving an account as gift, especially if there is no intention to smurf and you play seriously on that account. \n\nThe ToS and Summoners Code, really focus on boosting, smurfing, and trading accounts for money. It's not like Riot couldn't take action technically, but more like, it's not a blatant violation. A bit like jaywalking and whilst it's technically illegal, unless you do it on a busy road and disrupt traffic, the police really don't care.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-12-12T12:13:42.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, first day of preseason some challengers got placed in iron4","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cody Dumb","date":"2018-12-10T03:10:33.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha, one day #1 rank in NA soloqueue, the next day\n\n[this happens](https://imgur.com/a/5fBVlCk)","replies":[]}]}
