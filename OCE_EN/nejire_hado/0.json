Even looking at their match history, you can see they have a history of this, with no punishment or reform. And yet Riot choose to let them play. Why not permaban inters? Would solve so many issues.\n\nJust have a 0 tolerance for inting. Someone ints once = permaban. Or, better yet... an IP ban. If they have family who play, then tough luck. Now they will have mad relatives. Players will quickly adjust.\n\nBut then, if these inters are banned, who will buy RP? I think I can see the problem here... Riot clearly cares more about money than the playerbase, no matter what they &quot;claim&quot; in their dev diaries.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-24T06:50:07.210+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes people have a terrible lane matchup and get no assistance from their team.\nSometimes people just have a bad game.\nSometimes people are drunk or otherwise wasted.\nSometimes people get tilted by teammates.\n\nMost players don't int just to troll you, there are usually other reasons. The ones that do just int for 'teh lulz' are the ones that do get punishments.\n\nSometimes I have trouble with my net (I'm on the best fiber you can get in this region outside of business connections) and damn straight I feed or afk when I'm finding the game completely unplayable.\n\nThe thing with punishments is that it is a choice to abuse someone in chat. It is not so clear if someone is playing poorly. There are many things that can cause someone to have a bad game, but only one thing that makes them abussive in chat, themselves.\n\nThis is why chat violations are more commonly punished and it shouldn't be hard to understand, for anyone who actually takes a second to think about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-24T00:27:47.680+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because its hard to see if someone is an inter or just bad (especially in the lower divisions).\n\nI have reported and got 2 or 3 trolling people banned in the past, the problem is it takes a while, like they need a good solid history of trolling before it is \"obvious\" in order to warrant a ban.\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Nejire+Hado\n\nLooking over your match history i don't see anyone inting. In fact there is a game where you went 1-10-0 on singed, seems pretty troll to me.\nLooks to me you went support Singed and proxy farmed all the ADCs CS and inted. so i dont know why you are complaining...","replies":[{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-11-24T00:38:51.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Did you see me say I was an exception to the conditions I said? No? Okay. Would help if you could read.\n\nAnd you clearly didn't look hard enough. The Thresh, Miss Fortune, and Graves in the last game spent the first 15 mins inting, and then got some KS's to round out their KDA so they wouldn't get banned. If you watched the replay, you'd see.\n\nAs for the Singed game, I never proxied the ADC. I proxied the top laner and the jungler, and let the ADC lose a 1v2 lane. You shouldn't just go and assume things for no reason. Probably why you missed all the trolls and inters that are obvious on OP.GG if you actually properly look.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-24T00:57:58.918+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know why you are being so rude. My very first line was \"It is hard to tell if someone is inting or just bad\".\n\nThe people are you talking about are low Bronze with negative winrates. Can't really see if they are simply bad at the game or trolling from match histories friend. Riot don't have the time to watch everyones replays and see if they are inting or just bad players.\n\nIt's preseason and you of all people understand preseason doesn't matter that much. Probably why you play AD Soraka and troll with Singed. So lets just leave things be.","replies":[{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-11-24T01:40:09.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"And, wait for it... lost another game due to 3 inters and a troll...\n\nAnd I can guess that Riot will choose not to do anything about those inters and troll...
