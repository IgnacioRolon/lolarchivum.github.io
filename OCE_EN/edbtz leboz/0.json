And it jsut doesnt seem right for me and other people to get reduced prices on rp. it kinda feels like you care about only 1 region and that is NA{{item:3151}} pls fix it and dont be a {{champion:36}} .\r\nThanks rito","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-14T05:52:02.425+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically, we simply lost free stuff.\nRPs is basically money. And money, as Mr. Homer J. Simpson generously explains, can be exchanged for goods and services.\nNow, if the opposite is true, good and services can be exhanged for money, and therefore for RP.\nQuestion is: _how many goods and services do you need to exchange in order to gain a fixed amount of RP in each server?_\n\nBefore, NA players had to exchange a higher amount of goods and service in order to obtain money. Now, all servers are lined up and up to date with the value exchanges.\nSure, it kinda sucks for those who used to \"get the goodies\", but in the end, it's right, sad as it is :/","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-14T08:02:13.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"As I explained it back when the RP prices were first changed.\n\nWhile yes, we were essentially getting more for less on a global economic scale, $10 to an OCE citizen is still $10 even if that $10 is only $5 to USA. Just because our dollar is weaker doesn't mean we should have to compensate and pay more to make up the difference that a company is making.\n\nHowever that's not how companies work. Companies need to maximize profit or else they can't stay a company for long. Sure it's a scumbag move for consumers to pay more.\nExample: Someone who is payed $500 a week getting RP now has to spend $40 instead of $20 to get the amount they want, so they end up with less money for other things since everything else is still the same price as it was before the dollar value dropped.\n\nIt's shit, but Riot had to do it in order to have profit, let alone to keep the OCE server alive.\n\nIn the overall if you want someone to blame, blame Tony Abbott. During Liberal leadership the Australian dollar plummets in value, but skyrockets during Labor leadership.\nThink of it this way, Labor wins next ellection RP price will come down as the AUD goes back up.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-06-14T08:25:06.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While blaming Abbott is, for what i understood from my time here, as just and rightful as any other national sports, i might add that Riot (despite having a \"Riot Games Oceania\" section based here) is an American company, and the money gets exchanged when it flows to them.\nSo yeah, we might be paying £ or € or AU$ or whatever other currency, but it turns to US$ when it gets to the top. That's what they get, so that's what they base our purchase on.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Myko","date":"2015-06-16T09:51:38.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Australia isnt the only country in OCE (they reduced rp value for australia only im pretty sure)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-14T05:48:37.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"someone doesn't understand how exchange rates work. they try to make RP worth equal amounts in each region. $10 US will buy more RP than $10 AUS, because it's worth more.","replies":[]}]}
