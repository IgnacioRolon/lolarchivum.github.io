I am here today to present a poll for the community. This poll is intended to shed some light on recent issues and experiences not just by myself but for all and any with similar problems. In no way is it intended to be demeaning towards anyone or anything.","url":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/YQ4IrvNq-morality-poll","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a SERIOUS issue going on here. I have no doubt riot is well aware of whats going on. \r\n\r\nBefore i take this any further, please understand that whilst this post may sound very incriminating it is intended for means of constructive feedback, because something really needs to be done about all this _commotion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where to begin.....**\r\nWe should start with security. Lets be real here, it&#039;s poorly lacking. One &quot;verified&quot; email is not going to stop people from having their accounts hijacked, especially considering it would seem the first thing that always gets changed would be the &quot;verified&quot; email address. Riot can sit back and remind everyone that their own account is their own responsibility but at the end of the day riot is the only entity with any power over these accounts. There really needs to be some form of two step authentication system in place. There could always be the suspicious login from a random device that could be prevented, stopping the user from logging in without a sent security code to activate it first. There are more options available but in its current state people are going to keep getting hijacked. The more people that get hijacked the more work riot has to keep up with in the long run. Preventative maintenance surely has to be the best solution here for everyone&#039;s sakes. &quot;You can wrap a leaking pipe, but that does not fix the underlying issue.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n**Whats next.......**\r\nPermanent Suspension. The very very very very &quot;serious&quot; punishment whose integrity must not be compromised under any circumstances because everyone needs to understand that its really really really really serious. When someones account gets suspended this is so serious it can never be lifted! So serious it makes the joker from batman feel like he&#039;s been noticed. It&#039;s ok riot, everyone knows how seriously serious the serious suspension actually is. The problem is that whilst many people who incur this punishment in the first place often deserve it, there are now many people who don&#039;t. What&#039;s the argument for this one again? Oh yeah that&#039;s right; If your account gets hijacked and it breaks the terms of use or summoners code then that&#039;s the responsibility of the account owner regardless of what anyone says. Yeah ok then, so umm.......\r\n\r\nPeople whose accounts are hijacked get help; why do they get help for being hijacked when their account is their own responsibility? Why should they deserve help when someones account who has been hijacked and banned as a result gets no help? \r\n\r\nIf your thinking that lifting the super seriously serious suspension is going to undermine the people who were &quot;offended&quot; by the account in some way, that&#039;s a bold claim and a half. I&#039;m sure if you notified them in some way that the account they were offended by was hijacked at the time, they wouldn&#039;t be all that bothered by it being reinstated. I&#039;m sure if you announced that people who were hijacked and suspended as a result were going to get their accounts back due to morally fair rights for the community then nobody would protest against that. Actively choosing to hurt someone for something they morally didn&#039;t do. This is the only company i have ever seen to do this. Not even EA is this bad. I bet if we had the actual figure by now on the total monetary value of all the accounts have been cut by this or similar issues, it would easily be a five digit number by now.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Well then..........**\r\nI have written much and I for one am tired of this stupid problem where riot is unable to step up and support the victims who are being hijacked and losing everything because riot says they have to when other companies have almost no issues with the same matter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do not be fooled......._\r\nI may seem very upset and writhing with anger to some extent, but the reason i am most upset is not because i personally have suffered from this issue, but because I remember how fun league of legends can be and to see some of the older parts the community being neglected like this is just appalling. I have written here today in the hopes that riot may feel inclined to address these issues in a better way than in the past. I do care about riot because it is the only entity with the power to do anything. Please do _something_.\r\n\r\n\r\n~GURNHAWK\r\n&quot;It is better to watch your friends improve, than to watch your enemies wither.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-01T11:25:10.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey summoner,\n\n\nYou might be happy to know that **Riot** has [2 step authentication](http://www.riotgames.com/riot-games-security) coming soon! \n\n I know it's really late compared to most other companies, but at least this shows they have listened and are making a conscious effort to fix the issue.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\nI also noticed you seem to think that compromised accounts are rarely recovered. **This is not true.** \n\n \n+ If **Riot** has evidence to suggest your account was in fact compromised, then any bans related to offenses while you were hacked, will be reversed. This happens quite often, you just don't hear about it much because it's usually resolved fairly calmly.\n \n  Most of the \"false\" bans you're referencing happen when a 3rd party's account protection goes wrong. \n \n  The classic [example](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/BUdaREnW-a-reward-for-6-years-of-league?comment=0046) of this is when someones email is hacked, and then the hacker uses that information to get into their LoL account. From the perspective of **Riot**'s systems there is no evidence of any security breaches.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n\nJust to be clear, most of your comments were pretty spot on IMO. I'm sure most people would agree that it doesn't seem fair to punish innocent players. \n\nI think it's very noble that you put some serious effort into both these posts to try and help others in your situation.\n\nI hope this helped a little :D","replies":[{"poster":"GURNHAWK","date":"2016-10-14T23:52:05.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have just received my account back, Thanks indeed for the reply and I am Gracious to have my account back. \n\nI hope others who find themselves in a bad place as I did see this and remain hopeful, even if riot support initially refuses to help. \n\nThere is always hope.","replies":[]}]}]}
