This poll is intended to shed some light on recent issues and experiences not just by myself but for all and any with similar problems.  In no way is it intended to be demeaning towards anyone or anything. This poll should be solely used as constructive feedback and to see how people think this issue should be justified. Onward with details:\r\n\r\nRiot has legal claim to all accounts and everyone who makes a riot account is liable for their own security and actions taken against/with that account. This is legally justified through the terms of use agreement. The problem I intend to address is in the title. Morality. When something is legally justified, it does not always mean that it is morally justified. \r\n\r\nWhen someones account is taken from them by any means, be it hacked or misplacement, it is typically seen as morally wrong and would seem legally wrong as well. The person who has had their account taken can only go to riot support for help in the hopes that they get their account back. I personally do not know about these people but from what i have seen they seem to get their account back without too many problems. \r\n\r\n**When someone has had their account stolen and the perpetrator has used the account to break the terms of use and the summoners code, it is permanently banned and/or suspended without any form of remorse from riot support as it was involved in causing a negative impact on the riot community.**\r\n\r\nLegally riot has no obligations to help this person as their own account is their own responsibility and in no way must be helped. What is the opinion you people of the riot community towards this?\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n**Option A:**\r\n_ This person has accepted legal responsibility from creating their new account and should not receive any support in the matter._\r\n\r\n**Option B:**\r\n_This person should be given some form of compensation through riot points towards a new account in direct relation towards the progression of the persecuted account as they are as much a victim as the riot community from the initial perpetrator._\r\n\r\n**Option C:**\r\n_This person&#039;s account should be given a second chance as they are as much a victim as the riot community from the initial perpetrator._\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n_**My story.**_\r\nMy personal experience with this matter is when my original account was stolen this year in July while i was taking a break from league and trying out some other games. My account was hijacked without my knowledge and whoever stole it was able to change the credentials of my league account without any form of notification/alerts. I do not know how this came to be but they ended up getting my account banned permanently due to toxicity. Whilst i am certain they had quite a joy ride with my account and ruining matches for other players they have also ruined the game as a whole for me. Naturally i contacted riot support when i discovered that i was not receiving any emails in attempts to get my username/password. The responses i got were quite distressing and i hoped to get some form of help or another. What i am getting right now is what feels like the opposite of support.  \r\n\r\nI had spent a long time with my account through unlocking all the champions and acquiring many of the skins that are no longer available. I had received several banners, most common one being Great Leader. I played mostly arams as i am more of a casual player and had never played a single ranked match in my life. \r\n\r\nThe ticket (#23383523) i have with riot support makes me feel as if i am personally being punished for somebody else s actions. To me it is legally correct but morally unjust. \r\n\r\nAll i can do is hope that someone out there from riot support reads this and can help me in any way possible.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nGURNHAWK\r\n_&quot;it is better to watch your friends improve, than to watch your enemies wither.&quot;_","replies":[{"poster":"Lara Croft","date":"2016-10-07T04:01:37.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A simple 2-Factor Authentication method could save both parties a lot of time and effort.
