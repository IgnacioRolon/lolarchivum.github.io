Which is not a bad thing. A bad thing is she is only 14 and still got school. She is playing way too late + my mother need to sleep for early work in the morning. I do not want this to happen. I tried to block the internet but then she complaint to my mother and my mother asked me to unblock it for her and I cannot simply resist that. May I ask a selfish request to block her account for a month? It's not really a big deal as she can create a new account. But in my opinion, as a fresh start player she wouldn't want to abandon her account just yet and would wait for a few days. I can then see what I can do within the house to restrict her play time. If you can, please tell me then I can privately send the account name to the actual GM. Thank you very much. And by the way, please comment below for a suggestion on what should I do guys.
