Could someone tell me how to fix this bug? Because it sure isn&#039;t my sheitey 11 ms connection. I&#039;m currently in a 30 minute waiting queue trying to not rip my hair out and I don&#039;t actually get why this bug hasn&#039;t already been fixed. If someone could tell me how to stop this from happening I would be really happy. thx","replies":[]}
