It only took 2 minutes for our lucian the Fresh to start shitting on our brand support about something and** threatening to go afk **if brand tried to go back botlane. Something else noticeable was that our midlane corki afked for a few minutes, and i am 99% sure this was because of them flaming him for feeding since he was 0/2. Needless to say we lost the game fairly quickly and with the chat filled with &quot;f*cking trash c*nts&quot; and &quot;please learn how to play league&quot; etc.\nBut what i realised at the after game lobby screen was that they were duoed_ since they never flamed and always agreed with each other and surely enough i searched them the fresh up and i saw  that they were duoed. And now this has made me have very high suspicions that this duo is particularly toxic and flames teams in most of their other games.\n\nIn all of my 2618 league of legend games i have never gotten so tilted by someone to go to the bother of spending 30 minutes making a post on trying to get someone punished, i would really like to see these guys get some punishment like maybe even just a chat restriction might help them reform.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-27T20:44:26.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry, the new report system is great on picking up on chat based toxicity.
