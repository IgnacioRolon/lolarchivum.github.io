We played mirror 1v1 xerath and was fun and i ended up winning, so afterwards i asked him about the $50 and he linked me to this site &gt;&gt;&gt; **scam site removed - \"leagueofskin\"** which looked pretty phishy and so I entered in fake details and it still logged me in, afterwards he asks me if I got the RP and quickly deletes me after i say &quot;tell me when u get my acc info &lt;3&quot;. So it was obviously a phisher and i also have his username and the chatlogs too. So wanted to know if it was possible to take some action on this guy and maybe get him banned for phishing. He ocassionally makes and joins custom games too so maybe you can play along and try catch him red handed. _**I&#039;ll put the chat logs i had with him down and if a Rioter needs his name I can put that down too**_ hopefully something gets done!\n\nChatlog 1: https://gyazo.com/5b70d901411e7cd9304a3321e3c551af\nChatlog 2: **removed as it shows scam site**\nChatlog 3: https://gyazo.com/0b6cfb0bdcea310788cf111437273cf8","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-22T06:19:52.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha I remember when I first started league of legends and someone was asking me to give them rp and wouldn't stop asking me to gift them rp, and I didn't understand how to block someone and so after about 3 days of this happening, I told them to google free rp because I had seen an ad in the comments of a youtube video and that I didn't have any rp (which was a lie I was saving like 800rp for a skin sale).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-01-21T08:07:05.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have the evidence, [send in a support ticket to Riot](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they'll deal with it. \nWe can't help you on the boards with this type of thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-21T07:56:04.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol is the runescape","replies":[]}]}
