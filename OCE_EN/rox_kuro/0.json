If they were not emailed to you, I am happy to share them here with your permission.\n\nIn those games, you grieved and berated your team mates including the use of racially derogatory terms as well as other things that the community has deemed (through reports made with the automated system), absolutely unacceptable. Because of that behaviour, you were permanently banned.\n\n> I haven't started to flame, and never trolled you always banned mine only. \n\nIt's important to remember that whether or not you start the negative behaviour, you will be judged purely on your own merits. Just because someone else was mean, does not give you a free-pass to abuse other players. Likewise, the player who started the behaviour will be judged on their own accord with the appropriate actions being taken REGARDLESS of what happens to you.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=iLLz,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=91wuIrOE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-05T02:47:32.893+0000)\n>\n> for most games when I see a post like this I think yea whatever but I&#x27;m currently chat banned because I called out period jokes as being sexist so youre probs right\n\nI also took the liberty to have a look through your chatlogs as well. You say that you were chat banned because you called out another players sexist jokes, but forgetting everything else that you said prior to that as well as your general behaviour. It can be very easy in the heat of the moment to not realise what you have been saying or how it looks from another perspective.\n\nOverall your behaviour does not seem too bad - we all have those moments of course - so take this chat restriction as a warning (which it is) that you're starting to show signs of moving into the red zone.\n\n__\n\nI hope this adds a bit of extra context for both the OP, and others reading through!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-09-05T02:55:32.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hah cya m8 enjoy being banned ðŸ˜Ž","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-05T02:47:38.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> what the fuck rr u guys doing?

If you carry this behaviour over to Overwatch, you will be IP banned (ie. you can't even make a new account because the ban system tracks you via IP, not account). At least with League you can make a new account, or buy an unranked smurf even, to have a second/third/etc. chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iLLz","date":"2017-09-05T02:47:32.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for most games when I see a post like this I think yea whatever but I'm currently chat banned because I called out period jokes as being sexist so youre probs right","replies":[]},{"poster":"meatjacker","date":"2017-09-05T15:10:43.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey I was in ROX Kuro's last game (on the opposition team), and his teammates were flaming them so hard in all chat. I told them to stop, because Darius and the Bard were the only good players on their team. Maybe the automation was too harsh because most of his team ganged up on him in reports. They were saying things like \"report Darius\" and \"Darius is an inter\". He was the only one in their team applying pressure to the map, and trying to win. ROX Kuro did twice as much damage as their carries, and got more gold and was 3-4 levels higher than them. \nPerhaps they should be the ones getting a sanction for being abusive to the Darius!","replies":[]}]}
