I hope the game I won at least gives me the lp I earned after how ever many hours its going to take.

Voted no because I don't really care about playing a 4 v 5, but the vote prevailed and we went back to the main screen. Tried to join a game and was told I was apart of an exsisting game, tried relogging as suggested by Seras, and that only made it worse because now I couldn't use my main screen (couldn't use the shops, make item sets while I waited, etc). Currently no idea what I'm meant to do. Hail the remake system!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-22T12:44:54.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like you experienced a ghost game. This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will fix on itâ€™s own and _usually _ lasts a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs (though can sometimes be up to 8). Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update. Otherwise you can really only wait it out.","replies":[]}]}
