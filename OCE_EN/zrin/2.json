There is no #notallsummoners here. Everyone who plays video games knows that matches can take longer than you would think. Just one more match before school, one more match before time runs out, please don&#039;t.\r\nPlease think of the other players on your team before hitting that play button.","replies":[{"poster":"Positivity 4 OCE","date":"2016-07-10T00:52:23.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Zrin \n\nUnfortunate to hear about your experience on the fields of justice! but you're correct. There is no specific report for people leaving because they thought the game wouldn't last as long as it did.\n\nLeague of Legends - Summoners Rift gives a rough average on how long the games can take. Anywhere between 20 - 45 minutes. The only thing that I can advice you to do is just report for AFK. This is probably the most suitable report if a player decides to leave or go inactive. \n\nThat way the player could get warned or punished and then given a reason to think about if they have enough time to play a game that could go more then 45 minutes. As long as you report appropriately the League of Legends report system can punish correctly. \n\nDon't disregard! it happens to more then just you! \n\nEnjoy your games!","replies":[]},{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-07-08T05:35:45.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its going afk, i dont care the reason. report for afk.","replies":[]}]}
