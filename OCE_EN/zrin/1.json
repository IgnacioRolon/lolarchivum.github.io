The Rakkor trained as they do every day, filling the air atop the cliffs with a mighty ring of steel upon steel.\n_&quot;Just one more day before the end.&quot;_ The voice belonged to one of the mighty Aspects of Targon, War. The hardened features of the formerly mortal Rakkor twisted with his facial features in a stern glare across the mountaintops surrounding his home. It was an expression not often seen upon the face of one so fearless.\n_&quot;We cannot abandon hope, my friend. There is always a way to protect ourselves, and those we love.&quot;_ A soft voice cooed from behind the armour-clad Pantheon. White and purple glimmered off of the exquisite armour belonging to the Shield of Valoran. His mouth curls into a warm, soft smile as his gaze looks out over the Rakkor tribe, taking in the hardiness and skill of the many warriors always seeking to better themselves.\n\nAn audible shifting of steel heralded the coming of yet another to the couple sharing a cliff together. A few moments passed before Pantheon and Taric stood, holding their weapons across their respective chest plates in a salute to the herald of the Solari herself.\n&quot;How many times have I told you? We are all equals, here.&quot;_ The Radiant Dawn stabs her Zenith blade downward, the soil melding around it to receive the blessed weapon. It is held aloft by the earth, the hilt and pommel form an upright symbol of the Solari. Both Pantheon and Taric bow their heads in silent respect and reverence. Leaning her Shield of Daybreak against the weapon, Leona looks upwards, feeling the warmth of the Sun across her face and exhaling slowly. Her features soften and she is overcome in the moment, her mouth curls into the same kind smile that Taric so often wears. It was a rare moment of femininity for her, for she must otherwise always give off an air of authority in the company of the mortal Rakkor and their enemies.\n\nMany moments pass as the three stand atop the peak, the men knowing full well not to interrupt Leona&#039;s reverence. The silence is broken only by the tiniest wisps of air passing through the already thin atmosphere.\n_&quot;So. He has broken his chains, his crown.&quot;_ Leona takes a militaristic posture, standing with both hands clasped over her tailbone. Pantheon and Taric stand like recruits at a boot camp, listening to the Solari. Taric is the first to respond.\n_&quot;He will not listen to reason. I have communed with the stars, shown him the beauty that he has created because of whom we have descended from. He refuses to...&quot;_ Pantheon cuts him off.\n_&quot;Spare us your flamboyance and vocabulary of a school teacher, Protector. This is not the time for talk or discussion, we must act!&quot;_\nHis voice cuts through Taric&#039;s unfinished sentence, as though physically striking the man standing beside him. They both fall silent and look to Leona.\n&quot;Nor is this the time for arguing amongst ourselves or demeaning each other.&quot;_ Her voice is stern and resonates through the air, as it always does. _&quot;Equals, remember?&quot; She glares at Pantheon for a moment, forcing him to visibly reconsider his previous statement with a look of shame.\n_&quot;It is clear that Aurelion Sol will not back down. Something of his nature cares not for our perception of beauty...&quot;_ she looks briefly at Taric, _&quot;...or power,&quot;_ her gaze crosses to Pantheon.\n_&quot;All of the Targonians must be warned, but without causing panic. I have spoken with the other Solari, they have agreed to hold a communion and address this situation. Dragons are vain creatures, without speaking ill of Shyvana in the west. But Aurelion Sol will never back down at this point, he will not stop until we have been punished for our ancestors&#039; deeds.&quot;_ She paces in front of the two Aspects, her bottom lip moving thoughtfully from side to side.\n\n_&quot;Are you suggesting war, Solari?&quot;_ Pantheon speaks with determination, but caution.\n_&quot;I am not suggesting it, Artisan. I am saying its already upon us.&quot;_ Leona heaves a heavy-hearted sigh. _&quot;I had hoped it would not come to this. I thought perhaps that the Protector could calm him.&quot;_\nTaric looks grimly downward, but nods in agreement.\n_&quot;The stars themselves obey his command. What can we do?&quot;_ The calm joviality of the Demacian exile wanes in this moment, despair crossing his features. The gems adorned on his armour brighten in their glow, seeming to restore a semblance of his positive emotion.\n_&quot;We gather what forces we can muster. Any who do not openly join our cause will do so eventually. If it exists on Runeterra, it is in danger. That includes Noxus. no matter the rivalry between the city-states.&quot;_ Leona speaks with the voice of a diplomat, even though she does not act as one. A part of Pantheon always thought that she would make a better ambassador than what she has become. Taric however seems lost in thought, the glow of Leona&#039;s armour always catches his eye and pulls him into a trance of adoration. It takes a minor force of will to pull his mind away.\nPantheon is the first to respond.\n_&quot;Are you saying we recruit from outside of Targon? Who would risk their lives for the sake of the rest of the world?&quot;_\n_&quot;The Yordles in...&quot;_ She is not given time to complete her sentence.\n_&quot;The YORDLES!? Those little fluffballs couldn&#039;t contain a crazy purple psychopath, let alone help us against a Cosmic Dragon!&quot;_ In an instant, Leona is upon Pantheon, staring him down.\n_&quot;Do you not remember the Fields of Justice? Do you not remember the look in Teemo&#039;s eyes when he bears down on you? Tristana&#039;s perfect aim? Ziggs&#039; skill with explosives, even with his mindset? And do not tell me that Veigar wouldn&#039;t be an asset to the defence of Runeterra. A Cosmic Dragon is the perfect target for a power hungry maniac like him.&quot;_ Her eyes glow a bright gold.\n_&quot;And if we win, Solari? What happens if Veigar absorbs even a portion of Aurelion Sol&#039;s power? Would we be able to stop him?&quot;_ Taric adds his own insight.\n_&quot;I&#039;ve already considered this. He has been beaten before, he can be again. Especially with your newfound strength, Protector.&quot;_ Leona&#039;s voice immediately dies down to a serene harmony as she replies. Pantheon speaks up again.\n_&quot;Alright. Suppose we ask the Yordles for help. Who else would aid us? The Ionians are too busy trying to track down that corrupted archer or meditating in their temples.&quot;_\n_&quot;What&#039;s wrong with meditating in a temple? It might do you some good.&quot;_ Taric quips, earning him a glare from the Aspect of War.\n_&quot;I have already been in contact with Demacia&#039;s Quinn to send word to the Avarosan. Ashe will stand with us. Demacia has also responded positively to a call to arms. If the Might of Demacia himself joins us in our fight, more will follow. As for the Ionians...&quot;_ She continues her pacing, shooting Pantheon a sidelong glance, _&quot;The Enlightened One and Will of the Blades have vowed to help keep the balance on Runeterra. It has been deemed that the Dragon&#039;s inevitably reign of destruction would swing the world too far in one direction.&quot;_\nTaric nods slowly as Leona recounts what she has already achieved, smiling gently.\n_&quot;I still have a few friends in Demacia. Perhaps they are still sensitive to matters of global safety.&quot;_ Leona nods at the Aspect of the Protector, and he disappears in a flash of purple light.\n\nBoth Leona and Pantheon stand atop the peak of Mount Targon together for hours, holding a vigil upon the stars. The Radiant Dawn having re-equipped herself with the Solari armaments and staring into the sky.\n_&quot;If this is to be the end...&quot;_ Leona cuts Pantheon off before he can finish.\n_&quot;This is not the end. The sun will burn forever, and while it does, the world will keep turning.&quot;_\n_&quot;I hope you&#039;re right.&quot;_\n\nLight years away, in the far reaches of the cosmos that even the Void dares not touch, a creature unlike that of anything Runeterra has seen for millenia\nrouses from his slumber.\nHis voice booms across the stars. He is Aurelion Sol, the Star Forger. Atop his head, chained to his form by sickly purple restraints is a shattered crown given to him by a civilization that will soon be shown its end.\n_&quot;They will stop and stare in wonder as their lives burn out before them. It was never a question of if.&quot;_\nAs he swoops through the many galaxies of the universe, an emptiness follows in his wake. It devours planets, stars and all life.\nVoices whisper in the Cosmic Dragon&#039;s mind, pushing him towards Runeterra and the beacon of magical energy that the Rune Wars opened so long ago.\n\n**_&quot;It was never a question of if we would find it. It was a question of when. You will be our herald. You will be our harbinger. You will be our Dark Star.&quot;_**","replies":[]}
