And yes I use the same screen name, he’s a character I came up with ages ago, and I like to use the name as my screen name too because it’s awesome, so deal with it :P\n\n\nLore:\nYears ago, Godric was torn from his home dimension into a world of swords and sorcery and has spent the better part of a decade travelling the multiverse trying to find his way back.  Through his journey, he came across Runeterra, a world seemingly filled with a vast array of mystical and magical beings and places.  Dimensional barriers appeared to be weak within Runeterra, observed as the beings of the Void occasionally invaded, and learning of the summoning magic the Summoners use within the League of Legends piqued Godric’s interest.  Curious to see if he could learn anything useful in his quest to find his way home, he volunteered to take place in the League, using his supernatural ability to predict and avoid harm, and his adept magical talents, Godric prepared to learn all he could from this incredible world.  \nAnd you know… kick some ass while he was at it.  \n\nAppearance:\nA young man with dark blonde hair about shoulder-length, parted by a streak of silver hair through the middle.  He is of average height and has an athletic build.  He wears light, practical adventuring gear of trial boots, pants, shirt and a tanned leather vest.  He carries a rapier as his weapon, and casts magic with his open hand.\n\nConcept: Mobility based, Melee mage.\n\nStats:\t\t\nHealth:\t\t\t380 (+75 per lvl)\nHealth Regen:\t\t5.55 (+0.55 per lvl)\nMana:\t\t\t250 (+45 per lvl)\nMana Regen:\t\t7 (+0.65 per lvl)\nAttack Damage:\t51 (+3.6 per lvl)\nAttack Speed:\t0.646 (+3.4% per lvl)\nArmour:\t\t\t18 (+3.1 per lvl)\nMagic Resist:\t\t30\nMovement Speed:\t360\n\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive: Momentum\nEvery time Godric uses an ability, he gains additional Movement speed & AP.  Buffs stack up to 6 times, and each ability trigger adds to the timer.  As long as Godric has at least 1 stack, he ignores unit collision.  Godric loses all stacks at once if the timer runs out.\n\tMove Buff per stack: 2.5/3/3.5/4/4.5/5%\n\tAP Buff per stack: 3/4/5/6/7/8\n\nQ: Missile Burst\nGodric fires a skill shot projectile that deals magic damage.  If the enemy is within his attack range, it also stuns the opponent and deals lesser damage to enemies in a small burst.\n\tCost: 50/55/60/65/70\n\tDamage: 60/95/130/165/200(+0.75AP) (50% burst)\n\tStun Duration: 1.5\n\tCooldown: 7\n\tRange: 900\n\nW: Dodge!\nGodric dashes a short distance, during the dash Godric is untargetable and avoids skill shots.  In addition any ranged targeted abilities or auto attacks targeting him lose focus and miss him.  The cooldown of Dodge! is reduced by 0.5 sec equal to the number of Mobility stacks Godric has.  The mana cost increases if Godric uses Dodge! within 10 seconds, stacking up to 5 times.\n\tCost: 50 (100/150/200/250/300)\n\tCooldown: 11/10/9/8/7\n\tDistance: 400 \n\nE: Combo!\nGodric leaps to an enemy, ally, or neutral minion, dealing physical damage if he leaps to an enemy or neutral minion.  After the first leap, he has 2 seconds to leap again, but not the same type of target (ally/enemy), unless his first target was a neutral minion.  Godric can leap to champions, minions, wards or targetable traps.\n\n\tCost: 60\n\tDamage: 40/65/90/115/140(+0.5AD)(+0.6AP)\n\tCooldown: 10\n\tDistance: 800\n\nUlt: Void Traveller\nGodric opens a gateway through the Void, traveling a target location after a 2 second channel.  Upon appearing at the location, he erupts from the gateway passing through enemies, damaging and slowing all enemies he passes through.  During the channel, the player chooses the direction Godric will erupt from.\n\n\tCost: 120\n\tTeleport Range: 5500\n\tEruption Range: 1000\n\tDamage:\t100/150/200 (+0.7AP)\n\tSlow:  20% for 3 seconds\n\tCooldown:  145/120/95\n\n\n\n\nThe concept I wanted to work with is a mobile mage, utilizing combos and movement shenanigans to dance around the opponents.  He ducks in, deals damage, maybe gives a stun, and dashes out.  He's not a brawler, he's an opportunist with hit-n-run tactics as he's naturally very squishy, but skilled players can make use of his Momentum passive and effective use of Dodge! to avoid most threats.  I mostly looked at other mobile champions for inspiration, such as Lee Sin, Fizz, and Riven.  In the first concept, Godric had an ability similar to Jax, where he would avoid AA damage for a short duration as it worked well as a character translation, but I discarded it, as it turned him into more of a brawler and he's too squishy for that.\n\nOne of the key elements I wanted was to have all of his skills involve movement of some kind, even Missile Burst has positioning advantages to it. Positioning is everything and an active eye on your cooldowns to keep up Momentum to maximise your effect in battle.\n(Which ironically means Godric is the sort of character I'd suck at playing :P)\n\nDodge! is probably his main ability and what uniquely defines Godric, and when combined with stacks of Mobility, he can potentially dodge every 4 seconds, even more often with cooldown reduction.  Note that this dodge is a very quick action, like Grave's, Riven's or Lucien's E dash, so any dodges have to be precise (or simply enough to get out of the way).  Dodge! does one thing I'm pretty sure nobody else has, which is it's targeting disruption, as it causes things like Cait's ult, Kayle's Q to miss, if it's used during any point of their travel distance.  However melee targeted abilities such as Maokai's W, or Vi's ult will still remain on target.\n\nI'm not really sure what kind of effect such a quickly refreshing immunity dash would have in the game, but he kind of needs it to keep up his Momentum. At the moment I kind of think it could be leaning a little toward the OP edge of the scale, so I'm hoping his natural frailness balances it out.  \n\nCombo! is interesting in its usage because while you could dive an enemy, unless there’s an ally champion or minion nearby, you may catch yourself out of position.  It generates a bit more teamwork with allies to use properly, or at least good ward placement.  I left the ability to target neutral minions with both jumps intact in case people wanted to jungle with him, as otherwise his clearance is a little lacking.  Also note that both activations of Combo! will add a stack of Momentum. \n\nI'll admit, I'm also little unsure of his ultimate, as it has the initiation value similar to Pantheon or Twisted Fate, combined with an AOE slow built into it that he can then combo with a close range Missile Burst for a stun, but it seemed thematically correct for the character.\n\nTL;DR combo/play style version (as requested)\n\nfarm up with AAs or Q in early game, trying to avoid harass too much, as Godric is relatively squishy.  As you get E or W, you can start harassing a bit more, using E>Q combo to leap to your opponent and stun, probably adding another AA in there too, then using the secondary leap from E to escape with little (if any) damage.  Add a Lichbane or Triforce and watch the damage start to grow.  \nAt lvl 3, you can start generating Momentum consistently chaining one ability to the next.  Remember to move swiftly and harass more often, using W to dodge skill shots and attacks.  Just be aware that because you activate skills to generate momentum will be expensive on mana so bring enough Mana-Regen, or pick your timing.  With stacks of Momentum and W, you should be able to chase down or flee from almost any enemy you come across, and likely avoid ganks as well.  With a high speed from Momentum and W, you should be able to cross the map and roam relatively well, without leaving your lane too exposed.  \nAt lvl 6, you don't particularly gain 1v1 superiority, but you do gain initiation potential for team fights.  Communicate with your jungler to coordinate powerful ganks when you're ready and attempt to snowball lanes.\nMid to late game, Godric works best as he keeps moving, sticking to a single lane will limit your potential.  In team fights, you can likely reach squishier targets, but be aware of your own frailty.  Use your E>Q combo to stun and single out enemy mages or AD carries, then Q to an ally while you wait for your cooldowns to finish so you can charge back in.  Godric is not the kind of champ to burst down singular opponents like regular assassins, he's tricky and deceptive, and you need to play him that way.  Look for opportunities, look for plays and don't stick around the thick of a long fight.  Jump in, jump out, always keep moving.  \n\n\nAnyway, I’m not a designer or balancer so a lot of the numbers are pretty much estimates, I just wanted to put up my champ concept for fun.  Tell me what you think and does it have potential within the current game?  At the moment I see Godric as either a Mid or Support, and maybe a Jungler at a stretch.  He's got the mobility and speed for effective ganks, but I don't think he's got the survivability for the jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2015-03-26T13:22:51.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Uh by mobility stacks I assume you mean momentum, his passive?","replies":[{"poster":"Godric89","date":"2015-04-17T13:45:01.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, thanks for spotting that.
