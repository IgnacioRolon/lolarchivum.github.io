Checking my e-mails daily I noticed that in March this year someone requested a new password and an e-mail change request, following the next events.\r\n\r\n**MARCH 12, 2016**\r\nI have sucessfuly managed to recover my account after it was listed in a long list of hacked accounts on the internet. Got back into it, checked everything, played games and had fun.\r\n\r\nFrom March to July I played League of Legends only when U.R.F available. \r\n\r\n**JUNE 20, 2016**\r\n\r\nI received an e-mail from RIOT games, wondering what could it be as I didnt quite play for the last months. I opened it and I was shocked, literally. I &quot;was banned due to the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client&quot; despite not playing for the last 2 months. \r\n\r\nJUNE 21, 2016 \r\n\r\nI have sent a ticket feeling confident this was a simple misunderstanding, explaining carefully and detailed what happend to the account previously and that this can&#039;t be right, cause I haven&#039;t use any &quot;malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to League of Legends client&quot;, expecting to talk with someone who would check that the 3rd party program usage for sure occured on a different IP and in that period of time when my account was compromised.\r\n\r\nIn within 2 hours or so, someone from &quot;Riot Games Player Support&quot; answered to the ticket with a copy-pasted message telling me something that I already knew, my account was banned. This account recovery process and the GM team have completely dissapointed me. The support team helped me back then and it was cristal clear that someone hacked the account and played on it but yet I am still banned for actions that were not carried out by me, with no help and no one willing to listen, and most of all, no foot to stand on to defend yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-21T16:52:53.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best course of action here is to simply respond to the ticket again detailing why you were unhappy with the outcome. Make it very clear that your account was compromised recently and you were not responsible for the actions taken at that time. The reply should escalate your ticket to the next tier of support if you haven't already been. \n\nIt's very important you don't submit multiple tickets or respond before someone gets back to you, because it'll bump you back to the bottom of the queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex pls","date":"2016-06-22T12:34:46.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, I am waiting for a reply.","replies":[{"poster":"Alex pls","date":"2016-06-26T12:43:55.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So apparently the player support refuses to answer further questions, and set the ticket to solved even if he didnt answer to further questions. What can I do :(?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
