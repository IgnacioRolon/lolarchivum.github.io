Team 1 and 3 are where red/blue team base is normally, team 2 is at the top of the map making it an equal 3way split. I&#039;ve made a very simple and dodgy customization of the dominion map with my pro MS Paint skills. I&#039;m sure it will serve its purpose in explaining what the map would be like.\r\n\r\nCapture points removed- Nexus added to each team instead\r\nXP/Gold gained over time similar to howling abyss and dominion\r\nStart at level 3 with 1375g\r\n4 towers per team- 2 either side of base exits\r\nHP Points and Speed Points still in default areas\r\nMiddle buff would be changed from blue/red buff to a single buff that grants that team map vision for X minutes\r\n\r\nHaving a buff that grants a team entire map vision (not including brush) would make for a great battle hotspot as it would be heavily contested. If the buff became available early on (2-5min game time) it would create a faster-paced high action game, especially having a 3rd team to fight against. Do you work with another team to shut down a hard carry and wipe someone out or play heavy defense and fight the remaining scraps?","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-11T07:47:42.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this could be problematic. cause some people might be too clever and have two of the teams team up to destroy the other one making it a not very fun time for them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"straw hat romii","date":"2015-05-28T10:54:36.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bruh thats awesome","replies":[]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-05-28T09:23:59.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I tried to do this back when the forums existed.
