( Yes no sustain or peel i know).\r\n\r\nBut my problem isnt about my champion choice, im starting to find that the ranked system isnt balancing the teams correctly if at all.\r\nIm finding that as a gold 4 im usually the highest on my team in ranking and the enemy team has plat 5 and mostly gold 3 - 2 - 1.\r\n\r\nThe most recent game i played I had a silver 1 and an unranked and I have the highest ranked player on my team again.\r\nthe other team were much much higher ranked then us.\r\n\r\nFrom memory it goes:\r\nTop Gold 3 vs (our) gold 5\r\nMid gold 2 vs (our) gold 5\r\nJungler gold 5 vs (our) unranked\r\nadc gold 5 vs (our) silver 1\r\nsupport gold 3 vs (our) gold 4\r\n\r\nThier yasou mid went 7 - 1 against our ahri, we did win bottom lane i think we left 3 kills up.\r\n\r\nWhen i looked at MMR incase maybe that was the reason my MMR isnt even good, infact its bad, my current MMR is gold 5.\r\nso is there a reason to how unbalanced the system has been currently.\r\nMaybe from being toxic in normals theres some Bad player que that ive been placed into? \r\nIs the system geared towards cutting off winning streaks or winning average? \r\nTheres has to be some reasoning behind how consistently the system is unbalanced.\r\n\r\nTL:DR, support main complaining about match making.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-01-25T17:16:26.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Consider yourself lucky that you were not placed in a match to support an all silver team, that happens a lot when there is a shortage of support mains.
