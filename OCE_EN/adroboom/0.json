Mode moved to Howling Abyss for 2015** is quite a disappointment for such a fun game mode. Restricting the Mode to Howling Abyss removes the range and diversity of champions, skills and OP-ness as the only way to win is by a select amount of champions (Ranged, Poke, CC Mages). The Lack of room on the map prevents the ability to dodge skills, confuse enemies, and almost refuses fun for melee champions. Champions like Lee Sin, Evelynn and even Alistar have been replaced with Nidalee, Sona and Lux. Making U.R.F. Mode available for all maps (or at least Summoner's Rift) will make the hype for League's favourite gamemode worthwhile.","replies":[{"poster":"Blissed","date":"2015-03-07T04:21:51.959+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think mostly everyone will be disappointed if riot makes in on howling abyss...\nPLEASE RIOT NOT URF on ABYSS!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pepe","date":"2015-03-09T10:29:40.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"urf on sums pls.\n\n\nOT: Adrobum is gay","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lore Ventus","date":"2015-03-30T21:01:55.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember all for one: Mirror mode?

At this point, URF would have been out and the gamer is probably in a custom game on howling abyss playing URF. Note that the other gamers are on the old Summoner's Rift. It might still be a spoiler, but it isn't 100% like I thought it was when I made the picture.\n\nThere is nothing to fear.\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-07T06:09:20.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only asked for URF, you didn't specify a map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-03-07T05:59:29.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"URF should be on Summoners Rift not Howling Abyss \n\nWhy?
