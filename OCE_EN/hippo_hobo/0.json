Others I would use this for would be,\n\n{{champion:13}}\nQ - Quick Cast with Indicator\nW - Quick Cast\nE - Quick Cast\nR - Quick Cast\n______________________\n{{champion:9}} and {{champion:1}} \nQ - Quick Cast\nW - Quick Cast\nE - Quick Cast\nR - Quick Cast with Indicator\n_______________________\n{{champion:161}} \nQ - Quick Cast with Indicator\nW - Quick Cast with Indicator\nE - Quick Cast\nR - Quick Cast\n_______________________\n\nAnd many, many others. These are just what my personal Hotkeys would be but I&#039;m sure many others would like to have this option because everyone have their own personal Hotkeys in mind. Even though most people probably just use Quick Cast. :P\n\nEDIT: I imagine this can be done by adding this option. http://puu.sh/oQb3K/c630e6acf4.png.\nWhile also changing the visuals of the quickbind UI to show that Normal Cast has been switched to Quick Cast with Indicator.","replies":[{"poster":"Sarge","date":"2016-05-13T00:14:52.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate even if these features aren't added (They will be) ... you have a career in using mspaint.

I get really confused when I load up into a game playing Urgot and suddenly my q doesn't have any indicator and just goes off, it kinda confuses me and would be great to be able to switch them up when I need. nice idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-14T04:46:49.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no real reason not to, HotS has this feature atm, changes the game quite a bit imo","replies":[]}]}
