ARAM isn't an exact science, and if you make one small QoL change, why not make another, and another, until balance completely overrides the spirit of the gamemode because you have so many \"it's random except when x\" conditions that it's not really random at all.\n\nEven in normals, where balance is a priority, you can't win every game. You'll get unlucky sometimes, doubly so in a luck based gamemode. Sometimes you'll be extra unlucky and get unlucky a bunch of times in a row.","replies":[{"poster":"Jaapi","date":"2018-04-22T10:22:04.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?? All its changing is the fact that when one person has a melee champ the chances of getting another one are lower and so on, the fact that every time someone rerolls a melee champ and gets another does not simply seem its all bad luck to me and the stats behind it all is already altered in favour of the free rotation champs or is tha just bad luck that everyone seems to be getting them more?? And for why not just change everything well that comes down to the development team. If they want to change the whole mode go hard i have just voiced my opion on one aspect that i thought could actually make the game mode better and so its not either too easy or too hard where is the fun in any of those no wonder leag has lost so many players. Like you say ARAM isnt an exact science but there are still factors that can be changed that still mean its random..","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
