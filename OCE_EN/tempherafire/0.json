Every single time I log into League of Legends, my PvP goes red. Whenever I&#039;m in a queue, and I lock in, it says &quot;Attempting to reconnect&quot;. Eventually, it obviously doesn&#039;t work. I try to &quot;manually&quot; reconnect to League of Legends but it doesn&#039;t work. I have tried disabling the IP Helper and it only tales the red signal away. \r\n\r\nI have found a solution, however it opposes unreliable. I have to disable my Firewall EVERYTIME I would like to play on League, I desperately need help, Riot. \r\n\r\nIf anyone else has the same problem as I do, please comment.

This is the first bit of software you install on your computer to run other programs with, examples being Windows 7, iOS (Mac) and Linux Mint. ISP means Internet Service Provider, and is the company who provides you with an internet connection. Usually also a telecommunications companies, some examples are Telecom, Optus and Vodafone.","replies":[{"poster":"TempheraFire","date":"2015-06-20T05:44:57.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I get it. I just never fully understood what those terms meant. My computer is an HP and it currently has Windows 8.1 installed on it.

Be sure to reinstall them later.\n\nDouble-check that you've tried everything on [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664), mainly, using an alternative DNS.\n\nYour ISP, Vodafone, has pretty good records in my books. Windows 8, however, not so. I suggest you upgrade to Windows 10 if feasible, or even better, downgrade to Windows 7.","replies":[{"poster":"TempheraFire","date":"2015-06-26T03:01:17.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have done all the 'basic' things to attempt to fix the issue and it has not worked.
