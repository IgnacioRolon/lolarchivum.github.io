The topic of this discussion is Yasou. Yasuo is an extremely unfair champion to lane against, due to his windwall and high damage. I think I can speak for everyone when I say this, but when you nerf champions that don&#039;t require nerfs (Examples being Soraka) you are wasting time on champions that ARE actually overpowered! You need to take summoner (LoL community) recommendations into considerations, especially those on the topic of nerfing and buffing. I&#039;m not venting or anything, I&#039;m providing facts that champions such as Yasuo, need the nerf. It&#039;s no fun playing against an OP af champion; It just makes the game unenjoyable.  \r\n\r\nI mean they&#039;re champions like Irelia and Akali that have are manageable but Yasuo definitely needs to be buffed. His damage is gross and I don&#039;t know why he even exists in the first place.  \r\n\r\nAlso, those of you that do Play Yasuo and are going to hate on this thread, don&#039;t waste your time. No one can change my opinion of this gross broken champion.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T07:41:07.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">when you nerf champions that don't require nerfs (Examples being Soraka)\n\nwut\n\n>You need to take summoner (LoL community) recommendations into considerations\n\nThey already do this. Even though it's not been officially announced, the PBE players input a lot when it comes to balancing, stability, feel, etc.\n\nFun fact: Yasuo was nearly gutted with his initial nerf, to the point of being unviable. He recently got a buff for his shield, making it actually do something early game. There was a time he got Flow for dashing through targets, allowing him to get twice the value of his shield. Also, his crit was straight 50% at the start of the game, which increased to 100% with just IE and Statik, no overflow. He was crazy upon release.\n\nAnyway, gameplay related discussion belongs in [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy).
