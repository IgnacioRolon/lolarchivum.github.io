I find that I win when my team doesn&#039;t have a troll, and lose when we do. The last few days it has been about 50/50 chance of getting landed with one. Sometimes I&#039;ll just mute and keep playing, but when they don&#039;t get a response they seem to then troll through stealing CS, feeding or trying to tell the other team that someone else is trolling.  \r\n\r\nThe question is;\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to act when you find there&#039;s a troll on your team? Try talk them out of it? Mute and keep playing?","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T03:12:18.901+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just mute and keep playing. Even if they begin harassing you directly just ignore it. They're are after a response after all. Don't give them one. Focus solely on your own game play so that there's nothing you can be at fault with and simply report them when the game is over. It's an unfortunate part of League but Riot is working on a way to combat this. \n\nBest of luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-09-17T23:28:53.765+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this.

It's got me some great laughs (but be polite!) and even got some of the trolls laughing with me :)\n\nYou do need to be careful with doing this though, if you notice they sound angry or frustrated leave it alone and just mute them, you're better off for it. E.g. they might be blaming you for their bad play, and if you laugh it off they might get even madder.\n\nKeep cool, and have a laugh where you can!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-17T06:08:10.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"say they need to stop being a dick and then get banned by riot and then riot don't do shit about the trolls and afk and dc and smerfs \n\n:}","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T09:39:24.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Responding to trolls in a similar matter is probably the worse way to handle this situation.

Here's a couple of tips that I've found helpful:\n\na) Obviously if they get abusive, use that mute button liberally. Don't feel like you need to take their attitude one bit. Like DW Aatrox has mentioned already, they're looking for a response, so try not to give it to them.\n\nb) While you shouldn't engage with them try not to be silent in chat! start communicating more with the rest of your team, try to make it sound positive, point out when/where people did good. Everyone gets down when a game doesn't go well but like any team game/sport the more you try to communicate and stay positive the better mood the team will be in - which helps everyone play better!\n\nc) Look for duo partners, this board even has a section for finding others, if you can find people to duo with that are reliable and positive then you've significantly reduced the chance of getting a troll on your team. (not everyone you meet or try duoing with is gonna work out but keep at it, throw me an add if you want)\n\nd) This one is totally anecdotal (ie I have no evidence this is true apart from my own experience) I've started avoiding playing ranked during the weekend and mostly just play on weekday nights, obviously the population on the server changes throughout the day and depends on what day it is and I've just found I seem to get better teammates and less trolls on weekdays as opposed to weekends. \n\nStay positive mate, not everyone is a troll! \nHappy Hunting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-09-17T23:10:18.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Surrender.  Or call their bluff - you'd be surprised how many trolls change their tune when you start doing what they do. Toxic ppl can be muted but trolls ruin games.
