Students in particular tend to work all weekend and have more time during the week for games. \r\n\r\nIf you make the game modes available for people to play on Friday, through the weekend until Monday night, it&#039;d fix this issue for these people. Is there a cost of keeping the game modes running? Could it be offset by the satisfaction of these players?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-25T10:39:42.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis thread would be better suited for the [Miscellaneous](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) or [GD](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/general-discussion) boards where you may have a better chance of sparking discussion.\n\nThis board is for Help & Support regarding technical issues with the game.","replies":[]}]}
