I think ill save up to 6400 and buy him on release, I'm pretty excited to see what I can do with him.. although I think a lot of people would pick him anyway after the hype train so idk I might play evolve or HOTS until it cools down a bit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-03-04T09:17:10.278+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it became viable then Riot would nerf it to the ground.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-04T06:34:29.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he could be good but clear rate :/","replies":[]}]}
