How does that affect mana champs u ask? Well its quite simple, take any mana hungry champ and place it against a manaless champ(which by the way are a lot these days). Early game no matter what u do, u cant help but expending ur mana and sit there helpless while ur opponent just eats all the farm. Its even worse if u r a meele cuz the minute u go to basic attack, he will just spam his abilities and u lose a ton of health.... I just dont understand the logic behind removing the one mana sustain item for early game...","replies":[{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-11-11T17:00:32.719+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"...or you could conserve your mana and play safe if you are in a losing/counter lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2015-11-12T02:53:14.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=STOP DYING AT ME,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=5WJZP6tb,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-11T17:00:32.719+0000)\n>\n> ...or you could conserve your mana and play safe if you are in a losing/counter lane.\n\nYou missed the point where you use mana and now have no mana pots, no clarity to recover said mana. That Yas which is about to get his cloak of agi and static shiv will now get 15% hp back every hit so now you not only have to conserve mana to lane properly, you also have to deal with an enemy who doesn't have that problem and will easily stomp your {{champion:3}} as he ramps up faster then you can. Because lowering mana regen on everyone, then taking pots away, and clarity, then adding costs to AP items and lowering their stats makes it balanced. Yeah I don't think it does actually.","replies":[{"poster":"The Beauner","date":"2015-11-12T03:10:32.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tiz Arrior,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=5WJZP6tb,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-12T02:53:14.019+0000)\n>\n>  Because lowering mana regen on everyone, then taking pots away, and clarity, then adding costs to AP items and lowering their stats makes it balanced.

This started mostly when they dropped the costs of most AP items, while nerfing them slightly (which is fair), continued by nerfing azir twice and tinkering with other midlaners (AP midlaners), and concluded in this abomination of a patch. Where mostly all AP items are more expensive (sure 2 are cheaper by 100 gold) with no buffs (apart from a slight buff of ROA which simply encourages Ryze mid cause... Faker played it i guess), most AD items are cheaper (most, but the ones that aren't, aren't early game necessary items), and on top of that... there are no mana pots, which is a huge problem, since if your jungle doesn't give you blue and you're up against resourceless champs, or champs that need 1 combo to kill you... well you will loose lane, since you expend your mana to cs, so you can get mana regen, you back, you loose your lane. Farm better under turret you say, sure that's fine, but it's the hardest out of all positions (apart from supp) to farm under turret with AP champs since you don't have AD. \n\nMana pool increase and base amount per level and mana regen... doesn't do enough. Since it simply doesn't. This makes most (I say most cause some champs were already weak ealy game) AP champs much weaker in the early game, and much more vulnerable to ganks (now that you can't ward except when you buy a pink -problem with that is you ward one side and that's that). Sure global gold but for that your team must be doing good, sure more gold per minion, try farming with LB without using spells.\n\nThis shifts the meta towards resourceless champs in mid, Ryze and control mages, that sit farm, get items, then (If there is a mid game) can actually help in teamfights... Why? \n\nI understand why adcs had to be changed (and buffed... I guess), but why gut them at the expense of midlaners.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
