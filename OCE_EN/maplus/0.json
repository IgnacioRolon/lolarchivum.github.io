I was placed on a team, where two team mates were AFK for the entire game and one constantly disconnecting and reconnecting. As a result, the game was virtually a 2v5 and ultimately a loss. The depressing part is, I was robbed of LP due to this, something which I believe is quite unfair.\r\n\r\nI am aware, and grateful, for the fact that Riot are working on techniques to solve this issue such as the three minute detection of AFK players, and hence a game restart, however, I don&#039;t think this is enough. This is because players can play for the early game, but AFK about 15 minutes in, and as a result creating this same, unfair playing field and as a result, causing a detrimental effect to the team. \r\n\r\nI would like to suggest an improvement involving AFK detection timers, tracking the amount of time spent players spend inactive. If the timer reaches the cap time limit, the  player can be rendered officially AFK and a inhibition to the success of their own team. If a two (or more) players match this condition, the game should be determined as unfair, and those who still remain active on that team should not be punished for this unfairness. What I am proposing here is a system, where if these conditions are met, results in remaining active players on the team, not losing LP for that game, while those who did, get punished with an LP loss.\r\n\r\nThe ranked system is supposed to test the skill of those on a team, to work together and achieve victory. But punishing those without a team to do so,  especially those who find themselves unfortunately in the same position very frequently is robbery, and creates an overall negative view towards the ranking system.\r\n\r\nI really hope Riot views this, and works even more towards eradicating the loss of LP, unfairly to circumstances like I and many other players have experienced.\r\n\r\nTime to win back my LP\r\n\r\n{{champion:222}} \r\nMAplus","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-29T07:23:18.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remake will be a thing.
