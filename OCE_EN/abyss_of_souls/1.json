People never seem to understand that they are also able to ward and that the max wards someone is ever able to have down is 3 greens, 1pink and possibly 1  blue. They also don't seem to understand that in the early game the support is hardly ever going to go roaming and ward for toplane or ward top jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss of Souls","date":"2015-06-13T07:42:46.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jinx was Mid","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-13T13:34:40.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abyss of Souls,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BkEm4ELW,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-06-13T07:42:46.974+0000)\n>\n> Jinx was Mid\n\nJinx was mid.

You put down 20 wards in a 35 minute game, you didn't upgrade your trinket or buy any pink wards when against a triple invis team????????? You should of had your trinket upgraded as soon as you hit level 9, and at least bought 5 pinks wards at the minimum. You built 3 half items without actually finishing a full item other than your support item, which really doesn't count. Yeah you should really improve your self before blaming your team mates, since all of them were better than you.","replies":[]}]}
