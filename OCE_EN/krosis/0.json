I played maybe 10 games in a day, my fps fine, and then all of a sudden I join a match and I have 1-5 fps from 60fps on max graphics. Changed the graphics settings, Updated all the drivers, got rid of unwanted junk from the computer etc etc and nothing changes please help.","replies":[{"poster":"MrMunstr","date":"2015-07-30T09:57:25.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey **Krosis**,\nCould you please list your computer specifications, be sure to include the following information:\n\n* -Processor\n* -Graphics Card\n* -RAM Installed\n\nBefore anything though, have you recently made any changes to your computer? _I.e downloaded any programs, added or removed any hardware?_ These changes sometimes have other effects on software and hardware already installed.\n\nBe sure to check your processes using task manager (CTRL + ALT + DEL), ensure that there are no background processes stealing your resources.\n\n\nEDIT: If you have no prior knowledge about Task Manager, maybe read up on it before stopping processes and services.\nEnsure that it's not another program, anti virus program or hardware/software conflict first.\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Krosis","date":"2015-08-02T08:58:04.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heya,\nProcessor: Intel core i7 3990 CPU\nGraphics card: nVidia GeForce 660 GTX\nRam: 16gb\nIve checked my processes and none of them are stealing anything. I know somewhat regarding CPU usage and all that jazz so that was the first thing i checked. Ive also checked the internet regarding this problem and no one else has had it.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Krosis","date":"2015-08-02T09:03:43.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also,\nIve noticed that the game during this time (As it still happens) Changes my key bindings all together. Not letting me left click, ESC etc etc. I can't even try to reconnect or anything. It just changes the whole game. I have no idea what happened. I also havent removed any hardware or installed anything new","replies":[]}]}]}]}
