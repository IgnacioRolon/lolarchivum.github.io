Stuff like:\n\n1. Get a double kill with 1 ability.\n2. Only get assists one game.\n3. Have over 90 cs by 10 minutes\n4. Land over 500 hooks.\n\nLeague is spaghetti code though, some I'm not sure if they have the infrastructure in place to do more stuff like this. They shouldn't add too many mini-games IMO, you'd have something to work towards if they did objectives.","replies":[]}]}
