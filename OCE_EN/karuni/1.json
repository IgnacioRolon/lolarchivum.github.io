Annie. in front of all the champions this deal was made, and i got to take Annie.&quot;&quot; draven continues saying. during all this i take a look at Annie, she&#039;s barely awake and she looks like she&#039;s been abused. draven looks up to swain, and swain points up with his thumb, then down. he was satisfied with dravens choice to kill Annie, he knows he shouldn&#039;t, the league has a strict rule that no champion nation, faction, or group shall war or fight with another champion of the league, this has held the freiljord civil war between the three sides for many years, there&#039;s even a rumor that ashe and sejuani and now in small talks thanks to the help of bruam and anivia. but if the high council found out, they would have swains head for this, and i don&#039;t mean figuratively, i mean they will take his head, the command will send all champions not associated with noxus to attack, and not with reduced sizes that the league puts in to make the matches fair, full sized enemies, if they sent malphite, or god forbid aurelion sol. draven turned towards Annie, his face is lit with happiness and the biggest and most menacing smile i&#039;ve ever seen on his face. he lines up to through both his axes at this tied up child and just as he throws them the load sound of a scream resembling a no comes, out of no where amumu appears to save his only friend, the arena surrounded buy bandages, the bandages catch dravens axes mid air, draven looks shocked at first then snaps back into it, angrier then ever. swain stood up, darius had his hand on his axe and katarina actually looked interested. draven charged towards amumu, but the bandages wrapped him up, swain was angry, he bursts into his bird form but the bandages had made it up there. swain was trapped and sion was having trouble dealing the bandages. the others were to shocked that swain would lose his cool and burst into bird form here. amumu turned towards annie and started untying her. he lets off a very loud and painful shriek, my ears ring with the sound and i have to close my eyes and and cover my ears. i don&#039;t know how long it took for my hearing to recover and for me to look up but when i do, amumu and annie are gone no trace. draven screams. swain returns to human and storms off. everyone rushes out fo the arena, scared that this could be the end of noxus, they didn&#039;t know if there were more champions on there way to destroy noxus for this crime, but i don&#039;t think this was the league, more like a singular act of amumu trying to save a friend. i look at my wife to see if she&#039;s fine, she looks at me and nods, i gesture for us to leave and she nods back, we stand up and leave calmly amongst the crazed crowds. as we got out it started to rain, we were not far from our home when we heard sobbing, this was not uncommon, many children in noxus were left on the street if they were considered weak, they would band together in groups and fight for territory and many would die, i looked for a second i realized it was amumu, with annie on the floor, she wasn&#039;t awake and was breathing but wasn&#039;t in a good condition. i stopped, as much as i want to help my nation prove we&#039;re the greatest, i don&#039;t want to see these two separated. if i intervened and didnt come forward i would be trialed as a traitor and be cast out if i was lucky. i nudged my wife and pointed to them, i whispered to her to head home. she looked worried but started walking. i walked next up to amumu, he looks up at me and puts himself between me and annie, preparing to fight,\r\n&auml;mumu im here to help, i believe in annie, what her parents did was brave and frankly, the new noxus i despise, we cast out anyone who is weak and useless not giving them a chance to try, i wanna see a noxus that, is known for making the strong from the weak, to make legends from nobodies. but if annie or you were caught and would most likely be killed, noxus would be destroyed and along with it, my hopes.&quot; amumu calms down\r\n&quot;may i carry her to my home? we can get her warm and you might need some food&quot; i say ot him.\r\n&quot;OK, but if you try anything&quot;he says \r\n&quot;i won&#039;t&quot; i puck up annie, and look out onto the street, nobody to be seen i run out carrying annie, i lean over her to stop the rain from reaching her. we make it home i put in the bed to start warming up. for a week they stayed, by the end of the week annie was better. it was time for them to leave, i offered to walk them out of the city, we made it to the cities edge when i hear shouting.\r\n&quot;there they are get them!&quot; i see guards running towards us, they&#039;ve seen me, there&#039;s no point staying in noxus now,\r\n&quot;can i join you guys? i can&#039;t stay here anymore&quot; i ask, annie and amumu look at each other and nod\r\n&quot;sure&quot;and off i went with them. i traveled with them, constantly being protected by them but overtime i learned weapon arts from different areas and even had lessons from members of the league, one day, i hope to join them in the league, and fight swain to regain the noxus i love.\r\n\r\n\r\nsorry this was long, just under 1500 words, i was hoping to involve gragas towards the end but i didn&#039;t have enough space. this is also my first time doing this kind of thing so thanks for any support!!","replies":[]}
