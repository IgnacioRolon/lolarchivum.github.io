After closer inspection I have seen that the champion still has N/A as its score. I then checked other champions and some that I have played this season have N/A aswell. \r\n\r\nI am not sure how long this issue has been going on for however it was happening prior to patch 7.9 and currently still not working. \r\n\r\nI have repaired client, restarted client and computer logged in and out of other accounts. I have also submitted two bug report but have heard nothing back. \r\n\r\nSo decided to post on the community board instead. \r\n\r\nPlease help.","replies":[]}
