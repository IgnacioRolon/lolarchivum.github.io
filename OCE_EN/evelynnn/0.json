More specifically you shouldn&#039;t be online at all. The internet is not a kindergarten. More specifically if you cannot manage to mute someone before they &quot;upset&quot; you then you probably got mental health issues or just a weak minded person. \n\nLoL is a competitive game, people get competitive and emotions are high. If someone calls you bad, maybe there is truth to it? And most importantly if it truly upsets you perhaps you should use your IQ 70 to press tab and select mute.\n\nI really don&#039;t understand how our male race how scooped so low to such a poor pool of genetics. When did humans become so fragile and weak?? It makes me pretty disgusted tbh.\n\nI will leave with saying intentionally feeding is different. That ruins games.\n\nVerbal abuse is a choice YOU ACCEPT to tolerate. Reporting them makes you look pathetic and weak, pretty much a beta. If you report people for &quot;verbal abuse&quot;, natural selection failed with you basically. \n\nThis isn&#039;t even a troll post, I&#039;m 110% serious.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-05-02T00:55:52.889+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"bravo Sekai and Mozzie25, great responses =D Thank you for being a sportsmanlike influence in our community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-04-30T12:06:24.955+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If you're so tough, why don't you go live in the wild instead of hiding on man-made systems like internet and claiming that it's the wild wild west or whatever it is you think it is?\n\nHumans also get this thing over the years you know, it's called civility. And we expect people to be civil to each other. It's not much to ask. I mean, to use your own flow of logic, if you're so tough, why don't you just suck it up when others are telling you off?\n\nDon't worry, I can answer this for you. Because just like the \"realists\" who tend to talk pettily small, some of us instead like to talk big, very big. Those packs can only debate while dressing their personal beliefs as bigger than it should be, hiding behind an overarching and grandiose \"concerns\" of whatever to appear that they have the superior stance, and hope to beat people with buzzwords while putting little thought behind the legitimacy of the rationale as well as its implications. Those people like to pretend that being a barbarian, a brute, a beast is the be all and end all of all things. Those people are so concerned with \"oh people are so weak\" they can't help but to bully and assault others because being a madman, an non-empathetic grunt, or an uncultured fuck is such a superior way of living, because humans used to be \"so strong\".\n\nBecause god forbid humility, grace, rationality, intelligence, moral and ethics, empathy, general damn decency etc and **ACTUALLY TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU ACTIONS**, no no no they ain't no strength, noooooo the might makes right eh bois? We might as well say a person who attacks and spout crap at another is obviously not at fault, no mate, it's the victim's fault for being there that triggers the aggressor, right fellas?\n\n.............................\n\nThere's more to it than your muscle mass and the thickness of your skin. There CAN be truth in it if someone is telling you that you're trash, it absolutely can, but the thing is, there are better ways to express that without outright attacking the person you're talking to as that neither helps their situation and neither will help you. It's a very simple logic, because people don't like being attacked for no reason (and why should they? Do you?), so you don't attack them, and that can get your point across equally as well, so why not do it? Is showing off how tough you supposedly are that important?\n\nThe usage of force is not inherently wrong, I don't believe anyone would argue the otherwise, but it's a matter of fact that force are often misused to forward and abuse a personal stance at the expense of others. This OP is one of the examples.\n\nIt's 1 thing to criticise others for being thin-skinned, it's however another topic entirely to try and justify being a dickbag and disassociating bad behaviours from taking responsibilities as you are now.","replies":[{"poster":"Evelynnn","date":"2017-05-01T16:13:13.554+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":2,"body":"I actually read your entire response.

It really worries me how feminine men are nowadays, cannot even tolerate a bit of smack competitive talk.\n\nAnd lets pretend someone tells you to self harm, why is that toxic? You have the choice to do it, nobody is making you. Are we humans truly that pathetic that words upset you THAT much?

It might even be a generalised observation that you call someone trash. The question is, who are you or any other person in this world to tell me what I can and cannot say.\n\n\nIf you're going to try and hide behind Freedom of Expression, let's just take a moment to clarify something here. \n\nUnder the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which the Australian Human Rights Commission upholds), _**everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers**_.\n\nIn a nutshell, it means you're entitled to an opinion. Nobody can take that from you, and nobody can stop you expressing it.\n\nWhat it doesn't mean is that you have a right to be a dick. It doesn't mean anybody needs to respect your opinion. And for someone whose original post was calling on everyone else to be an intelligent adult, you're certainly taking a childish approach here.\n\nThis is not really about freedom of speech â€” it's about you desire to say things about specific groups of people, while at the same time refusing to allow them to respond.\n\nIt says a great deal about your lack of maturity when you demand the right to say whatever you like, but at the same time demand no-one should be able to answer back.\n\nWhile not everyone can express (or even understand) what it means to feel empathy, it's not hard to learn to be considerate. There's one simple step - just don't be a dick.\n\nYou're saying verbal abuse is something people choose to tolerate. Under that same vein of thought, being abusive is something you choose to embody. You've made a conscious decision to be a dick to other people, and then decided you have a right to get upset when other people are upset by it?\n\nThat's a right you don't have. Others do have a right to tell you what you can and can't say. It's why we have defamation laws and discrimination laws. It's why every workplace in Australia has anti-bullying and harassment policies. It's why cyberbullying is actually a crime. \n\nThose laws tells us that you don't get to tell people that if they don't want to be insulted they should stay off the internet, or not play League.\n\nAnd no, it's not a denial of your freedom of expression, it's just called being a grown-up.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-05-02T06:32:04.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always figured that you have freedom of speech until that speech becomes about abusing, harassing or provoking harm against another human being. Your right to freedom of speech doesn't override their rights. People wave around freedom of speech and religion like it's some magical banner which means they can do anything they want. When it's nothing of the sort, drives me absolutely nuts.

Getting upset over some words someone has said to you over the internet is pretty pathetic, the mute button exists for a reason, and even if it isn't on LoL, there is always a thing called putting you phone down/closing your laptop. Looking back at the last generation compared to ours, it's pretty sad how weak and pathetic people have become. People back then didn't even have the internet, everything insulting was told right to their face, yet in our day and age getting upset over the words \"kill yourself\" said by some random person on the other side of the world that you probably have never seen or know. For all we know the person saying that could be some 12 year old immature brat. So basically, get over it, stop taking anything online seriously.\n\n2. Yes LoL is a competitive game, but that doesn't entitle you to swear and be rude to your teammates, you think you're helping by calling your botlane \"autistic\"? You think that's gonna give them a boost of self esteem and make them play better for the rest of the game? No. Reporting someone does not make you look pathetic and weak, reporting someone helps rat out the fuckwits in the community that do nothing but decide to be shitheads all game, wasting time arguing back and forth instead of actually playing the damn game. You'd think after about 100 games of constant arguing they would learn a lesson but no, back to being a keyboard warrior instead of helping take drag or pushing a lane. You have every right to report someone for that, and they deserve to be banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-29T22:46:38.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-05-02T04:26:40.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Our Male Race? females don't exist?\n\nThousand years?
