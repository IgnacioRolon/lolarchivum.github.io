They need their stacks in order to become stated and incredibly strong. If you are continuously counter jungling them and keeping control of objectives, they can't do this. Keep wards deep in their jungle (trackers knife is perfect for this) and get your friendly laners to help you.\n* If the jungler you are playing isn't going to be the best at counter jungling, focus on fast pacing the game and snowballing your lanes. Apply that map pressure, get your laners fed. Progress the game to a stage where the enemy jungler either needs to match your map pressure (taking them away from their precious farming), or loses control of their jungle due to your superior vision.\n* If you have failed the above options and they have managed to become sated (or very close to), you must work hard to counter their strengths. Devourer junglers rely heavily on their attack speed. What are you going to do? Buy randuins and frozen heart. Both these items lower attack speed and come with some A+ armour which will also go a long way in fighting them.\n\n* Two of them tend to build guinsoos, so you must play around the stacks they have. Kite them for a lil while so the stacks can fall off, then go in for a balls-to-the-wall engage (keeping in mind that you have a short timeframe before you have to back off due to them regaining stacks). Frozen heart is also a pretty good counter to guinsoos as well.\n*Another way of dealing with this item (works best in ranked where you can see champs and guess build paths) is to pick an annoying tank with strong AR and MR, who wont be shredded by the damage easily (think: malphite, mundo).\n\n[Playing like a ♥♥♥♥♥ is also very effective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5QRH9a3UhM). \n\nIf all else is failing, try expanding your jg champ pool to include champs that can do well vs devourer junglers ({{champion:20}} )\n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dream","date":"2016-03-17T23:16:31.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Fiddle is in a pretty bad spot right now, ever since they slowly started nerfing him each patch a while ago (nerf to E and passive), sadly I feel that the way that the game is going it is really hard to climb now if you're not playing META champions because they are just simply better than all the others, like if you got invaded and died once on fid or just died once early due to a bad gank or something you are legit done, where as if you died on any of the jg meta champs you would be completely fine, now it use to be okay because Fid use to be really strong in the right hands, high skill cap champions=stronger than low skill cap champions but Riot are slowly changing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Dream","date":"2016-03-17T23:17:09.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ceebs with grammar","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-13T11:49:25.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You all described Dev Junglers, just kill the big monster (Wolves, Raptors, Golem thing) except the tiny one to make sure it doesn't reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LTK333","date":"2016-03-13T04:33:42.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou Princess Yaia - Excellent feedback and really appreciated.

However, I've found that playing the champ against a struggle with made me understand their strengths and weaknesses  to the point where I know when they make a mistake and I know how to use it to my advantage.\nNot all champions leave clear openings and some can recover from their mistakes more easily ( {{champion:11}} )\n\nHowever, if you believe you're doing your best with Fiddle, I still suggest you to learn more of the other champ's kits to be able to understand when it's the right moment and way to counter them. That doesn't mean the match ups will be in your favour (because of natural counters), but it means you'll be able to decide more wisely whether you can win a trade or not and how to play :)\n\nHope this help, not a really detailed explanation, but more of a suggestion...","replies":[]}]}
