My League launcher opens fine every time but its just after I click on \"launch\" that it fails to open up the log in screen, after trying to open League again it will tell me that a second instance of the program is already running. After prompting me to close the previous League instance it will open the launch page and once again fails to open the log in screen. Using  Ctrl Alt Delete shows that its trying to open the next screen but something is stopping it. I've deleted files, repaired, restarted and re installed and nothing seems to work. Although i did get to have one game after re installing but yet again went back to not loading anything after the launcher. \r\nI hope someone can shed some light on my issue","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-11-29T23:47:15.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tried running as admin?\n\nHopefully support work it out, good luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BestGrompOCE","date":"2014-11-29T10:14:37.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im running on Windows 7 and I had this problem a while ago but it only happened occasionally. Now i just cant open anything after the launcher.

Are you on mac or windows?\n\nAnyways regardless to whichever OS you are on you should maybe send in a support ticket? I personally don't know how to fix it but that is probably the most reliable way of resolving this problem.\n\nGood luck friend!","replies":[]}]}
