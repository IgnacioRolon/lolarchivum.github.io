Like seriously. It's more likely that they use this excuse to avoid difficult questions.\n\nIn my opinion, comments that are still relevant to the present day game, should not be deleted, even if posting on a \"necro-ed\" thread.\n\nBut you know when the company relies on unpaid volunteers to run boards, reduce opl to premade teams, and generally don't do bugfixes in game where their priorities lie.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-28T05:09:26.965+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"14 days without activity (not from original post date) is the standard we currently use.\n\nIt's not just that the thread content may be irrelevant to the current state. At that point, any discussion has usually well and truly run its course, and reviving it is extremely unlikely to offer anything productive, where simply creating a new post would.\n\nIt's also because the individuals involved in that old discussion are likely no longer invested in it, and possibly also not active, which again stifles any productive discussion.\n\nWe don't lock old threads to \"avoid difficult questions\", we lock threads because there is no reason not to create a new more productive thread over reviving an old dead one.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2019-05-28T09:54:12.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry, but I don't believe this one bit.

You can possibly check up on the exact date.\n\nThe people that were involved in the previous 3 week old discussion were invested in it, but never received answers.\n\nBecause of these policies, I will refrain from posting on these forums from now on.
