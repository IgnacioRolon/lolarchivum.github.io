I dont know, it&#039;s just, it&#039;s been a while since you released a new one (even though sweetheart sona was just released earlier this year). \r\nMaybe the linked pic (or something close to that) should be added in the Academy Skins along with Ekko, Vlad, Ahri and Darius? \r\n\r\nI have almost all of the Sona skins (missing muse) and would really just like to see a new one.\r\n\r\nI dont know. This is just a thought/suggestion. Im a Sona main and i just like using her a lot","replies":[{"poster":"loverrrr","date":"2017-06-12T05:52:49.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skin pool party sonaبه نظرم خیلی قشنگ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2016-06-13T23:24:38.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So...Academy Sona?","replies":[{"poster":"Siøpao","date":"2016-06-15T16:29:27.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk haha i just wanna see a new Sona skin, thats all","replies":[]}]}]}
