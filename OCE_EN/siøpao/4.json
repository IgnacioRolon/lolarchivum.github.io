I love how most of the time, when people get toxic, even just the slightest, they can get suspended or even permaban but when people afk or leave in the middle of games, they only get low prio queue for 5 games?\r\n\r\nYou see, just today, i had a game where everyone connected and our mid laner, wont mention who due to player-shaming blahblahblah.. pinged they had over 3k ping. She disconnected then when we only had 3 seconds of remaking, she came back on. Still spiking and stuff. I am unsure if we could&#039;ve even remade since she already moved and maybe even bought items. She came back so many times only to dc again and again and again which is annoying all of us even more. No objectives could be done, everyone is getting camped and our mid lane was getting pushed back so hard.\r\n\r\nThroughout the game, everyone was already raging due to 3 people, myself included were in promos.. 3 FUCKING PEOPLE!!!\r\n16 minutes in game, she finally fixed her internet, our base was already down and instead of apologising, she did not even give a fuck knowing she was the main cause of loss of 3 promos for 3 people in that game.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand why this keeps happening on my promos... either someone feeds, trolls or afk&#039;s. \r\nPlease fix your matchmaking system","replies":[]}
