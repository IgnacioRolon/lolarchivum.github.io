I&#039;m just wondering WHY wasn&#039;t that enough to get an S. I got the most kills in both teams and i died the least yet i only get an S-. Can someone please tell me what just happened and how do you exactly get an S or an S+?

So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\n**Riot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade,** but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-23T12:28:10.282+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well you just explained the OP's point.\n\nVery few players play Sona mid, I would say under 0.1% tbh.

OCE gameplay is among the lowest in the world. \nThe Chiefs got stomped and the Chiefs stomp OCE teams. \nOCE Diamond is like Koreas high Silver. \nThere is not much difference between high silver and low platinum oce. I know a couple silvers that can smash platinums, heck I have even stomped some plats and I am bronze 4. I have watched a gold player smash a Diamond 1 player. \nThe bell curve theory does not take into account the fortnight to fortnight patches containing nerfs and buffs to champs and items. \nSona just got nerfed so what OP did defo deserved an s+!\nThe stupid thing is I can go heimer top get 300cs in 30 mins go 15 12  and get an s+ which makes no sense as I have gone 28 2 with only 120cs about the same time and only got an a+ even though the carry game I won but the high death game I lost. All that cs meant nothing as I wasn't helping the team when needed. So the current system creates selfish play where farming is more important than team objectives even more so when crates and mastery are tied to getting an s.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-24T02:48:59.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing with these \"good players getting good scores and setting the bar for an S grade high\" it is relative to the other players on the server. People on OCE playing sona mid must be getting good scores, setting the bar really high. If you went to another server, it may be easier/harder depending on how their players do.\n So your facts about our esports scene and relative rank system aren't actually relevant here. \n\nThe bell curve isn't static, and probably does take into account patch changes, as the average scores will change as well and it will have to adjust for this. Unfortunately, this adjustment period isn't likely to happen immediately and would probably take a while to gather new info about players scores to re-adjust the grade boundaries. \n\nCS isn't the most important thing. It does have a big impact on grades, but so do other things such as ward scores and objective assists. I had 2 games (both approx 30 mins long) that ended with the same support score of 2/0/14. In one game I had 3 CS, the other I had 11. The one I had 3 CS was the one that I received an S grade. Why? Probably because my warding was so much better and I was at almost all of the towers/barons/drags to be taken.\n\nThe fact is that League of legends is an team orientated objective based game. The developers of the mastery grading system know this, and would have created their system with this in mind to avoid the \"antisocial steal all the kills, hog all the farm\" play style.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-23T22:19:25.689+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://puu.sh/nVLRI/7bec9e45c0.jpg\n\nIn this picture, the gangplank got an S+,\n\nI was playing Soraka and my score netted me a B+\n\nUnbelievable isn't it :l\n\n\nI don't think there's a lot of precision when it comes to determining as S+ especially since some of the possible prerequisites of obtaining a higher score doesn't always trying your best at your specific role. For example, Taking kills on a support seems to actually get you a much better chance at obtaining an S- or higher.
