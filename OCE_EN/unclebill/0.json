Riot understands that occasionally real life issues may come up that will interfere with a game, especially if its an emergency.\n\nThe system is set up in such a way that you don't get punished for simply leaving one game, it takes a few games for punishment to be given (ranked is treated more serious, however I do believe that one game won't get you punished)\n\nFor more information on leaverbuster please see the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\n\n> **IT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY INTERNET/YOUR SERVERS DISCONNECTED ME. I HAD A REAL-LIFE EMERGENCY. I HAD TO GET OFF THE COMPUTER. THE GAME CRASHED. UNBAN ME!**\n> We understand that players may be forced to leave from time to time so the system has been designed to keep these situations in mind. After leaving a few games, you will be placed into a low priority queue; as long as you can complete 5 matchmade games without leaving, you will be returned to the normal queue. However, if you continue to leave games, you will remain in the low priority queue.","replies":[]}]}
