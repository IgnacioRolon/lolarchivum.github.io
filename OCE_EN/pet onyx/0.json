I doubt Quinn would get one because she isn't popular but Riven is in there with the popular champs. We all know a lot of people who main a champ will drop like 300 bucks on chests to get a hextech skin so it makes sense Riot would only give them to extremely popular champs so they can bait people into gambling heaps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T04:30:26.491+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"The Soulstealer Vayne skin?

Do it as a fun thing on the side, but never go hard I say.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-01-23T04:44:21.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is an exclusive skin to Hextech Crafting like Hextech Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T04:48:13.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SkarSkarSkarner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=N9asVOA9,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-01-23T04:44:21.342+0000)\n>\n> It is an exclusive skin to Hextech Crafting like Hextech Annie.\n\nAh I see. Then welp, poor guy, OP's friend that is.\n\nStill, I really wouldn't advise going hard on gambling personally, even if there's something amazingly cool waiting for you that you just so want to have it, as it just really isn't cool unless you're blessed by RNGesis.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2017-01-25T08:13:34.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"$300+ and no essence.
