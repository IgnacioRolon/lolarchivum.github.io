But lately, things have changed. You see, I've been a top laner ever since Evelynn got reworked in season 1. She was the only champ I played outside of top lane and she got boring after the rework. Mostly because she didn't have Twitch-level stealth anymore and because she was super OP.\n\nOver the years, I've become fond with many top lane champions. I went into an Irelia phase, then a Riven phase, an Olaf phase, played a bit of Jax, some Jarvan, Kha'Zix (he is a fun champ). I thought I was going to main Swain for ever until I became impatient with his early game. I played Nasus too when he was OP (mainly jungle though). And then I came back to Irelia (who I got diamond with a pretty 65% win rate).\n\nTop lane wasn't the only lane I played of course. Occasionally I would play jungle and often I would mid. This was all part of being a team player in solo queue. Season 5 has changed things though. Jungling is consuming my LoL career. I used to hate jungling because I saw it as boring, killing the same camps over and over. But now it has suddenly become interesting. I'm not sure if it's just because it's new, but I'm liking the jungle right now.\n\nI enjoy the decision making aspect of jungling. Deciding when to gank, when to counter gank, counter jungle and do dragon. I've also gotten better at smiting recently. I've never been good at quick decisions and have always seen myself as a strategist. I'm not ready to call myself a jungler yet because I have so much more time invested in the top lane but I'm really starting to wonder which role I enjoy more. Jungling has a lot of decision making and game impact while top lane has less decision making and less game impact. I value these things highly but they're not the only factors in deciding which role I want to play.\n\nWhat do you think of both roles? Did patch 4.20 change your mind about the roles?","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-09T10:06:48.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"o hai arcanist,\n\n\n4.20 patch made me only play top 80% of the time.\n\ncbf learning the new jungle, i dont jungle often, but when i do, its shen jg.\nYes its normals, i dont go rank anymore \n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"I Really Irelia","date":"2014-12-09T10:45:33.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Dota. It's good to see someone is in the complete opposite boat as I am.

It just brings so many tools to the jungle. It's like the epic update when we got gold items depending on how you wanted to support, but for the jungle ;D I think it emphasizes the role of jungling a whole lot more. In my opinion i think junglers need to be more switched on and main the role a whole lot more because it is a scary world out there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
