Once I get there, I will dodge every series so that I stay there. Every other game, I will try to win. This will increase my MMR while still keeping me at Bronze 5. This is all to make people go \"WTF\" when they see LoLNexus.\n\nMy ask to Riot is that you drop me down to Bronze 5 manually so that I'm not forced to intentionally lose games. If you don't, I'll pretend to play badly so people won't notice I'm losing on purpose. It will be painful, but hopefully my first 10 games of the season get me there... from Diamond.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/OLudQCE.png","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-12-05T13:59:30.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's still a bannable offence.
