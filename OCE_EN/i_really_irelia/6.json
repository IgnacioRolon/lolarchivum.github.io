This is the tournament where nothing else matters. This is the tournament with 100% team fights and 0% objectives. This tournament is even rumoured to be Sparta.\n\nThis is the tournament...\n\n* Played on the Crystal Scar map\n* Where you are not allowed to take objectives\n* Where you win once a member of your team reaches 100 kills\n* That uses a crazy tournament structure\n\nIt will be played online and will be an official League of Legends tournament. This means you will be playing to win RP and Triumphant Ryze. The finals will be played at internet cafes across the country.\n\nThe start date hasn't been decided yet. Comment to express interest. If you don't have a team, find people in this thread and in the Miscellaneous board thread I made: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/2orsWjZ4-tournament-of-the-year\n\nI'm looking for people to help stream and cast the finals.\n\nI look forward to seeing your death ball team comps.\n\n**The crazy tournament structure**\nThis tournament is a double-elimination, best of 3 tournament until the finals, which is a best of 5. That means a team has to lose twice before being kicked out of the tournament. It will also use draft mode.\n\nFor the first round, every team member's rank on the ladder will be added together. The team with the lowest number will choose who they play against, then the second lowest numbered team will choose and so on. This means the highest teams on the ladder choose first.\n\nAfter the first round of best of 3s, the winning teams will choose who they play against, in order of the largest number of kill difference between their 100 kill player and the highest kill player of the enemy team. Basically, whoever wins by the most kills gets to choose first (only taking into account the players who get the most kills on each team). This applies to all rounds after the first and ends when there are two teams left.\n\nOnce there are two teams left, the finals will be a best of 5 played at internet cafes wherever players live. If it gets to the 5th game, champion select will be blind pick and runes and masteries that make a player do more damage are banned (with the exception of CDR). Items that give AD or AP or do damage are also banned. This means Sunfire Cape and Thornmail are banned. These items are not banned:\n\n* Frozen Mallet\n* Athene's Unholy Grail\n* Iceborn Gauntlet\n* Odyn's Veil\n* Face of the Mountain\n* Mejai's Soulstealer\n* Sword of the Occult","replies":[{"poster":"ImperiusË†","date":"2014-12-18T10:34:39.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is ridiculous, it will take forever for someone to get 100 kills, let alone 50.","replies":[]}]}
