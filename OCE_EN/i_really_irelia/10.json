This is the tournament where nothing else matters. This is the tournament with 100% team fights and 0% objectives. This tournament is even rumoured to be Sparta.\n\nThis is the tournament...\n\n* Played on the Crystal Scar map\n* Where you are not allowed to take objectives\n* Where you win once a member of your team reaches 100 kills\n\nIt will be played online and will be an official League of Legends tournament. This means you will be playing to win RP and Triumphant Ryze. The finals will be played at internet cafes across the country.\n\nThe start date hasn't been decided yet. Comment to express interest. If you don't have a team, find people in this thread and in the Team Recruitment thread I made: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment/tnNR9joF-tournament-of-the-year\n\nI'm looking for people to help stream and cast the finals.\n\nI look forward to seeing your death ball team comps.\n\nThe games will be best of ones up until the semi-finals and the finals. The games leading up to the finals may or may not be streamed.\n\nOnce there are two teams left, the semi-finals and the finals will be a best of 3 played at internet cafes wherever players live. If it gets to the 3rd game, champion select will be blind pick and runes and masteries that make a player do more damage are banned (with the exception of CDR). Items that give AD or AP or do damage are also banned. This means Sunfire Cape and Thornmail are banned. These items are not banned:\n\n* Frozen Mallet\n* Athene's Unholy Grail\n* Iceborn Gauntlet\n* Odyn's Veil\n* Face of the Mountain\n* Mejai's Soulstealer\n* Sword of the Occult","replies":[{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2014-12-14T14:01:12.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happy I could help.\nAs for advertising, the forums is a good place, make 2 or 3 separate posts over the course between now and the tournament to try and get peoples attention. Xfire is also good in that people look for tournaments in the lists there, so you will find that people will just see it on Xfire and join. Would be good to post the Xfire link in this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lumer","date":"2014-12-14T10:53:24.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting tournament.\nHopefully Riot goes through with prizing, I have heard of prizing not being handed out for various reasons like having 1v1 on summoner rift when there are 5 team slots etc. As long as Riot knows the layout of the tournament the it should be fine. I suggest using this site http://www.xfire.com/ \nto help organise your tournament. I use it when I do my monthly Twisted Treeline tournament. I am thinking BO3 may take a while, as it is kills for a single person not a team. Anyway, I would like to show interest in streaming and casting. Never done it before but I have heard I have a good voice and I have good knowledge of the game. Interesting being able to choose who you play, but I feel that everyone is just going to choose the team that came last, second last etc.\nThat sort of feature means that Xfire can't be used, but you can arrange the brackets so that the highest ranked teams should be the last two at the end, if they win. I also suggest having a chat room on the day to communicate with players and be very strict, if you give chances then people are going to complain and get angry, if someone breaks the rules then disqualify them immediately, they should be familiar with the rules as they are posted. Even if you don't use Xfire, it would be good to put it somewhere apart from the forums, as this may get pushed down the list and out of sight. Good luck, let me know if you need anything.\nEssay is finished XD","replies":[{"poster":"I Really Irelia","date":"2014-12-14T11:57:57.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Dalekvercity. You have just made this tournament so much easier to run as I haven't hosted a tournament before. I will get rid of the best of 3s as I do think it would take a long time. I'll use the seed setup and xfire. You have some very good advice.\n\nDo you have any suggestions for where to advertise the tournament? I usually put things on Reddit, I will make a video about it, advertise it in my games and put it as my status. I guess I'll put it on the LoL Facebook groups too.\n\nIt would be great if you casted. How many games you cast is up to you. I can actually cast with you as I have a lot of free time right now. My internet is fast which makes it good for streaming.\n\nI'm thinking the final should be a best of 3 now since the games will take so long. And it will probably be very one sided since this is a new game mode. That could give us time to have the semi-final at an internet cafe too. Of course, if nobody wants to do it, I can't force people to leave their houses.","replies":[]}]}]}
