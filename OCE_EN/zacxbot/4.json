From past experiences on smurfing its fairly easy to find players that are willing to play, so I personally suggest adding people that you enjoy playing with in-game. In terms of getting better, I would suggest investing a little bit of time in researching, since there are plenty of resources out there to support you. But to keep it short from my perspective, follow a strict champion pool, follow pro players runes/masteries and build path. Climbing in bronze generally going to be hard but as long as you get better it shouldn't matter much. I would probably suggest playing meta champions and drop kayle or zed, since those champions is pretty mechanically hard. Like with Kayle you really gotta kite and probably control your wave. But step 1. find a easier champion 2. improve mechanically 3. knowledge is as important but you can improve on that right now or later on, as you can win from just playing smart and with less risk (Apdo). Since you're in bronze your learning curve can easily improve drastically.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2017-12-15T07:58:14.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will never climb with 40% win rate.
