There has been numerous times where ive chased down soo many champs to only have them escape me because of her really bad base movement speed.\r\nNow im not saying completely rework her, but maybe a few adjustments like her W (Harsh Lesson) RANGE could be adjusted, im only saying this because once the whole enemy team all ins her, she has no real escape other than flsh, and thats a hella long cool down guys...\r\nPerhaps even if tentacles hit provide a 1/2/3/4/5% movement speed bonus when skills put into W or Q maybe even e if you want us to use it more..\r\n\r\nAnother thing, the animations for a lot of these abilities are really slow, could you make them either a little faster or even provide her with a little more lifesteal as early game you get poked and pushed out by champs like {{champion:80}} Pantheon and {{champion:23}} Tryndamere","replies":[{"poster":"FlÃºffy","date":"2017-07-09T14:44:34.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you just complain about people playing well against you, countering is a part of the game you should learn to adjust in that situation \n\nalso if you want more move speed \na phage move speed quints, and/or storm raiders","replies":[{"poster":"ZACxBOT","date":"2017-07-10T09:24:33.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh thank you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jorsty","date":"2017-07-09T16:19:25.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He should be running storm raiders if he plays Illaoi, if he isn't then their is one of his problems","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-07-10T06:07:26.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omega67679,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ON5cjEQV,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-07-09T14:33:24.178+0000)\n>\n>  im only saying this because once the whole enemy team all ins her, she has no real escape other than flsh, and thats a hella long cool down guys...\n\nThere's not too many champs that can survive when the entire enemy team all ins them.
