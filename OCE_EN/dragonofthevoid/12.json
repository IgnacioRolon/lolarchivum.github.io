Currently I probably lose about 40% of my games, and it is VERY rare to get a key on a loss, I might be misinformed, but I think you can only get one on a win. Then of those 60% of wins, I probably get a key around every 6-8 games. So basically it takes it usually takes me 12 games to win one key shard on average, and then that's just for one key shard, so i need three to get a key. Then we have 4 chests a month, so this is how many games you need to play a month to get all the chests on average: 12 x 3 x 4 =\n\n144 games. Games probably go around 35 minutes on average if you factor in 20 min and 45 min games, so 144 x 35 = \n\n5040 minutes of gameplay, converted to hours that is, 5040 / 60 =\n\n84 hours of gameplay. That is exactly 3.5 days spent playing league, in FULL. So if you were to play for 4 days, not eating, not going to the toilet, not drinking, not sleeping, you would be pretty much done with your chest collection.\n\nBut, that's only if you are good, and also win every game. Let's assume that you don't. (You don't.)\n\nThat's around 8400 minutes of gameplay now. That's also 140 hours of gameplay. That means about 6 solid days playing league, just trying to accumulate chests.\n\nIn conclusion, if you were to get all the chests and keys the way I do, you spend 72 days, or 20% of your year playing league. If I played for 5 years straight, I would have officially played League for 360 days. (Almost a full year of my life.) That's pretty damn insane, and means 1 of around 80 years of my time as a human it spent playing league, even if I only play it as a hobby for five years in my teens - early twenties.\n\nGG RITO.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-30T11:44:27.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its impossible to get a key shard on loss... its a win only thing...","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-03-30T12:23:24.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i said that..","replies":[{"poster":"Kaze no Kizu","date":"2016-03-31T02:34:35.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rainbows","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-03-31T10:49:07.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait Talon, is that your smurf?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-30T20:55:15.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice math lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-30T13:07:02.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests are super easy to get (compared to keys). All you have to do is get an S with a champ you own, or play in a premade and have someone in your premade get an S. \n\nKeys are a little bit trickier. \n\n>When asked about specifics on key fragment drop rates, **Wingfield** explained they key drop rates are not linear and the rates reset each month:\n\"Hey all, \nJust want to help clarify some things about key drop rates: \nKey drop rates are NOT linear and **only wins have a chance of dropping a key**. So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. \nThe goal is to create a nice ebb and flow. \nGrade does NOT impact key drop chance. \n**Premades DO increase drop chance. **\nHope that helps clarify \"\n[(source)](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/red-post-collection-hextech-crafting-on.html#6)\n\n**To get a key, you need to win.**\n_ As the key rate drop generally decreases as you get more, you must do all that is in your power to get these keys._\n \n* Tryhard \n* Cheese tactics\n* Premade 5 for hextech farming \n\n I have noticed from your match history that only 3 out of the past 20 games you have played premade.
