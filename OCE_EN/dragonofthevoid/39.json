People hate leveling up accounts for smurfs etc. So there is a market for level 30 accounts. So these websites make bots to \"play/afk\" so theey get exp and level up without having to do any work. Then they sell the accounts with no champs/runes bought so it is appealing that once you buy the account you have all of this ip to spend BUT if the account gets reported (most probably will when people are aware of bots) then it will most probably get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-07T19:08:32.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"isnt it absolutely baffling how a bot can even get past level 10 without being reported? or is it really taking rito that long to check the report?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-10-07T19:14:00.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk man.
