I get that you can't tell people how to play and that the 'meta' is only an invisible theory that most try to enforce, but at the end of the day, it's a team game and your own version of 'fun' isn't fun for others. Griefing others and saying it's only a norm, is a b.s. cop out to make it look like your anti-team, griefing antics are acceptable. I don't always want to play ranked. I still want to win at normals. Or at least have a decent game. I mean you spend 10 minutes getting into a game, with champ select, dodgers, load time, and then at very least 20 minutes playing the game (unless you want to quit and get leaver bustered), so no, I don't want to be a part of your troll game. Either ask me if I want to have a troll game first, so I can dodge, or go play customs if you don't care. But they won't, because the only reason they troll in matchmade games is to piss others off.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T09:39:06.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"yep and the funny thing is if this was ranked riot would do something well if its above gold anyway","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lady","date":"2015-09-25T08:04:57.516+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"I mean, they can go whatever they want. \nThey're having fun so get over it? \nOnce again, it's only a normal.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T08:53:02.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"cool let me go ad  {{champion:34}} max wall and troll with it as there is no rule about maxing wall and trolling with it or how about ad {{champion:99}} go jg just cos and why not in ranked sins there is no rule","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-25T07:59:25.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"I played with the same people that i queued up with 3 times and didn't learn my lesson and just sit down for 5 minutes before queuing again whinge whinge whinge\"","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-25T08:51:07.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"this was over the space of 2 days","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-25T11:57:50.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Really? cause i only seem to find **1** game of you playing with said Ahri and warwick and not any other games in your match history, but sure just lie to try and make your point valid.\n\nEDIT: yep, 1 time in the last 2 weeks you've ever played with this person.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
