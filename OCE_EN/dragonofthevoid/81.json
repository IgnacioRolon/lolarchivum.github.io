Tanks should tank damage, but eventually your team should either take out the carries, or draw their fire away from you. If you're the sole target and get focussed down so quickly and early, then your team either cannot team fight effectively or you yourself are too out of position.\n\nAs for builds, if I'm in a game with a fed Vayne or Yi and I'm the ONLY tank, I always take a Thornmail as my last item, sometimes even rushed if it's urgent. Frozen Heart, Thornmail and Randuin's Omen all kill champions like Yi and Vayne dead, but again, only if your team is fighting properly.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-23T09:13:01.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3035}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3153}} tank goes from lets say 500 armor to 100 and then hp goes from 100% to 0%","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T09:18:18.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Both Clear AND Last Whisper is a very rare build on normal ADCs. Last Whisper is sometimes built if your team is stacking armour, but I've never seen a normal Vayne or Jinx build buying both Cleaver and LW. Usually it will just be LW, in which case there's not much you can do other than buy Thornmail/Frozen Heart/Randuins as I mention and mitigate the damage.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-23T09:31:14.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"insert a tank here[   ]  now if they have a {{champion:86}} top {{champion:268}} mid {{champion:11}} jg {{champion:67}} adc {{champion:53}} sup then a tank above will build something like this [{{item:3742}} {{item:3102}} {{item:1319}} {{item:3083}} {{item:3075}} and then lastly depending on how much ad or ap they have it will be a {{item:3110}} or {{item:3065}} ] now a adc like vane with a {{item:3153}} {{item:3035}}{{item:3072}} {{item:3006}} will heal before she takes any damage from {{item:3075}} and still do a tone of damage","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T09:46:30.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is where I get back to my original point about maybe it's your team not team-fighting correctly. Yes, in a straight fight, Vayne would and should shred a tank like a buttery biscuit in a woodchipper. But in a team fight, after you engage and soak some damage and provide some CC and utility, Vayne should be taking more damage than she can deal.\n\nHowever, I play tanks a lot, and to good effect, and I've never use the build path you've shown above, so maybe it is your build. If I was building a balanced build, it'd be more like {{item:3068}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} {{item:1321}} with either {{item:3065}} for more MR or {{item:3083}} or maybe a damage-dealing item if I'm ahead. {{item:3102}} and {{item:3075}} are only for fed burst apcs/adcs respectively.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
