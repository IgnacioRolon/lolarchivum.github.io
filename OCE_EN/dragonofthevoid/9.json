I have come to realize he more you play the more experienced you get, the more champions you know the better you can predict what they are going to do and although I think I am good enough to climb I really am not. I always forget to look at the mini map I forget to ward and I make bad plays and decisions.. sure sometimes it is your team and there is nothing you can do .. but if you just keep playing watch some good LoL videos and streams and professional esports you will slowly get there.. I have been trying and it has payed off. (I think the biggest help is to learn from people who are much more experienced than you.. like friends who are in gold or plat or watch top of the boards players in videos and see what they do.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-06-28T02:25:42.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked your history and although there are noobs in bronze, you still have a  lot to learn about the game. I'm guessing the only way to escape bronze is to play carry champs and carry yourself out. Stuff like Katarina, Yi, Hecarim, Akali and Heimerdinger wreck bronze noobies.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-06-29T21:27:02.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer i play Darius in ranked and ad vi jg 2k crit lol but ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-28T02:39:45.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"QQ on the forums","replies":[]},{"poster":"i like cars","date":"2015-06-27T13:51:32.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"no, you are the noob. just play bots or normals untill your at least decent plz.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-06-27T14:51:22.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I always win my lane and my team feed the other lanes and I get stomped by the other lanes","replies":[]}]}]}
