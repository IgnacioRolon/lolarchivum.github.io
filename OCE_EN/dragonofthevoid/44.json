But please do not name and shame on our boards. The best way to raise this to us is to submit a support ticket.\n\nWe take behaviour like this very seriously and will investigate the account. In future please send in a support ticket and do not publicly name and shame.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-08T23:57:07.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I plz ask why cant we name and shame I just don't under stand it.

We would much prefer you to send in a ticket to us privately for us to investigate and action on and skip all the he said she said business.\n\nCurrently the systems are in a conservative mode as we work on the system to improve accuracy. In you case I would definitely say its because of reason 4 below.\n\nRead a bit more about the system here - https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3cf5ky/i_have_never_seen_the_successful_player/csvj1nd?context=3\n\n> There's a couple things that could be happening:\n> 1) The players haven't generated enough incidences of toxicity to be banned, as players aren't usually banned from just 1 game of chatlogs.\n> 2) The player is in queue to be banned, but we're rolling systems out over time so we aren't simply crashing servers with the additional load on the servers.\n> 3) The reporter's report weights are low because they reported inaccurately too often in the past, so the system has decided it needs more data to punish a player beyond just the reporter's report.\n> 4) All new systems launch in a more conservative state, and ramp up aggressively over time--this is solely to minimize false positives, and so we can monitor the system carefully in the first few weeks.\n> The reason people aren't seeing as many Report Feedbacks as they probably should is probably one of the four reasons above, and should continue to improve over time as we make the system more aggressive and more accurate. In fact, we're going to be adding the next \"tier\" of aggressiveness and Intentional Feeding Bans to the system in the next week or so.\n> Happy to answer questions about the system for a bit here.\n\n> [–]Rd_To_Max 12 points 3 months ago \n> \"as players aren't usually banned from just 1 game of chatlogs.\" Whys this? If a player rages and wishes cancer/aids/death/whatever ever why shouldn't they get a chat/ranked ban temporarily?\n\n> [–]RiotLyte 12 points 3 months ago \n> When we are confident in the system's accuracy, we'll aggressively expand the system to tackle behaviors more aggressively so in the future, many behaviors could be banned for just 1 game of chatlogs if it's severe enough.\n> But, when launching a brand new system you usually want to start more carefully and monitor the health and accuracy of the system before letting it loose 100%--this is especially true because we're launching in many new languages for the first time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-08T21:13:03.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He will be banned. The system is very good at picking up on abusive language in-game. But Riot is fair, he will be given his chance at reform just like any other offender.

And the game cant pick up all things if a say dick its as simple as me saying dickk instead. Im still saying the same word but there system wont pick it up and this is what he was doing as he can make the case now that he was not saying anything bad he was just saying random shitt and that's just how it came out. \nthis is not the first case of a player being named 1 week and then 2 weeks later the same player gets named.
