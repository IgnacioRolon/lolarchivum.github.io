If Faker can't carry Bang can, if Bang and Faker can't Carry Marin can. They've got three people on their team who can carry. Fnatic is a bit of a hit or miss. We saw Huni tilt week one, Febiven can be a bit inconsistent though I'd still rate him top 3 midlaners in world after seeing him play against faker and Rekkles can be interesting to say the least. Reignover honestly is a huge key, if he can help Huni or Feb they look decent, as long as Yellowstar and Rekkles at least break even then they have a good chance. Honestly Fnatic is going to have a hard time getting to the final with SKT, first game against EDG will be harder than they think it will be.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-12T06:32:53.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Typhlo,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=jKayMnMn,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-10-12T06:08:48.934+0000)\n>\n>Febiven top 3 midlaners in world\n\n\nlol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-10-12T02:44:37.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT look stronger than anyone else at the tournament. I really like how Fnatic turned it around, but it would be a stretch to say they are looking as strong as SKT right now IMO.\n\nI think in a best of 5, SKT would have the toughest time with the European style of play so Origen or Fnatic might actually have the biggest chance of an upset.  Even then I would still put SKT as massive favourites.\n\nYou could have said the same thing after the early stages of MSI though so you never know. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-12T02:53:43.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"late game skt will win but the early game of fnc atm is so powerful.

People expected a top or support pick but he ended up as AD carry.\n\n* AoE ultimate to protect the backline or even engage. When Febiven is doing that much damage, you can protect him and make him the main carry instead.\n\n* Fast and safe tower/wave pushing. Kennen's AoE wave clear with Runaan's is really strong, and his naturally high attack speed means he can shred through towers.\n \nIt was an interesting, effective pick, but I'm not entirely sold on its viability just yet. Now that Fnatic's played that card, everyone can prepare for it now. But I trust that Fnatic has a few more awesome picks hidden up their sleeves.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-12T06:01:39.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT smoked all competition ever.
