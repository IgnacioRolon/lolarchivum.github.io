If I can catch them it is another story, 2-3 Q hits and most enemies are dead, and if you hit that squishy champion, all it takes is one Q.\n\nNow let's look at why he is so OP and it is very simple, you counter build with nothing but defense and just stack your Q, if the enemy is bad enough you take the tri force for that extra oomph, with 5 defensive items you can't die, your ult means not only do you survive longer, but you hit harder again.","replies":[]}]}
