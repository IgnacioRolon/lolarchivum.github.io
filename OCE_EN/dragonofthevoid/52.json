So they don't need a tank meta to save him from feeding anymore. They make the ADC meta to help WildTurtle, but he was benched before he could show it. At least DoubleLift will show it for them instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-30T06:08:36.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why is this getting marked down","replies":[]}]}
