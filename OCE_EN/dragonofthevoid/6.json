Honestly it's good for Riot to keep a few noob champions, that are easy to play. \n\nPoppy desperately needs a rework though, Riot themselves have said she's problematic. Karthus, Taric, Singed both need a significant buff or small change, and Yorick... Probably just remove him at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-05T21:16:14.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:19}} is so reliant on his ult and any cc can stop it \n{{champion:20}} dose nothing in team fights and gets destroyed by many of the meta jg picks \n{{champion:9}} is so reliant on his ult if you just cc him before he can activate it he is shit \n{{champion:33}} I meant to say with some of theses champ 1 thing his ult needs a rework same with {{champion:106}} \n{{champion:10}} needs a op item to be strong sated got nerfed so she is week again its the same with urgot unless he has a op item he is week \n{{champion:27}} is toxic to the game no pun intended as he is a 1 hit wonder he just runs around him and the donger just don't fit into the game \n{{champion:30}} is another champ that is reliant on items and is toxic to the game his q is so annoying take him top and he will go 10 0 0 win lane 9/10 times and have the darius rage at you lol \n\nmany champs need a rework look at darius with his rework you can go ad ad tank tank ap if you wont to troll and still go 10000 0 2 \nbut someone like fid he is so week you cant do much with him at all same with taric","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-06T00:37:15.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:19}} The faults in Warwick's ult gives him counterplay. He needs this or else the skill benefit ratio would be too low. He's still strong in solo situations, and when the enemies have no CC.\n\n{{champion:20}} Nunu is a disrupter and support in team fights. He gives his team crazy stats, like a 45% attack speed buff and a 25% attack speed debuff to enemies. He can also out-smite anyone in the game, and is extremely annoying when played counter jungle.\n\n{{champion:9}} Other people who are also reliant on their ultimate's Wukong, Amumu, Malphite, Tryndamere (to some extent) and Nocturne to name a few. Fiddlesticks ult is OP as hell, therefore he needs to be weaker in other areas.\n\n{{champion:33}} Rammus ult is great, it damages turrets when you need it to, and deals consistent AOE damage.\n\n{{champion:10}} Maybe you're right with this one, she has been rather problematic through out the years, resulting in her current state.\n\n{{champion:27}} Singed is very unique strategically that's all. He's actually not that bad right now, I know a few friends in Plat who play him Top all the time.\n\n{{champion:30}} Karthus is fine. I don't know what this Karthus top bullshit is about, but he's not so broken that he needs a rework. Pick anyone with a gap closer and he'll struggle, like Riven and Wukong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smeagi","date":"2015-10-06T13:53:29.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i think riot said if anyone found a way to improve her early game at all they would immediately nerf her.
