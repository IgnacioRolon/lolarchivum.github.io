Champion reworks are quite hard to complete, even more so in champions cases such as Yorick. Due to the nature of the champion and the players that only play Yorick it's hard to change him and keep the old players happy. I hope that gives an understandable reason to the delay. (Keep in mind the other champions that are getting reworked.) I hope you can have a good time on Fields of Justice summoner and may you be Victorious!","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-05T21:19:16.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep in mind that's why we have that thing called the pbe so we can see how op reworked skarner was not and not tell riot that he is op and for about a week have him destroy solo q\n\nedit they let skarner to live severs they don't know what balance is ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-10-10T05:36:53.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obvious troll post.
