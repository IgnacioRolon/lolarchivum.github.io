From my knowledge; the main line is Riot does not endorse having smurfs. If you are caught out pretty much abusing the system then Riot can terminate all accounts associated with you because essentially it is all of their property. Meaning you don't even own your account.. It's their property always. Maybe Riot should speak up on the subject instead of keeping it under the rug.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-24T10:04:02.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer I just think its bs if they don't ban 1 player for smurfing then they cant ban someone else for doing the same thing","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-25T08:53:51.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a simple question, no need to be harmful, at least he's not 12 right :/ \nTwelvies... *shivers*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Derpyberpderp","date":"2015-09-24T08:21:11.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The thing is that it's too stressful for the pros to keep versing hard people, they actually need time off instead of just versing challenger level players.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-24T09:59:21.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what your saying is that all of us have to deal with a pro player or plat smurfs","replies":[]}]}]}
