But maybe we should nerf Ezreal or Lucian.\r\n\r\nRito Overlord: You&#039;re right, underling. Nerf their base AD by 1 and double their AD growth. Then nerf all their AD ratios on basic abilities by 10% and double the damage on their ultimates. We&#039;ll call this....&quot;windows of power.&quot;\r\n\r\nRito Underling: Sir, those are buffs, not nerfs.\r\n\r\nRito Overlord: Nonsense, fool! Remember when we nerfed Vayne, Fiora, Ahri, and Master Yi into the ground? Remember when we buffed Teemo and Zyra? Clearly you have no idea what the fuck a nerf or a buff is, underling!\r\n\r\nPatch ships. Community says &quot;wtf.&quot;\r\n\r\nRito Overlord: Now, now, Community. We just nerfed all these champions because we &quot;listen (tm)&quot; and &quot;value your feedback (tm).&quot; We need 3 full seasons to collect data before maybe possibly finding a Reddit post that tells us how to do our job correctly. At that point we will maybe possibly consider potential hypothetical changes that may or may not solve the problem. Look for some tweaks sometime around patch 9.4. In the meantime, we think Fiddlesticks is oppressive, so we&#039;re removing AP jungle items from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-24T15:33:22.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito Overlord: we making money?\n\nRito Underling: yep!\n\nrito hq:https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Laughing-Villains.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-24T21:14:47.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]}]}
