Yes in this game il go 5 10 0 but if you were to look at the amount of global gold I gave the team and add that in with the amount of turrents I got the team I would have don&#039;t more for the team then if I went 20 0 0. \r\n\r\nplz under stand this game has nothing to do with kills yes call me a nub yes feed me more power it has to do with towers as seen in pro league look at any game were a team will go 0 to 20 but will have the same amount of gold why well if you look at the map you will see that this team has 6 turrents and this team only has 1 this is like challenger above. \r\n\r\nand in this game were I was {{champion:48}} we won as they enemy team had 1 lane with super minions and me in it now if I had team fight we would of lost that game as there would not be any super minions in there base.\r\n\r\nSo next time you flame me or a other player for split pushing wen the enemy is fed remember you get gold for them killing turrents so wen you are in a game like this don&#039;t flame instead help them by stoping the enemy team from going b and let them get into there base and take something.\r\nEven if you are fighting a 4v5 don&#039;t think they are not helping the team. \r\n\r\nOk now you can kill me or tell me im a nub it will only make me stronger.  \r\n\r\nP.S. im only just starting to learn English so im sorry for the grammar or incorrectly spelt words.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-13T17:02:33.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the perils of risky decisions","replies":[]},{"poster":"NatsuDragneel612","date":"2015-10-13T15:48:53.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many have you possibly lost though because you didn't help the team out? I agree that split pushing is a big part of the game. But so is knowing when to do it. Also any decent team won't care if you are pushing one lane if they have taken out the rest of your team, they will just keep pushing their lane and taking out towers, with maybe one of them splitting off to go after you. Sometimes though you need to be there to help your team, sometimes you might be the deciding factor.","replies":[]}]}
