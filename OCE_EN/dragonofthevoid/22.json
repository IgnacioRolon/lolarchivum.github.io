Is it seen as a reportable offense or is it not negative enough? \n> \n> One of our philosophies is to try to not dictate what's OK or not OK in League of Legends unless we absolutely have to. We rely on data like Reports, Honors, social media, the Instant Feedback System and Tribunal to help determine the standards of what the community believes is OK or not OK. This is why all of our systems are intentionally designed to be community-driven, because we want players to have the ability to invest in and shape their own community. In saying this, looking at the data, \"GGEZ\" is considered a negative term, and is reportable. Players generally agree that the phrase is rarely used in a positive context, and is a pretty sour way to end a match.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-01T02:15:25.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ow well ty I did not know it was reportable just ticks me off iv had 50 min games were it goes to a base race and they tern around if they win and say ggez nubs I find it so toxic its like it was a good game and you have to go and be toxic after it like just why","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-10-01T02:23:27.776+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I agree, and from what we've seen \"gg ez\" is considered a negative term by a lot of players.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-01T04:21:48.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In other words, the banning system says GGEZ when you say GGEZ, stop feeding the bans system guys, he can 3 shot tanks now!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-01T03:06:55.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer I see it a lot more before 9pm lol them littlie 12 year olds have to go to bed ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-01T03:02:55.441+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stay free.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-09-30T14:51:27.738+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"GG EZ","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-30T15:24:58.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im gona find were you live and ...........hug you \nDAM RIOT RULES","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"stuzzo2","date":"2015-10-01T12:24:30.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you med?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-01T13:12:27.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its mad not med \nand no im fine I just find it toxic","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-04T16:41:08.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=snakeowen,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=kan48AtP,comment-id=00090000,timestamp=2015-10-01T13:12:27.394+0000)\n>\n> its mad not med \n> and no im fine I just find it toxic\n\nKappa 123 gg ez im  not talking about ezi im talking about ezreal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-10-01T13:16:14.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You are getting mad for someone talking s*** in a video game?
