It's just when you won , the team was obviously in the higher elo bracket and were expected to win. The win you obtain from your provisional is probably game where 52% chance of your team winning and 48% their team winning \n\nPreseason also doesn't change how the MMR system work overall , the MMR system remain the same unless you skip a year of playing ranked ( by not playing any soloq for roughly a season)  in that case it take into a different formula\n\nOT : Rank is a system to place you where the system think you belong , you can gain MMR through winning ranked games , you can also lose MMR if you lose games. The season last from Jan to Oct/Nov and then we enter preseason . During a season, getting gold and above will reward you w/ a skin . Being ranked will award you w/ an icon and a border (only apply for silver and above).  The system uses an algorithm of formula to work out your MMR. Playing your first 10 games will give the system a hint of where you might belong , the system will start you off at 1.2k MMR which is Silver V , and every win/lose will net you or lose you MMR . The system then place you in a League that it think you belong to . Afterward you can \"climb the ladder\" to a higher ranking .","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-12-04T09:56:41.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh i see thank use both alot for that explanation! Is there a way that i can view my MMR?\n\nSince completing my provisional matches and being place in Silver IV, i played 2 more games since and won both i think i have about 60 LP now whatever that means, i've read somewhere that you need 100 LP to get a promotional match is that right?","replies":[{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-12-04T10:04:24.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is explained in your League tabs but yes you require 100 LP to get into a promotion, if your MMR is really high you will be able to skip a division . With the new promotion helper implemented by Riot, if you lose your series (promo) then whenever you get back into it you will gurantee 1 win ( series) , 2 win (promotion to next league)","replies":[{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-12-04T11:04:57.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yes what a handy tab! tyvm :)\n\nUp to 90LP now 3wins in a row woo, almost time to earn me a promotion :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
