I'm not saying it would be anywhere close to the same, but it's a similar territory and they'd want to be careful about how they went about it. I imagine there would be other high priority concepts. \n\nThere is also the whole idea that each skin/skin theme is it's own alternate canon of a sort. The Bloodmoon skins as far as we have seen are reserved as the Ionian representation of the spirits from the shadow Isles. The Blood Moon Shen/Akali etc being like the festivals in much of Asia that celebrate that culture and the Blood Moon Kali/Thresh etc being the spirits themselves but as they are perceived by Ionia. Diana of course is not affiliated with Ionia.\n\nThat said, I reckon a Bloodmoon Di skin would be pretty fab. Or Bloodmoon Karma...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-11-15T08:04:10.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the fact that Teemo has plenty of skins, Naut has a few but Diana only has 2 -_-","replies":[]}]}]}]}
