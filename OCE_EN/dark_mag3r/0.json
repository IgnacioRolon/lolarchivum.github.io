OCE community is nothing like NA, we are on a much smaller scale. \n\n1. It wasn't too long ago that ranked wasn't even 24/7, it ended at 4 am and started at 8 am, because there were not enough players. \n\n2. We don't even have Normal Draft pick on here because apparently \"our player base cannot support it\", although I believe this one is massive bull shit.\n\n3. Twisted Treeline is only on Thursday - Saturday for a few hours each day. \n\nQueue times would be just be so long, it wasn't too long ago that team builder queue times were 3+ hours, now imagine dominion, it would be literally days!\n\nThe best way is to start up a custom game, and call it \"Dominion Queue for OCE come join!\" or something, maybe post it on the boards and get a little community going.","replies":[]}]}
