But I would appreciate a Rioter looking into it and punishing this player. We had a tahm ban Vayne, who this guy had selected as wanting to play. Tahm made a mistake and didn&#039;t see it, and said that. But then this player goes off, abuses the hell out of him and declares that he is going to feed. The game loads in and his afk for the first half, comes back and is still abusive, saying that his pc crashed and it was a coincidence. Either way, aside from the potential intentional afk, his behaviour was shocking. Usually I just deal with it and ignore, but I think it reached a level where this player deserves punishment.\n\nHere&#039;s my copy paste of the champ select chat: (I&#039;m assuming Riot has the ability to view the actual chat to confirm this)\n_Player 1_ joined the lobby\n_player 2_ joined the lobby\nYe 1 joined the lobby\n_player 3_ joined the lobby\n_player 4_ joined the lobby\n_Player 1_  : pls\n_Player 1_  : do not ban yas\n_Player 1_  : i LUV YOU &lt;#\n_Player 1_  : &lt;3\n_player 3_ : lol\n_player 3_  : i like it\n_player 2_  : ....\n_player 2_  : wtf\n_player 2_ : ok feeding\n_player 4_  &lt;3Riv : dont please\n_player 3_ : you should have declared you wanted vayne dude\nYe 1 : you banned his champ\n_player 2_  : I HAD IT SELECTED U %%%%t\n_player 3_ : lol\n_player 3_ : soz didnt see\n_player 2_  : kill yourself\n_player 2_  : no\n_player 2_  : kill yourself\n_player 2_  : just go now\n_player 2_ : i wanna fuking see u dead on the news\n_player 2_  : you %%%%t","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-01T01:27:39.832+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, this is an instance where dodging is your best option. If a team is fighting this much early on (even though they are being immature over a mistake), its worth losing the 3lp in place of the inevitable 20+. \n\nReporting this player in the end of game screen is of the utmost importance, because its the only way to ensure that your report will stack up agains the player when leading to a punishment. Manual reviews (that can take into consideration pre and post game chats) are also triggered from end of game reporting. \n\nWhile I do agree this player deserves punishment (IMO a ban due to the comments encouraging suicide), reporting players on the boards is [against the rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)) (hence names being edited out) and does not actually do anything. \n\nIf you didn't report them at the end of game, go ahead and send in a [support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). \n\n>Please create a max of 1 ticket about this issue, and do not try to add any information afterwards/submit multiple as it will bump it to the back of the queue. It can take up to 7 business days for them to get back to you, so be patient. Also, please keep in mind that Riot can not tell you if the players receive a punishment, nor go into detail about their potential punishments due to privacy reasons, but rest assured that they will look into it.\nHowever, In the future, please ensure to keep utilising the end of game report feature, as it is the most efficient and effective way to report players ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Ye 1","date":"2016-12-01T01:37:22.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice, and sorry about the names.
