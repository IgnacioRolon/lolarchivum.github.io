Please keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week). During this time do not lodge multiple tickets or continue adding information to your existing ticket, as it may send your enquiry to the back of the queue.\n\nIn the future, be sure to use the end-game reporting screen as consistent reports through this feature is the best way to get a player punished. \n\nDue to privacy reasons Riot can't respond to your ticket with details about if a punishment was handed out or not.\n\nCourt more than likely can't help you for something like this and will just cost you money. Very few people would believe what some random negative player in game says about you.\n\nAlso please note that Riot cannot provide you another players chat logs as it is against privacy laws.","replies":[{"poster":"ValkyrieJD","date":"2016-05-06T10:26:57.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"okay so people like you and riot will not be any help. I understand. then I will be the same person, who being a real toxic to me, to every other people in the game. It sounds like a kid but this will be much more fun aye? rather than just get stressed and wasting time to report people.\nSo all you said is if I am being toxic to other people, no one will stop me aye? got you! thank you for being real help","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-06T10:32:32.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to have misunderstood. \n\nWe don't want people to start \"witch hunts\" for players, who might not even be guilty. But even if they were guilty, getting people to harass a toxic player doesn't fix anything. It often creates circles of hate and divided communities. This is why there is a no name and shame policy on boards. We only have your word on the matter.\n\nSupport on the other hand can see chat logs and the like and investigate the issue for you further. That said they won't be able to tell you of any outcomes, again because of privacy laws.\n\nAt no point did I say we would not help, nor did I say that if you are toxic you will go unpunished. I am simply directing you to the people who can actually help you in your specific situation. Rest assured, if you decide to be consistently toxic in game you WILL be punished for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
