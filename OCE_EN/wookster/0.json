He's also a pretty basic Champion. Xerath on the other hand is common for scripters, is picked a decent amount and is much harder to do well and win with. The player was also losing most of their games unless they picked Xerath where they suddenly won almost every game and had great KDAs.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-25T07:50:48.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fucking Sherlock Trinity.\n\nGJ.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-24T23:26:44.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send in a [support ticket ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) \n\nCautiion- it may take a lil while for Riot to get back to you (1-3 days), but please don't continue to spam tickets, as it will push you towards the bottom of the que.\n\nIn the meantime, [check this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/5dmkJinG-3rd-party-applicationsmodifications-whats-allowed-and-what-isnt) and see if your mate recognizes anything he may have used.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-25T03:45:46.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty that was very useful \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-25T07:00:58.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol dem xeraths. get rekt scrublord","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neckbeard Billy","date":"2016-02-25T00:54:23.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have been playing since season one and I have been perma-suspended as well, apparently loads of people have been banned for the same reason as I have..
