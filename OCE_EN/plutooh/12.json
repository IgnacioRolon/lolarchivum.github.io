Say something along the lines of &#039;Positive Attitude&#039; or similar??\r\n\r\nJust had a game of ARAM where one poor guy on the enemy side had 4 bots on his team but he refused to give up and instead of getting pissed off kept a positive vibe going.","replies":[{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-25T00:33:53.869+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i really want to upvote this as i like the way the honnor system has been going and feel that they need to continune the way the have been going with it.\ni would like to ask tho what your view is have you found the honnor system is working thus far?\nwould there maybe be an extra glow for honnorable opponents?\nhow do we stop trolls from abusing it and people possible farming it?","replies":[{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-11-25T08:18:08.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can pretty much farm the honour system now with premade teams or clubs, players giving each other honours instead of those that deserve it so I think being able to honour opponents shouldn't be a problem.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-25T04:54:39.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"When the new Honour system came up Riot did say they had plans to add opponent honours into it at some point, can't recall if there's been any update on when that might be though.

Hopefully once the new season has started and been ongoing for a couple months they'll start to revisit adding honour for opponents into the system, *maybe* have it by/for the mid-season update if that happens.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-25T05:58:26.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah their To-Do-Now list is full of trying to make more money out of the people who play the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-25T04:25:17.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Honestly don't know why it was removed to be honest.\n\nOther then the fact that \"honor one person\" is the aim of the new system.\n\nOh yeah and it's not like it just get's abused how it is, and that premades generally just keep their own honor's.","replies":[]}]}
