Back in 2012 - 2014 they were everywhere and none ever got banned. Don't talk about things you don't understand because you saw one bot in a low-level game. Go play any MMORPG and you'll see bots. Go and play any FPS and you'll encounter an aimbotter. Heck, people even have scripts for mobile games. PokÃ©mon GO was botted on to Hell and back. The point is that every game has cheaters, no matter how advanced the anti-cheat is, the cheaters will bypass it and it's a war that is back and forth.","replies":[{"poster":"AlexandSam","date":"2016-08-30T17:00:37.600+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, you are some arrogant jerk.\n\n\"Don't talk about things you don't understand because you saw one bot in a low-level game\"\n\nYou have crested the height of ignorance.

I played together with a friend who was lvl10 and they're really good and I am trying to encourage them to just play pvp but when we played together vs bots even I had difficulty dealing with the super fed enemy bots whilst the other 3 people in my game just ran down lane without any items and my friend is like how can we win this? it's over. I mean eventually an experienced player will get items, build almost full damage and just outplay bots and then just push and carry (though annie, malphite, shyvanna and nocturne bots are extremely grueling to play against when they are that fed and can wombo you without giving you much time to dodge). It doesn't feel good almost losing to bots and the game is just so frustrating like this.\n\nI am lvl30, been playing for almost 6 months now and I consider myself only slightly below the average league player in skill, but I was struggling with a teammate who didn't play too badly and only 3 feeders to deal with. I can't imagine a new player who is just coming to grips with the game enjoying getting curb stomped by Ai with 4 noncommunicating itemless feeding bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-30T04:20:47.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's actually harder than playing 5v1 custom matches and trying to get pentakills.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-09T11:23:14.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Plutooh,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=nMIYMiRc,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-08-29T09:43:11.453+0000)\n>\n> The point is though, Riot have lost control of their game.\n> \n> It used to belong to Riot, it now belongs to the script kiddies who run the bots.\n\ntheir downfall was when Tencent completely bought them","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"stormbringer4tw","date":"2016-10-08T22:18:29.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While these \"bots\" are getting improved in numbers, is there anything as players we can do?
