So he got me to the promos making sure I did my part well and not just relayed on him and well I got lucky made it to silver 5 by solo and never ranked again.

These children need to learn some manners. Schools should be teaching some sort of politeness, this world's kids have only gotten ever more toxic over the years, and it all starts from bad influence from other students in schools.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2015-11-29T21:16:00.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, and see what you are talking about first hand five days a week, most weeks. Being a school captain, I observe a lot more than the average student, and I can tell you now, in the next 10 years, it won't get any better. All the kids are little shi.ts with no more than half a brain or any knowledge of acceptable communication strategies. We even had to have a \"Formal Etiquette\" lesson in the lead up to our graduation dinner this week. 20 years ago that never would have existed, because it was just known. Not anymore, though. Now, apparently, every parent just lets their kids go out in shopping centres on their own, handing them their credit card and saying \"do whatever the fuc.k you want\". This needs to stop in society. Kids need to realise that being a shi.t will get them nowhere, and the kids that get the good grades get them in part due to their behaviour.","replies":[{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2015-12-01T16:52:27.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=EzeBlood,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=qoE80vcn,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-11-29T21:16:00.709+0000)\n>\n> ...
