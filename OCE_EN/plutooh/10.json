Making it singular (there is only one), we use the word 'has' not 'have' for singular entities.  Meanwhile \"They're\" is an abbreviation of \"they are\", \"their\" is the word that signals ownership.\n\nSo the meaning of the sentence you wrote is: _\"Surely many Chinas have themselves that are servers to play on?\"_\n\nWho needs glasses again?","replies":[{"poster":"1250","date":"2020-01-24T15:17:27.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you need them nerd lol 7777777777777777","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DucNguyen","date":"2020-01-21T14:10:10.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Plutooh,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=ynwBIRtB,comment-id=,timestamp=2020-01-19T11:19:52.180+0000)\n>\n> I've seen maybe a handful of English names lately the rest are Chinese names who don't seem to speak English and certainly don't seem to work as a team.
