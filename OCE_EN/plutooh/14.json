If I play, I lose about 20 LP, and will be 2-3 wins from promos, and by the time I get those wins the season will be an hour from ending, so I cannot get Gold V.\n\nIf I dodge, then I will be banned for something that isn't my fault, and because it's a ban, I lose my Silver rewards too. And those troller/inters will get away free and still get their rewards.\n\nAt least in the current system, I can dodge, lose 3 LP, still win 1 game to get into promos, and have enough time to get Gold V before the season ends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-13T04:12:55.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dodgers should certainly get punished but what you suggested is way too extreme, and I thought getting perma banned through talking in chat was bad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-13T00:59:47.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perma ban for dodging 3 times?\n\n2/10 troll thread.
