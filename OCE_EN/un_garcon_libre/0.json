By DarkReclaimer :D   :~)  :P","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;ve been playing League of Legends for a while, and Akali is one of my favourite champions. During a game today, I was playing against a Soraka, and noticed something. There are no viable items to build on a mana-less champion that give grevious wounds or another method of countering healing champions, and I&#039;m writing to enquire if something might be done about this. Liandries doesn&#039;t really cout because it&#039;s health percentage, not grevious wounds :~). I know it&#039;s a big ask, and that I&#039;m just one person, but I feel that it&#039;d be a good thing to do to balance the game. Cheers for reading lads and ladies, glhf.\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  \r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-11T04:14:23.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since it's been changed, grievous wounds only reduces self-healing by 40%. If you were hoping to stop Soraka heals (and similar champs) from saving someone else's life the best way to do that is kill her first.\n\nFrom your post I'm under the impression you are asking for another **AP** grievous wounds item. I doubt that such a thing will be added since there are already a bunch of ways to apply the effect and it comes down to deciding as a team which one's you are going to use.\n\n* If you play mid or support you can take {{summoner:14}}. \n* If you play ADC you can build {{item:3123}} into {{item:3033}}.\n* If you play top you can also pick up {{item:3123}} for only 800g. I know it doesn't seem ideal on every champ but if you feel you are losing out to the sustain of a Maokai or Vlad it might be worth giving it a go once. It might even work on Akali who needs auto attacks to proc her q damage and has a bit of ad scaling.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-11T16:28:59.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm happy to see more grevous wounds items being released into the game since stacking life steal on champions like {{champion:157}}  have become to the point of absurdity allowing them to regenerate most of their hp within moments and to incline people into optimizing their build more towards doing so.","replies":[]},{"poster":"mrorchardpedo","date":"2016-04-10T23:53:56.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sik idea mate {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[]}]}
