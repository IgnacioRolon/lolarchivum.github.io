So i dont know if its just me but in the top right it looks like a eye, Mainly a lizard eye or dragon eye not only that but, if you look at the picture it looks like a bunch off blur bards are rushing into it maybe not bards but spirits and isnt this dragon Aurelion Sol a spirit dragon?. now i might just be crazy cause im the only one who sees this but in the picture it looks like theres a face on the left of the it like i said i could just be crazy but its what i see. But in pantheons lore ,leonas and dianas they went to the top of \nthe mountain went through a rift portal and got a powers from the gods maybe the big eye could be a portal or rift.\n\nOk so we just got a new clip on the league of legends home page and we got to see him and here him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=CAAnY_L4Pp4 in this he pretty much explains that he can go to different universes. at the start you see a light orb flying through the sky which seems to just be effects of a shooting star but no, watch a bit more and you will see that it is something personally i think its the dragon but right after you see it vanishes into thin air and you see his claw and his head and he crushes the orb right after it lights up and becomes big. is this showing what he does to planets because while he does that hes speaking about how they scream for mercy.And by the way does that spear at the start look like {{champion:80}} and if you can remember in the first video {{champion:80}} was standing on a point that looked exactly like that does this mean that the dragon killed him and took over mount targon?! but what about leona and diana.\n\nOk so i watched this a few times and read some other theorys and ive started to think that the light ball isnt the thing he crushes. I think that is a start that hes pulling in to destroy. so i pretty much think he pulls lots of stars in to make some sort of giant star? or a orb of energy And remember the video is called the star forger is returns! in a nut shell i think....... He is a massive dragon that can travel between universes and camos to look like the sky then sucks in lots of stars or planets creates a massive star or orb of light then destroys them. To be honest i dont have much to talk about mount targon except panthenon the guardian knows aurelion sol is coming.\n\nThis i what the new dragon champion i hope you enjoyed reading this is one of my 1st posts. btw the vote is for the 1st video. ill be adding more explanation till he comes out\n\n \nwhat do you guys think!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-02T05:37:42.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aurelion Sol is a storm dragon.
