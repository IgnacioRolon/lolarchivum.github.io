It&#039;s not her damage that makes her win rates so high, it&#039;s the enemy&#039;s inability to play against an Ahri. Just wanted to say, because I happen to be an Ahri main, and this nerf just didn&#039;t seem fair to me or other Ahri players.","replies":[{"poster":"Shad0wbird","date":"2017-05-25T12:55:08.954+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Ahri main i am obviously not happy about the nerf, but i do understand where riot is coming from, she is very strong at the moment. i just hope that these changes don't put her down to the point she was a few years ago.","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-05-24T07:55:08.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda a tweak.

Her ult lost 5%.\n\nThey moved a tiny bit of her power from her \"free\" W that auto targets to a skilshot so in order to do damage you need to be good. Nothing wrong with that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-26T02:15:20.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another mindless nerf. I can understand shifting some power from W to E but they shouldn't nerf her ultimate.\n\nJust because a champion is popular or Faker played it at MSI doesn't mean just nerf it.\n\nDo they have to nerf things in every patch? Balance team, please hire someone like Scarra or LS for advice before nerfing everything.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T05:21:02.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As has been said in other comments, they moved power from her W AND her Ult to her E. It was a rebalance not a nerf overall. It shifts her power so that the people that are actually good with Ahri are still as potent as she can be now (which is very much so) but so that as a champion she doesn't reward sub-par play just by virtue of having abilities that can't be avoided.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-26T06:11:15.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As BarryButcher said. \"Her W lost 10% but her E gained 10%.
