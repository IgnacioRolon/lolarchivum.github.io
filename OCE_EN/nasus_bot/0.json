I thought that it would be nice to try skins out before making decisions to buy new skins. I do know there is a 100% agreement in the community that custom skins do get you banned as some pose an unfair advantage, (hitbox, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-13T01:09:37.370+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot's standing policy regarding 3rd party software is that it's \"use at your own risk\", particularly when it comes to things that interfere with or alter the game files (like something that would give you custom skins, or skins you haven't paid for). Anything that gives an unfair advantage is obviously high priority, and treated as more of a \"definitely not allowed\" situation. Any time you use such software, you risk getting picked up by the detection systems and subsequently banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Nasus Bot","date":"2018-11-13T01:18:14.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for your comment, highly appreciated!","replies":[]}]}]}
