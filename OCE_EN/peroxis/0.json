It's just how it is atm and it would continue for the foreseeable future as far as I know, which is sad aye.\n\nFor me, I'm only paying big attention to **Guild War 2** and **Final Fantasy 14** in terms of MMORPGs really, since they're like imo ones among the only few bigger and prominent releases that actually got both the gameplay and social/community aspects of MMORPGs right and taking after the games like say EverQuest, Ragnarok and WoW, while many others are busy shifting to \"singleplayers with friends\"; I mean hell, even games like say idk, Dark Souls, you know that solo game with drop-in-and-out online mode, has more meaningful and memorable interactions between players than a lot of MMORPGs these days.\n\nThen again, those 2 games I mentioned just then do not have Aus, SEA or OCE server and probably never will. So thanks for the cockblock God, we love you. But I guess the pings are somewhat manageable and something worth to overlook for the GW2 and FF14 (though I face another challenge, my PC.........).\n\n................\n\nThat said, there's also the **Black Desert Online**, it's supposedly a rather sandbox-y MMORPG where you can just go about doing your own thing while ignoring the \"game\" like being a full-time farmer/trader or whatever for life or something from what I've heard. So if you like that, you may like BDO too. Though a piece of advice, the game has action-combat system, a very aggressive one at that, and there is no OCE server, which means combat most likely won't feel great at all. That and, the game has a very high graphics requirement afaik (though don't quote me on this one), so you might want to beef up your PC if you want to dive into this one.\n\n**Wildstar** seemed like a magnificent MMORPG and a diamond waiting to shine big time before it came out, and idk what happened, but the game has been pretty dead by MMO standards in population ever since it was released, and it never got that much better. I think it was mostly to do with the poor performance or something but honestly judging by gameplay alone the game seems like a real blast. Though I wouldn't recommend it now due to the \"death-spiral\" problem with MMO games when it comes to low active population. Shame.\n\nLast but not least, **Crowfall**, I've been following that for a bit. From what I've heard, Crowfall is a very different game than what we generally consider as MMORPGs: Essentially the game is \"seasonal\" in a sense that besides the hub world where the player builds and lives their houses etc, the game world which players play in is released and terminated permanently in a timely/scheduled basis, which I'm not sure I like the sound of that due to the issues with player-train-catching, concern with budget and content quality, and all that. But who knows. That being said, the game is still in rather early stages of development, so unless you're extremely passionate about the project (which is a very ambitious one I'll give them that) and want to be personally involved, I say wait and see, it still needs a couple years before actually coming out anyway.\n\n................\n\nComing back to\n\n>I don't know what people are enjoying at the moment especially in Australia.\n\nIt would seem due to the unlucky circumstances with MMORPGs, I would say most Australian players are spread between WoW (finally have OCE servers recently), ARTS/MOBA (Dota2, League etc; they have OCE servers these days), competitive shooters (CoD, BF, CS:GO, TF2 etc; they've always have OCE servers, either player or officially hosted), a couple live in the other popular MMORPGs but to a significantly much lesser degree than other regions would be mostly due to the absence of OCE servers and ping, off-shoots like Path of Exile which is a MMO Diablo where it came out with an OCE sever because the dev is based in NZ, endlessly going between popular f2p games to waste time, playing online games that are unaffected by pings like CCG (say, Hearthstone), and maybe the rest just go singleplayer for lyfe. Or something. Though what I've mentioned above are personal observations and opinions, it may not be factually correct, so don't take it too seriously.\n\n**However 1 thing is clear, OCE really needs some MMORPG love.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bevan03","date":"2017-03-12T05:07:24.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing a fair bit of EVE Online.

Still probably give it a try.\n\nSo Crowfall have an Australian server during testing (alpha/beta). They said that there will be an Australian server on release if the numbers in the closed alpha+betas (through backing the game) and open betas and signups look promising. This is a pretty big deal I reckon, that is why I think it will be up to Australian players knowing about this game, so they can try it at open beta, and thus they can justify having the Australian server long term.\n\nIn terms of the game, it does look like it is all about guilds and socializing, and less about ridiculous time investment (the game worlds die after all, although there are persistent elements like the world you own). You can play solo for sure, but I think being affiliated or mercenary at least for some guilds makes sense, since you could be seen as hostile (think survival games). Really innovative and cool concepts in there, which appeal to me as someone with limited gaming time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2017-03-12T06:55:48.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played Istaria. Not a very developed game. First one I played. Things i liked most about it was it had playable dragons. It wasn't just nice cos dragons, but it was just a unique race, with it's own buildings, culture etc. In other words it stood out. You felt like a dragon, whereas all the other playable races were essentially the same race, but looked different. That's a big problem I have with MMOs. Most of the options are essentially the same thing thing, just tweaked slightly. Whether it is race or class. And the same goes with the world they're in. \n\nI currently play WoW and the fact that it's playable areas go back years is easy to see how the design has changed. The oldest areas are essentially the same areas split off by mountain ranges. The previous expansion, legion did a great first step at making areas unique, and i mean really unique.  but again they were mostly separated by mountain ranges. Currently in Legion I think they took it to a whole new level. Area design is great. We have a continent with distinct areas that are not just cut off by mountain ranges and each flows with the neighbouring one. It doesn't just cut off. And each area is unique, but makes sense. The same goes ofr artifical buildings like cities, camps etc. They didn't just stick different looking areas next to each other. The new class system gives you a sense of playing your class. That's what I mean by when I say classes feel the same. There's nothing clear that separates them, you just know you're playing X class. Although I feel they could do more. And finally the same problem with races. Some feel more unique than others, but essentially they're all the same.\n\n\nI've gone through the lore and the art made by Riot, they have a chance to make a really great MMO that can be very different from the others. With unique classes, factions, world design etc, a brand new feel. Hell I'd fly to murica (or wherever they're based) and pay them to teach me how to draw and do game design if that's what it takes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-03-12T05:23:34.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chronicles of Elyria is something I have my eye on as well.
