Civ? Spend X amount of turns before you're capable of taking on Rome?\n\nURF is fun, it's fast, there's no minions, gold difference is irrelevant, it starts to become more about your skill with the champion and less about how many boring AI you've got the last hit on. Which is important, because minions are boring and gold differences are simply a way to make minions matter.\n\nFor instance, against a Nid/Jayce top lane, I was Malphite, friend was GP. Needless to say, GP had backed before 1mn thanks to the constant spears. But GP dropped a ward into the brush, Viktor TP'd up and came up behind, we converged on them and picked up first blood, and eventually won the game. Not because our champions were superior, not because we killed more boring AI who don't attack us unless we do something stupid, not because we had an advantage in lane, but because we could outplay the other people.\n\nAnd that's the game I want to play.\n\nAnd given how popular URF was, it seems a lot of other people think that way as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Donald Trumpet","date":"2015-01-26T08:17:40.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Slim Chaedi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Tih7msRw,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-26T08:08:58.847+0000)\n>\n> Although I think having URF back would be cool, the fanaticism is ridiculous.
