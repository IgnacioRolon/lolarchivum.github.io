I can have a great run where i will win several games in a row until I make it into promos, this is when the BS starts I swear they place me with the worst players they can find when I hit promos to top it off they&#039;re almost always trolls, my last game the top laner (who picked mid then raged out because he wanted top) gives 1st blood then spams gg on the chat prompting a quick mute this wasn&#039;t the worst performance though as the jg decided it was time to eat and went afk 3 minutes into the game and never returned. Now as a sup main it makes life extremely hard as any sup main should be able to create great plays and set things up but never really carry instead I end up with a score of 3/2/1 before losing a game before the 20 min mark as my top lane goes 2/8 my mid lane goes 1/6 and my adc goes 0/3 because he couldn&#039;t side step a minion  as lucian O.o. League needs to rethink how the rank system works perhaps looking at individual performances such as getting an S at the end of a game your team gets absolutely pumped in that player shouldn&#039;t have huge reductions in LP or players who play the game properly and push objectives instead of the all too familiar teemo standing in a bush for 3-5mins at a time shrooming hoping for a cheese kill. Obviously the salt is real right now but I&#039;m sick of putting up with people who decide they&#039;re going to play a ranked game just so they can fuck you over as they obviously never get punished despite frequent reports going their way. Perhaps league should just refund every cent I&#039;ve spent on their game as they repeatedly fail to ensure the game is a fair and people who decide they&#039;d raather troll then play the game are punished. I feel its on lol to ensure trolls are punished and players get a fair crack at it like monitoring a players history and if they frequently get reported over multiple games receive bans or have ranked ques disabled for said player. \r\n\r\nSorry about the vent but I really needed to have a whinge as I try to leave it out of games because it only makes the games worse when flaming commences.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-11T11:20:05.063+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot gives 0 shi ts about ranked and trolls \n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oprah Windfurry","date":"2016-09-11T08:18:36.458+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably get put with these players more often than you think but it's just that you notice it more in promos. as the outcome of the match has a greater impact for you than it does if you were not in promos. \n\nPeople could say you're trolling with your rune set up, why are you running ap and magic pen on blitz sup?
