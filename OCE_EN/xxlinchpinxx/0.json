Is this really broken?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have recently returned to the game a few weeks ago.  I stopped playing around the time the Oceanic server went live but I never actually used it.  Back then things seemed pretty balanced on the NA server and I was playing with people of a similar skill level.  I&#039;ve had about 10 pvp games so far since I&#039;ve been back and won only about half of them yet I&#039;m matched with ranked players.  I am so inexperienced I am getting my ass handed to me soundly by bronze ranked guys.  Is the unranked pvp matching system this bad or is there not enough population on the server to have unranked vs unranked players?  \r\n\r\nSome of the people I&#039;m matched with have 1600 wins, I haven&#039;t even played the game that many times let alone won that many.  It would be a lot more fun to go up against similarly inexperienced players.  Is there anything I can do to avoid these ridiculous match-ups?","replies":[{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-05-29T13:38:28.482+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you complaining about ? You should feel privileged to be able to play with people with higher ranking than you because they will punish you when you make mistakes and this will help you learn the game better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-28T10:00:29.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll be getting matched with people around what your skill level was when you left (and presumably it's dropped since then), you can't expect the system to know exactly how good you are when you haven't played in years. If you're getting put in games that are over your head you're gunna lose a lot and start playing against less experienced players soon. I'm sure it'll fix itself, 10 games is just such a small sample size.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-05-27T13:56:33.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you talking about normal pvp or ranked pvp?\n\n**Normal pvp** matching is all over the place due to not many people on our server being below level 30 or not having many normal wins. It goes anywhere and everywhere with level 10s being up against challengers. Normal mmr is different to ranked mmr, with high elo players typically having low norm mmr because they simply don't play enough normals to actually increase it. \n\n**Ranked pvp ** is based on ranked mmr with unranked players who have never  been ranked before starting with a low silver (4/5) level mmr.  The biggest changes occurring in the first five games to make sure people that aren't actually prepared for ranked end up in low bronze where they can't ruin other peoples games.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-05-27T12:33:07.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 main things.\n\n1. Unranked accounts have the same MMR as mid to low Silver. So yeah.\n\n2. Normal games don't take your rank into account. I'm Silver and i've played against Challengers. If you want more even matchmaking go play ranked, otherwise just play, learn from your mistakes, and keep going. a 50% winrate is actually pretty good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-27T10:48:55.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah it seems broken to me, i am getting put with high bronze (which is fair) and UNRANKED PLAYERS. I dont want to stomp most unranked matches i wanna play for the challenge without losing alot if i fail.","replies":[]}]}
