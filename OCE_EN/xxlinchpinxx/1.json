You must be at least bronze ranked and only play champions you already know well.  All you have to do is jump into an AI game solo with your favorite champ and rape all the bots.  Travel from lane to lane ganking, preferably when your teammates are not around. Make sure you melt them instantly so none of the other summoners have a chance to get an assist.  When you do gank a lane, make sure you take all of the CS but DO NOT help them attack the tower.  Our goal is not to win but to have the highest score so that everyone will know Clan Ego Trip has the largest penises on the interwebs!  By level 10  you should be standing outside the bot spawn, raping them as they come out.  Gota get that kill score up.  We are here to impress people with our skills.  It doesn&#039;t matter if it ruins the game for anyone else who is legit trying to learn or have fun.  This is about EPEEN!     \r\n\r\nIf anyone asks why you are playing AI here are some excuses you can use.\r\n\r\n&quot;I&#039;m learning a new champion&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m doing it for the xp&quot; - even if your score is ( 48/0/1)\r\n&quot;Just want to get first game IP&quot; - even though you don&#039;t kill towers once you get to your bot spawn raping camp.\r\n&quot;It&#039;s only AI&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s just a game&quot;  - These responses can be used to excuse any sort of bad behavior\r\n\r\nPost screen shots of your score here so we can all admire your bot stomping skills.","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-06T10:13:08.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interested ^ (But to be honest idk wtf ur talking about).
