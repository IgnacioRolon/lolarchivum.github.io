I was placed in b5, b1, b1 Over the respective seasons. \n\nHere are my top tips for climbing out :D\n\n**1. Join a premade team.**\n Climbing alone is boring and can potentially ruin your will to climb through some of the players out there. Playing as a ranked 5 will definitely lessen your chances of being matched with trollers/afks/other toxins. It also allows you to become familiar with the play patterns of your teammates (so you don't have to keep adjusting your style every game) and you have way better communication. With the implementation of a dynamic queue where this is possible, there is literally no reason not to. You also get lots of cool bonuses like extra IP, mastery points and Hextech stuff.\n\n\n**2. Play comfort picks rather than counter picks.**\nA lot of people in bronze get caught up in trying to play counter picks, even if they have no idea how to play the champion. Same happens when the \"FOTM OP\" isn't banned. A lot of people are going to be playing \"op\" champs in order to get out, and the likelihood of them sucking is high (look at all the bronze v vaynes and yasuos). Playing a comfort pick means that you will not only have better matchup and skill knowledge, it means that you have more options on how you want to play (aggro/safe/roam). Keep in mind that your comfort picks may be banned, I would suggest picking up a couple of champs (also helpful if you are last pick and your team is missing something like a tank). On top of this, play easy champs. Champs that aren't too mechanically intensive, so that new players will be able to identify what they do (a lot of B5 is made up of new players), no point playing Eve/Yasuo when it is highly likley your team wont know how to synergise with them.\n\n\n**3. Get super good at two roles.**\nDynamic queue allows you to choose two roles, so you have 100% chance of getting of your fave/best roles. Pick up a few comfort champs in each, learn all there is to know about them so you know things like build paths and matchups like the back of your hand. Fill is your worst enemy. Leave filling roles to normals. \n\n\n**4. Revisit some of the basic league skills.**\nThings like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). \n\n\n_Note: also check your masteries and rune pages are the best they can be._\n\n\n**5. Keep a ranked diary. **\nMost of my improvement comes from my ranked diary. After every game I write down who I was playing, my score, CS, wards placed, LP gained/lost and a quick summary of the game. I also like to write down 3 things I did well, and 3 things I need to improve. That way, you are really processing the game and learning from your mistakes. It also gives you something to consciously work towards improving in the next game. \n\n**6. Get the right mindset**\nA massive part of climbing is the mindset. You can be really good enough mechanically to get out, but if your head isn't there, you will reach a plateau super early in your climb. \nIf you go into each game thinking your that your team is going to be trash, you have actually started tilting yourself from the get-go. Have a positive mindset, constantly active and switched on making decisions that you think will ultimately be best for the team. Be a positive and encouraging player to put the other players at ease. If you are toxic, your flame will just tilt them and they will play worse. Don't point out their mistakes, chances are they have already noticed. Just worry about your own mistakes, and what you bring to the team. Keep communication open, ping like crazy. Ping when you want a gank, ping when you want an objective. \nAlso, remember that you can't win every game. It's ok and perfectly normal to have a win rate hovering around 50%.\n\nIf I were you, I would definitely be looking to improve my CS (more CS = more gold = more pressure) and warding (more wards = more safety / more map pressure)\n\nGood luck, may the elo be ever in your favour ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-10T18:43:25.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesnt help.
