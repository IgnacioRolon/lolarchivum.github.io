A cataclysmic battle followed and the guardians put up a magnificent fight, however, as the evil was almost vanquished, it revealed an unbeknownst and calamitous power; resulting in the devastating fall of four of the newly born guardians. \r\nIn their last moments, each guardian breathed their life&rsquo;s powers into the last mourning guardian of their fivesome; Star Guardian Katarina. Having absorbed the power of her brethren, Katarina&rsquo;s emotions came over her as she grieves over the loss of their light.
