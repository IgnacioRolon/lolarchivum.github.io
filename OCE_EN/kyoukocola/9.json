(Riot help?)","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So recently I was playing some ARAM games on my account and then I met a full team of bots and we had three on my team.  They just ran into turret and suicided and I lost to them all thanks to the bots feeding. I reported most bots to Riot but after a day or so we saw them still not banned.  And if you don't believe in me go make a smurf and play some low level ARAM games. Most bots have no numbers and commonly tower dive or not buy items and they follow the recommended items. So rito please help ban these bots for good. And can I shame them since they are not a human? {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-08T02:08:32.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately there isn't much that can be done about this other than reporting the bot users and hoping Riot bans them appropriately. It is a well known issue that bots are often found in pre 30 ARAM games, this is due to people wanting to level them for sale at 30, something which is against the TOU and EULA. Another unfortunate thing is you still can't name and shame them, Riot has their reasons but I have no idea why we can't name and shame bot users. One thing you could do, other than reporting them in the post game, is make a list of suspected bot users and just send those names to Riot via a support ticket every now and then.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-07T20:59:21.468+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think heartvine is making a comprehensive list of all the bots (I could be wrong).

Unfortunately for the moment there is no real way to avoid playing with them other than to avoid playing in the game modes they commonly use (ARAM and AI). Right now the best way for you to combat the issue is to take note of their player names and screen shot games with them then send this information to Riot through the SUPPORT system. In addition. You could pass their names onto HeartVine as he is compiling a list of players who use the bot system as mentioned above. \n\nRegards,\nlols =)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Billos","date":"2014-12-07T21:52:48.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I made a ton of posts about this a while back and was told I was either flat out wrong or just so low in 'ARAM elo' that I  deserved it...\n\nThat said, just report them as already said. It'll take a little bit, but most of 'em will get banned. At least, that's my experience.","replies":[]}]}
