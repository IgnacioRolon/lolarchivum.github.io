Q the enemy laner, rather than a minion. once you've got it down on cool down, feel free to q all the minions, but i find e and auto attack early game works well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-04T06:32:55.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Malphite.\nGo for tanky build.\nIn team fight, press R\nGG","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2015-08-01T07:47:04.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you hate csing and want to be tanky while dealing some damage, naut support or gragas jungle work","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-08-01T06:30:00.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like {{champion:86}} \n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/ muhahaha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-08-01T03:19:49.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vladimir is good top, very tanky with significant damage, and now that WotA and hextech stack, he can recover more health than the enemy can take away sometimes, for CS just spam E (hits every unit within range) \n\nGaren is about as simple as it gets, use his spin for CS, he has no mana, he deals 1/3 of your health with his ult and all the rest of it with his E while they're silenced the whole time with Q he's tanky as fuck while still having lots of AD but actually does magic damage which makes him very hard to build against and regenerates like 100+ hp a second with his passive (but dont play garen, i wont be pleased knowing that theres another one out there) \n\nTaric is my favourite tanky support, he is about as survivable as it gets with an armour buff a heal and a stun, you're a support so theres no need to cs and while he doesn't do mega damage, once you have a few items you can 1v1 any adc in the game and win (Vayne is an exception) \n\nSkarner is a jungler but you can play him top if you don't like ganking, he has no dashes or invisibles or anything hard that requires positioning, just run in spamming Q, grab them with R, run out spamming Q, by the time R ends you'll have enough stacks to stun them, he does Aoe damage and Q is spam able so CSing isn't a problem, and he does a lot of mixed damage while being a tank, but he is a little hungry on the mana early, so a iceborn or something might be required.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XURiN","date":"2015-08-01T00:07:25.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen top maybe.
