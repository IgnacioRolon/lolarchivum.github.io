Maybe you should take a computer course on this.\n\nIf you are unable to play cause your actions take ages to do anything, thats a result of Internet Speed Lag or Ping. \nIf you are unable to play cause your game is really choppy and starts and stops alot, thats a result of framerate drop.\n\nTo fix Internet speed:\n- Try to use an Ethernet Cord to connect from your computer to your router/modem or heaven forbid, directly into your phone line.\n- Make sure you arnt running anything else that uses the internet. eg. Facebook, Youtube, other games, any music streaming, updates for programmes etc...\n- Make sure you are the only one on the internet at the time that you play. If you have AbottNetâ„¢, or a %%%%ty ISP who runs your internet thru a plastic straw or copper wiring connection, your BANDWIDTH may be too small to have multiple devices running on the internet at the same time.\n- If you want to know if your lagging before you start a game, open up your search bar on either Win7 or if your unlucky, Win8, or even unluckier, Win8.1 and type in and search for \"cmd\". You should get an 'oldskool' looking command propt. In here type >\"ping www.google.com\" and hit enter. Depending on if you are lagging, this may take some time to print out the results. After it finishes, you should look for 'time=' and look for that number. The lower that number is the better. If the number is consistently low ( ***LESS THAN 200***) you should be fine to play, if its greater than say 500 then your gonna lag. If it says 'request timed out' it means your over 3500 ping.\n\nTo make sure you dont lag make sure none of the following are happening.\nTorrenting, Downloading, opening webpages, Uploading, Streaming, Watching/Listening to Streams/Audio Streams, getting DDoS'd, ~~being monitored by ASIO, being subjected to Replay Attacks by ASIO~~, Any other person is using a device that is connected to your router/modem be it Computer,Laptop,$3000 Apple Paperweight, Mobile device, Cloud Storage device, Television, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-12-23T21:41:24.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most useful comment, +1.\n\nAlso the quality of wiring in your home and street, and also the distance to the nearest exchange will all affect the quality of your connection.\n\nI used to live on a horrible street that had four hundred year old iron wiring and my only option to get better internet was to literally move to a different street. The worst part was the internet was meant to be awesome there because I was literally 15 metres away from the exchange... only that was physically, not the actual wired distance and sadly that's not how it works.\n\nedit: Oh also I tend to get a lot of leechers on my wifi, random devices hogging all the bandwith that nobody admits to owning. I have to clear everything off and change the wifi name to get a decent connection for LoL every now and then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mojohinkey","date":"2014-12-24T10:25:26.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is molendo saying \"git gud\"","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-24T10:41:58.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Molendo,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=prsBmnnk,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2014-12-24T10:25:26.388+0000)\n>\n> git gud","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2014-12-24T00:12:52.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just tell your internet provider it's usual free for them to come and inspect your connection and if there is a problem get angry and get free stuff","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-24T09:39:48.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=prsBmnnk,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2014-12-24T00:12:52.348+0000)\n>\n> get angry and get free stuff\n\namen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-24T04:42:29.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"modify your connection to a gamer connection, I went from 45 ping to 38 :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-23T04:27:59.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"check your internet speed","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-23T03:58:58.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"change the internet plan you're on. who's your ISP?","replies":[]}]}
