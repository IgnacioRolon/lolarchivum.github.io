Two things to remember:\n1. DON'T click where you want to end up, click where you want to be WHEN you jump. This is due to auto-pathing and also to the fact that Riven jumps in the way she is facing, not towards to cursor. I think this should be changed, but obviously Riot doesn't so yeah, we have to deal with it.\n2. She can only jump relatively skinny walls. Don't over-estimate her leap distance, and find a map to look at to make it easier. Also, contrary to unpopular belief, her Ult does not increase the range/distance of her leap, just the area she does damage in.\n\n\"I knew I should have sprung for the broken blade warranty...\" - {{champion:92}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-20T08:46:28.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try E ---> Right-Click (at your feet) ---> Q so that auto-pathing doesn't make you face away from the wall.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thredson","date":"2015-02-20T06:54:19.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't jump all walls as Riven.
