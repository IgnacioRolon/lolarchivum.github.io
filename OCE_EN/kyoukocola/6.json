It should be reduced to 100% AD ratio. Seriously. I am forced to back off lane when I get poked every 5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-03-07T13:41:08.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like he has any late game damage anyway. He has to be building full AD to really get the kick out of that high ratio. I'd say nerf his Q and make his passive hit on every 3rd strike, or remove the ratio on his Q altogether and make it apply on hit effects.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-06T07:02:39.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but then again he's quite 'unreliable' since his combo requires all of his active damaging abilities that aren't his ultimate so once he uses his EQ, and if someone dodges it he's a sitting duck (other than his passive)...\n\nBut yeah, even so, he's still an insanely strong champion. I would say 100% bonus AD from 120% is a fair and deserved nerf.\n\n______\n\n*\"y u do dis to me\"* {{item:3070}} {{champion:59}}","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-06T07:14:52.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"he is a tank. it needs to be BONUS AD, not raw AD...make him actually build squishy to deal big damage, esp considering its got a massive AR shred on top...\n\ntoo many free stats. atleast the E nerf makes sense.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-06T07:24:09.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Qg48rapA,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-03-06T07:14:52.164+0000)\n>\n> he is a tank. it needs to be BONUS AD, not raw AD...make him actually build squishy to deal big damage, esp considering its got a massive AR shred on top...\n> \n> too many free stats. atleast the E nerf makes sense.\n\nhe's not a tank, he's a bruiser. big difference.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-06T08:15:02.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"http://gameinfo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/\n\ndont EVER question me. i know what im talking about.\n\nedit: oh wait, that doesnt show the filters...go to tank. and then go %%%% yourself in the arse. have some ebola cancer autism.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-06T08:32:23.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Qg48rapA,comment-id=0000000000000001,timestamp=2015-03-06T08:15:02.769+0000)\n>\n> http://gameinfo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/\n> \n> dont EVER question me. i know what im talking about.\n> \n> edit: oh wait, that doesnt show the filters...go to tank. and then go %%%% yourself in the arse. have some ebola cancer autism.\n\nlmao he's a %%%%ing tank fighter, you build damage items like hydra, bc, lw on him. he's a bruiser, not a tank. and by tank, I mean true tank, like rammus. goddamn you're one salty %%%%%%%%%%%%.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-06T08:13:38.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Qg48rapA,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-06T07:24:09.456+0000)\n>\n> he's not a tank, he's a bruiser. big difference.\n\nIsn't he a tank fighter?
