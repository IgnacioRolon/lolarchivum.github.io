His vision burred, the hot breath knocked from his chest as shrieks and battle cries rang out around him.\n\n&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he shouted to himself, diving forward as a minion exploded where his form had once been.\n\n&ldquo;Immense power is fun!&rdquo; taunted a voice from the distance &ldquo;You should try it sometime.&rdquo;\n\nEkko cried out as a minion struck him down where he stood.\n\n&ldquo;This is the longest second of my life,&rdquo; he mumbled, staggering to gain control.\n\nA blinding blue light filled the ashen sky as an icy dagger rocketed towards the shape beside him, bringing it to its knees. Ekko looked into the hollow eyes as the glow of consciousness faded from them and only a dull figure remained.\n\n&ldquo;AAHH!&rdquo; he yelled as an arrow pierced his left shoulder, burying itself deep into the flesh.\n\nEkko reached down and snapped the frozen shaft, grimacing as the wood splintered into his fingers.\n\n&ldquo;Cmon!&rdquo; he shouted struggling to his feet &ldquo;Show me something new!&rdquo;\n\nFrom the river behind him erupted a ball of tremendous flame, the Half-Dragon descending upon him in a storm of fury as the enemy closed in.\n\nEkko needed time. &ldquo;We make the future&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nA convergence split the timeline before him, slowing the drake in its path. He knew what he must do. Reaching for his Zero-Drive the path behind him, before him, all made sense. Zaun would know his name.\n\n***\n\n&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s day&rsquo;s about to get wrecked.&rdquo;\n\nEkko&rsquo;s eyes shone in the glow of the red nexus, the smallest of smiles lining his face.\n\n&ldquo;The boy who shattered time found his way into the Rift&rdquo;\n\nEkko turned to see the Minotaur deep in thought, breath furling in great ribbons from the pierced and battle worn face.\n\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Alistar,&rdquo; said Ekko &ldquo;From the Great Barrier. You&rsquo;re a legend! Mess with the bull and you get the-,&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Hmph,&rdquo; snorted the Noxian enemy. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard that for a while.&rdquo;\n\nHe did not look up or acknowledge Ekko in any other way.\n\n&ldquo;Let me be honest,&rdquo; said Ekko &ldquo;I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo;\n\nA fell voice sounded out across the vast expanse.\n\n&ldquo;Welcome to Summoner&rsquo;s Rift.&rdquo;\n\nThe Minotaur rose, cloven hooves ringing across the cold stone.\n\n&ldquo;You will kid,&rdquo; he murmured as he passed &ldquo;You will.&rdquo;\n\nEkko watched as the others moved around him.\n\n&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Bandle,&rdquo; said Alister &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this over with.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I call frontline,&rdquo; said the Yordle Gunner shouldering her weapon and following her Support south.\n\n&ldquo;We can do this Ekko.&rdquo;\n\nHe looked up into the face of The Lady of Luminosity, taken for a moment in the light of the Crownguards&rsquo; only daughter.\n\n&ldquo;Focus on the battle,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;Stay positive.&rdquo;\n\nEkko smiled weakly as she headed west out of the base.\n\n&#039;Tomorrow&rsquo;s the last of my worries&#039; the thought to himself.\n\nOne Summoner remained with Ekko, the glistening steel of his Mount Targon armour strengthening him in the weak daylight.\n\n&ldquo;Onward!&rdquo; he proclaimed beneath the Rakkor helm &ldquo;The Jungle is yours child.&rdquo;\n\nThe Artisan of War lifted his shield and spear and made for the north lane.\n\n&ldquo;Back to going forward then,&rdquo; he said in the still air.\n\nEkko ran out of the base and headed into the Rift&rsquo;s jungle. The space was oppressive, dangerous, the grasp of an unspoken enemy tightening around his nerve and resolve.\n\nThe Gromp, Wolves and Raptors lay in ruin at his feet as Ekko charged through the undergrowth, mana burning along the walls of his labyrinth.\n\n&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo; he said as he slid to a halt, the Blue Sentinel towering over him &ldquo;Ummm.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Nothing a little gunpowder won&rsquo;t fix.&rdquo;\n\nEkko looked to his right to where Tristana was sizing up the enemy.\n\n&ldquo;Light &lsquo;em up!&rdquo;\n\nEkko threw out his temporal grenade, phase diving towards the stone monolith, explosive charge and rapid fire igniting around him. He gasped as the Crest of Insight surrounded him, imbued with its power. With a little more than a nod the Yordle Gunner ran off to the southwest.\n\nThe jungle was quiet now, explosions and clashing metal and cries of spells long in the distance. Ekko stepped cautiously through the grass, knowing that someone must be near. A snapped twig. The call of an owl.\n\nA brilliant pink light filled the area as Ekko struck the ward into the ground. He saw nothing before him.\n\n&ldquo;I hear a man likes a lady with legs.&rdquo;\n\nEkko spun, glaring into the shadows, searching for the horrific whisper. Nothing was there.\n\nHe took a step forward onto the edge of the ward&rsquo;s light, staring intently, listening to the deafening quiet.\n\n&ldquo;Come closer, I don&rsquo;t BITE!&rdquo;\n\nThe spider form repelled towards him, Spiderlings in a skittering frenzy as the beast attacked.\n\nEkko didn&rsquo;t hear his scream as the burning white light filled his vision. The final spark taring the air above his head. The radiant heat stealing the oxygen from his lungs and pushing the Spider Queen back into the river.\n\nBoth Lux and Ekko looked suddenly north to the blue marker.\n\n&ldquo;They need us!&rdquo; said the Demacian.\n\nEkko smiled.\n\n&ldquo;Good a time as any to act reckless.&rdquo;\n\nHe followed Lux along the river, Alistar trampling in from their right. Ahead they saw the light of battle, the Minotaur focussing his unbreakable will and charging into the front lines.\n\n***\n\n&ldquo;Cmon!&rdquo; Ekko shouted struggling to his feet &ldquo;Show me something new!&rdquo;\n\nFrom the river behind him erupted a ball of tremendous flame, the Half-Dragon descending upon him in a storm of fury as the enemy closed in.\n\nHe needed time. Lux lay beside him in ruin, Tristana and Alistar beginning to fade.\n\n&ldquo;We make the future&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nLike a tare of lightening the heavens were rend by the grand skyfall, Pantheon&rsquo;s spear and strike crushing Syndra beneath his feet.\n\nThe ground lay pulverised around Alistar and Ashe fell in a shriek to the buster shot fired from Tristana&rsquo;s weapon.\n\nEkko&rsquo;s hand fell. The Chronobreak activated. The world shattered, rewinding. Picking his spot the Zero-Drive kicked over again. The blast was deafening. The Heart of the Freljord was broken. Elise shattered in the maelstrom. And Ekko smiled to himself as Shyvana backed away.\n\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already calculated your odds. Sorry.&rdquo;","replies":[]}
