The box showed up today in the mail, everything is fine except, there&#039;s only a Volibear in the volibear-sized box. Don&#039;t get me wrong, the Volibear is adorable, but I wanted Tibbers more. \n\nIs the Sweetheart Tibbers getting sent separately? Is anyone else having this problem? I sent a support ticket to Riot but they take forever to reply and I&#039;m sad and want an answer now. :( It was my V&#039;Day gift.\n\nAlso a side question, the invoice has &#039;Blue Snow Gnar&#039; on it, anyone know what that is? Is it the cute little amumu card I got in the box?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-16T05:57:40.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience stuff often gets sent separately (not sure if they come from diff places or it's just a production thing or what) so likely it's just on it's way in a separate box. As for blue snow Gnar, it probably refers to Snow Day Gnar but I'm not sure why that would be on an invoice for a Tibbers and a Volibear.\n\nProbably the best thing to do would be to submit a ticket to Player Support under the \"I have a question about the physical merchandise store\" category.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Frozen Ashes","date":"2018-02-16T06:03:43.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, that makes me a little less concerned about it not showing up. :) I have ordered things in the past from Rito and they always come in the same box, but if other people have experienced things coming separately, that's probably what it is. Thank you.\n\nStill confused about the Gnar thing, but nothing was charged for it so I'm assuming its just a mistake then.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-16T11:11:20.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was ages back now but I got a couple hoodies (they had that buy 1 get 1 free thing) and a plush and the plush and the hoodies came separately. I think they might have mentioned it somewhere on the invoice or something but I don't remember it was too long ago.\n\nI'd probs still submit a ticket just to make sure everything is all gucci :) No harm in it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
