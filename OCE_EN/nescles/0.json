How much higher does my MMR need to be in order to gain more LP per win? I&#039;ve been gaining around 20 LP per win so far. Also, if my MMR is significantly higher than the &quot;average&quot; will i gain more LP and LOSE LESS? Not too sharp on my knowledge as you can probably tell XD. Please help if you can!!

It's just a 3rd party site and is not to be used as an accurate source of information. \n\nGenerally speaking you will gain more LP than you lose when you have a more positive win / loss ratio.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emit","date":"2017-03-30T06:29:51.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Higher mmr = higher lp gains and lower lp losses. Works vice versa. But, op.gg does not correctly show your mmr, there is no way to view it. One way to get an estimation is based off of your win rate. Yours is 50%, therefore you have normal lp gains/losses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-29T00:35:30.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20 per win is above average. when your mmr matches closely enough its win 15 lose 15.","replies":[{"poster":"Nescles","date":"2017-03-29T00:36:41.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok.

Losses will lower your mmr more quickly, whilst wins will increase your mmr more slowly.\n\n- when your mmr is matched to your elo, your lp gains will be smaller and your lp losses will be smaller. You have stabilised. MMR gains/losses will be standard.\n\n- when your mmr is lower than your current elo, then you will gain slightly more lp for wins, and you will lose alot more lp for losses. Wins will raise your mmr more quickly, whilst losses will lower your mmr more slowly.\n\nimagine it like a system of counterbalancing logistic rates. I hope I haven't made this more confusing.\n\n- the greater the difference between mmr and elo, the faster you will climb and fall with higher lp gains and losses\n- the higher the number of games you play, the smaller the difference between mmr and elo will be, and the number of ranked games played also factors into how fast the system will adjust these numbers. This is why new accounts can climb faster than longstanding ones.
