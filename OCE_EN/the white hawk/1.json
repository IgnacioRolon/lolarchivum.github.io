Before you try and bring this up (as everyone in your situation tends to do), it doesn't matter if they started it. All that matters to *this case* is what *you* did, are we clear on that?\n\nNext time you should just refrain from saying anything if you can't stop yourself from saying something negative. If you find that you can't stop yourself from responding to these kinds of people, just mute them.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-07T23:29:48.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dont forget apparenly ggez is banable.

I got chat restricted for, from what I can tell, saying variations of \"fuck\" and \"please stop\"/\"stop\" a lot, and talking too much overall. (and maybe calling someone scum of the earth?)\nThis all towards persons who intentionally trolled games, after many attempts to try to talk reasonably and friendly to them and calm them down.\n\nI'm sorry but as much as I think negativity for nothing and etc.. are punishable offenses, Riot's automated punishment system is completely flawed.\nIf saying 'fuck' can get you punished, make it a 100% 3 strike rule and have people banned/suspended upon a 3rd/5th/10th warning for using the word at all in-game, otherwise automated punishments, or any at all, for using those words should not exist.\n\nFrom what I can tell though, the system severely punishes \"retard\" and \"%%%got\" when used, which to be honest, as much as it's a fairly kneejerk thing said, I guess even outside of SJW standards it's a pretty socially unacceptable thing to say. ie. that's probably what got you punished.\n\nIf there were any human elements in the tribunal, people with names like \"KILL ALL BLACKS\" and etc.. i've run into, wouldn't exist.\n\nJust thought i'd add my 2 cents on the punishment system. When you get trolls 10 games in a row, a few \"fucks\" and etc.. are going to happen if there's a chat system. If people had any confidence in punishments being dealt out to people who intentionally troll games/int feed/etc.., then people wouldn't feel the absolute need to unleash on every troll they come across.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-08T17:37:14.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat is a key communication tool in League, while pings are typically sufficient chat has significant value. That asshats want to ruin it for everyone else is their problem and thus the consequences are their responsibility.\n\nThe language filter exists to protect those who do not wish to see such things, it does not in any way excuse toxic behaviour. Swearing in and of itself is not punishable, the context matters.\n\nIf you want a review of your chat restriction you are welcome to post your logs and we can tell you what behaviour is generally deemed unacceptable by the system. \"They started it\" is not a valid defence. Two wrongs don't make a right, and two negative players just makes more negativity. The behaviour of others does not excuse your own. Just because someone else does something first doesn't mean it's okay for you to do it.\n\nThe lower tier punishments ARE the warnings, and there are three of them. In the vast majority of cases it is three strikes and your out. A 10 game chat restriction, and 25 game, then a 14 day ban, then a permanent ban. It takes a lot more than one little \"fuck\" to get you punished.\n\nHate speech is treated very seriously, and can get you escalated through punishment tiers, resulting in an instant 14 day ban (one strike and your out) or in very sever cases an instant perma ban (when I say severe, there is absolutely no way you are not aware what you are doing is not allowed).\n\nNames are just as punishable as behaviour. For the more mundane names they will simply have the name reset and they will have to select a new one, but in the case of names or club names/tags that involve hate speech and the like they can indeed result in bans int he same way that kind of talk in game can.\n\nWe all encounter our share of trolls and negative players, some more than their fair share, but stopping to their level only makes the problem worse funnily enough, because it creates more trolls and negative players. No one is going to be punished for occasional toxicity (severe behaviours like hate speech excluded), especially if it is borne out of frustration, hell I'm no exception either. You have to be either pretty consistently or severely negative to ever actually face a punishment, and even more so to face more than one.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"You are loved","date":"2017-02-07T07:00:08.280+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why post this on the boards?
