I use the gold coin on a riven skin, Icon and chroma as it states but I only got the Icon? I&#039;m a bit confused at why this craft option says Dragonblade Riven, ( Golden ) Chroma, and Golden Riven Icon... I&#039;m basically really confused and out of 5 dollars now because it mislead me... Could you please follow this up? Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2018-02-17T16:13:20.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhen you redeem the gold coin it says **\"Dragonblade Riven ( Golden ) Chroma, and Golden Riven Icon\"** \n(the big part to note is the lack of comma between dragonblade riven and golden chroma.)\n\n[In the announcement](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/learn-more-lunar-revel-2018-event) they did state that the golden chromas did require the base skin to use them, and if you didn't own the skin you keep the border and chroma until you do. Sadly it doesn't seem like they worded this clear enough to push the point that the crafting does not give you the base skin as well. \n\nYou can always try send in a ticket to[ Riot support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and explain the misunderstanding and request a refund, although they might not oblige.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-17T18:42:29.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Same thing happened to me, It's fucking dumb.","replies":[]}]}
