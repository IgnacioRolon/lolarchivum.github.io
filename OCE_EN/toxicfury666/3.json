It's called the [\"reform period\" and the amount of time is completely dependent on the player](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions). \n\nRefrain from being a ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ and be hoarding that hextech loot before you know it. \nAlternatively, if one continues being an ♥ ♥ ♥ during this period and keeps getting reported, its going to take a while.","replies":[]}]}]}
