Help me out if its not :s\r\n\r\nI&#039;m pretty sure this probably has been discussed about before (If it hasn&#039;t then im shocked) since League is quite a few years old now.\r\n\r\nCan we get more incentives to keep playing? Something like, you get new summoner icons by completing in game challenges similar to how the bilgewater event is.\r\n\r\n(e.g. kill 500 minions --&gt; kill 2000 minions -&gt; kill 5000 minions -&gt; ... and like get 100 assists -&gt; get 500 assists -&gt; get 1000 assists -&gt;...)\r\n\r\nAnd for each stage you get at, you get a new summoner icon, or IP gift or something of the sort. I can see huge potential in it and it&#039;d give people who don&#039;t really wanna play league competitively something to do. Not everyone is grinding away at normals to get better, some play it with friends. Some play it because they don&#039;t want the tension of playing ranked.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-07-29T08:17:46.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should go to a certain extent though.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-29T10:56:40.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, we can't have endless goals xD There should be an end goal for players who play for a really long time. Something like \"200,000 total minions kills\" or \"1000 champion kills\" etc. That way the people who played for that long and got these things can show em off :3 It's something to aim for.","replies":[{"poster":"Lilja","date":"2015-07-30T02:29:02.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I enjoy playing the game...

If it's simply playing games, people will grief them to shorten and play more. If it's champ kills, well. Tahm Kench can still team kill, right?

Yeah if there was only killing minion challenges you'd get people doing that. However throw in things like \"kill the dragon with your team 250 times\" or \"take 1000 towers\" and you get people who actually play with a more proper mindset and new players kinda learn how to go for objectives and things like that. I highly doubt you're gonna get people who just care for the csing challenge and dont care for the \"kill 1000 champions\" or other challenges like those.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-31T13:52:41.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, it would definitely work if you made several challenges at the same time, rather than consecutive and one at a time, which I thought you were implying. Tho getting CS as support is bad so they should modify it by a ratio below 1 to discourage people from suddenly KSing when they notice they're a few pentas away from getting their reward or something.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"The Violation","date":"2015-07-29T13:22:21.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this was the point of them introducing the champion mastery system","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-31T05:27:18.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion mastery thing kind of flopped.
