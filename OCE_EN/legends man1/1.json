Then I had a mental shift and decided that im not gonna play like a little girl and rather I&#039;d go into every game with the intention of carrying that team. This worked wonders as I&#039;d play aggressive when I could and a lot more smarter and overall made me a better player. It was fun for like..  a week or two but then I realised, riot&#039;s team making sucks. \r\n\r\nI keep getting put into retarded teams which I have to carry. I don&#039;t have a problem carrying but the sucky thing is that I can&#039;t use different champions to learn different playstyles. If I do, I&#039;m obviously new to the champ so i&#039;ll have a hard time carrying the team. So if I want to win any games I have to keep using the same champions Im good with. It&#039;s annoying because it bores me to death when every game is literally me calling all the shots and using the same champions every game, telling people to listen to my pings. It frustrates me when they start trash talking me back because they just died even though i&#039;ve pinged them 3-4 times to back off. It happens *every* game. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve lost a handful of games to players who didn&#039;t know how to play the game simply because I strayed from my usual champs to new one&#039;s and ended up having to be the one calling shots on objectives and when to back and stuff. Using a champ im unfamiliar with, I wouldn&#039;t know my damage output at different points in the game and neither would I know optimal builds and stuff.  \r\n\r\nAlso just throwing this out there, I&#039;m no challenger player. I make mistakes too with my decisions because I&#039;m still relatively new to the game. I&#039;ve found that if i party up with some of my older friends at this game, I get put into teams that actually know what to do, but then I&#039;m stuck once again using a champ i usually use otherwise I&#039;d get stomped. It&#039;s tough, and I don&#039;t know if anyone else has been stuck in my situation before. All in all, im finding it extremely hard to enjoy League right now and I dont have a clue what to do about it. Any help whatsoever ? {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-23T06:03:26.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I've got a 50% winrate which is pretty average for a new player.\n\nThat 33% you got probably is from my last 20 games which further proves what Im trying to say..

Don't worry about truly becoming a good player just yet. What I'm saying is just take it one step at a time, don't think to hard about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-23T10:12:55.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't act superior, but when your whole team backs after taking an inhib turret while no one from their team is up, someone's gotta shout at the team.. I am matched with newbies thankfully but these guys are seriously bad. I didn't have this problem all the way up to level 21.. It's started ever since I hit level 20. I keep getting matched with guys who really would struggle against beginner bots. Trust me, these guys really are bad. They're making mistakes I made when I was really new to league and they're level 20 as well. \n\nIm just quite frustrated because i cant use any new champions without knowing im gonna lose the game.
