Just about every other adc can out poke him and combined with their support, completely zone him during the laning phase(if they know how).\nBecause of this he's highly support reliant even if the twitch is decent.\nAs for positioning, you get one chance to get it right in a fight with ur q, fuck it up and ur done for. All u got is flash to try and re position. Because of this you need a reasonable knowledge to know where you want to be using your q to get to before a fight breaks out.\n\nIf the above things are dealt with twitch becomes a monster though.
