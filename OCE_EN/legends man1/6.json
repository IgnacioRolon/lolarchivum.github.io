Only the strongest item slow is applied at any moment. The exception to this is the active effect of Randuin's Omen, Hextech Gunblade and Bilgewater Cutlass, which stacks with other slowing items normally because they are considered champion abilities for slow stacking purposes.\n\n 3.Attacking a champion with the Blessing of the Lizard Elder buff when the target is already affected by that slow will reapply the debuff, resetting its duration. It will NOT increase the slow amount. The same holds true for the Exhaust summoner spell. \n\n ExampleEdit\n\n A champion with a raw movement speed of 400 is affected by a 2 second long 40% slow and a 5 second long 20% slow at the same time.\n\n For the first two seconds, the effective slow will be 1 − (1 − 0.4) × (1 − 0.2 × 0.65) = 47.8%, so he will have 400 × 0.522 = 208.8 raw movement speed.\n\n For the following three seconds, the effective slow will be 20% and so he will have 400 × 0.8 = 320 movement speed.\n After that, he will return to his normal speed of 400.","replies":[]}]}]}
