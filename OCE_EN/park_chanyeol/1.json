I plan to play ranked next season and I&#039;m currently unranked simply because I didn&#039;t ranked this season.\n\nI'll usually be playing in the evening. If I'm on in the day time, I'll most likely be playing customs testing out champs.\n\nFor a bit of background, usually play Jungle but I don&#039;t mind playing any other role. In terms of Jungling, I&#039;ve mainly focused on Trundle &amp; Udyr right now and plan to play some other junglers at some point.\n\nIf you guys want to add me, username is Park Chanyeol (or Tundradragon if that doesn&#039;t work) and add me on Discord for communicating (Tundradragon#6401). Thanks guys :D and hope you have a great day\n\nP.S If you get my K-Pop reference, you&#039;re a legend :D","replies":[{"poster":"Lun√•","date":"2017-11-24T13:48:23.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you like exo?? i havent listened to k-pop in a few years im still hung up about old shinee :L i gave you an add maybe ill see you on the rift sometime x","replies":[]}]}
