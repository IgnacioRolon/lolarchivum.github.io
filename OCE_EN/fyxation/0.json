For some reason or another from my own experience, there seems to be a standardised name format for these accounts (a name or word followed by a series of numbers or two words with the letters PK separating them).\r\n\r\nLet me firstly say that my opinion will probably mean nothing to a lot of players as I only play co-op vs AI, this is a choice based on time constraints and my personal dislike of PvP game environments.\r\n\r\nNow, RIOT has a very strict policy concerning in game activity which negatively impacts the fun factor of it&#039;s player base, that being said, I have not had a game in the last couple of weeks where there has not been at least one account being controlled by a third party program. This morning however I encountered a full list of potential third party controlled accounts (based on the name format). \r\n\r\nPlease RIOT, there must be something that can be done about this. These forums required a security check to log on (via recognition and input) surely there is something similar that can be implemented into the character selection process so as these third party controlled accounts can not join games and ruin the gaming experience for others that choose to play in the non-PvP game environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Balhaza","date":"2015-12-12T00:40:18.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I too encounter this trend and it is very frustrating. While I play Co-OP and ARAM exclusively, the inclusion of these AI bot programs are really troubling to the game as it can definitely affect normal games. For your reference, I've found some of these profiles on LolProfile.com. Interestingly, there is one  that is not following this naming convention, but from the Match Histories, seems to be employing the same Bot Software but has a few games won under the belt, so it is definitely player controlled. \n\nThese accounts are most likely duds, or shell accounts created to level up to lvl 30, then sold to players who can't be bothered to level to level 30, or to players who want a smurf account. After which, the player, once in control of that account, can purchase a name change to whatever they want. This is just a conjecture, but having played WoW for the entirety of its existence, and many other MMORPGs, this is certainly something that is happening. \n\nUPDATE: Website like http://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/ where you can clearly see the accounts are on sale, and how they are instructing buyers to change the summoner names. \n\nI believe this is in serious violation of the terms and conditions of the game, the bots and transactions of accounts. I seriously urge Riot Oceania and even the HQ to really consider this problem and devise a response. \n\nThe accounts I found were:\n\nKate PK Jeff: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Kate%20PK%20Jeff\nKarl PK David: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Karl%20PK%20David\nJeffT PK Charles: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/JeffT%20PK%20Charles\nAndy PK Vincent: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Andy%20PK%20Vincent\nVincent PK Kin: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Vincent%20PK%20Kin\nKin PK Fred: http://lolprofile.net/search/all/Kin%20PK%20Fred\nFred PK Fred: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Fred%20PK%20Fred\nPaul Pk Tom: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Paul%20PK%20Tom\nAlbert PK Pkry: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Albert%20PK%20PKry\n\nNon PK Characters, often found with the PK characters:\n\n**North630**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/North6301 \n\nPlayer had a recent win with Orianna, 15/4/10, indicating that a player is using this account. But prior to that, the match history is exactly the same as the Bot accounts.\n\nNumber accounts:\n\n**Rita0845**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Rita0845\n**Dean0845**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Dean0845\n**Rafael6705**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Rafael6705\n**Clyde6017**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Clyde6017\n**Mark6016**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Mark6016\n**Ailsa0834**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Ailsa0834\n**David6013**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/David6013\n**Car6014**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Car6014\n**Lynn6015**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Lynn6015\n**Jimmy6045**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Jimmy6045\n**Aoses08408**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Aoses08408\n**John6013**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/John6013\n**Scott6056**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Scott6056\n**Archibald6014**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Archibald6014\n**Winnie6013**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Winnie6013\n**Yellow0832**: http://lolprofile.net/summoner/oce/Yellow0832\n\nAnd it goes on and on and on. How did I get this list? I search for a Bot account that I played with on LolProfile - Vincent Pk Kin and checked the Recently played with. Open those up, and check that Recent Played with. The bot accounts usually play with each other, perhaps to minimise detection. But this clearly is a trend that is happening.","replies":[{"poster":"TROLLO","date":"2016-01-14T02:19:39.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have the \"sexy\" and \"KIA\" accounts these days too...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-16T22:36:31.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah yes, the infamous bot epidemic. I remember the JZ epidemic of 2014, ended up being match with 4 of them every other game and 2-3 the rest of the time. Didn't take long for me to resolve to compile a list of all known JZ bots (and suspected bots), with the help of the community, to periodically send to Riot via a support ticket. Only a few short days later, they seemed to have disappeared almost completely. Everyone had noticed a very significant decrease in the number of bots they encountered, matching the levels from before the epidemic, and, to the best of my knowledge, they've not been heard from since.\n\nPerhaps it's time for someone to do the same here before this gets too out of hand?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fyxation","date":"2015-12-16T17:23:39.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After having reported the same accounts time and again for \"cheating\" through the use of illegal third party programs and placing these accounts on my ignore list..... and still being grouped with them, it appears that RIOT values their numbers more than they value their actual players. I am the one being penalised by having low priority queuing because I drop from champion select when I have 4 bots in game with me. \n\nSo..... that's it for me, I won't be back. I enjoyed League, enjoyed the champions and the lore of the game, but it's been ruined by lack of action and poor control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T00:31:57.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Please RIOT, there must be something that can be done about this.

Riot has already indicated on a few media that they are taking a very hard stance on Third-Party Program interfering with the Game experience, even from pre-game to post game. \n\nHowever, detecting that another program is controlling the character on screen is not quite that easy and might take more programming finesse to accomplish.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-12T02:25:18.757+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's actually fucking simple, but riot doesn't care that much because it doesn't make profit to actually fix.\n\nFact is right now LoL has the use of really simple bots (about half are suicide, the other half are \"follow X player and be special.\") If riot actually tried these are simple to spot, and the reason that there are simple bots is because the botting community doesn't have to try to not be caught, because it's the player base that has to catch the bots, Riot don't give a rats ass.\n\nLike riot only just recently introduced a report in game for people with bots, until recently we had to make a ticket with riot to tell us that  \"we will look into the matter, but won't tell you shit\"\n\nThe problem is, that if they actually did give a rat's ass, the botting community would just make better bots (though this would still be a step up, because these would be closer to player like interactions at low level).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JovielMe","date":"2015-12-12T00:22:19.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am had the same experience.
