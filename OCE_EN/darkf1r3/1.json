Also counter intuitively, damage is worth minimal points, and so it's possible to get an S with less than 10k total damage in a 40min game, as any champ.\n\nRiot then tabulates these values (and a few others like vision, objective damage, towers taken) and compares your total value to a bellcurve of performance of other players, and assigns you a grade depending on your z-score.\n\nIf you want more information, join a hextech farming discord, they've basically refined the art of grade farming.","replies":[{"poster":"LetHimStack","date":"2019-01-28T00:25:07.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"to be fair to him though. looking at that stats page everyone had worse than he did and i still see neeko got an S-.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-28T01:13:24.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stats are also somewhat based on champion performance averages in the roles. Now I can't really work out who goes where without the replay because this game is messed up, and tbh I feel the Riot engine might be having the same problem, but Brand probably got assigned mid or support, and Neeko looks like she was assigned as the support role, which means CS doesn't matter as much for them.\n\nThis is yet another highlight as to why a grade based ranked system would be an absolute disaster, because it's clear Vlad did play better.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
