I only play ARAM but im not enjoying it since the changes. I dont claim to know why, its just much less fun.\r\n\r\nIts like there is very little room for counter play once a team gets ahead. \r\n\r\nChamps mean more than ever. I used to love beating good ARAM team comp using skill on underrated champs. Doesnt seem possible anymore.\r\n\r\nWere people actually complaining about long games? They werent that common for me but when I did have one, they were extreemly intense and challening games. Not sure why thats a bad thing.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-06-10T10:53:00.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"People take ARAM seriously? News to me.
