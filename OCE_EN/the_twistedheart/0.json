I am completely oblivious to these things so I clicked and it looked identical to the league OCE Home page. So I signed in and next thing i know. my account automatically sent the link to all my league friends. and it now says that someone has logged into my account and kicked me off of it. When i try to change my security details its got some random email on there that isn&#039;t mine. So I cant change it. Can anybody please help","replies":[{"poster":"The TwistedHeart","date":"2015-09-22T22:42:41.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, im submitting the ticket now as they have changed my password.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Beckie Gabriel","date":"2015-09-20T14:54:18.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the same link got sent to me and the support pages is not helping. wtf \ni keep getting robotic answer and i just want my account back","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArataHaruki","date":"2015-09-18T14:22:26.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish you luck!
