What we got were essentially permanent chat groups, with a little tag on your name, nothing more and nothing less (not that you could get much less).\r\nSo I thought about it for a bit, and I got some ideas as to how Riot could possibly rework the clubs system, or implement a whole new system that acts more like what I expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFirst off, it would be located in a new tab in the client (duh). If you&#039;re not apart of a guild, there will be a list you can scroll through of open guilds looking to accept members, nothing special, maybe some search options and requirement boxes you can tick, fairly straightforward. There could be a little section of this page dedicated to guilds that have invited you personally, and maybe guilds you&#039;ve been in previously.\r\n\r\nSecondly, once you&#039;ve joined a guild, the guild screen will change. It will become like a profile page, but for the guild.\r\nThere will be the guild icon (much like summoner icons) in the center of the page, a section for guild stats (games played, won, lost, kills, takedowns, towers, etc etc).\r\nThere will be a section for players (like the friends list, but for the guild, who&#039;s online, who&#039;s offline, guild rank, etc).\r\n\r\nThere could also be a section for daily quests, for example, every day the quest will change, and it&#039;s available to all guilds. Think of it as a &quot;first win of the day&quot; bonus, but a bit more in depth, things like &quot;win 3 guild games&quot; or &quot;level up your guild&quot; or even &quot;recruit 3 new members&quot;, every guild would receive the same quest, and it&#039;s only one quest per day. These could give rewards to all members of the guild, or maybe just the members that took part.\r\n\r\nAnother idea I thought of (which is where the main difference to clubs comes in) is achievements. Things like winning games, or objective steals, or time limits, etc etc, if you can think of it chances are it could be an achievement. These provide your entire guild with rewards and exp.\r\n\r\nAlso a separate game mode called guild matches, here is where you fight other guilds and rank up (your guild, not your personal rank), like ranked teams, but more relaxed.\r\n---\r\nI&#039;ll throw in the images, these should help explain my ideas a bit, any suggestions would be awesome, so don&#039;t be afraid to comment :D","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-24T03:40:14.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly what I thought Riot was originally going to do, RIOT PLS","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2016-10-23T23:31:09.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-10-23T13:09:59.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"logged in just to upvote, sounds kinda cool","replies":[]}]}
