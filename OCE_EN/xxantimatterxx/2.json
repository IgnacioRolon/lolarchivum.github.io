posted a flawless answer, how is there still confusion. i think you're being a bit stubborn now man. you didnt even account for dragon, whats more likely now that you're wrong again or that he is in

determined im right i just took over 10 minutes to write a detailed answer as to how he got such a highamount of AP and you refuse to believe me for whatever reason. the explanation included the possibilities of having 1 of either blue buff or bulwark on at the time you observed. i was convinced he would have blue buff as its much more likely, but i gave you the benefit of the doubt and you said he didnt have blue buff. thats fine though, ill dismiss this possible smartass-ery and i accounted for it, he had bulwark, its 4 seconds, gives the same amount of AP, thats fine, im still correct\n\nbut now, even after my pin-fucking-point calculations, you refuse to believe he didnt have rabadons, and you refuse to believe, that you did in fact observe him at 25:00 to 25:37 maximum, NO LATER, according to you, with only his bulwark on, having not yet bought rabadons until 25:41 (up to 4 seconds later) and with these stubborn conditions based on nothing but word of mouth to work, he must also be hacking, for the exact amount more of AP as if he were to just have had a rabadons, possibly 4 seconds later after you observed him......\n\nyeah nah gtfo

+ 35% ap.
