This season after improving significantly I won 6 and lost 4 out of my provisional games and was placed once again in Bronze 4. Now I have a 2nd account in which I just did my provisional games and I won 4 and lost 6 and was placed in Silver 5 which is strange because I won less and lost more than on my main account. Rectify this please. I tried to escape from Bronze on my main and went from Bronze 4 to Bronze 1 in 2 days. Recently got demoted back to Bronze 2 because my teams don&#039;t know how to play.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-02T09:07:50.381+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"You had lower mmr last season so it makes it harder to climb the next season.","replies":[{"poster":"TnT","date":"2015-06-02T11:57:10.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ShuffledPancake,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=I1c1Xcp2,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-02T09:07:50.381+0000)\n>\n> You had lower mmr last season so it makes it harder to climb the next season.\n\nThis.
