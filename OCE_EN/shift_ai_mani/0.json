I found the ticket from a few months ago that you're referring to where some support reps appear to be continually asking for logs instead of just letting you know why your leaverbuster restrictions cannot be reversed. They could have handled this better, and this was eventually escalated and feedback was provided to these support reps shortly thereafter. I do also note that an escalation rep answered your ticket and explained things appropriately.\n\nTo give a bit more detail:\nThe primary reason that account was placed in such a long priority queue was its recent history of consistent leaving. Even if the leave which got you a 20 min priority queue was due to your anti-virus restarting your computer, it was only so heavily punished due to so many leaves occurring beforehand. The system does allow a leave every now and then due to technical issues. But it will place you in low priority queue if you continue to leave intentionally (which you mentioned you had done on occasion) or if you fail to fix the technical issues that are causing you to leave games so often. If the system were any more lenient then a far greater amount of games would be impacted, and no one wants to play with a leaver or AFK on their team.\n\nLooking at your more recent tickets regarding your new account which has also been placed in low priority queue: your restrictions again are due to the consistent leaving or dc'ing from game. I note that you've been flagged for leaving in 10% of your games on this account. That is a huge amount and it negatively impacts every single player in those games :(\n\nLow priority queue is designed as shield to prevent a player who consistently leaves or AFKs from negatively impacting as many games as they potentially could. It also doesn't just ban you outright, as we want you to be able to play, but would prefer that you prioritize fixing the issues that are causing you to disconnect before doing so.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Haboub","date":"2015-06-28T02:24:05.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Gehirn. \nI need help with my account! I keep getting chat restrictions every time i finish them they come back! It has happened 5 times in a row. To make sure it wasn't my fault when the chat restrictions finished i played a game and didn't type a single word 3 times! And still at the end of the game the chat restrictions managed to crawl their way back onto my account! Why is this happening? PLEASE HELP!","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-06-30T08:47:06.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Mr Haboub,\n\nFrom what I can see you have been getting successive chat restrictions because you are still being consistently reported. However, your latest chat restriction where you chose to avoid using chat shows a significant decrease in reports against you.\n\nThe thing is you are still rated negatively enough to receive another chat restriction based on your recent history. Basically, if you continue to avoid saying negative things to your teammates then chat restrictions will eventually stop being applied to your account, but your behaviour has to be consistent!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
