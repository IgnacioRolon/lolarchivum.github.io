Bots do not help the game, they are not needed and should not be allowed and frankly RIOT should be doing a lot more punishment wise to get rid of these things for good. The fact that these botting programs pretty much change the odds from winning from 50/50 to 80/20 on one team is also completely wrong, as it makes 1 of the 3 available modes luck based instead of skill based effectively . These botters face no punishment outside of their bot accounts being closed, if they doing this it should be an IP ban, because they are just going to make more accounts and keep the bots in a place where they shouldn&#039;t be in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-04T02:24:23.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or we could just ban accounts that are obviously bots in the first place.\n\nThe issue is that these bots don't actually get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-01-04T04:15:02.968+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":8,"body":"Man, so did I just dream all those times that I banned bots last year?\n\nGranted neither I nor the automated systems hit them all, also that bots are likely to level fast before we can detect them given how easy it is to hit 30 now.\n\nWe've got resources being poured into new methods right now, because whatever we've been doing has, as you've regularly pointed out, not had the desired effect despite the significant time investment thus far.\n\nDo note that IP banning is already known to be a non-workable idea.

The fact that bots still exist at all and are such a consistently complained about issue means we're doing not nearly enough as of yet.\nThe team that handles automated detection for scripting/cheating also handles automated detection for bots. Automated bans do still exist, this much I know because sometimes when I go to ban some bots manually I find that the automated detection has already picked them up and banned them. Regrettably it's just usually a bit slower than if you were sifting through data manually looking for key indicators and then confirming that through further manual checks.\nBut the automated bans obviously have a larger scope and can achieve more than any amount of Rioters could manually, but again slower to act due to confidence/accuracy issues.\n\nI do suppose that we've been so much better and faster at addressing cheating/scripting because it has the potential to have a much more negative and larger scope of impact if not given our full attention. Whereas botting is usually at least confined to co-op games or strict MMR ranges in ARAM.\nTo that end however, the team is actively pouring more effort into the problem, and I'm hopeful that some other stuff coming up will curb the problem.\n\nNow, over the years you've heard me say this before, stuff like \"yep it's a problem, it sucks I know! but the team is on the case and working on new detection methods\". And while they're working on new methods myself and others will often try to fill the gaps in detection with a few manual efforts here and there.\nGets repetitive doesn't it? But indeed, each time it has been true. But, as with scripting/cheating, it's a constant arms race. Someone develops a cheat, you detect the cheat, then they develop a new cheat or method of employing it and you have to close another loophole or develop new detection and so on it goes.\nI'd say this time however, that we're looking to cure the problem to the same degree of effectiveness that we've had with scripting/cheating which has been pretty good. At least I know that is the intent of the team set up to have a crack at it this time.\nYou and I may be pretty jaded at this point, and gods know I'm as tired of dealing with bots as anyone, but I'm actually hopeful that we're gonna take a more significant and permanent chunk out of the problem in 2018.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-04T23:39:27.250+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Gehirn,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=78Nvd6pV,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2018-01-04T04:15:02.968+0000)\n>\n> Man, so did I just dream all those times that I banned bots last year?\n\n\n\nThat is some solid bedside manner right there.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2018-01-10T06:32:42.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"how unpleasant!!! i call for a ban!!\n\n\nsarcasm btw","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-10T07:01:48.465+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lebron Games,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=78Nvd6pV,comment-id=0000000100020000,timestamp=2018-01-10T06:32:42.820+0000)\n>\n> how unpleasant!!! i call for a ban!!\n> \n> \n> sarcasm btw\n\nPeople have been given 14 dayers for less.
