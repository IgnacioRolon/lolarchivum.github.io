My last one got deleted for no reason and i didn't care but now im really pissed. I have been playing ranked (im in b5 even tho i got 4/10 provionary wins) and i always get a really bad team. I try so hard to carry but no matter my score once i get 1v5'd and die my team instantly loses. As you can see from my link i go positive as ADC, JG, Top or Mid 99% of the time. This may be a score of 20/9 as adc or 10/3 as jg so on and so on. Yet my team will always lose, i try to help the other lanes as much as possible if they are losing and get them back to even or positive. Yet i still lose. Is there any way that i can have any kind of answer that will explain to me why your match making is so bad for me?\r\n\r\nAt this rate i highly doubt i will play LoL again, Ever. Especially if this gets deleted again with a bs reason like This being in Misc is the wrong board.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-24T08:49:11.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously don't know how or when to take objectives.\nGet a million kills, it doesnt matter if your opponents still have all their towers.\n\nLets look at your last game.\n\nUdyr (jungle): 10/3/6. Great score.\nWards placed as jungler (including trinket): 1..... 1..... in 33 minutes. 1.\n\n17 minutes in: Enemy gets Dragon and a tower. But are aced for it (5 for 0). Good. Your team didn't get any towers or objectives for it. if the WHOLE enemy team is dead, there is no one there to kill you. PUSH A TOWER.\n\nGame before that.\n\nUdyr (jungle): 12/8/8. thats ok.\nWards placed as jungler: 0.... 0... INCLUDING TRINKET. in 35 minutes\n\n10 mins in you kill their jungler and top laner. take the top tower. just do it. push.\n17 minutes in, you kill 4 of them and they get a tower. You get no objective from 4 kills?\n\nEzreal game. you ace the enemy at 23 minutes. Again. no towers, no dragons, nothing. for 5 kills.\n\n\nthere a pattern here in all your games. Learn how to win rather than just simply getting kills.","replies":[{"poster":"shadow tenshi","date":"2015-02-25T14:09:38.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't agree more, Objectives win games, that and vision, warding is important too, dont forget your {{item:3340}}, {{item:3341}} and {{item:3342}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quite Strong","date":"2015-02-26T11:48:15.019+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I can still improve my game, but when i have no team to back me up what can I do?

If I want to I can carry my self out of bronze / silver ELO and if you don't believe me look at my match history \"DemiGod44\" on NA, i average about 300 - 400 cs depending on the game take all of the towers my laner has and just dominate them. I carry MY SELF almost singlehandedly every game, the fact that you are having this much trouble in ranked at this elo it means that you are bad. You just need to play normals.","replies":[]}]}
