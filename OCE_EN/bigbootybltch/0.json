NA job","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, i&#039;ve created a smurf and finally hit level 30, getting all excited to smash these placements since i put some rp to buy my champs and managed to save up for my runes. During my placements (all 10 games) i somehow managed to get teamed up a bunch of unranked kids. I&#039;m not complaining that im getting unrankeds in my team, it&#039;s the fact that i am playing against silver 3&#039;s up to gold 3&#039;s. My team mates are going 1/13, 2/10. So riot how on earth am i meant to win games with this match making. I have given them advice and i got reported x3 for verbal abuse. I have reported them for int feed then next game i get them again. \r\nis it too much to ask for a balanced team?\r\nAccording to lolskill each game i have played in they have a 60+ win chance. This is dumb.

Until you get ranked, those statistics won't mean anything and shouldn't really be taken into account.","replies":[]}]}
