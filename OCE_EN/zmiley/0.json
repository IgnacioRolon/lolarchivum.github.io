I know everyone is playing bla bla bla. \r\nIt&#039;s awesome game, I admit. people are destryong it with there attitude. \r\nWhat about a system, of pure skill gameplays and not flaming where:  \r\n- people can&#039;t join ranked if they flame or they are chat aggresive. Argument: people tend to focus more in ranked becouse of there self estime and work in this game ( which means if you flame someone when he is trying to cooperate, will fail due to concentration issues) \r\n- Not being able to join, until, you reach at least level 4 with 16 champion and at least 2 s- . Argument : people tend to enter in game with hard champions they never played, there mecanics suck, they can&#039;t do outplays, more they enter that champion in ranked cuz they want to get people mad.\r\n- If a person is afk in the middle of the game, more then 10 min, he needs to go down one division, for exemple from g 4 to g 5 to understand afk frustration. Argument : people are doing insane effort in ranked, in which case, some people tend to give up fighting, which means they don&#039;t want to evolve, they don&#039;t belong among people with current divion he&#039;s playing.\r\n- Games with a teammate afk more then 10, should receve at least 20% less ip and so far with every further teammate afk. Argument : if someone is afk, your force is 20% less, 40% less ... which means your effort and time and play spent there doesn&#039;t need to be 100% punished, cuz you cant force people to play, they enter in solo que, and it&#039;s unfair to punish everyone with the same sentece cuz one guy decided to leave on purpouse or not and ruin people. Doing it on purpouse if hard to be proven, but having to implement a sistem where afk is afk need to drastically be done.\r\n- Teemo should be deleted ( kidding ).","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-09-08T09:43:20.370+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your first idea is pretty solid.\n\nTBH to this day I don't know why severely toxic players are allowed to play ranked. **Riot** already removes ranked rewards from toxic players at the end of the season, so it really wouldn't be very radical to extend this logic a little further.\n\nRanked is place for intense co-operation and hard work IMO. It's really not the kind of place where we can afford toxic players to escalate tensions and ruin experiences :(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2016-09-10T09:43:40.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, i can sympathize in most of what you are saying except for the 16+ lvl 4 champs, only because champion mastery is no real indication of skill, i mean im lvl 4 on some champs that i CANNOT play, not only this but you are excluding people from maining champs in ranked, which we really want to improve overall performance. say for example there is a guy on your team that has 300 k mastery on yasuo, do you want him or the person that cant decide who they are good at. im not even joking at this point tho, i have seen a guy with a million points on teemo and 3 points on the rest of his champion pool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-09-09T00:33:05.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you never get your mistakes pointed out you will never learn or get better.\nDiffuse the situation. Say you're sorry for making a mistake and you will do better next time.\nThat way you concentrate on your game, they feel better for having their ego satisfied and it makes everything a positive place.\nIf they keep abusing you after that then they are in the wrong, mute them and report them after game.\n\nGenerally, players won't get toxic unless they feel someone is ruining their game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-09-08T16:16:24.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with the have atleast level 4 champions.\n\nBut I feel like it should be extended to ONLY level 4+ champions can be used in ranked.\n\nI may be salty but I've had many people who keep trying out champions they're not good at in ranked.
