If that's the case, and the actions which resulted in suspension of the account were done by an intruder on the account, then usually that punishment can be reversed once the account is secure.\n\nYour first step should be to change your password. From there, assuming you didn't do whatever the reform card says the account was punished for, didn't share the account with someone who did, and are the original owner of the account, your next step should be to submit an account recovery ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\n(You will have to be logged *out* of support to do this)\n\nOnce the account is secure, Support can take you through the process of recovering it.","replies":[]}]}
