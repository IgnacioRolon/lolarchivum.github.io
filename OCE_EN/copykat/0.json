The biggest reasons people hate it so much is...\n\n1. People choose really lame champs, and you are stuck playing that champ for 20-40mins... \n2. There are just some champs that counter everyone else... (I'm looking at you heim) \n3. There is no skill involved (get a lot of trolls and ragers)\n4.
