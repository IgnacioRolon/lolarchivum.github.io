That said, you will only be given the account back *if* Riot determines that you were falsely banned, which is a rare occurrence in itself. The best advice I can give is to provide as much information on the situation as you can when you submit your ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"LOLTHEPOOLEESIN1","date":"2016-10-10T19:12:07.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Iamkorean123","date":"2016-10-02T02:42:12.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I write this and I can log into lol oce league of legends.com but I can't log into game","replies":[]}]}
