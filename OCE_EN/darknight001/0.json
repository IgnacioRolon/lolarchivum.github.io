Mobility. Now, I know that people say he is not a mobility champion, however, I think this buff idea could make him quite fun to play, as well as reward people with aggressive and bullying behavior in lane and maybe pull him back in the meta. \r\nSimply put, I ask of riot to do this: When your w procs on an enemy champion, you have a, say, 5 second time limit to use a dash roughly the size of a lucian or vayne even dash. \r\nThis would make varus mobile enough to keep with the current meta, and to let him get time to reposition after a aggressive play in lane. It would also give him some mobility in team-fights if he is caught out when his ult, which would help his supposed strength in that area, and would compensate for his falling off late game.\r\nI also personally think that it would make him more enjoyable to snipe with and to improve his playability in the current meta. \r\nAbout it being broken, I don't think it would be if, either, as you can give a set timer after being used and unless you use it, not proc it's cool-down, and because you need to proc the w, it would not be an OP buff  imo, it would just give him a situational burst of mobility.\r\nI would also like some sort of way to diminish the cool-down by simply getting the w procced.\r\nTo conclude, I think that this would be a decent buff which could bring another bursty adc back into the meta!\r\n(P.S comment your opinions too)\r\n;) {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}}  {{champion:110}} \r\nMORE VARUS!\r\nI DEMAND IT RIOT!","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-22T11:07:27.500+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Varus is not meant to have fucking mobility, giving him any sort of mobility would make him OP.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-22T11:39:20.221+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"this guy is just stating he's opinion no need to get aggressive, a simple, no that would make him to op would be perfectly fine, easy now tiger","replies":[{"poster":"blackfang3","date":"2015-03-23T01:36:45.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:76}} \ndon't ult yet wait for the teamfight","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-03-22T23:55:15.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats a load of bull crap, varus is fine as is, if you are good at him he shouldn't need a buff. so if you want him to get buffed evidently you are not good at him, i play varus and he is fine, press E and actually hit them just on the furthest edge so its a perma slow, press R locked in place then just run, if it is such a problem that he is immobile, get mobi or swifty boots","replies":[{"poster":"blackfang3","date":"2015-03-23T01:26:59.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Well, if you play Varus, you should know that he's barely used at all, and that a buff would help him.

Maybe I do need more skill against morgs, and luckily I haven't been matched up against volis, but thanks for some advice.\n\nbtw, I think I was just in a bad mood that day, and I'm always biased towards Varus.

That might be better, as you can pop your w a lot more times than killing an enemy opponent to get the mobility boost. As for minion kills for the boost, it can be reduced like the AS buff in the passive. It might be cool to gain mobility when u hit your E against an enemy (initial hit only) or with any ability too, but that might be pushing it\n\nBut Varus FTW \n{{champion:110}} \n{{summoner:6}} \n{{item:3085}}","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-23T05:04:56.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think what one of the features you describe there is already in the game..

You're meant to watch your positioning anyway as a fragile ADC.
