Somethings i have noticed are these bot like players are river sprites with no icon(just black), make strange movement after battles and pick wheels, Never speak, seem to quite often get lux 2 star, have lightning  fast unit placement(i will scout the unit placement just before battle starts and it will be totally different when battle begins.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Say No to Krugs","date":"2020-02-14T01:08:30.758+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah OCE TFT has been hit with bots as well, I think its to do with the moblie release.

They are mobile beta players. Players from other regions are making throwaway accounts to test mobile tft. Oce and Euw (possibly Eune too) are the only servers testers can play on atm in closed beta. There is also no chat or shop functions in mobile and you cannot change your player icon. Which is why theres so many default players who do not respond in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"zebedi","date":"2020-02-16T13:11:41.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 bot for 3 humans.
