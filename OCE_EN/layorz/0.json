Avast is not the cause of my issues.\n\nLast year around July, my LoL launcher simply stopped working. Anytime I tried to open the client, it bug splatted immediately after the League of Legends logo appeared. I tried for days to find a fix, but nothing worked from deleting RADs folders to full reinstalls to creating new users and trying it out on those. Nothing worked, and I eventually gave up and stopped playing altogether. I figured maybe in a few months time it&#039;d work again.   \n   \nObviously not. I have tried all day to make League of Legends work, but I get the same thing happening. I get a bug splat when trying to open client, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, I&#039;ve tried playing with DirectX and AdobeAir, I&#039;ve tried disabling UAC, I&#039;ve tried everything and anything that I can find using online searches and nothing works. I really don&#039;t know what to do anymore. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gUKJ4br.jpg - What happens when I double click the LoL icon\n\nI&#039;ve attached my latest bug splat log. I really don&#039;t know what else I can do to get this shit working. I&#039;d like to actually play with my mates when I play a MOBA rather than playing with randoms in HOTS or DOTA","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-13T08:44:24.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you made any recent changes to your system? \n\n* Are all your drivers up to date? \n* Is your Windows install up to date?\n* Do you have a system restore point from before this started occurring to potentially identify the change to your system that started causing this issue?\n* What antivirus software do you use?

No changes were made preceding the first issue last year - in fact, the PC was brand new and was running LoL fine for a month before a patch dropped.\nYes, Windows is up to date   \nNo, I do not. It happened, IIRC, immediately after a patch around mid 2015. I can't provide any other information about my PC's state at that time.\nAVG, yes it's added as an exception (both executable and the parent Riot Games folder) as well as to Windows Firewall.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-13T09:48:11.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you please run dxdiag and reply with the results, thanks.\n\nThis is going to sound silly, you also mentioned you disabled UAC, did you run the game as Administrator after doing this?
