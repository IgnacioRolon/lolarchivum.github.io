I most often played Diana, Jhin, and several others. I have no huge role preference so give it your best shot. Tell me why you think your champion is the the most fun and or best to pick up and learn. Your pros and cons and why you love the champion so much. Also just for additional fun, favorite skin on that champion?

It also give's you free damage\n\n- Has the \"Hyper Carry\" playstyle that allows you to carry games off your own back\n\n- Does huge damage and is tanky\n\n- TF can't gold card you when your stun is up\n\n- People who cant play Renekton pick Renekton to counter you\n\n- Has a gap closer stun that is great for successful jungle ganks\n\n- Can top or jungle and mid if your adventurous (AP burst)\n\nCon's\n\n- Gold hungry champ that can fall behind if he doesn't farm well / snowball / gets killed alot early\n\n- Pretty lackluster teamfighter until you have like 3 items unless your ahead and can insta kill squishies\n\n- A good Pantheon and Renekton can be hell in lane\n\n- Irelia does what you do and is a bit stronger in the current meta\n\n- If you don't understand how split pushing works properly you'll find yourself dying alot to 1v3's for nothing\n\n- Teammates love to blame you for not grouping when they push without wards and die 4v5\n\n\nNotes\n\n- Watch high level Jax players who play super aggressive in lane to pick up some pointers. (Hashinshin and Diyos are 2 i've watched recently)","replies":[{"poster":"The Bush Chicken","date":"2016-09-15T19:43:30.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good comment I have played jax before but mostly back when guinsoos did the aoe damage at 8 stacks adn the devourer item was the thing to go.
