Two things which people incidentally already complain about even at times when they are functioning normally and as expected.\n\nSo if it barely helps the situation, and actively harms matchmaking and queue health, why reason would they have to consider (let alone prioritise) such a feature?","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-03T00:25:50.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Imagine unironically believing this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-03T06:27:04.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, I could say the same of you.
