My first idea is in the death screen, to display a tip to deal with the champion that killed them. For example, &quot;_Riven is a very strong 1v1 champion, but if you silence her she looses a huge portion of the damage she could have dealt to you_&quot;. If a player dies to a turret, a tip like &quot;_Turrets deal a huge amount of damage, stay behind your minions to avoid turret damage_.&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-11-22T22:13:47.257+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love this idea!!!\nI'll pass it along. We are working on finding new ways to help new players so this sounds perfectly in line.\nDo you think that this needs to be ingame to be the most effective?\nModifying the game is one of the hardest things to do and we would need game developer resources to do that. If we can use the client or the web, we can pretty much to it by ourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-23T01:12:18.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well a possibility would be to collect data from the game like timestamp, what gave the death blow etc to help remind them of the death, then give the tips in like a post game report almost. You could also put extra tips there like say if there score was 2/12/5 or something you could have tips like: \"If you are behind in levels or kills, be sure to play safe around your turrets/minions as your enemy will have greater strength, catch up in cs and if possible roam and pick up some kills or assists before trying to fight them again.\" The kind of stuff that we who have been playing for 3 years know mostly intrinsically.\n\nThat way there's less to worry about in game (cause let's face it, it's a hectic game to learn, especially if you don't have someone to teach you, been there done that, it's hard) and after the game they can look back at what they did wrong and get general tips on how to get better. Of course it'll never be able to replace human observation but, for those that don't have anyone to teach them, it would be a good buffer. \n\nI floundered through mechanics and such well past level 30. It wasn't until I picked up a couple plat friends and found sites like lolcounter and the various build sites and watched and learned that I really started to actually understand what was going on. If i had had something in end game to say, \"This champion does x in x way. This is how you counter/vs x champion. Minions are very strong allies/opponents in early game fights.\" Things would have clicked a lot faster. Maybe you could even (I don't know how it works from the business end) link to sites like lolcounter. LIke have a little note at the end of the report to say for more information on this champion, go here: and then have a link to the lolcounter page for that champion or something like that. (I don't know how relevant lolcounter itself is anymore, I haven't needed them in a long while, but it's just an example)\n\nAn end game report (put in in match history as well but have it visible in end game lobby) would be so versatile. You can have a system that looks at their items, gives them information about how often (percentages) the item is picked for that champion in that lane. You can give them the most common items used on that champion in that lane against that opponent (I'm pretty sure you guys already use all this data in internal testing so exposing it to new players could help them. Some of that data could help even experienced players, though maybe limit the data to your mmr. So say I have a gold mmr, limit the data to silver-plat. If you're challenger then limit it to master/challenger etc if that's at all possible, obviously different tiers build/play pretty differently).\n\nSo you could have categories like items, runes/masteries, skill max order (if relevant), then general tips for the matchup generated perhaps with some input from death data. (e.g Yas vs Riven, the only thing Yas's wind wall can block is her ult, so if the death data marks a 1v1 and Yas took damage from the Riv ult have a tip saying \"The only skill of Riven's that Yasuo can block with Wind Wall is Wind Slash - R (that's what the active is called yeah?) so save your Wind Wall to block it.\"\n\nAnother thing you could have in these reports would be to mark champions with similar playstyles. For example, if you like Vayne, you might enjoy Kali (mobility/positioning). If you like Nami you might enjoy Lulu (heavy hard cc, knockup ults, heals/shields). If you like Lulu, you might enjoy Karma (heavy utility, shields). You could also mark team matchups like, Malphite/Nami goes very well with Yasuo. Morgana goes well with Sivir/Varus.\n\nI've gotten a bit long winded here but basically.\ntl;dr Have an end game report visible in end game lobby and match history with tips/stats that we come to know over time like build paths, champion matchups, game mechanics like how to farm under turrets. Learning through experience is the only way to get better, but providing tips like this, some would stick and would make their lives and their journey a whole lot easier.\n\n(Especially you could stress the importance of vision/vision control. I know that one of my biggest hurdles when I started playing with people who actually knew what they were doing, was working out that, wow, wards are really f'ing important and I need them, and then subsequently learning where and when to place them, where pink wards should go, remembering to keep vision on key objectives like baron and dragon etc etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-11-23T04:33:46.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Great feedback I am going to grab a lot of this for discussion thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-23T04:36:13.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":) Hopefully it wasn't too disorganised for you.

Suggestions like \"BE CAREFUL\" and \"YOUR CHAMPION IS SQUISHY\" and \"THINK OF YOUR TEAM\" and \"STOP FEEDING FUCKWIT\". How about a system that recognises who is causing trouble on the other team? Players really should not be reminded not to feed Nasus or let him farm but \"WHOOPS, LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE FEEDING THE DOG. DON'T FEED THE DOG!\" could get attention away from less important things.
