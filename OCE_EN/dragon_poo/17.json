Whoever thought that buffing it was a good idea should probably have heir artistic license revoked, because this is almost as bad as the juggernaut reworks","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-08T04:11:30.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trinity force is also the most expensive item in the game next to rabadon's death cap by a 67 gold margin.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-08T07:59:58.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't mean much when it's Item slot efficient and a great item to start snowballing with (let alone all the parts being efficient).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-08T00:27:58.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its just a frozen gauntlet with double the damage","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-08T00:58:07.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it has a more powerful spellblade, rage passive which is better for toplaners when engaging or disengaging or towerdiving, gives 5% movespeed, 25 ad, 40% atkspeed and 250 hp and if you build steraks or have high base ad that extra difference between +100% base ad and +200% base ad is pretty big. In the end triforce is just more gold efficient and whilst not as tanky or supportive as frozen gauntlet, it offers better dueling stats so much so that if my adc is a tool, I might build triforce on my blitzcrank instead of gauntlet.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-07T23:31:59.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm seeing triforce on alot of champions now, and even I'm guilty of building it on random champions to see what happens (go triforce+steraks into full tank blitzcrank sometime the damage is hilarious, you grab that adc or mage support and you don't even need an adc to finish them). I'm build triforce sion, nasus, ezreal mid, twitch, akali (testing it in custom bot games atm) and blitzcrank in top or sup.
