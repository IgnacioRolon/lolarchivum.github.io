Now, you could give her charges of &quot;focus&quot; which give her  4 uses of abilities  before having to recharge, similar to the reload mechanic, but on a much more useable timeframe.\r\n\r\nI mean lets face it, id rather you just delete the champ and start over, but at least give the champion that has everything, jsut one downside.\r\n\r\nthx for  ruining my losss streak riven.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-03-06T06:57:47.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just slap an energy bar on that fat ass of hers.\n\nProblem solved.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-04T19:21:34.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i run urgot,malz and swain into riven and never have a problem, most times i usually end up getting fed depending on how much box box they've been watching.\n\nyeah but i get what your saying and i also find champs that have no resource to burn in lane pretty darn annoying, i feel like most of the time they have no restrictions and can just spam abilities to easily. theres no \"oh if i harass my laner i won't be able to farm\" type of balance.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-05T01:44:15.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play around cooldowns though and riven kinda has trouble csing if she has to fast clear, so pushing out and forming your minion wave can deny her alot of farm because despite how it looks her q is horrible for csing large waves, especially early game. Also against squishy burst melee champions like riven, she really doesn't want to be fighting and taking your minion aggro since then she'd be forced to use her e to engage and now she cannot disengage and is still taking minion aggro. Riven's lane sustain kinda sucks (which is why she buys so many pots) so unlike alot of tanks or lifesteal champions she generally can't afford to be taking much more damage then her e shield.\n\nAs Nautilus I find a good general strategy is to try just pushing minions and waiting for an opportunity to trade harder and keeping her stuck once she tries to disengage if you can, as nautilus use e to push from a distance, dancing through the minion waves and when she looks like she wants to engage with a e-w for instance, pop your w before she engages, then e once you are out of stun and then auto her before she tries to dash away and then q her back when she tries to run away for alot more minion damage than she ever expected. Minions are not to be underestimated, especially earlygame.\n\nJust don't try to fight a riven as soon as she hits level 6 since she's probably going to kill you until you get some armour, since her level 6 powerspike is extreme, but she falls off shortly after since we hit the point in the game where people start buying items and rivens early item options kinda define how she'll play the laning phase.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trafa1gar Law","date":"2017-03-05T01:26:49.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Look i'm sorry but if riven's mechanics were changed into a reload mechanism she would never be played again. this is including box box and adrian riven lmao. As a riven main myself ik that there are many ways to counter her such as in one of my previous games i vsed a quinn which is hard enough as it is alone but got ganked a few times to give my opponent a massive lead. i was useless for the rest of the game becasue i could neither farm nor did i have any decent or fed teamates to back me up :p.","replies":[]}]}
