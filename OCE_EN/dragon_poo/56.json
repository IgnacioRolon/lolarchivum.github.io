Leave em, focus on top and mid instead (Or lanes that ain't feeding)\n\n- Try and get other lanes fed, in most cases for you. This should be mid.\n\n-Only counter jungle if you have nothing better to do.\n\n-If you have just ganked mid or top and gotten a kill, Push that very hard.\n\n-Trade objectives. They get bot? You get top. \nThey get dragon? You get rift.\n\n-Focus on towers, first blood gold is alot and is very nice to have for a spike.\n\n-BONUS: the moment you see ANYONE from mid or top bitch about you killing them (the enemy)\ncamp the FUCK out of that lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Delicious Yogurt","date":"2016-12-29T12:16:48.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Don't Gank any lane <3 Just farm and focus your game, and just aim for Ks and be strong and carry game","replies":[]}]}
