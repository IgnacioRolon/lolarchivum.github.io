Many things can happen that is out of their control. There might be some douche out there who chooses to afk purposely but there is very little chance that someone does it purposely.

Riot knows that sometimes these things can't be avoided, and doesn't want to punish players so harshly after just one occurrence. It takes a couple of leaves (less if you don't play much) to actually start getting punished and placed in low priority queue. If the player doesn't address there issues (crap internet/ pre-historic computer) then the punishments will keep stacking up. \n\nRanked is a pretty serious and competitive queue, so those who leave (even just once!) usually face the LPQ punishment more quickly than those that leave in bots/norms. A two week ban from ranked is just stupid for just one leave. Yes, it is frustrating for the other players (who hasn't had a ranked game lost to an unfortunate DC or rage quit, even when in the clear lead), but a harsher punishment isn't the answer. \n\n\n## **A better solution would be to focus on preventative measures. **\n\nWe live in a region where most people have really crappy internet _(I didn't realise how bad, until the new feature came in where you can ping your ping)_. Some people have it consistently, others have it in spikes. A large portion of the player base are youngins and students, who don't have much money to buy top-tier computers, or even slightly above average ones (a lot of people play this game because it's free to play and not pay to win). In other words, it isn't reasonable to put a ranked blanket ban on players who don't have less than x ping or x PC specs, because you would be alienating a large portion of the oceanic community. \n\nSomething that could be done, however is a **small popup checklist** when you enter your first ranked queue for the day (and then comes back up every ~5 ranked games). \n\n* have you checked your ping\n* Is your laptop plugged in (if on laptop)\n* Have you checked your runes/masteries\n* Will you lag if someone else starts using your web (and is it likely)\n* have you played a bot/custom/norm to check for any random errors\n* ethernet plugged in / stable and strong wifi connection\n* do you have ~1hour to dedicate to this game\n\nJust to remind players and make them a little bit more conscious of the impact of these factors on the quality of the game. Educating players and guiding them to make more informed decisions is a much more effective strategy than just slapping them with a hardcore punishment.","replies":[]}]}
