It used to be that if you got caught In something like Morgana's Q, when it ended you'd usually come out with very low HP _(in general)_.\nNow, you get hit by something like Lux's Q, you're dead before the snare even ends!\n\nSo with all the champions nearly 1-hitting eachother, a shield is a huge boon! It means that your damage will kill the enemy, before his damage kills you.\nWhere in the old days, fights seemed to last much longer, so a shield was less useful as it was only being used for part of the fight. Instead of today where duel/fights are so much shorter because everyone does all their damage so much quicker, so the shield is on you for the majority of the fight.\n\nI think if we saw a 15% damage reduction on ALL champions, everything would be a lot better. There would be more time to actually put your counterplay into action, instead of having Trynd fly out of a bush and 2 hit you before you can even flash.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-22T17:08:16.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Also with the nerfs to the tank items (reducing their health+health regeneration of other items) shields become so valuable. If we continue to nerf shields, then tank supports will be OP (currently I believe they have quite a nice battle with the 'enchanters'). Then we will nerf those.... and ....\nthe next nerf we will be playing league in a 4 corner square room.\nLeague sure changes a lot. I wish they had left things like they were back in season 4. Where each class had its strengths and weaknesses, real items still existed, and nerfs (not to mention patches) were less frequent. Constant changes leave no time for the casual player to settle in and get accustomed with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-06-23T00:31:33.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, I really don't want to return to a tank meta. where you need at least 3 tanks on your team just to have a chance at winning...\n\nLeague definitely changes a lot, and from a business standpoint it has to, otherwise a large amount of players would get bored.\nBut a lot of the 'forced' changes like huge class updates and the like, push the game in a certain direction too rapidly, and into unexplored waters, which then requires immediate heavy patching to balance it, which itself throws the game off course again.\n\nI think they just need 6 months with no big changes in the patch notes to just fine-tune all the little niggly bits, and even things out again.\nThey are chugging out mostly-untested updated champions and items nearly every patch. While big bugs like this one:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Nrz4fekIU\nare still rife in the game.\n\nI think a big part of the damage problem is new items. \nBack in the old days, items mostly just gave you increased stats, and the occasional one like Gunblade, Hydra, or Death Fire Grasp, gave you a clearly visible extra ability. \n\nBut now there are so many hidden damage sources on items, Duskblade's true damage, Titanic Hydra's bonus damage, Luden's damage. etc etc. Hell , the crit damage from Statik Shiv and Rapid Firecannon, does more than most abilities. \n\nNot to mention there are tons of items like Titanic and Sterak's that give tanks high levels of damage now as well.\nSo I think the game hasn't properly adjusted to the presence of these highly damaging items, and so the damage of champions just continues to rise.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2017-06-22T02:51:20.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A shield that inflicts grievous wounds does not really make sense as shielding traditionally is about mitigating damage.

I mean I want there to be an effect that is grvious wounds, but instead of it affecting hp, it affects shields. so it reduces shielding by 50% or something. there is currently no counter to a shield except trying to burst through it, and with he rise of the new locket on tanks, Janna, lulu, karma, Courage of the collossus, there should be a way to reduce the shielding done.","replies":[{"poster":"Soju Puppy","date":"2017-06-22T07:35:18.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay now this makes more sense. although the shields could be annoying, there's nothing stopping your team from using them also.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
