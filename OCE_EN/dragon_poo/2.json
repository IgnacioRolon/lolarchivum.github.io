If you're a higher ranked team and you win, you will win slightly less points, and vice versa. \n\nThere can't ever be a system where LP gains are given per player based on performance because your *performance* is based on a wide range of factors outside of your KDA. No one statistic or even a mixture can give a true indication of your contribution to a win/loss. There used to be strategies with Singed where you would continuously push and die nearly all game, but the pressure you created on the map allowed your team to win. Your KDA may be in absolute tatters, but the pressure alone resulted in a win. How do you measure map pressure on a number scale? \n\nSo your best option is to embrace your teammates and support them right to the end of the game. You're stuck with them til then, so its your choice as to whether you help them to try and win as a team or play for yourself and blame others. Remember, there's ALWAYS something you could have done to win a game, regardless of how well you thought you did. More wards, pinging enemies positions, calling a dragon play, recalling earlier, focusing a different target, peeling instead of diving, etc etc etc. \n\nWork on yourself, play for your team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-10T02:40:48.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-07-10T12:18:56.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've never gained Lp on a loss that my team has a massive part in, thats what i talking about.","replies":[{"poster":"≈Åeader","date":"2016-07-10T22:09:27.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lose the game, you lose LP.
