Along with this in the early game you have to wait a while for the barrels to tick down to the point where they can be exploded with his Q or his auto attacks. This in a sense I think is where the next element of counterplay is. \n\nThere is a good sense of clarity in that you can see the health bar of a GP barrel ticking down, you are able to watch it, and if you are able to auto attack it at the last tick before he is able to activate it, you get the gold from the barrel. \n\nThis is one of the big thing that Riot focuses on, in game clarity, and in GP Barrels I feel like they do a very good job, having the health of the barrels displayed at all times to enemies. If you want to have a bit of a read of what Riot's thoughts on clarity and how I think it applies, here is a copy/paste from this [Dev Blog they did on \"The Design Values of League of Legends\"\n](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/dev-blog-design-values-league-legends)\n\n> Players should fight their opponents, not the game. We strive to present information in a clear and precise way so that League can be about dominating opponents with skill and teamwork – not through bookkeeping hidden information.\nClarity means we want distinct, transparent mechanics in everything we design. When the outcome of a game hinges on a player’s ability to quickly assess the situation, information needs to be clear and accessible. This doesn't mean we tell players the best play to make, but we should make sure they have the right info to make calls as best they can.\n\n---\n\nNow the other thing to note is phantom barrelling which is an advanced GP technique that a lot of players have started using to better use their barrels. This lets him play around fog of war more to hit the barrels and for them to come out faster. However in a sense though, this encourages what players should already be doing against a lot of champions in the game. If you were in a sense in a position to get hit by a phantom barrel, there are a lot of champions that could possibly be able to grab you or CC you in the same position that you are. Meaning that you have to play around vision around the map, and ward in the locations that are currently contested, which is a mechanic that all players should learn how to do.\n\nI hope that this helps, if there are any other questions I can answer or anyway I can lend a hand let me know, and good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-01-03T09:03:32.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gp hits like baby ram compared to release","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-03T09:22:06.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:201}}: Like baby ram!
