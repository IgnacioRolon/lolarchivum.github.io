If there's one thing Chinese people like more than winning, is appearing above one another, whether that's by shittalking the other person for 70% of the game time.\n\nLast night I had a game where my Jarvan IV and Katarina started to argue in Chinese pin yin, since my parents are from Taiwan, I can read and understand everything, but since I'm born here in New Zealand, my main language is still English. They argued from around 15 minutes in all the way non-stop to the end of the game. Neither would listen to me telling them to play the game, and neither actually would play since they're just standing under turret arguing at each other. What was worse, was that Blitzcrank also got involved.....Vayne and I were the only native English speakers in our team. So basically they lost the game just because they wanted to be better than one another. Eventually we ended the game where I was perhaps level 13 or 14, and Jarvan was still level 9 since all he's been doing is stand around arguing.\n\nTo address some previous arguments, I was playing at 9:30pm New Zealand time which isn't late at all, and yes, plenty of Chinese/Asians have better english skills as their second language, but typically not League players who typically are International students who just game all day and all night since they're away from their parents. Of course I am making assumptions, but most of these assumptions are realistic and do exist, unfortunately very prominently in my school >__>\n\nI do understand that my rant is focused around Chinese and not Asians overall, but I do believe Chinese people do stand the majority of the 'Asian people' on the OCE server.\n\nI'm open to debate and criticism since I understand a ton of what I said can be offensive and/or subjective.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-09-09T04:53:49.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fine with broken english, but when they straight up play like they are the only on on the team, and refuse to listen, thats what get salty.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-09T06:14:37.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So every single time? xD\n\nI've like never come across someone who's a proper player who has broken english, which ever filters the majority out first anyway","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2016-08-29T00:33:36.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there are a bunch of asian servers (korea china japan south east asia), the asian you see in oce either live in australia/nz or indonesia/surrounding area","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-28T23:33:35.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Broken English from someone whose first language is one other than English is understandable.\nWhat is OP's excuse?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-09-09T08:58:31.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a no asian Australia?
