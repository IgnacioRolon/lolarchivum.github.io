With that in mind a diff of 100 is relatively meaningless.\n\nSecond note is that the Silver 1 has a 59% win rate, so more than likely his true mmr is higher than indicated by his rank. This is especially true in any div 1 because players are gated by that 5 game series, so are much more likely to have a high mmr without actually going up a rank.\n\nThird, that unranked player is now Gold with only a few games of ranked played, so seems likely he deserves to be there no?\n\nYour mmr is likely higher than your rank as well. Easiest way to tell that one is by how much LP you are gaining/losing.\n\nThe rest of the players match up pretty nicely. There isn't a huge skill variance between G4-G2, and both teams have a P5 player. I didn't look super deep, but with just a brief glance and one op.gg search on the unranked, this looks like a perfectly reasonable matchup to me.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-11-24T11:49:38.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You say that, btu you didnt have him trying to push down bot outer turret while we were losing our inhib one.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-24T15:16:17.454+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not really sure who you are referring to, but I think that comes down to a tactical disagreement. Likely he felt you would lose the inhib turret whether he was there or not, so he should try to get something/anything in return. That's usually the case anyway. Did he make the right decision? Probably not given you lost, but that doesn't make it an invalid one, even if it is frustrating.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Gerk","date":"2016-11-24T16:07:01.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"op.gg doesn't always show the current placement of champs, you have to refresh each one sometimes.
