The Q counts as an auto and multiplies with crit, if they made it like Ezreal/ Nasus, as in the tumble can't crit but just adds flat damage on her auto, I think she would be decently balanced. Right now though, you may as well just flex queue and ban her. Fizz, and Rengar, are also both problems. I think I have the most problem with the latter two to be honest. They took Fizz' hidden power on his W and turned it into burst, giving him that plus an almost unavoidable ultimate and insane utility on his E, it's really unhealthy for the game. Just the fact that Rengar has such high base stats along with insane bonus AD on his passive and a 30 second ult level 16... Jesus. He's just overloaded right now. \n\nTLDR; Make Vayne's tumble additive damage like Nasus' Q, give Fizz more counterplay MECHANICS (apart from pushing him into turret early, because doing that in solo queue is suicide), and nerf Rengar's scaling, passive, or base AD, and reduce the time he has in ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DonkeyWhisperer","date":"2016-11-19T03:08:01.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds like a new player issue cause vayne is quite easy to deal with, just cause some1 tends you own you doesnt mean they are op, they are just better at the game then you and know the champ and game better. you could get a full ap raka and kill some people and have a wicked score and people will be like omg thats so broken needs nerf,\nwhen you play more games eventually you learn how to deal with it in your case vaynes, vaynes are espically weak early thus why vaynes late game is quite strong as opposed to most champs.\nthe 1 tip i will give you about vayne...she can get bullied quite easily earlier as most of the time as she deals not so much dmg early and generally vaynes struggle even late if they fall behind early\nthats my advice","replies":[{"poster":"Clockw0rkk","date":"2016-11-19T03:27:57.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree. As a Vayne player myself, the issues i find are..\nGetting ganked pre 6 by enemy jungler, if you face a vayne, get JG to camp her, zone her off farm, poke her immensely and make her back.\nThe stealth is only 1 second so she isnt going far.. Focus her in team fights ALWAYS and CC lock her to the ground. If she tumbles forward into the fight, jump on her.\nYou can still have assassins who easily 1 shot her too.. new Rengar to name one! \nTheres a reason why you dont see her at worlds or LCS, so therefore she aint that broken!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krispy Kreme","date":"2016-11-19T02:57:18.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vayne is a high skill based champion early game and majority of the rest, in higher elo's you must be able to perform well and come out on top of your enemy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-18T10:07:51.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what is a tanks hp bar?","replies":[]}]}
