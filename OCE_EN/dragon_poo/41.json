Sometimes people find out AFTER they start a game, which is troubling for allll parties..\n2. riot banning people for 2 weeks over a few leaves, does not work for their system... each game consumes around 30 average in-game time, and maybe 10minutes of queue/loading (longer depending on circumstance) even the smallest disturbance can ruin this.. most people cannot remove all real-life distractions and just play league of legends...\n\nyes it's frustrating, but sometimes it happens, even me, someone who leaves 1.5hours of free time, during a ranked, has been forced to leave mid-way due to circumstance.. it sucks.\n\n3. there is no way to properly discern true-leavers from accidental-leavers... it's impossible unless the person says otherwise... \n\nfor instance.. someone joins a game, it's 6-0 against their team, they have died twice, and are not getting helped by the person. They then say \"omg gotta go, something just happened, sorry\". \n\nTruth? or Lie? would it matter if his team was winning? if they were equal? if he said nothing? \n\nWhat if his parents just got into a car accident and were just rushed to hospital? are you going to ban this person because of that? \n\nThis issue was raised LOOOOONG ago in league of legends. The basic idea to come out of it is: If someone is a frequent leaver, give warnings, issue short-bans, or queue-related bans.\n\nif the person is NOT a frequent leaver, some leniency is given.\n\nTo put it into retrospect. if i say beforehand \"i need to leave soon, can we make this a fast game\". There are 3 main things that will happen 1. Team rushes and loses, 2. team rushes and wins, 3. team doesn't rush, person has to leave mid-way.\n\n2/3 of those circumstances are bad, however only 1 should be resulted in a ban IMO, as again... people sometimes need to leave, it's impossible to account for all disruptions.\n\nAND before this chat gets out of hand, i'll say it simply:\n\n1. i do not play ranked (or even blindpick) unless i have ATLEAST 1.5hours to spare, uninterrupted.\n2. I usually play ARAM if i have less time (or just mess around in practice tool). \n3. i don't even remember the last time i left a game due to time restrictions, it doesn't happen to me at all.\n\ntl;dr: it's a hard thing to stop, a lot of issues come out of banning people with time restrictions, for a game that can take anywhere from 15-60minutes, it's a little hard for the general populous to keep perfect uninterrupted time. People have lives... the world is unpredictable, even if you think you have 8hours interrupted... you may get interrupted for a random reason within the first 20minutes.. they can't ban every single person this happens to, otherwise they wouldn't have ANY playerbase.. (Also let's not forget this is OCE, the playerbase is small enough as it is.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-07-12T13:05:29.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. If they want a \"quick game\" then go play vs bots. Putting your team under unnecessary pressure before the game begins which may or may not be based on team composition is not going to help morale.","replies":[]}]}
