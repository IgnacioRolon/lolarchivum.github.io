Bringing the **total to 60%**. And then you can have a **Last Whisper **or the upgrades which are **Lord Dominik&#039;s Regards** and **Mortal Reminder** which adds another 45% Armor Penetration. Bringing the new Grand Total to 105% Armor Penetration.\r\n\r\n**Summary**: Garen&#039;s &#039;E&#039; + The Black Cleaver + Last Whisper (or Upgrades of)\r\n                = **30%** Penetration +** 30%** Penetration + **45%** penetration\r\n                =**105%** Armor Penetration\r\n                = **True Damage **???????\r\n\r\n**Situation 2**:{{champion:157}} Yasuo: Ok so **Yasuo** is sorta the same but he **only needs 1 item** and **1 mastery** along with his **&#039;R&#039; Last Breath**. Ok so **Yasuo&#039;s &#039;R&#039; Last Breath** has a **passive function** upon activation that **grants him 50% Armor Penetration** for a set time. **The item** he needs is again **Last Whisper (or Upgrades of)** which add another **45% Armor Penetration** bringing the **total to 95%**. The **last thing** is the **mastery** which is **Battering Blows** a tier 5 mastery in the Ferocity mastery skill tree which adds another** 7% Armor Penetration** bringing the **Grand Total to 102% Armor Penetration**.\r\n\r\n**Summary**: Yasuo&#039;s &#039;R&#039; + Last Whisper (or Upgrades of) + Battering Blows (Mastery)\r\n                          = **50%** Penetration + **45%** Penetration + **7% **Penetration\r\n                          = **102%** Armor Penetration\r\n                          = **True Damage** ?????????\r\n\r\nThank you to all the people who take the time to read this, I welcome all feedback and ideas on why this may not be counted as true damage and on why the damage pop-up should or should not be displayed as True Damage. I would love some answers {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
