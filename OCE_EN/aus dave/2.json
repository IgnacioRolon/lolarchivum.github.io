How does riot possibly think it is fair that just because you are in promos means u cannot dodge? How do you figure that if i can already tell my team is flaming each other or we have a whole bunch of terrible trolled picks that i must play the game knowing full well 90% of the time, we will lose.\r\n\r\nJust seems that you can put so much time and effort into these games and really get beaten down on a personal level by the strain the game has.\r\nJust some food for thought \r\nAus Dave","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-11-05T23:15:26.749+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"league of legends is that, a game.
