Dynamic queue/full team","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im currently Bronze 1 and attempting to climb unlike previous seasons where ive given up on ranked. Im not the greatest obviously but im looking for players to play with. Id like to find a full team to play with as 5 man queue is the most fun (not necessarily looking for specific players for roles, but rather 5 players where we can switch it up). \r\n\r\nAnother few players duo/triple/quad queue with would be fun also. I mostly play adc (Ez, lucian, trist), support( janna, leona) and Jungle (reksai) in ranked because they are my favorite, but I can play other champs and roles. I prefer to use comms especially in 5 man and prefer skype but have teamspeak. Leave a message here first then send me invite if your interested. I usually play 7-9pm weeknights and sometimes 4-7. Weekends aswell. \r\n\r\n:)","replies":[{"poster":"GrimCobra","date":"2016-02-11T15:25:41.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi i main supp and top, Main champs Sej @ Zac but can play any support. but thresh and karma, am bronz 4 due to rubbish mmr but im decent or better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZTKPWN","date":"2016-02-03T07:45:58.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate Jungler main also bronze 1 feel free to add me ztkpwn, I main nidalee ( and am good with poppy, gragas, shyvanna, and lee)","replies":[]}]}
