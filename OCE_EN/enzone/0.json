I am bronze 1 ADC main (was silver 3 at the end of pre-season). I only recently got back into league after a long break. I&#039;m looking for any role who can just win lane and peel for me in team-fights.  I&#039;m not gonna lie and tell you that i&#039;m amazing and my team is always shit, because that&#039;s not true I understand that if you&#039;re good enough to get out of lower elo, you will. I currently do coaching sessions with a diamond 5 adc main and i&#039;m trying to improve as much as possible while focusing on school and a part time job. If you are interested please let me know by posting here or adding me on LoL. My ingame name is Enzone.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Fire Flareon","date":"2015-05-05T05:56:02.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey im bronze 2 support i main sona but can also play lulu or soraka  and im looking for someone to duo que with myself \nIGN Fire Flareon","replies":[]},{"poster":"BeyondPlay","date":"2015-05-05T04:33:33.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm a bronze 2 hardcore troll add me for fun games xD I can play seriously if you want though.
