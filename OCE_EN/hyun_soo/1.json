I understand that it is partly my fault and that some of the calls I make in game aren't up to par of a Gold/Plat Elo however I am willing to learn and am always looking to improve. I like to pride myself on the fact that I don't rage/slander people for making silly mistakes as I know this is part of the game however am looking to climb Elo's this season and am looking for more serious players to play with. Add IGN to play.","replies":[{"poster":"SleazzyJefff","date":"2015-03-05T07:19:58.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI have a similar thread. Add me - Dr Pill Popper.\n\nI like your attitude. Most people in this bronze hell, don't usually accept that they made  a bad call or misplayed some battles. That is the most important step to getting better imo. \n\nI'm b2, was s5 last season. Lets jam some games!","replies":[]}]}
