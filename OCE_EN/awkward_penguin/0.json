Eventually people get to level 30 and decide to play ranked with that idea in their head. They then cause everybody heartache because they play ADC's and APC and decide to go to the frontline to kill the enemy adc/apc. People need to stop spreading this shit as only the assassin class or maybe the bruisers should be killing the enemy adc/apc. you freaking job as a support is to peel for your team aka adc / apc not to disregard your adc/apc and go try to cc theirs.","replies":[{"poster":"BOBBERT","date":"2015-01-27T13:35:46.988+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze lyfe","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-01-27T21:11:06.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvoted because Anivia is my favourite champ.
