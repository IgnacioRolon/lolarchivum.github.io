So you mean every single player has to change their DNS?\n\nEveryi was raging so funny. \n\nStop blaming every single user bro. \n\nAfter I restarted the client, the game was not there anymore, so I guess we maged to not play the game.\n\nThe funny thing is \"This all happened when I warned my team that I might disconnect\" LOL. And they all got lagged out to.\n\nBut man, I do love League, but these servers issues giving us all a bad time you know :( . My holiday time too.

But this one looked like it could be solved. After all, not 100% people are lagging, just a very large number. Just because some people are lagging, it doesn't make sense for those who aren't to not be permitted to play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
