Although this is extremely small compared to other servers, (EUW = 2.4m, NA = 1.7m) it is still a decent number of players. \r\nWe actually have a higher percentage of players compared to the total population than NA. Ours is 0.0061 (Quick calculations, not extremely accurate as it only includes AUS and NZ), NA is roughly 0.0053. \r\n\r\nSo basically my question is what server population are we looking at before we get more game-modes, specifically normal draft. I know every time this is brought up the answer is just &quot;not possible at this time&quot;. But is there a set number that would make this a viable option? I&#039;m interested in a specific number or time frame. RIOT has been under blast recently for transparency issues namely on reddit, I think it would really make a lot of people on OCE really happy to not be left in the dark as this is a very important topic.\r\n\r\nThanks, hoping for a Red post to weigh in.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-06-30T05:19:20.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact that we have a higher percentage of our population playing is cool, but unfortunately not the number we need.\n\nWe need recurring players to get queue times to a decent level across game modes and maps.\n\n10% of 1 million is still less than 5% of 5 million, and that's just the unfortunate part of being a low populus region.","replies":[{"poster":"Lemewinks","date":"2015-06-30T06:01:31.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely agree, that percentage was just thrown in there. \n\nAs i said, i'm looking for a response with a player count that would be necessary to sustain those game modes.\n\nEdit: I may have been a bit ambiguous. I assume Riot has a milestone that the player count would have to reach for them to \"safely\" add other game modes. I'm looking for a statement with a number or at least some sort of time frame if it's even in sight.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-30T06:06:49.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of it this way:\nCurrently Teambuilder has queues as long as half an hour, just to find a team, and ARAM can have queues up to 20 minutes at times.

I fully understand the situation and why they have not added a game mode.\n\nI am simply asking what population of active players is required. The fact that all they say is \"not now\" is the issue for me and i'm sure a lot of players. If they were to educate us on something of more detail than \"not possible at the moment\" than they would be informing us as they said they would multiple times after not doing so in the past.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-06-30T06:55:40.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=gA58YU5v,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-06-30T06:06:49.082+0000)\n>\n> Think of it this way:\n> Currently Teambuilder has queues as long as half an hour, just to find a team, and ARAM can have queues up to 20 minutes at times.
