We don&#039;t need to burn couches to keep warm). \r\n\r\nVUW Esports events are currently organised through the Victoria Engineering Club (name aside, we do everything, not just engineering stuff). We organise stuff through our facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/VictoriaEngineeringClub). If you&#039;re in a team, or want to join a team, hit us up - we host team creation events, online competitions and LAN events for LoL players on an approximately consistent basis.","replies":[{"poster":"Vaapad","date":"2015-07-22T03:58:56.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, my old Uni\n\nBest of luck fellas","replies":[]}]}
