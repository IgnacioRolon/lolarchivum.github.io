(Gurren lagan Kindred/Rumble/Fizz and Shyv help prove this point xD) \r\n\r\nAnd this research while targeted at Anime, will almost certainly be able to be applied to Lol as well in order to help any future live-action films that may or may not take place. \r\n\r\nThanks :) and feel free to a sky any questions or offer any ideas you have, below :)\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:**\r\n_I made a survey about improving Anime live-action films, please fill it out if you can.
