BUT if you still go that position anyway just to spite them, its YOU who ruined the game, and are worse than horrible.\r\nThe instalocker ruins the game for you, but if you go that position as well, you ruin it for yourself and 3 others too. \r\n\r\n\r\nPS. The instalock button has no use anyway, literally its only use is that you can start the game 20 seconds earlier and only if EVERYONE on both teams do it and that never happens, (pretty sure the last time that happened for me was a year and a half ago) So ask yourself RIOT, is that 20 seconds every year and a half, really worth the rage and idiocy that happens every 3rd game or so?","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-07T05:29:00.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait I just actually looked at OPs picture and name you disgust me degenerate","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-07T04:26:54.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope, Nope, not at all. Riot doesn't care if you instalock and lane steal in normals, never will.\n\nIf I call mid first, I'm going mid. I don't care if they are \"scum\" for stealing my lane, I'm playing the game, and I'm playing for fun. If they go duo mid, whatever. If they intent feed, whatever. If they flame all game, whatever. Couldn't really care. Doesn't make me \"worse than scum\", it means I called a lane and am entitled to that position. \n\nI would be \"worse than scum\", if I decided to intent feed, flame, or stole jungle or top or something after they took mid. I am not obligated to fill, or, (most likely) support just because people can't handle team games. The only time I ever give up a lane that I called is if someone wants to try a rework, new champion, new skin in some cases, but not when they are just stuck up Zed mains or something. Because many people let me have a role if I try out new things, so it's fair. \n\nBut you know who doesn't deserve my role?\n#Instacockers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-07T04:26:04.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spiting people is the highest thing on my list tho","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-05-07T03:09:26.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were supposed to have Normal Blind pick replaced with Normal Dynamic queue.\n\nBut it looks like Rito lied and refuses to tell us any more on the matter.
