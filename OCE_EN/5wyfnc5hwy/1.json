The change to the AP items did hurt AP mage and AP assassin but it in no way affected the AP mid meta, just because a lot more AD assassin get play doesn't mean AD champs are stronger. After reading your post, I feel like it's partly your fault for losing the game not just your team mate, and before you come up w/ the \"I'm not the only one on this team argument\" . This meta consist of a more snowbally effect, you can essentially snowball your whole team by snowballing yourself and killing the enemy team in repetition . A lot of people can single handedly carry a team, you are just one of the people who think \"I'm the best\" and not try to see your error.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-12-04T04:02:49.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I felt this way. Last patch though.
