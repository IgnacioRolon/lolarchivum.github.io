For Example just from being trolled by him so much I know that he plays Fiora or Garen top lane when he trolls, he takes Tp to speed up the feeding and wont buy a single item until late game where he may start attacking the enemy while feeding. \n\nHe starts every game with a spam of something along the lines of \"My Name is WeHateAsians and i will troll if everyone doesn't say the word penis 1/5\" He will change this as time goes on such as recently he has added that he is from perth Australia in message each time. If all 5 people dont say penis he will troll the game. He often does this effortlessly and plays games such as Final Fantasy while his character seems to feed on a Macro. \n\nIn short the guy doesn't feel any strain by doing this or any enjoyment since hes not even playing any attention while feeding, he just does it because he can and its been like this for months now with everyone taking every chance they can to report him. \n\npls riot can you do something about this guy\n\nSimply looking at his profile verifies everything ive said http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=WeHateAsians","replies":[]},{"poster":"YouAreDead","date":"2015-05-04T15:04:25.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot staff are paid to work but apparently they are paid to rest.\nCan't see any positive outcome regarding the elimination of intentionally troll trash or mentally retarded players in this game.\nOnly advice is start over a new account and play ranked seriously, although silver and gold are full of trash and trolls as well, the situation is not as bad as in bronze","replies":[]}]}
