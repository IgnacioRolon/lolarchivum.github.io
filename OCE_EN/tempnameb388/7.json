While you can get free skins from Riot, that is under condition (they're mystery gift rewards for good behaviour in-game that come at random times, only happened twice so far to my knowledge). There are skin codes but, as has been mentioned By GoldenTomat0, HH Cait has not been available through codes. It's more than likely just a gift, probably a mystery gift, from someone, *possibly* a Rioter. If that was the case it would have been as an individual, not as a Rioter, as Red Arrow stated. They *might* have also just asked Riot for a little extra RP to be able to afford the skin and just passed it off as the skin being a gift from Riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-14T22:21:43.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can get skin codes from PAX if i remember correctly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-03-14T15:24:22.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the off chance that a Rioter did this, it would have been as an Individual not a Rioter and it would have been paid for out of their own pocket not actually for free.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-03-14T14:01:59.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think your friend is lying you can get skins from codes though at special events like pax","replies":[]}]}
