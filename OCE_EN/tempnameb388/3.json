If you live in Europe you may notice that the amount of Riot Points we give you for the same price may vary by payment method.  Using a credit card, 5 Euros may get you more Riot Points than using an SMS.\r\n\r\nWe put a lot of thought into the decision to have different pricing by payment type.  After all, either way you are giving up 5 Euros (or Dollars, Pounds, etc), why wouldn&#039;t you get the same Riot Points either way?  We have deals with different companies to provide different payments.  They actually all take a cut of the Euros you pay, but the amount they take is different (it&#039;s actually different by country too).  We could have given out Riot Points equally across payment methods by using an average of the different payout percentages, but we didn&#039;t want to penalize and raise prices on our &quot;cheapest&quot; forms of payment, credit cards and PayPal.  It also made sense for us to encourage players to use those &quot;cheaper&quot; forms of payment, since we get a larger share of the money you spend.\r\n\r\nSo what we do is, when a payment type is less expensive for us, we pass that benefit on to you in the form of more Riot Points.  You get more Riot Points per Euro when we get a higher share of the amount of Euros you pay.\r\n\r\nBecause the payouts vary by country (because the deals we have vary by country, especially with SMS payments where different countries have different wireless companies), and they vary by time (with currency fluctuations, and when a better deal is negotiated), it&#039;s not a simple task to list all your options.  The best way to find the current prices is to go to the store in League of Legends.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps explain why we have different prices for different payment methods and countries.)\r\n^^^^^^^^^^\r\nread it if u want \r\nbut im just saying if i wantd to get a 1350 skin which they all seem to be i now have to spend 15 dollars instead of just geting 10 dollars worth which i think it should be plus im sure amping it up like 190 rp isnt that hard i just dont want to spend excess money \r\nsoooooooooooooooo could u raise thr RP please \r\nbtw ily riot even if u r cheap {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-18T00:00:36.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow. Went to all that effort to quote such a large chunk of text and it isn't even relevant to your point. That's talking about different payment methods, such as Credit Card compared to Phone Data, not about the difference in cost (***across all payment methods***) between regions.\n\nThe entire reason OCE has a lower rate of RP per $ is because the AUD dropped significantly compared to the USD several months ago, and the reason it hasn't gone back up yet is because there's been negligible change. If the AUD were to increase to be equivalent to, say, 95 US cents, and it was a long term trend, then Riot would give us more RP for our money.\n\nYou can find out all the details here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/MXv9uHnL-rp-adjustment-in-oceania\n\nTLDR: Riot isn't just going to increase the amount of RP we get for our money just because we ask, it all comes down to exchange rate compared to USD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-19T10:28:58.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree \nMONEY ABUSE\nSIVIR MAYBE THE BOSS OF RITO\n{{champion:15}}","replies":[]}]}
