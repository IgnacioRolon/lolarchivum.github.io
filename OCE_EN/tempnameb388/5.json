Weak to pre-6 invades and can't really gank but if they don't end quick, you will solo carry.\n\n{{champion:117}} with the recent buffs, can jungle, good counterganks, kinda slow clear.\n\n{{champion:25}} good ganks, bad early clear, good later clear, good cc and devastating in choke point fights.\n\n{{champion:27}} you piss off the enemy jungler and you are basically singed without having to worry about your toplane tower. Good ganks though.\n\n{{champion:17}} used to be more viable as a jungler, good map control, preferably you want to go for a atk speed dps build not full ap, ganks are ok, can invade pretty well and the fact that you don't have a lane makes your bush ambushes much more terrifying.\n\n{{champion:83}} good sustain, nice invades, crappy ganks since you lack burst or cc, very off meta though.\n\n{{champion:143}} it works I guess it's kinda boring but eh.\n\n{{champion:30}}  good early clear speed, ridiculous clear once he gets started, poor early sustain, surprisingly hard to gank with pre-rylias, ult is good map pressure tool. a nuisance in teamfights.\n\n{{champion:43}} go offtank ap, you have good ganks, slow clear, decent sustain, good invades.\n\n{{champion:20}}  this guy is a true jungler and always has been but he's not really relevant in the meta and is rarely seen, very tanky, great invades (necessary, you have to do this as nunu to be a decent pick), good counterganks, okay ganks, ridiculous sustain and lvl4 drake is pretty easy to rush, horrible dueling power, devastating ult when fully charged even with 0 ap but easily interupted, his atkspeed/movespeed buff makes him really effective at taking towers after ganking.\n\n{{champion:92}} basically riven in the jungle which if she knows what she's doing can be terrifying, harder to play than regular riven but can carry even harder than a toplane one.\n\n{{champion:240}} toplaner but I've seen some terrifying jungle kled recently, weak to invades but ganks are really strong, good at invading oddly enough and has ok sustain though he does lose his skarl alot making him vulnerable sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"tempnameB388","date":"2016-08-17T13:21:13.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for the long comment ima try karthus{{champion:30}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"veo","date":"2016-08-14T13:35:47.419+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just click random when in champ select.
