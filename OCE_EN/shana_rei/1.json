We lose early, mid and late game as everyone but myself (support) and the adc (ashe) feed constantly. \r\n\r\nBut lo and behold. Nobody raging at the jungler, nobody spamming /ff. Nobody AFK&#039;s. Nobody builds tears. Nobody starts feeding even more. Nobody says anything at all.\r\n\r\nInstead the most amazing thing happens. We stayed to the very end. I&#039;m talking we lost 8 inhibitors and every turret we had. Twice. TWICE we have all 3 inhibs down in our own base while the enemy team try and get in with baron. Twice we shove them out. My team scouts out and even though I am completely hesitant to leave the adc alone out in the wild I have to stay in the base, shoving what lanes I can and making sure the rengar doesn&#039;t sneak in, or the TF doesn&#039;t ult in for an easy backdoor.\r\n\r\nIn the end. Through all the most insane picks and plays. We won it. We took only 2 inhibs that game but god damn was it a game to remember.\r\n\r\nIt is on Replays.GG if anyone cares for a watch.\r\n\r\nTo the 4 randoms on my team. Cheers for not giving up!!\r\n\r\n*Also.
