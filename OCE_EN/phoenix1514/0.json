However, the prestige tokens feel a bit, how do I put it, expensive.  I just think they need to be slightly cheaper or maybe create a way you can grind out tokens with a pass or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2019-02-21T03:24:34.674+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to hard pass on the prestige points. \nI agree that they need to come up with more ways to get the prestige points other than \"buy chest packages and we will give you a small number of points\". They did say with their[ initial PP announcement](https://eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/prestige-points-and-new-prestige-edition-skins) that they were looking at hopefully finding new ways to give out the points in the future, hopefully making them slightly more attainable for most of us who don't want to spend $100+ on a skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-02-20T21:28:33.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but that's their point, skill grind, not normal grind grind. I don't even upgrade mine, why would you want your opponents to know you're good at the champ they're facing, that's like saying \"Hey, watch out for me!\"","replies":[{"poster":"RozettaRose","date":"2019-03-29T02:29:51.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean yeah. To earn the skins you should have to do something to grind for it. anyone I see with a KDA Ahri Prestige skin I think they probably aren't that good and prob spent $100+ the moment the skin came out.","replies":[]}]}]}
