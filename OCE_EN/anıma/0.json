I couldn&#039;t even change my masteries in champ select because it was too laggy and I had a couple of minutes to do it. Now, I usually didn&#039;t care about this as I reported it to riot and just used old client, but I&#039;m forced to use this. The lag this client is giving me makes this game almost unplayable. \r\n\r\nOn the old client it was super fast and no problems, but as soon as I try to use the new one it goes down the shitter. \r\n\r\nThe only real option I have is to try to stop playing this game at this point due to me not being able to accept most queues and not even being able to change masteries. In game it&#039;s fine just out of it is a mess. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not one for complaining especially on boards but a lot of my friends are getting this too and the fact I&#039;m now forced to play with this turns me off playing in general.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-11-11T04:20:10.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nSorry to hear you are having issues on the updated client.

From a 45 ms to a 6k ms in every click once I played in normal game, but the thing is it doesn't do it in Coop vs Ai. Plus, I've checked my internet server which is kind of weird to say that its in its 100% but why is it a problem for me that this thing is happening? Its been bugging me ever since the preseason came out. Bare with me that I was really looking forward with the  new update but when I stumbled upon this bug or whatever you call it was a disappointment. Hopefully it will be fixed soon before the actual season 7 comes out .\n {{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}(-P.S. I haven't played normal game since today its been 4 days and It's still like that...
