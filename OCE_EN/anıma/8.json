I am quite positive and don&#039;t tend to rage. I&#039;ve played in competitive teams before.\r\nI main Tristana/Vayne/Miss Fortune but can play most others.\r\nI&#039;d prefer a high elo team but it&#039;s not a complete necessity. \r\nIf it&#039;s a problem for any teams I&#039;m 15 years old. \r\nIf you want to trial me or something that&#039;s cool, just add DeathGod64. I&#039;m on all day everyday so I should respond quickly unless I&#039;m watching something on YouTube/Twitch ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"TA Vespik","date":"2015-12-06T11:26:08.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey i added you and if your interested this is our twitter: https://twitter.com/TrueAmBitionGG\nReply if interested","replies":[]}]}
