I dodged for the first time today an aram game and got a 15 minute timer straight away, I&#039;m not mad just kind of confused. Doesn&#039;t it usually go like 4, 8, 15, 30 etc?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-22T06:06:31.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's generally daily but,  as to how they calculate daily I'm not sure. It could be 24 hours from the dodge, or it could be 24 hours from the end of your next game or it could be something entirely different. Also it's just 5, 10, 15, 30 as far as I know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TitusBlackwell","date":"2017-05-22T06:05:36.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAM has harsher dodge penalties because it sort of defeats the whole point of 'random' if people keep dodging when they don't like their pick :)\n\nList of all the dodge penalties and their timers: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751844-Queue-Dodging","replies":[]}]}
