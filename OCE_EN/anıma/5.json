I am 15 and have been playing since Season 3. I used to main adc but I started not performing very well so I decided to try other roles and I really liked mid so I started maining it. I mainly play mages but do know how to play assassins/fighters as well I&#039;m just not as comfortable on them. I also really like things like Corki, Varus etc. I have very good mechanics for the most part and have great game knowledge but the one thing I don&#039;t do the best is decision making which is what I&#039;m working on atm. \r\nI&#039;ve played on a couple of semi-competitive/competitive teams in the past. I played on a team called Enclave which managed to get diamond in the 5s ladder and went for OCS. I also played on an NZGC team where we got 4th (I think). I&#039;ve also played on others but they were mainly troll/inactive ones. I am online most of the time and I can play from 3pm - 12am+ (can adjust if need be) on weekdays and for a long time on weekends (9am-1am)  haha :P. If anyone wants to trial me or anything just add me on LoL. My IGN is Ryuku","replies":[{"poster":"bluz0r","date":"2016-02-25T13:49:52.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is legit!
