I'm just looking for a fun/semi serious team to play with. I can usually play from 3pm-10pm New Zealand time and I'm always on. I have skype, curse voice, teamspeak etc. \r\nJungle champs I play: Lee Sin, Jarvan IV, Rengar and recently Nidalee. I can play more like Elise but I tend to prefer those 4 over them. \r\nAdc champs I play: Graves, Lucian, Corki, Vayne, Caitlyn, Jinx, Sivir, Ezreal, Kalista. I'm good at listening and tend to always work hard, I'm honestly quite quiet in games as I focus a lot and I use a lot of pings. I don't mind what rank team you are, I just want one :P\r\nIMPORTANT: I am 15 and very young which may influence how you feel about me but honestly I don't see a problem with my age but some people might, well thanks for reading. Have a good day! C:","replies":[]}
