I am not toxic and don&#039;t troll, I&#039;ve seen every &quot;getting better at league&quot; video on Youtube and I watch LCS/LCK etc but I just can&#039;t seem to get out of Platinum into Diamond and it bothers me a lot. I **really** want diamond and I&#039;ve been playing League since March 2013 but now that I&#039;ve hit Platinum it seems impossible to get out of it. I have peaked at Platinum 1 where I was versing Diamonds etc and I do say myself I was having an easy time until I just started losing all of my games no matter how well I played and I really don&#039;t know where to go from here. Any tips would be greatly appreciated \r\n*And yes, I have been coached briefly*","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:59:12.452+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2015-04-18T07:16:29.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-12T11:38:34.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2015-04-12T12:16:29.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd rather have \"no life\" than to be going around on a gaming forum being a total douche to people, because that is having no life lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-04-12T15:21:53.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Anıma","date":"2015-04-12T15:33:43.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Riot doesn't ban this guy I've lost all faith in humanity, the perfect example of a toxic troll.
