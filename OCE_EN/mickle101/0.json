Out of curiousity, is there a ban wave going on or something? I am not here to have a rant about being banned, I highly likely deserved it, although riot did not specify the reason, and I haven't played for around a week.\r\n\r\nSo just curious did riot just do a ban wave, or did I actually commit a 'severe violation' of the summoners code that isn't about being toxic...? \r\nP.s. This question is just for an understanding, I'm not here kid on the forum having a rant, because that obviously won't achieve anything.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T05:28:45.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not to my knowledge. But then again, I'm just another player. I wouldn't know anything more.\n\nConsidering that there was recently a patch, maybe that incentivised Riot to do a ban wave?","replies":[{"poster":"mickle101","date":"2015-02-26T05:50:41.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe.. I checked my accounts, 2/5 are banned, so it definitely isn't an ip ban. I've probably just had a bad reputation against my name for a while and it finally came back and hit me on the chin.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-26T09:26:19.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Possibly.\n\nWell, hopefully it won't seem like long. Plus you still got those other accounts.\n\nWait does me helping you mean I'll get banned?\n\n*%%%%*","replies":[{"poster":"mickle101","date":"2015-02-26T09:50:51.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you can't get banned in game for doing anything on the forum, worst case scenario is you get banned from the forum, which would possibly happen for exploiting others information.\n\nHelping people wont get you banned, it's quite the opposite","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T03:47:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, thank you for that. To be honest it doesn't seem like you'd be the type of player who'd get banned for bad attitude or anything.\n\nSo it was because you got the client from an unofficial source. You more you know, I guess. Are you actually able to get the client from the official website now?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"mickle101","date":"2015-02-27T03:23:44.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never mind I found out what the problem was, apparently my installation had a 'zoom hack' installed, which is perhaps the consequence of installing torrented clients, due to the fact that when pressing 'download' on the LoL website it wouldn't work.\n\nWhat's done is done, and its only 2 weeks so I'll manage ;)\nJust gotta figure out what these files are so I don't get banned in future :(","replies":[]}]}
