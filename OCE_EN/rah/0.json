Over the last few months we&rsquo;ve constructed a website platform that awards users points that they can then use to earn skins, RP cards and other goodies. It&rsquo;s still in its new stages and just recently came out of BETA, however we have many ideas that we plan on incorporating over the next few months. \r\n\r\nThe site allows users to sync their league of legends account, the website then tracks your performance in ranked games and awards you points based on your performance. Users can then bid on items in our store with these points. \r\nFor those that are interested, the link is:\r\nwww.generationgaming.com.au","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-25T07:12:48.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Ranked Games and slay your opponent, for every opponent you slay and help slay Thresh will reward 1 GGK\n\nRanked Games and slay your opponent, for every opponent you slay and help slay, Thresh will reward 1 GGK*\n\n\nneeds grammar fix :) We aren't helping to slay thresh... otherwise he can't give us the points","replies":[{"poster":"Rah","date":"2015-08-25T07:50:18.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL.

It was at times difficult navigating around googles adsense policies and other riot api limitations, I do have hopes of registering this in the future though. This is by no means the end result of the website, my friends and I have many ideas and are willing to be very responsive to the community with the suggestions they may have. \nI agree with wins and kills not being specifically related to skill. We do hope to incorporate other means of obtaining points that rewards other variables of skill in the near future.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-25T07:15:25.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should... like hide this site... then less competition for the rewards :P\n\n\nalso, what does the minion kills do?\nDo I get 1 point for every minion I killed :? much points.","replies":[{"poster":"Rah","date":"2015-08-25T07:49:47.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hehe...

Going to dive in and see what it's all about.\n\nPS: Like the look of the site.\n\nUPDATE: Ok, so having successfully synced my account I've noticed a bit of a flaw with how it looks at your statistics. It's based solely on standard Summoners Rift, meaning people who like to play ARAM (such as myself), Twisted Treeline or Crystal Scar (I know, not exactly an issue at this stage) are left at a significant disadvantage. Having rarely played standard SR at all in the past several months, I'm hesitant to input a \"role\" (technically you are referring to \"positions\", just saying) and \"most played champion\" (having played ARAM a lot, there isn't exactly one I could accurately pick...)","replies":[{"poster":"Rah","date":"2015-08-23T06:42:41.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool let me know what you think.\nIf you have any questions feel free to let me know. :)\n\n-\nCurrently our system only awards points for ranked games (both solo and team) on summoners rift. ARAM kills, wins and losses was a factor we decided to leave out when considering what aspects of league should be rewarded points. In regards to role input and most played champion, they are not factors taken into consideration when updating your status for points, thus no hesitation is necessary :) simply choose a champion or position that you are comfortable with. \n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-23T07:29:59.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've explored the site more fully now and feel like I haven't missed anything important. Having said that there are a few things I'd like to say. To keep it clear I'll just add in \"pro\" or \"con\" at the end of each statement.\n\nTo start, I like the design and set up. Obviously it's not the best but, for a website that's recently come out of a beta and is only used by near 150 people, it looks and feels fine to me. (pro)\n\nIn regards to the \"Terms and Conditions\" and \"Privacy Policy\" I feel they are short enough for people to feel like it's not a waste of time to read them while being long enough to cover the base points. The TAC could probably include a little bit on acceptable behaviour (in regards to posting on a persons \"wall\") but, other than that, seems fine. (pro)\n\nSyncing to a league account is easy enough. Input your summoner name, which anyone can find out anyway, the website generates a code which you use as the name of one of your rune pages, which anyone could find out anyway if that had your summoner name, temporarily and you're done. Simple, effective and no need to put the account at any risk. (pro)\n\nTeams seems like a good idea but I'm a little unsure of what the purpose is. Is it strictly for ranked and, if so, why is that not stated somewhere? Is it there for people to use just to find others to play with and, if so, why is there no way to differentiate between the kinds of \"play\" people are looking for? Easy enough to understand how it works, not so much what it's intention is. (con)\n\nNow, a \"big\" issue. Bounty Exchange Point. I understand the concept and I don't have an issue with what you're trying to do but you're basically giving an incentive for people to \"chase kills\" in ranked. Not a good idea. You've given people an hour to get as many as 20 kills/assists, something a lot of people will see and just go \"ok, 20 kills in one game is all I need to do\" and then likely cause a loss, ruining the game for 4+ people, because they were trying to earn those points. My suggestion? Increase the time limit a little, maybe an hour and a half instead so they have enough time for two games meaning less chance of \"kill chasing\". (con)","replies":[{"poster":"Rah","date":"2015-08-23T07:52:10.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much for your input and time. \nIm glad that there are many aspects of the site that are considered positive. \nAs for the bounty exchange point, weve taken your suggestion board. This is a figure that we ourselves were playing around with. Our estimates suggested that an average player will gain about 10 - 15 GGK (total kills + assists per game) per every hour update using the bounty exchange system. By allowing a user to have enough time to play 2 games there is a higher probability that they may have achieved their max point game for that update. We have however increased the time interval to 2 hours ( we'll see how that goes for the time being) \n\nOur intention behind the team function is to allow users to find a team on a casual basis. We havnt stated that it is specifically for ranked as we do not want to restrict the team finder function to simply ranked players. Although looking at it now, I do think that our format may need a bit of revision. \n\nThanks alot for your input :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
