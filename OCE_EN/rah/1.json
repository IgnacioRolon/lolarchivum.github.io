I&rsquo;d like to share a website that a few friends and I have been constructing over the last few months. Our goal was to create a website that would encourage the growth and support available to players in the oceanic scene. As our scene is considerably smaller we based our functions on:\r\n- Rewarding users for their efforts on the rift\r\n- Encouraging players to play more\r\n- Allow users to quickly find team mates and have effective team management functions \r\n\r\nWe recently just got accepted as a RIOT development APP which allows us to make more calls with our API systems, so expect many new functions in the upcoming months!\r\n\r\nCurrently the site allows users to sync their league of legends account (we use a safe verification method using your rune page, we do not ever ask for log in information), the website then rewards points based on your performance in league (we use League API systems to keep track of a players performance). Users can then use these points to obtain RP cards, skins and other goodies in our store. Our store is an auction system that is set in a way that allows new users to still compete over these goodies. \r\n\r\nOur site also has an active dashboard hub that allows as a communication method for all members of the website. Members can utilize this function to find a team or ask questions to our community or just say hi. Our site also contains a range of other functions! \r\n\r\nWe have a lot of new ideas we want to incorporate over the upcoming months and we could really use the communities suggestions/feedback. We understand that they aren&rsquo;t too many items in the store as of this moment, currently all items in the store are fronted by us (poor student life) however we have recently been accepted for Adsense and after overheads we plan on using the excess cash for store items, so please bear with us till then. \r\n\r\nFor all those that are interested! \r\nwww.generationgaming.com.au\r\nThanks so much for your time.","replies":[]}
