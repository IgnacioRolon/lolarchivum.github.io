Autofill exists and makes up on average about 33% of my games (bronze mmr has autofill turned on, which is retarded since autofill is a system meant for challenger to stop the 30 minute queue, not so bronzies can shave 30 seconds off their 2 minute queue then lose to a lux support mid main who built deathcap and self shields)\n3. doesnt mean i play to a plat 5 level as thats only my winrate in bronze, my winrate would go down as i go up in mmr until it stabalises at 50% once im in the mmr i belong in, but it does show that, when im playing that champion at the very least, that i am below the correct mmr for my account.\n\n4: Bonus point: This accounts flex mmr is around gold-plat (yes its flex, yes i got carried there by giving up my role to play support instead then just basically afking free wins) i have experienced what its like to play against a diamond 5 lucian top.\nI did not feed, i lost the match, but did not lose the lane, do i believe i shouldve beaten the diamond lucian? no im bronze, but i did hold my own, i remember thinking to myself the entire match \"if this is what diamond players are actually like mechanics wise why do people revere them so much\" as i went 3/1 in lane.\n\nCould that lucian have been elo boosted? who knows, i dont really care. all i know is, i was able to hold my own against a player who is supposedly in the top 10% of the entire region, meanwhile i cant 1v9 in the bottom 90th percentile. i call bullshit on that, because that just displays the gross inaccuracies of the mmr system in outlier cases.\n\nIf you were the ask the question of where i truly believe i shouldve been? probably somewhere around silver 4, not that much better than where i was but still better, and the winrate supports that theory, because thats only an increase of 2-3 tiers. Ive also played in silver 4 and experienced about a 50% winrate there so i can say honestly that that is likely where i am on an overall skill level, i may be higher than that was cass mechanics who knows, but if i am that just means that im worse than that somewhere else which is equalizing me out there.\n\nif you asked where i think i shouldve been at the very least even if i wasnt at s4? b1 easily, because even within b1 i was able to maintain a positive winrate, so i know im higher than b1 or at the very least in the upper echelons  of that particular skill bracket.\n\n(keeping in mind the account that got ripped was ybr not this one, ybr was b2, i havnt played this account for many moons and do not own cass on this account)","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-03T18:34:52.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So where does it say bronze auto fill is turned up...","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-12-06T04:32:29.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"On =/= Up 50% of the entire playerbase is bronze (silver 5 starts at top 50%) there is no reason to have autofill turned on in quite literally the largest portion of the ladder.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-06T07:23:07.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No but you didn’t answer the question... where does it say bronze auto fill is turned up","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-30T06:23:16.338+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean... if you have an 80% win rate over 200 games, 7 troll teams doesn't lower it to 65%","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-11-30T12:41:42.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes looking at the preseason winrate which only had ~30 games played total.\n\nThe other 180+ games were played in season 6","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-12-06T08:55:58.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play AP Mid'Maw, no problems, easy to carry, do shit tonnes of dmg, win game :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CamoFTW","date":"2017-11-29T10:41:55.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it definitely feels that way to me too.
