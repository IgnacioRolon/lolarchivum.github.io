they are literally card counting in their games.\n\nThey look at the enemy junglers cs and do #quickmath to determine which of their camps are still up so they can predict their gank paths.\n\nI tried it once and got a free red buff and jungler kill out of it, can i do that consistently? no because im not the bloody rainman, but my god is that complicated.\n\nSo complicated in fact, that the vast majority of this playerbase is not capable of doing it, hell the only reason i could even try it out once is because im literally a maths undergraduate so i can do #quickmaths in my head.\n\n So if you want a reason as to why i get so damn frustrated with league players?\n\nIts because im average, maybe a little tiny bit better than average, but still average.\n\nAnd despite being average i can pull off akali w hops that are thought of as impossible, fast q combos without thinking of them, solo rift herald with my eyes closed on every champion in the game (hes actually really easy to solo you just walk behind him when hes charging his slam and auto his back, gg 12 minute rift herald solo on every champion in the game).\n\nStuff the people around me cant do, and if they try to do they fumble and do it clumsily.\n\nBasically im someone who can quite literally say.\n\n\"God im surrounded by idiots\"\n\nAnd let me tell you, its fucking hell, theres nothing more soul crushing than being the smartest person in a room.\n\nBecause you want to know a secret from such a smart person?\n\nWe dont take pride in it, we dont think its a good thing.\n\nBecause if were the smartest person in the room, that means that everyone else is average or below average intelligence.\n\nWhen i walk into a room and see people actively trying to solve problems that i can do on a whim i dont think \"boy im so blessed to have the ability to think this quickly\"\n\nI think \"oh god humanity is doomed\"\n\nIn that respect, maybe youre right that i dont have people skills when it comes to dealing with below average intelligence people, because my method for not being consistently angry at stupid people, is to actively avoid them (something i cant do in league, go figure). but everything else you were wrong about.\n\nOh and before you say \"well if the problem is you find stupid people aggravating why dont you get this angry at other matchmaking based games like dota\" simple, theres a higher concentration of tards playing league than in any other game.\n\nI can play 20 games of dota 2 and theres a pretty solid chance that in all 20 games the players wont be jaw droppingly stupid.\n\nI can play 20 games of league and i 100% guarantee you atleast one player will have been an extra in the movie idiocracy.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-03-07T01:03:15.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can i get a tl;dr?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-03-07T00:42:08.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*cough* im currently playing on a gold account right now *cough*\n\nYeah i cant get out of bronze 5 because im b5, totaaaaalllllllllly the case.\n\n\"Being good in WOW pvp dont mean you are gonna be good in league.
