bitter and toxic, in turn  people that come across me will eventually be made toxic through constant exposure to my own toxicity.\n\nThe cycle of toxicity.\n\nAka the reason if riot wants to stop toxicity from happening they need to take a zero tolerance stance on it, not this slap on the wrist until youve made the lives of hundreds of people objectively worse bullshit that they do

games i played today i had players being toxic to me, irregardless of what i did in that 24th game to get myself perma banned, i know for a fucking fact no one in the 24 teams i played on, will be punished, not one single fucking one of them.\n\nmeanwhile im the one that gets punished for lashing out because i just dealt with said 24 teams worth of toxic players.\n\nIn the real world if someone lashes out after being harassed for an extended period of time the harassment is taken into consideration when determining the charge applied to the offence, because that is logical and has rationale.\n\nIn riots fucked up fantasy of how the human mind operates, you are either toxic or you arent and the people around you that you are playing with has zero bearing on you.\n\nYou want proof that thats bullshit? i play plenty of competitive games, league, overwatch, csgo, paragon, a few more obscure mobas, etc etc.\n\nLiterally the only game im toxic in is league, the only fucking game, its also the only game on that list with a community actively being toxic to each other, yeah sure csgo can get bad sometimes but thats the exception not the rule.\n\nLeague on the other hand when i click that exe i know ahead of time someone is going to argue with me, could be first 5 minutes of my first game, could be my third game, who knows, but it has a 100% chance of happening the

I can easily climb your account to gold because i know how to win.\n\nAs for KR, the reason people are not on ladder is because they dont have a massive ammount of fund to throw on pve and pvp or stack their UW. KR isnt hard; Dont pretend it is to make yourself look smart. Its a gear check game. pressing 1-3 buttons in a 5-10sec match is not difficult once you know the gist of it. Any 1 can replicate a winning \"meta\" team and be sucessful, skills is 20%, 80% is wallet.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-12-06T04:35:25.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Come back when you can make a mediana laias kaulah frey team work at anywhere above diamond by throwing money at it.\n\nYou dont need 5 star uw's to get high in arena, you need to know who counters who and how to counter the counter, the people who just throw down cash on the latest cheese comps ultimately fall back out of challenger to be replaced by the next young gun with cash, the people consistently at the top (for instance ive been challenger since week 1 of eu) are the ones actually putting thought into the heroes they run.\n\nSo again, your simplistic understanding of arena is why you arent at the top, not your wallet.\n\nFor instance a mate of mine is challenger up here with me after following my advice, hes free to play.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-12-06T21:59:06.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can tell you have alots of false pride. Cant accept that you are wrong on league, or that KR is a gear check game; and theory crafting is a simple task if you have the resources to trial and error. \n\nYou said simplistic understanding. But lets face it, KR is a simple game. And you blow it up to be this complicated, challenging, reflex intensive game play; Does that make you smarter? Nope! just a fellow who think he is better than he actually is. Take yourself down a notch and you might see why you're shit at league. \n\nGive any one that played pvp for a month or two the same resources you have, and they will make challenger aswell. \n\nAm pretty much a f2p on KR so no, i wouldnt make it to challenger with my PVE roster. But since you pay soo much am sure you can have pve teams and pvp, also Transcend them to whatever the fuck you want with your wallet. And your friend that are in CHallenger, am sure you carried his arse in Raid so he can get gear with his pvp line up, so pls stfu about it. If you are half as good as you claim, you wouldnt be soo shi0t at league and failed to understand why.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-29T23:09:00.177+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's nice. 🙃","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-06T11:03:53.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is this lad blogposting about getting banned lul.
