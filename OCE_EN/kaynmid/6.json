shocked","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":7,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://youtu.be/BQ5LXCMwZP0\n\n248 games of trolling didnt get banned.\n\ninfact the only reason hes banned now &quot;if he is&quot; is because he got on the front page of reddit so he got manually reviewed.\n\nDont worry guys the automated system is smart enough to ban people who troll using gameplay rather than the chat.\n\nLike dont get me wrong, the bot is very good at banning people who swear at you, but thats about it... unfortunately.\n\nAt this point i know i sound like a broken record but im going to say it again.\n\nThe automated system, does not work, in the majority of cases.\n\nThe problem with riot thinking it does, is the only data that they have on the system is report to ban ratio, and flag to ban ratio.\n\nThey cannot get data on something they are not or cannot look for (im learning on the side of cannot as a system capable of reviewing the gameplay of every player who gets reported in a region simply isnt feasible on a hardware requirement basis, maybe if riot was google and had billions of dollars to throw at rnd for an ai and hardware to run it sure, but they arent google, they dont have their own proprietary general learning algorithm to find these people)\n\nHell want an example of what im talking about?\n\nYou know that google demonetization bot? i can tell you how it works.\n\nIt uses speech recognition and ocr to look for \"trigger\" words and phrases that are on its blacklist, it then looks for a pattern of said usage in the video to make sure it is loosely in the context of an offensive connotation, then bam your ads are gone.\n\nit also uses very very basic image recognition on the thumbnails, which is why you will see thumbnails including a gun in them get flagged, why do they do it on just the thumbnails? oh thats very very simple, because even google doesnt have the processing power to do that very same image recognition (which is done by a neural network that google developed a little while ago that can recognize images based on training data, its very neat actually you should look it up) on every single frame in a video, on every video, is simply not possible.\n\nits asinine to think its possible, youd require a very basic understanding of software engineering to know its not.\n\nBecause just that one singular image search, is not something you can run on your toaster or pizza box, take my pc, i have an overclocked ryzen 7 1700. that is 16 cores of ipc similar to the intel alternative running at a clock of 4.2ghz this is a workstation pc basically.\n\nthere is very few workloads i cant run.\n\nI cannot run that image search algorithm in any reasonable time.\n\ni mean i can run it, give me the code and id run it just fine, itd just take me about an hour or so to actually find the image.\n\nAnd it doesnt help much when you scale up to much larger dual xeon stations.\n\nGranted google does run its neural networks using GPGPU processing on an array of tesla gpus, which is much much faster, but you are still looking at multiple seconds or minutes per image depending on its complexity/how good their training data is.\n\nA human could do it in a matter of miliseconds.\n\nShow me an image of a gun and i will take that image in through my eyes, process it, and recognise that its a gun in under 100ms, thats just the time to recognise the image mind you, everything after that the computer can do faster than me but THAT is the current limitation of these systems.\n\nThe one thing they are designed for in current commerical and private use beyond research reasons, namely the automatic detection of offensive images speech and text as in googles case.\n\nOr the automatic detection of text in riots case.\n\nis done faster and more accurately by a human.\n\nInfact the only advantage a computer has over a human, with the currently level of technology that we have.\n\nIs that the computer doesnt need to watch or read the text linearly.\n\nIt can break it into chunks, and read multiple chunks at once.\n\nGo and try to read the first half of this post and the second half of this post, at the exact same time without having to swap between each half, you cant.\n\nThat is the only advantage automated systems have right now, aside from saving personnel costs.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBasically to punctuate my point.\n\nThe reason why the automated ban system for league does not detect gameplay based trolling, is not because riots too lazy to code it.\n\nIts because they dont know how.\n\nIf riot had a system, that is capable of anaylising player gameplay, and determining who is trolling and who isnt, from 10 players simultaneously.\n\nThey would have an ai, more powerful, than the ai used by open ai, to beat dendi in dota 2, because that ai, could analyse gameplay of 2 players at once in one lane (which is why if you want to 1v1 it which if i remember correctly you can now, you can only do it solo in the midlane, because when you throw more lanes or players at it, it doesnt know what to do, because it wasnt coded to differentiate between players, or to look at other lanes, so where you would see \n 5 players, it would see 1 player that strangely had different names or it would pick the first player it sees and ignore the other 4, depending on how they coded its player recognition)\n\nIf riot had a system, capable of doing that, they wouldn't be making league of legends, because whoever in their team coded that ai is worth billions in the ai market.\n\nHell if riot had a system capable of doing that, i wouldnt even be mad, id be attempting to pick their brain to learn what kind of alien civilization they came from to put us atleast a year into the future, granted apparently according to riot they have had this system for years, so sorry elon musk, riot beat you to it using a time machine.\n\nDo you get the point yet, the automatic system doesnt work, it never has, it just bans based on chat, its very good at chat, but thats all it can do.\n\n\nMy closing point, ive always known this, i literally work on AI research as a hobby, ive read countless white papers, ive coded my own neural networks, i am the real bloody deal when it comes to this kind of shit, i didnt just pick up a html for dummies book and suddenly think im the next bill gates.\n\nGranted im no where near bill gates, otherwise id be working for big software firm wouldnt I, thats besides the point though.\n\nBecause I lied, i wasnt shocked by the video, i just used clickbait to draw you into reading this, i knew ahead of time when I saw the 248 games played that the reason he would be banned is because someone would draw his attention to riot staff, because i knew ahead of time that riot isnt capable of reviewing those 248 games with their automated system, no one is, the tech doesnt exist yet.\n\nBring back, the tribunal, you can keep the automated system for things like chat, it works very well in the majority of cases.\n\nBut stop being too fucking proud, to admit that your golden boy system cant work in every fucking scenario and realise that you need the advantage of a human right now.\n\nNamely, our natural general learning algorithm built into our brains.\n\nWe are currently the worlds most powerful ai, every sinlge last one of you even the most bloody stupid among you, is still smarter than an AI, simple because of said general learning algorithm.\n\nUntil we develop said algorithm, it will not be possible for riot to rely solely on an automatic system, no company can, even google with all its ai research, still employs a decent number of staff, whos sole job, is to correct errors from the systems and catch videos that slip through the cracks.\n\nHell EVEN GOOGLE has a tribunal system, ever heard of the youtube heros program? its not very successful because the rewards are shit and they wont accept most people as users, but it exists, and it works, infact they have been using it for literal fucking years, it only showed up recently because google wanted to be more transparent and open the system up to the public.\n\nBasically riot.\n\nYou are not too good for a fucking tribunal.\n\nIn fact its quite the opposite.\n\nYou arent good enough, to not have one.","replies":[{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-10-23T12:02:16.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 things.\n\n1.

With the size of the game today, a manually driven tribunal is infeasible. Thousands of games are played every second. There&#x27;s not enough manpower at Riot nor within the playerbase for any kind of tribunal to be effective. This is the biggest reason they retired it in the first place.\n\nUmmm, not really. More games means more players means more manpower for a tribunal.\n\nAnd it's not like we're talking about reviewing _every_ game being played, we're talking about a small percentage of the community that are spreading their toxicity throughout the playerbase. So 3% (I pulled that number out randomly as an example) of a playerbase being toxic now is no different to 3% a number of years ago, as you still have the same percentage of manpower remaining to review those cases.\n\nWe're also not talking about shutting off Riots fandangle punishment bots, as they seem to be handling one facet of toxicity pretty well. So the fact that a rebooted tribunal wouldn't be implemented to deal with most cases of verbal abuse and other chat based abuse allows the tribunal to focus on things the bot won't pick up on.\n\nHere's the thing, there isn't really an argument to be made over why a tribunal is a bad idea.\n\nBring one in to deal with **high priority cases**. A high priority case would something like where a player has been reported multiple times, perhaps over multiple games, but the riot bots are coming back empty handed. In other words, this player is most likely pissing off a large number of the playerbase but the bots aren't able to - and won't be able to for a long _long_ time - detect what the deal is. Where possible have a game reply available (this would be the major thing to update with the tribunal and shouldn't be too difficult as cases don't stick around forever, so replays don't need to either) and put the community to task to root out the many troll players with negative behaviour who aren't getting their just desserts.\n\nIncentivise the playerbase to get involved with some sort of rewards program and expand/narrow the caseload depending on how successfully the tribunal is able to deal with the existing number of cases within an allotted amount of time.\n\nRegardless of the number of cases the tribunal _actually_ deals with, the psychological impact it will have by **merely existing** on the entire communities behaviour also counts towards it's measure of success.\n\nI honestly don't see the issue in having one or why it's so difficult to have one again. It would improve the League experience for a huge number of players by allowing the majority of the community to have a say in what expectations they have from summoners.\n\n\n[edit: I missed KaynMid's post below making the exact same point about playerbase percentage.]","replies":[{"poster":"Easley","date":"2017-10-24T12:51:03.377+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The argument against the tribunal you're suggesting is that it would be pointless because Riot already manually reviews 'high priority cases' - cases where players are reported excessively. \n\nSee the support singed and support nunu with smite cases earlier this year - they prove that Riot will ban players with high report rates regardless of toxicity. Cases of trolls and intentional feeders left unbanned are not because they receive frequent reports and yet Riot ignores them - it is because their griefing is subtle enough to attract fewer reports and remain below the cutoff.\n\nIntroducing a tribunal for 'high priority cases' would be redundant because those cases wouldn't even make it there to begin with.","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-10-24T14:34:22.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because a couple of employess at Riot can handle the entire caseload of the

should be permabanned across multiple accounts, i have literally mastered the art of reducing a games winrate to 0% while making it look like im playing normally, through the sheer process of guessing what the bot can and cant find.\n\nGuess how many punishments ive gotten.\n\nI can count it on one hand, all of them are from when i got so very very pissed off that i started yelling at people in

give them a detailed breakdown of everything i do to avoid bans and why they cannot even fathom how to fix it.\n\nHeres the entire list.\n\nI dont do what the bot is looking for.\n\nBecause its very easy to code a bot to look for certain types of behaviour.\n\nIts literally impossible to code a bot to detect behavior you arent looking for.\n\nUnless you use a general learning algorithm and like i said in the op, we wont have that for around the next 20-50 years, atleast according to the current leaders of the ai research field, just to throw out a recognizable name that specific time frame came from elon musk, the current Chairman of Open AI aka a company so confident that ai is an impending danger, that its sole reason for existing is to teach everyone how to create and use it, and be the leading research firm for it so that no malicious companies can hold all the chips, lets just say any prediction they make about how far away ai is, is pretty accurate, and if anything is a shorter time than reality.\n\nSo personally i trust elons judgement more than the developer of a free 2 play cash
