I'd estimate at least a quarter of my games (and not just in LoL). The difference is, I don't take out that anger on people. I vent it through outlets that I've come to rely on, which for me is (mainly) Video Games, which might seem contradictory, but it works for me. I don't always play multiplayer games, and when I play solo, that's when I'm working out my anger and frustration.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-11T07:38:42.729+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=10dAj78k,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-01-11T06:12:17.037+0000)\n>\n> Fun Fact: 83% of statistics you see online are made up!\n \n\nNonsense. the figure is closer to 81%.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-11T06:04:31.992+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is some of my own percentages except they are irrefutable.\n\nIf you are good then your team has 4 other people who could potentially be bad.\nThe enemy team has 5.\nEnemy team is statistically more likely to be worse if you are consistently good.\n\nHmmm its kinda like if you are good and play enough games you climb regardless.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2018-01-11T10:35:55.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I guess thats why i have multiple accounts in silver+\n\nMy complaint wasnt \"wah wah wah all my teams are shit and it stops me from climbing\"\n\nMy complaint was \"Man all these teams dont give two shits which pisses me the fuck off, and i play like shit when im pissed the fuck off\"\n\nThat and it doesnt matter if its my team or the enemy team that plays like dogshit, i still feel like i wasted half an hour of my life.\n\nBecause as i said i have multiple accounts, i dont care about getting as high a rank as possible, i care about improving as a player, how am i meant to improve in a pubstomp game, if i wanted to pubstomp or be pubstomped itd mean im not trying that game, and you know which queue i play when i dont feel like trying?\n\nnormals.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-11T10:52:13.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup multiple accounts in silver.
