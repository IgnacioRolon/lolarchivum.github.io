I have asked a few popular streamers in Twitch and some of my closest Ranked friends which are mostly Silver IV, and above! I&#039;ve recently gotten the same feedback e.g. Learning your Match-Ups, Warding, Lanes, Mechanics, etc! And just wondering if there are other ones at there! \n\nI myself main ADC and Support, I&#039;m currently working on being a Jungler since it&#039;s a new experience for me! And as well very FUN! I&#039;ve done some bulk research on making my Masteries and Runes, I was planning to do my Runes when I hit Level 30 but, I wanted to start early, and I may say it is working great! \n\nAlso, when reaching Level 30. Should we go straight into Ranked? Or is there a certain amount of general knowledge you need to know before you go into Ranked? I have seen most of my friends who hit Level 30, go straight away to Ranked, but not thinking too much e.g. Instalocking, Not mentioning Lanes, etc. They mostly land on the #BronzeLyfe which they don&#039;t like at all. They&#039;ve told me that they regret doing that, and telling me some input about it. Like having experiences and tactics behind your mask.\n\nIf you have any suggestions/tips/tactics/mechanics feel free to share them! \nThank you! \n_Anne - OCE_\n\n~~\"It's not over until it's over.\" ~~","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T04:54:23.635+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is no downside of going into ranked play. If you want to play League of legends more seriously and want to improve at the game, then ranked is the place for that, if your just playing for a laugh and some fun, stay in normals. Unless you are some kind of prodigy, you WILL be placed in bronze  or low silver (which may as well still be bronze) during your first attempts at ranked. Even if you stay in normals and play another 200 normal games, you are still going to be placed in bronze. This is because in ranked the game is played very differently to in normals. Normal games are good for learning the mechanics of specific champions, and perhaps some laning mechanics, but the mechanics of the game change in ranked. It will also test your mental state against flamers, feeders, trolls and whatever else you may encounter. Objective play is much more important in ranked because people actual care about winning. I myself enjoy ranked more than normals, because I get to play against other people at the same skill level as me and everyone is more focused on winning the game(even though flaming and abuse is increased 10 fold). So yes, go straight into ranked, when i first started ranked i thought i was great and would be placed into gold, only to be placed in bronze 3. But by the end of that season i was diamond, and im fairly certain if i hadnt started ranked straight away i would still be low elo. Last tip. Elo Hell DOES NOT EXIST. If you are stuck in  bronze it is your fault. Proof that Elo hell doesnt exist is evident by the fact that their is bronze is ridden with boosting. There are very simple strategies that require very little skill or game knowledge and they will get you out of bronze. The most prominent, mindless split pushing. I will leave you to figure out the rest. ","replies":[{"poster":"Anne","date":"2015-06-07T10:32:52.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much! Yea, it's great how some people aren't afraid to try Ranked straight away since you can learn things at every game, and it's good to start early, isn't it? \nYour input was great! And WOAH! Congrats on getting Diamond at the end of the season! Your tips was very appreciated!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-06-08T12:31:02.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have never played rank before due to issues with my ping ... but i would say focus on CS and look at the Mini Map more. Focus on CS because 18CS is approximately equal to a kill. Why look at the mini map more ? well because warding is pretty much useless if you don't look at the mini map and there is one game i remember where i was able to avoid all the ganks from the enemy jungler because i am aware that he is near just because i looked at the mini map. Other than that, never overextend and never get cocky because you think you are fed. I am a support main and plays ADC occasionally and i think that positioning is extremely important as an ADC. Always stay behind your front lines (Tanks) and deal as much damage as you can from behind. Try your best to survive for as long as possible as an ADC so that you can deal as much damage to the enemy team as possible. My tips for a support is protect your ADC and your teammates or prevent your enemies from diving your ADC. What you need to do as a support is pretty much to just save and protect or help your team win teamfights with CC skills or healing teammates depending on what support you are playing. Don't try too hard to save a teammate because you need to understand that sometimes you just can't save them and that you should just let them die instead of possibly dying together with them for trying to save them. Lastly, focus more on objectives because what you need to win the game is to get the enemy Nexus and thats all to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Anne","date":"2015-06-10T11:35:36.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes! Minimaps aren't my strong point, but in a couple of games I recently played, I was aware of the Map since I have the brushes warded, and I also got away with ganks which helped a lot and lead us to Victory!

Everyone does this a lot of the time but few people actually realise they do, even fewer try to correct it. The people who overestimate their skill are terrible to play with. They blame their teams and don't accept their skill (or lack thereof) had any effect on the outcome. When they do manage to win a match they brag about how they carried. All this even if they went 0/50/0 with 10 CS. They'll complain about people \"stealing their kills\" and not getting ganks from the jungler (even if someone does help their lane). Jumping straight into ranked often makes this worse and I'd say most people in bronze suffer from the worst of this. Accept you're not as good as you might think and work to become better. Set realistic goals like getting placed in Silver, not goals like reaching platinum in just a few months.\n\n**Don't play when you're in a bad mood**. You may think there's no issue doing so but the way you're thinking can affect your gameplay, and it becomes worse the worse your mood. If you are getting frustrated or angered it's a good idea to have a break. Get something to drink or eat, go to the toilet or browse some website like 9gag for a few minutes to calm down.\n\n**Learn from mistakes**. When you notice a mistake you or someone else has made think about how it could have been avoided. For example: *you get ganked by the enemy jungler and get killed. Did you have a ward giving vision of their approach? Was your map awareness sufficient (rather, how long did it take you to notice the jungler's approach)? Were they invisible and, if so, did you use a stealth ward? Could you have escaped any easier? etc.* You could even record your games and look for as many mistakes as you can find if you're willing to put the effort in.","replies":[{"poster":"Anne","date":"2015-06-07T10:54:46.415+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed! It's great how people set goals being Gold or maybe someday becoming a Pro player, but you need to not jump too far, it's great having confidence in a period of time and having the knowledge! 9gag is a great site I've been always checking out as well as Buzzfeed and they really cheer my mood up! And lastly mistakes, I've actually recorded some footage of gameplays and the PING is just too high (JKS) In my head when I see something wrong I normally say \"What did I do! I didn't even see him/her!, etc\" And it's basically knowing what to do, cause League is a game where your mind works frequently and you need to be aware of the Rift. I basically think I can improve on what I do and I'm glad! \nThank you so much for your input!

Csing is really important - you should be aiming for about 100 cs every 10 minutes (if you cant get that practice practice practice) you should be able to get about 70-80 cs even if you roam a lot. Your cs atm needs a lot of improvement because adc is all about cs and positioning and getting ~150cs in 30min is not nearly enough (you should have about double that). Cs is really that important and it is crucial you have that much cs because good cs ing supplies you with so much more gold than just a few kills. Good Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"Myko","date":"2015-06-07T10:17:30.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"btw you can check how much you are csing per minute on oce.op.gg - aim for 10 cs per minute but realistically at least 7 cs per minute (if you dont feel like you are improving, do these exercises because i cant stress enough how important this is http://i.imgur.com/orWUCKH.png)","replies":[{"poster":"Anne","date":"2015-06-07T10:35:39.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CSing is very important! I have gotten a lot of input about that since, if you CS well you have the advantage of getting your items than the opponents focusing to attack you! Thank you so much!

I'd say stick with normals but nothings stopping you from going into ranked if you really want. Just realise that if you go straight into ranked your skill level is unlikely to be better than bronze, so if you're gunna get demoralised by being 'stuck' in bronze for hundreds of games it might be better to stick with normals til you're a bit better and can climb faster. People also care more about winning so they are more likely to get frustrated and argue, blame you/teammates, and afk when things aren't going their way so keep this in mind and don't let it tilt you.\nAlso, I notice you pretty much only play one ADC and support (jinx/sona). You really need to have one or two more for each role that you can play well, otherwise you're going to be in bad shape when they get banned out or picked before your turn (VERY important for ADC, since jinx is one of the most popular and will frequently get picked before you can get her)","replies":[{"poster":"Anne","date":"2015-06-07T10:39:45.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed! I'm currently working on other roles, since I was pretty aware that you must at least learn a couple of champions since they might get banned.
