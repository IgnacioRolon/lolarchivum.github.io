That account your on was Plat in season 4 and 5 and now you are \"hard stuck\" in silver 5... suspicious.\n\nThat account is also 4 years old and yet you don't know about MMR and keeping a positive winrate...\n\nFizz stats: you average** less** than 5 cs per 10. that is Bronze level farming. 2.5 K/D/A is nice, but averaging over 8 deaths is not.\n\nLucian stats: your last 6 Lucian games, you have died 68 times... amazing. You average more than 10 deaths a game. Your average 6 c.s. per 10 on Lucian which around a high silver level.","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2016-10-16T08:04:03.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea you tell him :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-15T08:56:26.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you get the cs per 10 stat?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-15T09:50:57.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oce.op.gg","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-15T11:59:44.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty bby","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
