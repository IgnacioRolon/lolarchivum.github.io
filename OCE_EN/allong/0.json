I get the impression Riot has identified that there is a serious problem with toxic players, and as such have recently implemented measures to help curb it. But yet, these past few weeks I have seen more despicable behavior than ever.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is commented on in-game, it's suggested that everyone rallies together to report the player, and **of course** a the toxic player will just laugh it off along with some comment about there being no tribunal. \r\n\r\nI don't think I'm that bad of a player, I have a 40% win rate. Last season I averaged around 50 LP in Silver 4, but this season I went straight to Bronze 5 and I have been stuck there this whole time. Without any trolls I can get up to 70 LP in B5, however as you will note in the following screencap of my previous game - *in which the user Peterpith stole mid and then ran down the lane repeatedly, causing Fiora to DC and Zed to snowball* - I have managed to drop **23 LP** due to a single players actions. \r\n\r\n[Screencap (**Contains profanity**)](http://i.imgur.com/JPmczVY.jpg) \r\n\r\nMy questions are the following. What are we, as genuinely interested players to do about toxic behavior? Every troll I come across, I report. I still lose the game and LP, and then I guess I'm supposed to feel a sense of justice by clicking a button and filing a report. They might get disciplinary action? They might get a little message pop up saying \"Don't do that\"? I don't know, I don't get any feedback about my reports, and for some undisclosed reason there is no tribunal, I just have to soldier on and pretend I've made a difference for myself and the League community.\r\n\r\nThe next question I have is, what are Riots thoughts on \"ELO Hell\"? (in my case, Bronze 5 hell). I've heard from many players the difficulty of climbing, especially after having not so great provisionals. And what matchmaking considerations have been designed to deal with ELO hell? I would really love to see some statistics about the distribution of players over ranks and divisions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-02-18T04:13:41.301+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Allong,\n\nIf you're really interested in player behaviour give this video a watch it is Jeffrey \"Lyte\" Lin talking about \"The Science Behind Shaping Player Behavior in Online Games\".\nhttp://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n\nIt explains why solving the negative/toxic behaviour of players is not as easy as just banning all of the consistently toxic players (thats only a small part of the answer)\n\n**Feedback for reports**\nI agree the feedback loop for reports is terrible right now. It is something we are looking into but it can't be fixed overnight.\nHowever just because negative players \"laugh it off along with some comment about there being no tribunal.\" doesn't mean they won't get punished.\nCurrently Tribunal is undergoing a maintenance period to add some new features and will be launched globally in the future. But we have a lot of systems in place and they all use your reports.\n \n**Live**\n\nLeaverBuster\nChat restrictions\nIntentional feeder bans\nManual audits\n\n**Currently testing**\n\nAutomatic verbal abuse bans\n\nThis is of course just the negative stuff, we are also working on ways to promote and recognize positive play within our community as well!\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/special-event/celebrating-end-years-snowdown\n\nOur player behavior philosophies include punishment, reform, and positive reinforcement. There's no silver bullet to improving player behavior in online games, and you always need a mix of punishments and rewards. You can read more about our design philosophies here: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/exploring-player-behavior-design-values\n\nNow onto **ELO HELL**;\n\n**TL;DR:** Elo hell does not exist.\n\nBefore I can discuss this I am going to make a few assumptions on what you define as Elo Hell.\n1. Elo hell is where negative players hold you back from climbing the ranked ladder\n2. Negative players include; trolls, feeders, toxic, afk/dc etc\n\nThe general idea is there are too many negative players on your team most of the time and you can't carry hard enough to win. Now this may be true for a **few** games, but it certainly is not true for a **majority** of them. Say you are currently in bronze 5, you get match up with people around your level and you get matched up against people around your level. Both teams (yours and theirs) get players from the same pool. \n\nNow lets assume you are not a negative player, you never troll, get in flaming wars, feed, afk. This means there are 9 spots left to fill the game.\n4 spots on your team and 5 spots on the other team. This means that there is a 4/9 (44%) chance to get a negative player on **your team** and a 5/9(56%) chance to get a negative player on the **opposing team**. This means that not only should negative players not be causing you to **lose** more than normal but they should be causing you to **win** more than normal because they end up on the **opposing** team more often.\n\nGive this video a watch it really helps me when I find myself blaming teammates too much for my losses. http://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc","replies":[{"poster":"Allong","date":"2015-02-22T15:19:16.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am glad that there is much emphasis on rectifying player behavior, even if it can be admitted that it is still a work in progress.\n\nI feel like I should have been more specific as the term \"ELO Hell\" seems to be thrown around a lot without much serious meaning. What I am referring to specifically, is Bronze hell. I'm sure that everyone can have trouble moving up divisions and staying there. However in all my MOBA experience (which is mostly League-centric), I have never seen such a touch-and-go mash up of such immensely varying skill differences as League of Legends' Bronze 5.\n\nI hear so often that Bronze Hell doesn't exist purely on the basis of some marginally higher chance of the other team having a toxic player, assuming that there is a perfect chance of exactly one toxic player every game. Not only does that rarely play out in practice, it is completely ignorant of what actually happens in a B5 game. That is why everyone I ask in low Bronze agrees, Bronze Hell exists, and people above low Bronze seem to agree that it doesn't.\n\nGoing purely on the basis of toxic players, you miss smurfs, who I have played with and against on many occasions. They are clearly not B5 material, yet purely on a whim they hyper carry one game and then completely throw the next just to stay in low leagues and continue for \"fun\". Then there are people who do try to do their part, but still have a lot to learn, they admit they are new to their role/champ, they know they aren't Silver material, they just want to play ranked. There is nothing wrong with that, however *that is why there exists, the lowest division in the lowest league: **Bronze 5***. I know I am not an amazing player, I probably don't even deserve Silver. But I can with all certainty say, I do not deserve Bronze 5. \n\nThe attachment shows my previous match, if you can honestly say there is nothing wrong with this match up, then I request that my account is closed, because I'm just about done with League.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-02-19T06:22:08.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I managed to get out of Bronze 5 last season. It was not easy, but I did everything the video that Marauder posted. If you'd stop blaming others, ignore trolls and afks, and just play the best you could, you can get out. I even muted everyone in 95% of my games just so I don't have to deal with toxicity. If you're good enough, you'll get out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-18T03:33:44.597+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I really think Riot needs to take a more harsh stance on people who get aggressive/abusive/toxic in ranked play. Sure it's unacceptable in general, but honestly a 5/10/15/30 day ranked ban should be warranted in cases of going afk, for being really abusive, for trolling/intentionally feeding, etc.\n\nAt the same time however, I think 1) we need the option to pause in ranked play just in case someone disconnects due to internet issues, and 2) if someone leaves the game the losing team should not be penalised for it (the player that leaves should get a 24 hour ranked ban, and significant LP loss/division drop). It is seriously about time we stop rewarding toxic behaviour with slap on the wrist consequences and show that this kind of behaviour is not alright.\n\nI don't feel as if the system we have now is working. I have seen way too many people be abused in game, and this kind of negativity should not be normalised. League of Legends is already infamous for the abuse people receive on it (I know this is anecdotal, but the people I know who don't play LoL is because of the cases of abuse and humiliation people have been put through). \n\nFingers crossed for a discussion on this, although it might be better to post about this on the NA forums - I'm not sure if the discussion on these boards will lead to anything (not doubting the capability of our Riot members, I'm just unsure of how things work here).\n\nThe 'ELO/Bronze hell' is easily solved by dealing with bad player behaviour. One of the biggest factors I've found that contribute to losses is player mentality and how well the team works together (not in terms of playing, but in terms of behaviour).\n\nedit: Also you need to blur/remove the names of the players in the screenshot, otherwise you might get in trouble. Not allowed to 'witch hunt' (don't get me wrong, I completely understand how you feel and sometimes it really sucks not knowing if there will be justice).\n\nIf I had any advice for you, it would be to avoid getting involved in any kind of argument during the game. Do what **you** have to do to stay focused on yourself, your lane, and being conscious of the rest of the map in terms of whether or not someone is coming to your lane to gank you or support you. Solo Queue is all about individual improvement - the system also rewards constant play, meaning in time you will go up in rank. Your focus should not be on your rank but getting better as a player.\n\nYou're still going to have losses in the future, you're still going to have unlucky games with teams that just don't work well together, but instead of **you** losing as (example k/d) 0/7 Annie, you might lose as a 6/2 or a 0/2/12 Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"Allong","date":"2015-02-18T03:52:44.714+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really appreciate your response, I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, yet I'm surprised I haven't seen much mention of it.
