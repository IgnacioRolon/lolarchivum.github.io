However, Alexander only gets half of this effect.\n\nWhen Alexander reaches level 18 all allies 500 units near him temporary gain +0.25 hp and mana regen until they leave his presence. Alexander gets the full effect of this.\n\nRoyal Protection Aura max passives:\nAllies: get 72 of both armor types and 720 hp max.\nAlexander: gets 36 of both armor and 360 hp max.\n\nQ**Paladins Strike\t\t\tCD:7/7.5/8/8.5/9   \t         Mana:(60 all levels)**\nAlexanders next attack ignores (10%/15%/20%/25%/30%) of the targets armor and lowering the targets armor for 0.5 seconds. When Alexander lands a successful attack after Paladins Strike has been activated he instantly strikes again.\n\nW**Paladins Charge\t\t\tCD:15/14/13/12/11               Mana:(70/75/80/85/90)**\nAlexander Charges 250 units forward being immune to cc for the duration and stunning anyone Alexander hits for 0.25 seconds. After Alexander charges forward he slams his mighty war sword into the ground in front of him dealing AD damage (75/125/175/225/275 + 2% of AD) and stunning anyone caught in the AoE for 0.5 seconds. (minions/monsters are stun for twice the amount)\n\n\nE**God of Love/War     \t\t            CD:10/9.5/9/8.5/8\t          Mana:(50/55/60/65/75)**\n**God of Love**: Alexander gets on 1 knee and after a 0.5 second channel he heals an allied Champion for (25/50/75/100/125 + 0.5% of Alexanders AP) and removes all debuffs (if the selected ally had no debuffs the healing effect is doubled.) 700 unit range. If Alexander would take damage his channel stops and the spell still costs and goes on CD. When Alexander unsuccessfully casts God of Love he takes the damage he took as true damage.(first damage only over time damage e.g. Lulu auto attack will only do true on her first hit and not the bonus attacks pix does.)\n\n**God of War**: Alexander Raises his Sword high in the air and after a 0.1 second channel the God of War strikes the selected enemy champion for (50/100/150/200/250 + 1% of Alexanders AP) and slow for 20% lasting 0.5 seconds 700 unit range. (Alexander will take true damage if he unsuccessfully casts this spell as well on first hit damage)\n\n\nR**Presence of the Gods\t\tCD:90/80/70\t\t\t\t               Free**\n\nPassive: Alexander gains 15/25/35 AD. (30/50/70 AD while activated.)\n\nActivation: When activated Alexander is granted a presence from a God so that he and his allies are immortal. While their is an image of a God with Alexander, champions within a 750 unit radius around Alexander are granted immunity for 1.5/2/2.5 seconds.\n\nAlso when presence of the Gods is activated the passive damage is doubled for 3/4/5 seconds, Alexander is then armor penalized for 3 seconds after Alexander loses the bonus damage. (Alexander loses 10/20/30 armor.)\n\n\n**Tips**\n\n**When Playing as Alexander**:\n- When you are about to level up go to another lane and stick next to as many champions as you can for the best use of Royal Protection Aura.\n\n- Alexander is best in fights when next to allies. Standing next to allies grants a bigger chance of Alexander&#039;s team winning fights and objectives.\n\n- God of Love is really good but don&#039;t activate it while taking damage because it will stop and it will cost you greatly.\n\n**When Against Alexander**:\n- Alexander wants to stand next to as many allies as he can to get max effectiveness of Presence of the gods and Royal Protection Aura. Try to denied Alexander of this if you can.\n\n- When Alexander is charging at you he is about to land an AoE stun and it can&#039;t be stopped, move backwards diagonally to get out of the way of his stun then punish him for trying to stun you since he won&#039;t be able to do anything if your a ranged champion.\n\n- Stopping Alexander&#039;s God of Love will punish Alexander greatly. it is very easy to stop just damage him. (effects that don&#039;t do damage won&#039;t stop the channel.)\n\n**Lore**:\nAlexander as a child was gifted immortality while he was near a god. So when Alexander became 17 he spent the next 500 years protecting the gods from any threat. for the last 500 years Alexander never once failed to let any enemy get close to the ones he was protecting.\n\nUntil recently when Alexander failed on one of the gods and accidentally getting him critically injured. So the gods declared Alexander goes on leave until Alexander got a well deserved break. Once Alexander rested he decided himself that he couldn&#039;t go back to protecting the gods until he gets more training so he became an adventurer and he discovered Runeterra.\n\nAfter realizing where he was, Alexander realized that Runeterra was just a huge battle field and a great place for him to get experience. So after Alexander realized he now spends his time on the Rift protecting his allies and their belongings preparing for his true test of protecting the gods again.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-12-09T23:10:19.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"One day Alexander came across some God who just decided to grant him immortality! IMO, that's bad lore. Rest is kinda fine, if lacking in detail. The champion is lebrokebroke. ADC's become tanky asf. His level 18 passive is useless. Decrease armor... For .5 seconds...
