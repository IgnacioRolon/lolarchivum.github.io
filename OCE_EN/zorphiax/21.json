Will I still get my banner or have they rewards been set for this season?\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask this now because, league is currently unavailable to play and I think this is when they give rewards and make big final changes for the new season. So just inquiring.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-06T19:23:46.437+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Congrats on the climb!\n\nUnfortunately, you won't be getting any rewards for this rank as season ended back at the start of November. You don't get anything for climbing in pre-season. \n\nNew season starts up today, with another soft reset. This means that you will once again have to play placement games, and will end up placed lower than you currently are. If you manage to get back to silver and stay there when season ends in November of next year, you get those rewards :3","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-12-06T19:50:17.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Yaiamone,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xbAwfzxk,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-06T19:23:46.437+0000)\n>\n> Congrats on the climb!\n> \n> Unfortunately, you won&#x27;t be getting any rewards for this rank as season ended back at the start of November.

Oh well did it once I can do it again.\n\nDoubt it will happen, but, I never know If I go 10/10 will i stay same rank or just drop by 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-06T19:55:07.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With a reset, even if going 10/10 in placements players usually drop at least one rank. \n\nOn the positive side with your impressive climb up to S3 during pre-season your MMR would have slightly increased and it is possible (although not guaranteed) that you will end up being reset into b2-S5 instead of having to climb up from bronze 4 again.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-12-07T23:31:26.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I went 6-4 and somehow to my surprise...
