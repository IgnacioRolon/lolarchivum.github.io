(Laptop)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the day patch 6.3 came out my Laptop wouldn&#039;t even think of launching LoL at all I can&#039;t get to the launch screen nor login screen or the client itself. I think it might be my laptop or something that patch 6.3 has added that isn&#039;t letting my laptop even think of starting League.\r\nI tried the following and none of them worked:\r\n- Factory resetting my laptop.\r\n- Starting league in administrator. (sometimes it works but didn&#039;t this time ;( )\r\nI was going to uninstall League but with my bad internet it will prob take a week and a half to reinstall it so trying to make that a last resort. So if any riot members have any advise I would desperately like help, if I don&#039;t get a response within the next couple days I will just try to uninstall it then reinstall it.\r\n\r\nP.S. League does work on my PC though but dads 24/7 on it so I get it once in a blue moon.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-13T14:12:50.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just wanna ask how you \"factory reset\" a laptop O_O??","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-02-13T14:14:58.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my friend said he did it so that's probably why my laptop is being really shit lately.
