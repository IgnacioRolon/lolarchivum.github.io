(you can get timer from dragon sounds and timing from when Baron wore off anyway)\n\n> Two, and this gets more big-picture, we had to ask ourselves what we wanted to be rewarding in taking objectives. There's certainly something to be said about maintaining vision and map control, but that should be on a level playing field as opposed to one team snowballing their previous Dragon / Baron takedown into a serious advantage. Our hope is this will encourage teams to be more proactive about their Barons and Dragons - each time they come up.\n\nKinda screws over Nunu/Warwick/Fiddle etc who used to be able to sneak the first drag at level 2-4 then basically get the 2nd one too since the enemy didn't have a proper timer.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-25T11:20:18.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ward dragon Early and they wont steal it or they will steal it but you will have a timer, god summoners should just get some Skill/Knowledge.","replies":[]}]}]}
