Apprenticeship I paid over 75% of that but parents got the other 25% i only really got 4 games but 1 was a bundle of 35 atari games or something like that (fifa16 - gears of war - Ori and the blind forest) which all came with the Xbox. It was only a $10 riot point card from one of my other friends that I see only once in a blue moon.\n\nand I live in a split family so its kinda a 50-50 thing for my parents.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
