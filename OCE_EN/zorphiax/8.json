Because, IDK about you other people but I think it&#039;s rather annoying that we have to wait 10-30 minutes to stare at an empty screen while a friend just messaged and we can&#039;t see it because of a leavebuster penalty so for the next long 10 minutes you have to stare at your friends name trying to think what the sms is OR here&#039;s a brilliant idea click leave que check message and wait another 10-30 mins cause you know everyone wants to do that.\r\n\r\nI sent this to riot and they gave me a good comment back.\r\n&quot;Hope your having a good day. Because, I&rsquo;m not just 20 minute bans But I&rsquo;m not asking you to remove them. I was wondering if you could make the leavebuster message minimizable. Because, I&rsquo;m sitting all by myself and I can&rsquo;t do anything for another 20 minutes and I just wanna talk to my friends but the message is in the way so please make it minimizable.&quot;\r\n(no that&#039;s what I sent not what they sent to me)","replies":[{"poster":"Hairy Lobster","date":"2015-12-24T16:12:28.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's an idea:\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't afk in games or dodge queues.\n\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-27T09:28:03.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I will admit I do AFK a lil bit and I can't help i t with my internet but that's getting fixed soon so can't complain.

(norms not ranked) and I copped the bans.

Or you can at least lose all the ip you receive for the next five games or another strategy like that! I don't believe waiting 20 minutes leaves a good example and community feedback for Lol.  For one, people just watch youtube and forget about it!
