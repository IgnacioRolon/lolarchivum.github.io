Others will have to be nerfed (mostly AD ones, as the ad items have been laid out to make the strong ones utterly terrifying, whilst the AP ones got nothing).  Rengar and Khazix seem to be sticking out of the pack, and will likely get worse once players learn their new combo's and builds.  \n\nHopefully, the nerfs will come before we have the new season, so we can go ranked without having to ban 6 assassins every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-09T21:28:18.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got my final lvl 7 S with Kalista, on the first game of the first day of the assassin plague meta _(I'm pretty sure i was one of 2 non-assassin champs in the whole game)_ \n\nIm pretty sure a miracle just happened, cos that shit aint happening again thats for sure..","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-11-10T01:17:07.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=itV9IYe5,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-09T21:28:18.491+0000)\n>\n> I got my final lvl 7 S with Kalista, on the first game of the first day of the assassin plague meta _(I&#x27;m pretty sure i was one of 2 non-assassin champs in the whole game)_ \n> \n> Im pretty sure a miracle just happened, cos that shit aint happening again thats for sure..\n\nA moment of silence for all marksmen mains please.","replies":[]}]}]}
