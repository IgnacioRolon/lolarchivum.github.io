I've duo'd with players below lvl30 and a few times I got completely destroyed by lvl3s who only have ghost and heal and no runes or keystones. \n\nNow I'm not saying I'm good at league, far from it, I'm around bronze elo but I've been playing for almost a year now and I doubt someone who has only 10 games of league ever, can crush a bronze-silver player 12-0 with the disadvantage of runes, masteries and optimum summoner spells. If someone can pull that off they've at least played a few hundred games and is at least silver level.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-12-09T11:07:51.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely a disadvantage, and I know what you mean.\nI'm currently trying to learn DOTA 2, and am forced into normal matches (because it takes 30+ minutes to get into a bot game) and legit everyone is smurfing. They are all super ragey and expect everyone else to be smurfs as well, and flame when you aren't as good as they expect you to be. \n\n**With games such as LoL and DOTA, they have been around for quite a long time. The majority of the player base is already established, and not many of the \"new\" accounts are actually new.**\n Most of them are smurfs that aren't happy with their rank and are starting again after being bronze 5 for years (it's easy to fake your rank when stomping noobs). Another good majority will be those that feel they can't practice new roles/champs in their own elo (such as myself) because everyone has a standard they will hold you to and flame the ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥  out of you when you don't reach it.\n\nI think with both games, the easiest way to get some practice is to pad yourself with experienced players in your games. Some that will carry you and teach you as the game goes on. That way, even when you lose you likely still would have had fun and learned something. \n\nWhile it may be frustrating to repetitively get stomped and be at a disadvantage, it gives you the opportunity to [learn how to play from behind](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2vydtp/how_to_play_from_behind/). Surprisingly, playing from behind is a rare skill for players (especially low elo) to have, as they usually give up at the sign of the enemies being even slightly ahead. Eventually you will just forge through (or stick to bot games) to level 20, when you can start to gain some equal footing.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-10T05:37:28.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha trust me I have experience playing from behind. In my entire time playing league of legends I don't think I've ever won a solo lane or snowballed. If I'm to get ahead of my laner and get fed it generally involves either being the jungler or having the jungler gank or the enemy doing something very dumb and throwing their lane.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-09T03:01:33.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I agree, even just the difference between a a level 11 player and a level 12 player is massive now with keystones. I can't really blame them for not playing normals.\n\nThe downside of this though is that players wind up going ARAM and bots only and we loose competitiveness in the game. I remember early on I got tired of loosing normals and just played about 1000 games of bots instead that year.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-12-09T02:18:34.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only smurfs play low level normals, so the mayority play bots & aram when they get enough champs because it is less of a curbstomp.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Brain Ahzoos","date":"2016-12-09T02:14:12.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"league of legends isn't a MMO (massive multiplayer online) its a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-08T23:09:26.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Off peak time imagine that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-12-08T22:38:33.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probs because all the twelvies aren't awake at like 6am.","replies":[]}]}
