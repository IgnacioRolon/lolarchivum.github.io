I was wondering when abouts we may be given 3v3 ranked on Oceania. I think the community has grown since the initial opening of the server and I believe that it is only fair that Oceania gets the same recognition as other servers with 3v3 ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyson","date":"2016-02-05T11:41:25.422+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be so much fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkWarriorHD","date":"2016-02-05T11:40:16.940+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes Please!","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-06T15:08:19.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you mean i can play 1v5 instead of 1v9? sign me up thats 4 less retards to worry about.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-06T14:06:08.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"never","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hynnil","date":"2016-02-05T12:27:03.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is the game mode i play most with friends.

I will say OCE has improved its numbers over the years and personally I hope it comes back and doesn't destroy other que timers with it (if riot could bring it back for a while just for a test)\n\nAlthough I do think that they should hold off the ranked que for a while just for tests and other reasons that may effect the LoL game for some reason.(But yes after a while it would be nice for 3v3 ranked to come back)","replies":[{"poster":"SweetPye","date":"2016-02-05T12:24:55.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3v3 Ranked Should be back RANKED asap!!!

Being in Oceania I've never, since the launch of this server, had the opportunity to even queue up for ranked 3v3's.
