My first 35 levels or so were purely bots. I never touched PvP.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling to settle on a champion, Qiyana was released, and I fell in love with her playstyle instantly. I know she isn't the easiest champion to master, but I knew that was what I wanted to play.\r\n\r\nSo I started jumping into some normal pvp matches, and I was getting annihilated to begin with. But I slowly chipped away at it and set myself a goal of reaching M7 with her. After about 3 weeks of playing Qiyana almost exclusively, I managed to do it! I learned things like CSing and wave management and warding and roaming and all kinds of fun little things.\r\n\r\nI was so excited and happy, I thought, next step: Ranked!\r\n\r\nOh boy.\r\n\r\nThe toxicity levels and the ability of players in ranked is beyond anything I've ever seen. I managed to consistently get A's or higher in normal games, but I can't even get a positive KDA in ranked, and the amount of HATE I get is ASTONISHING! I've never seen a more toxic environment in my entire life. I even forewarn people that I'm new, but there's nothing that sates their rage when a Zed bullies me out of farm and tower dives me and combos me in 1.5 seconds and teleports back out of range of the tower before it even gets a shot off on him. I have NO IDEA how to combat this, and honestly, it's so discouraging because even trying to stay safe under tower doesn't work against good players, and my team mates have no consideration for my lack of experience.\r\n\r\nI don't know what else to do. I love this game, I love the lore, I love so much about it. I watched so many videos trying to learn how to play properly, and even got some coaching sessions, but none of them prepared me for ranked. It's a whole other beast.\r\n\r\nI don't want to turn off team chat, because I feel like I might miss some pivotal information about what our game plan might be, and most of the time I try to stay above it and not interact, but it can get pretty hard when people bully you so relentlessly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, any words of advice would be very appreciated. I just want to enjoy the game...","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-08T14:26:03.446+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt anyone below gold even knows the definition of a gameplan, and in the many seasons I've floated around in gold, I have seen a gameplan once, and that was only because it was 2am after a 32min queue and matchmaking was fucked, so the game was half challenger/master players, half plat/gold players, which eventually devolved into the plat/golds try not to feed and support the challengers.\n\nSo yeah, unless you're in like high plat+, you probably won't be getting much tactical value out of teamchat, and the only reason you *may* want to participate, is placating angry players when the game isn't going well, and it looks like they're going to ragequit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-08T14:29:27.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dunno about you but in my experience, if they're at that point of negativity, anything you say will just make it worse. Some people are more receptive than others of course, but if someone is at the point of RQing, even something like \"we got this\" will generally be taken as \"well I don't want to, bye\".\n\nIf you want to effectively talk someone down, it has to happen pretty early on imo. If things are already that bad, the best you can do is mute and just play your best without the distraction.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-08-09T04:54:23.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To deal with toxic teammates, you need to be happy, friendly, you need to focus your interactions with players who might tilt. Ask them for a small favour or change in their gameplay to try to make their lane more favourible. If you want the player to get zhonias vs zed, tell them to buy zhonias so that when zed ults them, you can Vi ult them as a bait. Preventing their death won't be enough to make them happy, they need to get a kill for their choice to work with you, they might still be 1-6 instead of 0-6, but they're alot less likely to afk or consciously continue to int.\n\nThis used to be my primary method of climbing in early seasons, when I was willing to have a bad time for a few extra lp, so that I could make gold with basically no skills and a complete newbie to MOBAs. It's very emotionally tiring though, and nowadays I'm okay with just playing for fun and not caring about winning and losing, since I can get gold fairly easily, a few lp doesn't matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-09T05:02:11.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For sure I agree, there are ways to do it (though you have to consider the personal cost). I just meant if you're going to invest in that method you have to do it early or it snowballs out of control and the return on your efforts tends to nil very quickly.\n\nIn my experience, tilt is like spice, it's cumulative. If you can treat it (for lack of a better word) when there's only a little there you're mostly gonna have success, but it hits a point where nothing you can do will help much and you're better off letting it be.\n\nUltimately though, I'm with you in that in the end, this is a game, and while I will always play my best in ranked (because that's what it's for), if it's not fun there's not much point.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-08T14:26:17.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So there are a few things to unpack here. \n\nI'll start by saying that toxicity, verbal abuse and other such bullshit like that is not okay, and you should always report it in the post-game lobby. Don't be discouraged if you never get any feedback on reports, they're designed for anonymity all around for various reasons, which I can get into if you want me to but aren't all that important to your original topic so I'll leave out for now.\n\nReporting is important, even when your report isn't directly actioned. Even if nothing happens this time, it counts as negative history on their account for next time, and it also provides another data point for the automated learning system that manages most behavioural punishments.\n\n**tl;dr 1: If you experience toxicity or negative behaviours from players *report it*. **\n___\nYou mention that when you first jumped into normals, you were getting annihilated. This is, in essence, the same phenomenon you are experiencing in ranked. There are two important factors here:\n\n1. Each queue has a different MMR (matchmaking rating), so when you jump into a queue for the first time, you will have the average MMR, rather than one that is accurate to your skill level. This can often result in playing in mismatched games for a little while, though it does adjust fairly quickly. \n\n If you've just started, and don't have any prior MOBA experience, chances are your accurate MMR is going to land somewhere in the low Bronze range, where the average MMR you get when you start ranked is putting you in mid Silver.\n.\n2. There is a substantial skill and attitude gap in opponents between Bots>Normals and Normals>Ranked. Jumping from bots to players is obviously going ot be a big step up, but so is jumping into ranked. \n\n In normals, people aren't as invested. They are playing off-roles, less played champions, less seriously. In ranked, it's the opposite.\n\n**tl;dr 2: Just as there is a big skill gap to overcome from bots > normals, there is the same gap from normals > ranked. Your matchmaking rating for ranked also hasn't settled yet, as it is separate from your normals one.**\n___\n\nKDA isn't everything. This is another thing that changes drastically from normals to ranked for a variety of reasons. It pretty much comes down to macro play. If micro is your control of your champion (lane positioning, CS, mechanical play, etc.) then macro is basically the big picture (map awareness, ward lines, team positioning, enemy prediction, map control, objective decisions etc.). \n\nIn ranked, there is a much greater emphasis on macro, and even if a team has average or even terrible KDAs, if they have better macro than their enemy, they have a very good chance of taking the game.\n\nEssentially, kills mean nothing if you lose your nexus getting them. This is a difficult skill to master, and even just *understanding* the basics of macro, will improve your play dramatically. After all, you aren't the only player in the game. In my experience, macro is the majority of difference between low and high ranks.\n\nNaturally, champion skill has it's place. You'll do terribly if you don't know your champ and that won't help your team, but once you have that, macro is really the only substantial way up.\n\n**tl;dr 3: Always consider the big picture. It's a team game and champion mechanics alone will only get you so far.**\n___\n\nThe stakes. They are much higher in ranked, for some people enormously so. This means that people are much less tolerant of mistakes, and much more prone to tilt. I'm not saying it's ok to abuse people for doing badly in ranked, because it's not, only that the nature of the game-mode means you will see more of it.\n\nWhile you should always report it when people cross the line, early muting is the best way to combat it on a game to game basis. As soon as someone says something even remotely negative, just mute them. Even if it's only a little bit of tilt, there's nothing you can say (without heavily distracting yourself from actually playing) that will make it better, and they can communicate plenty effectively with just pings.\n\nIf they start spam pinging you too then they probably don't have much worthwhile to communicate anyway, and you're better off relying on your own awareness, than letting them distract you with negativity.\n\nIn addition, the odd compliment certainly isn't going to go astray. If someone makes a good play, give them a simple \"gj!\", if the jungler makes a good or even vaguely helpful gank, \"thanks man!\". It takes 2 seconds and helps to keep level heads. Knowing that your team has your back changes the dynamic a lot, and teams that fall apart tend to lose games fast.\n\n**tl;dr 4: It's a team game, so respect your team, but don't get dragged into any BS either. Mute if it gets negative, compliment when they do good. Keep it simple and don't let yourself get distracted by pettiness.**\n___\n\n**tl;dr 5: Focus on yourself. Ultimately, you are what you can improve. You may not notice it game to game, but overall improving your own skill is what you will see the effects of, not the random game you played a year ago with strangers.**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-11T22:25:30.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't follow metas so hard, you can put tanky items on a champion that's ranged, skinny, small or isn't metad to be for the cs or blocking skillshots and use creep aggro to defend you","replies":[]}]}
