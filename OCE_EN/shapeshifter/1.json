I'm a little tired of being griefed by the random PUGs I get grouped up with, banning my champs in the champ select screen, intentionally feeding, and generally acting like massive jerks.\r\n\r\nI'd really prefer to play with a friendly and chill group of people, who just want to have fun playing the game and not getting caught up in what is probably the most toxic gaming environment I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to playing with you.","replies":[]}
