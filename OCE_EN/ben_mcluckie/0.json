I say this because I&#039;ve been trying for the past year, looked up every guide and tried EVERYTHING. I&#039;ve even had someone from Plat 5 (I think it was 5, he was from Plat anyway) tell me, after 1v1ing me (after calling me a retard in a match I vs&#039;d him in while he was on his smurf account). I lost that game, everyone blamed everything on me, maybe I&#039;m too old for this game and RIOT doesn&#039;t want my money, who knows. That&#039;s the way this game is starting to make me feel, and I&#039;ve only recently turned 22, I still remember the days of being 18, wasn&#039;t really that long ago. I&#039;ve said to many people and many people agree with me that there should be an 18+ version of league, for people who have completely developed brains and have learnt some respect, dignity, initiative, have been through their own &#039;stuff&#039; in life and don&#039;t take things too personally, as you grow up you learn not to take things too personally because there is so much out there that sh*ts you to tears that you take a moment to realise how stupid it is that you, after x amount of beatings (in whichever form they come in, I&#039;m sure you know what I&#039;m referring to) still CARE.\n\n(When I say care I&#039;m referring to having an emotional connection with)\n\nWhich is the result of many reports that I&#039;ve had for calling someone retarded after doing something stupid.\n\n(When I say something stupid I&#039;m referring to them not knowing something that I know and when I call them retarded it&#039;s my way of saying that they weren&#039;t thinking at the time or they&#039;re just being completely ignorant either on purpose or because of laziness.)\n\nDon&#039;t get mad while you&#039;re reading this because it&#039;s probably something worth reading, even though you think someone is &#039;mean&#039; over the internet doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re instantly right, it doesn&#039;t mean everything they say can now be discredited, it doesn&#039;t mean you have to stop trying.

What you are doing to the league community is the same as what an oil tanker can do to the ocean, either keep on acting the way you are (and have some compassion and understanding for what might be said back to you), or find something else to express your anger.\n\nRemember when you were little and found $5? If that&#039;s you then that&#039;s basically the same feeling I get when I get a game without feeders and trolls.\n\nDo you think it should be like that?\n\nLooking forward to your response.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T17:08:37.936+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":">there is almost no chance of you getting out of Bronze\n\nGetting out of Bronze is easy. I was at the bottom of Bronze, wanna know how I got out? I did some reading, watched some streams, and **learned the basics of the game**. I played mainly support and jungle, solo, no duo. Once I learned the basics of the game I maintained a 65% win rate (counting games from then on, I was keeping the games in a spreadsheet at the time) until I got to mid Silver (this was a couple years ago).\n\nAt the end of the day, you WILL get bad teams that you can't win with, but that evens out once you play enough (50+ games) so in the long run (not from game to game) the only real constant is YOU.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-04T21:14:26.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Strat,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4igYMJ5W,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-04T17:08:37.936+0000)\n>\n> so in the long run (not from game to game) the only real constant is YOU.\n\n^ This is what I believe too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ben McLuckie","date":"2015-08-04T17:28:44.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, that doesn't address anything my post was referring to but thanks for your feedback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-05T00:21:41.667+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nSounds like you've had a few rough losses recently, I'm sorry that's been happening. Let me just talk to a couple of points you bought up, \n\n> As it has come to my attention, I am not good enough, yet so very good at this game; not good enough to continue my journey to Silver. I'm almost ready to give up and turn into a troll, a troll feeder, a feeding troll and a troll shaman.\n\nPlease don't resort to trolling or feeding, if you have been experiencing it in your games you know what it feels like. Don't spread that kind of behaviour. Two wrongs dont make a right.\n\n> Sorry innocent people who are so eager to climb the ladder but even you nubs (no intended) can relate to what I'm saying. Unless you're placed into a decent bracket to begin with, there is almost no chance of you getting out of Bronze.\n\nPlease don't punish innocent players for the wrong doings of trolls. I would also like to point out that while you may have had a few bad games recently you are actually 10 wins/ 10 losses in your last 20 games which is not bad (you actually have a 51% win rate overall in ranked 313W/ 305L).\n\n> I've said to many people and many people agree with me that there should be an 18+ version of league, for people who have completely developed brains and have learnt some respect, dignity, initiative, \n\nI said this in [another comment](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Q2HLQ31e-the-new-report-system-is-an-absolute-laugh-gj-guys?comment=0002) but;\n\n[51% of players are between 19 and 25 years old](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2013/10/league_of_legends_infographic_800.jpg) - 2013\n[60% are enrolled in or have completed some University](http://majorleagueoflegends.s3.amazonaws.com/lol_infographic.png) - 2012\n\nA large proportion of our players are over 20. \nA large proportion of our players are in or have completed university\n\n> Which is the result of many reports that I've had for calling someone retarded after doing something stupid.\n> \n> (When I say something stupid I'm referring to them not knowing something that I know and when I call them retarded it's my way of saying that they weren't thinking at the time or they're just being completely ignorant either on purpose or because of laziness.)\n\nYou talk about respect and dignity earlier but you call other players \"retards\" after doing something stupid? I'm sorry but I completely disagree with this if you know something they don't instead of calling them names just give them some constructive criticism. Not only is that the right thing to do from a respect and dignity perspective but even if you don't care about respecting people you don't know think about these two scenarios.\n\n**1: Teammate does something wrong, you call him names. **\nA) You tilt your own team mate, and he will start playing worse because he is distracted and offended and put down by you.\nB) Either he knows he made a mistake and you berating him doesn't help or \nC) he doesn't know how the mistake happened (doesn't know what you know) and you call your team mate names instead of helping him. He makes the same mistake again in the same game.\n\nOR\n\n**2: Teammate does something wrong, you give helpful constructive criticism**\nA) He doesn't listen to you and plays about the same, maybe a bit tilted cause this player doesnt like criticism\nB) He already knows and ignores\nC) He didn't know and you helped prevent him learn.\n\nOR\n\nYou could say nothing and just let them learn on their own without tilting them\n\nScenario is 1 is not only a bit disrespectful, but it also doesn't help you win games.\n\n>  I just think maybe instead of expressing to yourself through feeding someone elses game that you take some time out away from league or play normals instead of ranked, or maybe just get a bunch of guys/girls together and play some custom 5v5s or 3v3s and get it out of your system.\n\nIMO players shouldn't intentionally feed in any game mode =P but yeah custom games are a pretty good alternative.\n\n---\n\nI've looked at a few of your past games through match history, you seem like a decent player that can climb man. But what's holding you back isn't trolls and feeders (in fact if anything they help you odds while climbing). But it looks like your attitude needs a bit of adjustment. Check out this video it is a good explanation on what kind of mindset you should have when playing ranked.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc","replies":[{"poster":"GonewiIdwithfire","date":"2015-08-05T10:26:59.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^^Could not have said it better, commenting here for future reference.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Not Gosu","date":"2015-08-05T08:43:08.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best advice anyone can ever offer you, is that you are your own worst enemy.
