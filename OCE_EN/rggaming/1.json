I play decently with all champs on locked screen and yet this is the first moba game I&#039;ve played and I find it so hard to adjust to playing with my screen unlocked can someone please assist me in providing more info on this such as: \r\n\r\nHotkeys - I know space can bring you back to your champ and if you hold it, it&#039;s like playing lock screen. If their are any other keys could I please get that info.\r\nTips - I know that lowering mouse and game sensitivity can help me practice but are their also any other methods?\r\nGame - If u wouldn&#039;t mind showing me in game tutorials or gamers to recommend it really helps.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve also been playing lee sin and katarina recently and I see that when I wanted to kill someone who&#039;s under tower that is really low I went to flash then shunpo as kat and the locked screen moved as I flashed so my cursor had slightly moved off its target when I wanted to shunpo in for the kill (I still got the kill after I flashed anyways). This play has been tempting to try playing with my screen unlocked and I can see the advantages it has to advancing my gameplay in the future, It would be a big help If someone could really assist me in these areas but other than that thank you for your time and I&#039;m open to suggestions. &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-07-29T05:57:03.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Krepo (former Pro Support player) played with a Lock Screen. It's not the worst, but being able to play without it helps.\n\nYou can rebind the spacebar to be a Toggle lockscreen instead of having to hold it.\n\nWhen i decided to change myself to non-locked I just played vs AI for a bit.
