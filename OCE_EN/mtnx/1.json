I originally thought this was fine until I hit level 31 (after many games) and received much, much less then I would have with the &quot;old&quot; system. This new system is very unrewarding and it seems that at higher levels we are going to have to start paying RP for new champions &#039;*_shiver runs down spine_*. I would not want to see players leaving because of this fact but it may indeed become a big problem. It would be nice if we could have back the &quot;old&quot; system of earning BE after games but still having a nice little reward for levels. \n\nThis isn&#039;t a trashpost to riot but a request for the better of Leagues future. I have been fine with the new runes and find them fun as a supp main. But please make a change for the good :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nEdit 1 (_The Maths_):\nAfter looking at other boards and asking some friends I have found the **most people are getting around 600BE**. It takes an average of around 10 games to level up (30-31). That is like earning 60 BE per game and this includes first win of the day. 60 BE per game is much less then the old system where 76-145 BE was awarded per game giving an average of 110.5 . Playing ten games with an average of 110.5 gives us 1105BE. When we add the First win of the day bonus it adds to 1255BE. This is double of the new system. This is the soul reason I am annoyed by the update. \n\nEdit 2 (_Level 32_):\nI got three champion shards this time : Warwick, Master Yi and Anivia. This gave a grand total of around 800 BE. A total of on average 400 less BE then the previous update. Even if I am just very unlucky, this luck is not fair for when I grind the same amount as others.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-07T10:39:08.092+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I understand of the new system, you have a better chance at getting higher \"quality\" (rather, cost) items from higher levels (you'll get different chances/loot from levels 1-10 than 30-40 or 70-80, for example) and certain milestones (such as every 10 or every 5 levels, and/or \"significant\" levels like 30 and 50), so it may just be the case that you got unlucky with your loot in this case. It would be a god idea to give the system a chance, rather than assuming it's all around terrible from 1 level when you'll probably be able to hit another 5-10 over the next week or two and be able to get a better idea of what the system is really like.","replies":[{"poster":"DBDSMOOTHIE","date":"2017-11-07T12:59:22.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So what all the lvl 30 players miss out on the rewards from 1-30? just because they grinded before the new system. also i didnt even get my blue essence that i was meant to get from the conversion from ip to BE also with the new lvl up system to earn BE it makes it even harder to buy champions cause we are not earning any BE for playing games we only have a RNG chance to get either a Very Low amount Or a High amount dependent on the luck of the player - Rather than the old system with a garenteed minimum of about 71 i think it was - 120 ip or up to 220 if you had the first win of the day. in my opinion either the rewards from the lvl up system need to be buffed or set or the exp to get to each level needs to be nerfed because i have played about 7-8 games and im still not even lvl 31, so i have earnt no BE for the day which in the old system i would have earnt around 700-1000 ip just for playing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MTNX","date":"2017-11-07T10:47:07.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I completely understand with what you are saying, and i agree I should give it more time.

It did also take me around 10 games to level up and with the old system i would have got an average of 110.5 BE per game. Which adds up to 1105 BE (double the amount i got) and _not_ including first win of the day which gives from memory around 150 IP/BE. I will admit I may have gotten unlucky and should have given this some more time however getting nearly half the old one is rather sad {{item:3070}} \nThanks for sharing your thoughts :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-07T10:13:57.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in other words, it's not even similar for those that only play 1 win a day, and you just don't have to pay for runes.\n\nAnd your basically forced to get random champions that you can easily get.","replies":[{"poster":"MTNX","date":"2017-11-07T10:39:34.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen so far, it is either you get lucky and get your wanted champion in a shard or grind for a LONG time to unlock them or purchase RP from rito\n{{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
