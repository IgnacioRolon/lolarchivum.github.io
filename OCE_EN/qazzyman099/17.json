I&#039;m not sure if these are intentional but things like {{summoner:51}}  {{summoner:35}} {{item:2424}} {{item:3513}} {{item:3042}} {{item:3633}} {{item:3048}} {{item:2420}} are repeated. Some things also have the wrong picture like {{item:3673}} which is enchantment: runic echoes.","replies":[]}
