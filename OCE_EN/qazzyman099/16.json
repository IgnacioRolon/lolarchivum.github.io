He dc&#039;d. It was at the 1 minute mark, in  a ranked game. I thought it would be fine, we could just remake. The game didnt give us the option. We lost the game and i lost lp. RITO GIVE ME MY LP BACK PLEASE","replies":[{"poster":"Astara","date":"2018-12-14T11:06:32.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't going to adjust LP for anyone's game. They can't just remake every single game with a dc or an afk. No one would climb because half the games would be \"remakes\". They are being generous by giving us the chance to avoid LP losses from games where players never connect. They used to not even have that option.","replies":[]}]}
