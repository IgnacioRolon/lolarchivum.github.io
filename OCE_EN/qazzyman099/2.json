Since the e is physical damage, but you need the ap to make your ratios and poke work. The traps get disabled by vision trinket, so you need to be creative in placement. You need both magic and armour pen, you need ap. If your team gets harassed too much by poke, it becomes far harder to assassinate anyone.\n\nIt takes a fair amount of shaco experience and a large amount of general experience to make shaco work in aram, compared to someone like Ashe or Velkoz, who don't need to deviate much from standard builds and playstyle to be very effective (though a cheeky serated dirk and w max on ashe is very good at getting alot of early pressure).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Pandadude123","date":"2018-11-08T08:28:18.900+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes it be like that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-08T10:41:11.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all about the champion.\nIts not that hard to get S's with champs like Sol because no one plays him, and when random people get him on ARAM, they have no idea what to do.\nBut get a champ like Vel'Koz or Veigar, and you'll have to try a lot harder to beat the average score of that champ.\n\nAnd probably the biggest factor is CS.\n\nIf he spent the game smashing minions with his AoE, he will get an S much easier than someone with no AoE, or someone who ignored minions.","replies":[]}]}
