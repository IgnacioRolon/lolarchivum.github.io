That usually has a big effect on grade. Eg. per my experience, 3/1/3 at 15 mins on Cait is an S-, but 9/1 at 25mins isn't. Also, grade is determined by your score vs other players score. Maybe you feel like you did really good, but it compares it with other people. If lots of other people have done better, you will not get an S.","replies":[{"poster":"qazzyman099","date":"2018-10-27T05:14:34.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nobody else did extremely well on my team anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-27T05:31:52.079+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not on your team, it compares your score to other Xayah players on the server. Xayah is a hot pick right now, and has very high scores. It's graded on a bell curve, so unless you beat at least the lowest S- score, you won't get that grade, it's not just a static \"get higher than x score and get an S\".\n\nLike Icanstillfly mentioned, game time plays a significant role as well. Looking at the other CS scores this looks like it was a real long game, which drags your CS grade down a lot.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"qazzyman099","date":"2018-12-07T14:05:33.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/166444468604502016/520590818034188289/ree.JPG\ngot an a+","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-29T21:47:05.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Should have been an S, idgaf what others say.","replies":[{"poster":"Whatshisnamee","date":"2018-11-07T05:06:01.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mashallah","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vts","date":"2018-11-03T04:13:39.815+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"5.7 cs /m","replies":[]}]}
