It&#039;s mainly as a meme but if performed right i believe it might be able to get all three lanes ahead. Any opinions on it or helping tips. BTW im thinking if i go alistar jg for the cc and the other goes an early game strong damaging champ. Not sure who yet","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-12-10T09:18:42.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its fine as long as the solo bot laner knows what they are doing, otherwise its pointless. If they get denied too much, then the extra gold you get from having a 2nd jungler (and counter jungling I assume) is less than having a \"regular botlane\"\n\nI think if you go something like Gragas/Pantheon and CC chain on ganks, it could be real annoying.","replies":[]}]}
