They don't change the splash art so you'll only see it in-game. Those chromas were some of the real early ones so they aren't super distinct.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/a95X3lK.png?noredirect","replies":[{"poster":"qazzyman099","date":"2019-11-26T07:51:39.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was confused cause I didn't really look when i was in game i just saw the exact same splash art and the in-game champ looked basically the same.","replies":[]}]}]}
