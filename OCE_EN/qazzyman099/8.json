You mean the model where you spend all your time on tft instead of fixing server issues? And you ban people for using a particular word that hurts your feelings instead of banning the people that play like absolute trash? You have no business model.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-18T05:28:49.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I'm pretty sure the team that designed and is balancing TFT is not the same (though it may overlap somewhat) as the teams that work on SR.\n2. What server issues? If it's an NA thing, this isn't NA.\n3. Why can't we ban abuse in chat *and* intentional feeders/trolls/griefers/etc? Since they're both breaking the rules and both negatively impacting other people should they *both* not face consequences?\n4.
