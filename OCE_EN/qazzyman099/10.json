After completing your first provis game you will receive a provisional rank (visible only to you), this is the minimum rank you can achieve once you are formally placed.\n\nIf you have been placed before, this rank (and the rank you are formally placed at) will almost always be *lower* than your previous seasons rank.\n\nFor the next 9 games, you LP gains will be faster, you won't have to complete promotional series to advance in rank, and you cannot lose LP. You will not be placed below the minimum rank you start with.\n\nOnce you have completed those 10 provis games you will be formally placed, LP gains, losses, and promotions will return to normal, and your rank will be visible to other players.\n\n>when are they?\n\nYou will play provisional games whenever your account is unranked, so whenever you play on an account that has never been placed, or when you play ranked in a new season after the reset.","replies":[]}]}
