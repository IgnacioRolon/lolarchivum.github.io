Find 1 or 2 lanes and 1 or 2 champs and play the absolute dog shit out of them. Odds are, you'll get good enough at your chosen champ that you will draw aggro from other lanes/jgler, and if you can deal with the extra pressure, you basically win the game there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-12-15T03:20:24.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Will of Bronze is always gonna have 1 feeder \n\nBronze is toxic atm","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-12-14T02:23:46.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Git Gud, don't rely on others","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mennea ","date":"2018-12-13T12:51:42.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"look up league videos IMLS is a great youtuber for learning there are other things like reddit\nto help you with learning videos too and you can look up youtuber videos.","replies":[]}]}
