Logically, this is definitely *not* the first time you've AFKed/DCed, nor is it the first time you've been punished for it.\n\nTo put it simply, if Riot banned the other person but not you they'd be \"enabling\" retaliation through toxicity, which is something they are actively trying to avoid (and for good reason).\n\nThe right thing to do in this situation would be to play out the game as if it was any other (surrendering at the earliest convenience if that's what your team decides), then reporting the feeder in the post-game lobby. Abandoning your team because someone fed a few kills is most certainly the *wrong* thing to do, you're just making the situation worse.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesseCabbage","date":"2016-10-16T10:42:35.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dont get me wrong playing bad here and there is fine or being on tilt whatever, but running down my lane and purposely feeding someone kills to spite another player then the player that did things right gets banned like TY and ILY u scumbag","replies":[{"poster":"surferfijio","date":"2016-10-16T11:17:18.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JesseCabbage,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=eWeTt4gO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-16T10:42:35.690+0000)\n>\n> Dont get me wrong playing bad here and there is fine or being on tilt whatever, but running down my lane and purposely feeding someone kills to spite another player then the player that did things right gets banned like TY and ILY u scumbag\n\ni get this also, riot need to look more into things, i have chat restrictions for retaliating to someones toxic mouth, like getting angry and tilted and then some little sweaty butt cheeks, starts shit talking me, and i reply back, and im the bad one after its all said and done, i really dont understand, its upsetting and annoying asf, please riot just look into things more, if people are duo and they all report you when u did most likely nothing much at all, ur gonna get a 20min timer, or chat restrictions, because they all reported you. unfair asf","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-10-17T01:33:37.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> if people are duo and they all report you when u did most likely nothing much at all, ur gonna get a 20min timer, or chat restrictions, because they all reported you.\n\nThis is simply not true. The system is easily able to identify pre-mades and \"adjust\" their reports accordingly. Basically, even if a pre-made of 4 were to report you, it would effectively count as only one report.

If you demonstrated negative behaviour, and you were reported, then you will face appropriate punishment. Sometimes one report is all it takes, it depends on the severity. Any history of negativity is also taken into account, if you have been accurately reported before, then even if that behaviour was not significant enough to net you an immediate punishment, it would be counting against you here.\n\nYour behaviour was deemed negative enough by the system to warrant a chat restriction. That is true regardless of the behaviour of the rest of your team. Defending yourself is not the same as retaliation. If you demonstrate behaviour the community deems unacceptable you will be punished for it, regardless of the origin.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-16T14:01:38.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"if the behaviour is severe enough a player can skip all these other steps and simply be perma banned\"\n\nThe struggles of a 4 man premade vs 1, where they drag in the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-16T18:22:15.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is an INT/unskilled list for low elo:\n\nTop Lane: Singed, Teemo, Yasuo\nJungle: Irelia, Ivern, Lee Sin, Nidalee, Tryndamere\nMid Lane: Aurelion Sol, Azir, Fizz, Twisted Fate, Varus, Yasuo\nADC: Ashe, Draven, Teemo, Tristana, Vayne\nSupport: Bard, Blitzcrank, Lux\n\nshudder when you get those champions on your team.\n\nEdit: updates coming in","replies":[{"poster":"Razzawood","date":"2016-10-16T21:54:13.150+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Azir?\n\n\n\nAZIR?\n\nhow is azir a no skill champion?","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-17T01:17:29.823+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"unskilled != no skill","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-17T05:36:19.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, he is an INSANELY hard champion to play/master","replies":[{"poster":"WeaponizedAutizm","date":"2016-10-17T20:24:08.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Which is why Cakemeisting had him on the list of champs played by intentional feeders/unskilled people in low ELO...","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-10-18T21:07:01.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, okay didn't know that!","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-16T19:21:44.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Should add the Kayle supports who rush Nashors Tooth to that list as well","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-18T23:28:03.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could do, but I haven't seen any of those around.","replies":[{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-19T07:44:06.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Match history tells a different story","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-19T23:35:56.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Eimer Troll,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=eWeTt4gO,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-19T07:44:06.958+0000)\n>\n> Match history tells a different story\n\nSure, if you read it wrong.
