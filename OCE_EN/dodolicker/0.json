This was understandable because he was a creature who only existed to lay waste on the world. As a being of pure fiery hate, it was also understandable that he would despise the idea of trekking along the bleak bridge of the Howling Abyss. \r\n\r\nAs another biting blast of wind rocketed through Brand, he willed himself to stay strong. He eyed Trundle who trudged on in front of him with his best glowering glare, and pictured what it would be like if he could pelt the troll king with a shower of fire balls and set him ablaze. But alas, a deal was a deal, and Brand would be lying if he said he was not even the slightest bit curious as to what was wanted from him. \r\n\r\nHe thought back to a few short hours ago where he had only been casually setting a vacant field in Valoran on fire. He had been in quite a sour mood having the huts he had previously ignited put out by a certain fishy tidecaller, so when Trundle had approached him with what seemed like a mockingly pathetic gamble he had jumped at it with a scorning swagger. \r\n\r\nTrundle said something along the lines of, &ldquo;Melt my club and I&rsquo;ll let you destroy my kingdom for a day. But if you can&rsquo;t allow me the indulgence of a single favour.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSurprisingly Brand had not been able to. Then Trundle had introduced him to a little something called true ice, the unmeltable kind, the kind his club was made of.\r\n\r\nSo here was Brand, on his way to fulfil what he deemed a pointless favour, to meet with Lissandra and complete one of her requests. He was not particularly fond of the ice witch, pure refined power he respected but hers was twisted dark corruption of ice magic. \r\n\r\nBesides, he was fairly certain she did not like him, and he was a firm believer of the whole &lsquo;treat others as they treat you&rsquo; saying. \r\n\r\nSo the duo crossed the bridge and neared the entrance to Lissandra&rsquo;s dwelling. The Frostguard Citadel was built into a cliff or glacier of sorts, and as they entered Brand felt uncomfortably chilled as more magic of blackened ice washed over him with each step he took. Further into her residence they walked, until at last they reached a polished throne of glazed dark frost which upon she sat. Brand had heard rumours of her inability to see, so when Lissandra smiled a knowing smile in their direction he wondered how she got around.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I have brought with me who I deemed most suitable, Brand the burning vengeance.&rdquo; Trundle said in a gravelly voice. &ldquo;He awaits your request.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBrand did not like the idea of &lsquo;awaiting someone&rsquo;s request,&rsquo; however there was nothing he could say to dispute the troll king&rsquo;s words so he just silently simmered. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Brand.&rdquo; Lissandra acknowledged, her voice piercingly frigid. &ldquo;You know of the cryophoenix, do you not?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe answered this with a nonchalant incline of his head. Of course he knew of Anivia. The meddling little hatchling insisted on guarding her lands and giving him a hard time. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Accompany me to destroy her and her home.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nNow things had just gotten very interesting. \r\n\r\nSo Brand journeyed with the ice witch through the Icespike Mountains towards the slope where the cryophoenix had made her nest, while Trundle and a select team of his warband navigated behind them. The mountains were every bit as daunting as they sounded, with the terrain being cold and wet and treacherous. However Lissandra was a manipulator of the ice elements, and Brand&rsquo;s power which already originated from Frelijord was burning bright at the mere thought of vengeance, so they made their way through unchallenged. \r\n\r\nThey were nearing Anivia&rsquo;s home when something unexpected occurred. A glistening object approached them from a distance, leaving behind a trail of light. It streamed past them with the swiftness of a coursing river and exploded in a shower of gleaming lustre. Brand had encountered Ashe&rsquo;s hawkshot before, and it was obvious Lissandra had as well. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Curses.&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;The foolish frost archer is here, pick up the pace!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThey climbed with increased urgency, but soon found that they need not have done so. For when they reached the slope of the cryophoenix&rsquo;s inhabitancy, Anivia was awaiting them there with the company of Nunu and Willump, and Ashe with a handful of her tribe.   \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Greetings, what brings you to this part of Frelijord on this bitter night?&rdquo; Ashe asked. \r\n\r\nHer tone was bland enough, yet her eyes were cold as steel and her grip on her enchanted weapon was rigid. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I am not here for brainless discussion.&rdquo; Lissandra sneered in reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve killed so many queens I&rsquo;ve lost count! Surrender, my triumph is inevitable.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe frost archer&rsquo;s lips pursed a little at this and her stance stiffened, but her voice was still calm when she spoke again. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Peace requires a steady hand. I ask again, what are you here for tonight?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBrand had nothing against the young queen, in fact he admired her persistent personality and steady aim. The thought of attacking her did not sit right with him, so he decided he would try to ignore her for the duration of the unavoidable fight. Instead he cocked his head at Anivia and when she locked eyes with him they begun a very high paced staring contest. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;We are here to destroy the cryophoenix by the name of Anivia.&rdquo; the ice witch declared. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well we as her friends cannot permit you to do so.&rdquo; Nunu answered. Willump, his yeti friend, bared his teeth in agreement. \r\n\r\nThe corner of Lissandra&rsquo;s mouth lifted, and Brand could have sworn he saw a flash of something akin to fangs before she hissed &ldquo;Slaughter them!&rdquo; and the world descended into chaos. \r\n\r\nHe targeted Anivia immediately, hauling a brilliant sphere of fire at her in an attempt to cripple one of her wings. However she was up in the air because it had the chance to even graze the air close to her. Then Nunu directed Willump to charge at him. \r\n\r\nIt was a ferocious battle of searing balls of fire versus blasts of ice. Brand erupted pillar after pillar of fire, and spread conflagration everywhere without care for the devastation he was causing. Nunu the yeti rider and Willump repaid him back blow for blow. But no matter the strength of the bond between creature and boy, a mistake or miscommunication of sorts was bound to occur especially in the high stakes of battle against the violent exterminator who was Brand. \r\n\r\nWhen it did Brand was quick to strike, and as he stood above them about to deliver the fatal blow, a sadistic smirk pulled at his mouth.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;The inferno begins.&rdquo; he taunts. &ldquo;You should not have gotten in my way.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nHe had just enough time to see Nunu&rsquo;s eyes widen with terror before a heavy shaft of ice slammed into his right shoulder and frost formed at his feet. Ashe already had another arrow nocked into her enchanted bow when Brand looked up. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You cannot win this battle.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is no trust between your allies, leave us Brand before you suffer the consequences.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Death is the only obstacle that will stop me.&rdquo; Brand proclaimed lowly. &ldquo;Run before you encounter the fires of vengeance!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nHowever some untouched part of him was still hesitant on hurting the young frost archer, and Ashe must have noticed his wavering thoughts because her expression softened before she said, &ldquo;Do not confuse mercy for weakness.&rdquo; Then there was a brief flash and stirring of cold, before an impassable wall of ice materialised between Brand and the three Frelijordans and hovering cryophoenix. \r\n\r\nTrue to Ashe&rsquo;s words, moments later as her tribe gained ground, Trundle gave a bellow of sorts which must have been a signal to fall back, and the troll king and his subjects vanished into the blistering unknown. Everything that was happening was putting Brand into a sourly destructive mood again, so he turned on the only creature left who was within easy grasp, Lissandra. \r\n\r\nHe flung a simple ball of fire at her. She shrieked in outrage when it came into contact with the side of her face, and this made Brand laugh. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she jeered. &ldquo;You really picked the wrong side.&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Come at me.&rdquo; he answered, beckoning with a mocking finger. \r\n\r\nHe leapt into what he anticipated as a scorchingly full-on battle, however things soon turned on him when she motioned with a hand and suddenly ice began creeping up his limbs and encasing him in a deadly tomb. He tried his hardest to melt the foul rime that was beginning to freeze him solid but the power of blackened ice was too strong. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Close your eyes and let the cold take you.&rdquo; Lissandra whispered, her eyes flashing daggers. \r\n\r\nAll Brand had enough time for was one last hate filled glance, before all he knew grew dark.","replies":[{"poster":"B00M","date":"2016-07-09T15:21:21.979+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"that was truly inspiring.
