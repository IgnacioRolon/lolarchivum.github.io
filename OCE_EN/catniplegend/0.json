It would be like playing a different game. See how different it is from today, and test all the bugs like blitz pull revive and teleport Darius pulls etc.","replies":[{"poster":"CatnipLegend","date":"2014-12-16T14:03:46.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or the lee sin cross map kicks :D","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-12-16T14:31:03.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CatnipLegend,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KE5eafMa,comment-id=0001000000000000,timestamp=2014-12-16T14:03:46.007+0000)\n>\n> Or the lee sin cross map kicks :D\n\nIndeed friend that would be the day.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CatnipLegend","date":"2014-12-17T08:40:52.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where all the riot members at, this needs to happen for all that is holy!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-16T16:45:10.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be cool if they released them and made you host yourself or something.
