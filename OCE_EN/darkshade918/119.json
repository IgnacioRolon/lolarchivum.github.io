The young boy Edwin decided on his 16th Birthday, announced he was leaving Demacia for a life of adventure, little did he know that leaving Demacia was one of the worst decisions he was going to make, as Edwin walked out the giant golden gleaming gates of Demacia, a young girl learning the art of light magic under Lux the lady of luminosity, spoke to him and asked if she could join him on his venture he agreed to let her come along and within 5 minutes of being accepted on this venture the girl vanished and reappeared ready to leave, she had her spell book that originally belonged to Lux and the other necessities that would be needed outside the city’s wall.\r\n\r\nAfter 2 days outside of the brilliant city of Demacia they came across the great barrier to the lands below, Edwin being the shy boy he was said ‘we shouldn’t cross the barrier’ and the young girl Fae said ‘are you a chicken or something, come on its an adventure, you’re meant to do things that you wouldn’t normally do’ Edwin agreed, this was a decision he would regret for eternity. At the highest point of the barrier Edwin slipped losing sight of Fae, when he finally regained his grip he looked around for the young girl, she was nowhere to be found, he called her name, and there was no response. By now Edwin was panicking, he caught a glimpse of the red jacket she was wearing, he walked carefully over to it, he picked it up, a note was left ‘if you want her back come and find her’ the address was Noxus and was and signed by talon of the crimson elites. Edwin vowed to find Fae at any cost, however he was bleeding heavily, he didn’t know why, then he thought back to his fall, and realized he had cut his lower eye socket, he believed his fall was not an accident he was pushed by one of the crimson elites.\r\n\r\nFae’s Supplies were on the ground in the pack she had been carrying, he patched up his injury, and he now had a scar from the lower eye socket to his right ear. Now recognizing himself as Scarface the bringer of vengeance. After Fae’s kidnapping Scarface trained himself to assassinate his opponents whilst remaining strong enough to take a hit, once he believed he was ready he returned to Demacia, and went to Fiora the Grand Duelist’s school of dueling, and challenged her to a battle, easily besting her, he left Demacia heading to Noxus, to exact his vengeance.\r\n\r\nPassive – Iron Skin\r\n10% of attack damage is turned into armor\r\n\r\nQ – Lightning Rush 10/9/8/7/6 Second Cooldown\r\nScarface gets a rush of adrenaline to chase down an opponent(s) increasing movement speed by 5/10/15/20/25, if an enemy is killed whilst this is active lasting 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5 Seconds, the Cooldown is reduced by half\r\n\r\nW – Blazing blade 15/14/13/12/11 Second Cooldown\r\nScarface draws his dagger and launches an empowered basic attack on the enemy dealing 25/45/55/65/75 increased damage.
