So, the best thing to start you off on the right path is get out there and start making stuff. In a perfect world, you make something, and then Riot reaches out to YOU ( which does happen, talent acquisition is a big deal )\n\nAs Seras stated above, Riot in LA ( as well as some EU offices ) do take on Interns, some of which go on to be hired by Riot, however Riot has a very strong history of favoring people who have an easy on boarding process. That means, people who are legal citizens of the place taking on the Interns. There are some very rare exceptions, but it'd be bad odds to gamble on an internship conducted with a working visa.\n\nAnother unfortunate point is that Riot based in OCE is downscaling a bit, with their focus being on their Broadcasting and Esports departments. Last year saw a fair few high profile Rioters leave Riot OCE, and there's been no public word on who / if they are having someone else take over that same role. ( Marauder, Mastermirkinen, and Loote were great people, I can't wait to see what's on next for them )\n\nWith that being said, there's a very common mantra and saying that comes from most Rioters you'll ask about this. There is no \"Road to Riot\". Some get in via their work, some get in via their connections, some get in because they're at the right place at the right time. The best thing you can do currently is work on improving yourself and getting a great professional portfolio down. Then, whether it's a friend in the right place, an elevator pitch at a convention, or a random application submission, you'll be in a much stronger position.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n~J","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-15T09:41:12.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm not a red, I'll see if I can maybe get Achenar to offer some input for you, but off the bat I can tell you that ppretty much all of those sorts of positions are based in central (NA), and would therefor involve moving. There may be very limited positions available for localisation, but I don't think that's particularly what you're after. There's a list of available positions at each office here also: https://www.riotgames.com/en/work-with-us/offices\n\nI also know that Riot do internships in central but I don't know the details of that process.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2018-06-16T10:26:30.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Darkshade!\n\nSo I'm not in Narrative myself but will point you towards[ a post on the NA boards](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/story-art/AHwU8e1q-a-question-about-writing-lore-and-writing-for-video-games-in-general?comment=0001) where one of our narrative writers answered some similar questions a few months ago!\n\nThe best advice I can give is that the best way to show that you're passionate and talented is to get out there and _do things_. Write, and share your work on platforms where folk can give you feedback! Be open to that feedback and use it as a tool to improve. Create worlds and stories and share them. Build a portfolio that showcases all the different styles and methods you can use to tell a story - because ultimately when a role opens up, at Riot or elsewhere - that's what you'll need to prove you've got what it takes.\n\n(This applies across almost anything, I think - not only writing! Being able to prove that you're not only passionate, but proactive enough to DO something with that passion, puts you above all those people who are super passionate but plan to start 'tomorrow'.)\n\nRegarding writing contests: I definitely hope to run some more in the near future!
