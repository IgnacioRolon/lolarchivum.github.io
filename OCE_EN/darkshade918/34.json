Champions like Vi, Warwick, Lissandra, etc. If you only have one champ with an ability guaranteed to interrupt her ult then the enemy team is going to catch on to it very quickly and just obliterate that champ at the start of every teamfight.  If you go against a Kat with the right comp you can easily render her useless.\n(The best example I can think of this was about 6 months ago playing Panth mid with J4 Jungle, Vayne Ad, Chode top and Janna support, the Kat was rendered to just cannon fodder, as the second she tried to ult she'd just get cc'd to death) obviously that sort of coordination is very difficult in solo q, and people just seem to tunnel on their own champion pick rather than trying to pick champions that either counter champions on the enemy team or give you more tools to deal with them, if you've already got Yi jungle and Fedora top then picking a champ with no teamfight potential or lockdown isn't going to help you when there's a fed Talon decimating your team, even Malzahar is excellent for dealing with snowballing enemy champs. But I think you should always go into games expecting to go against a champ with either ridiculous mobility or massive snowball potential, so you should try and always ensure your team comp has some form of hard cc for dealing with champions like that and if all else fails take that responsibility yourself. 10/0 Katarina is a lot easier to kill whilst she's getting ulted by Warwick :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T17:03:02.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just thoes champs that are powerful even if they loose lane","replies":[]}]}
