The turret was shooting across the whole lane from spawn to the enemy, but the shots did no damage, and granted no assist when they died. The turret was also inactive (I wasn't in range for it to be shooting).","replies":[]},{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-22T06:27:20.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive seen this bug, but its just a graphical bug. The tower keeps attacking the person even if they run to the otherside of the map until that tower is replaced,  destroyed, you move too far away from it  and it becomes deactivated or it targets something else.  \n\nIt probably occur's 1 in every 1000 turrents that are placed.\n\nThe person being hit by the  tower doesnt take any damage from it, once they have left the \"tower range\".\n\nIf the person died when he was out of the tower range, it was probably a damge over time effect that killed him or a minion....etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2014-12-22T06:19:09.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The bullets already in flight should follow the target after they leave its range, but it should stop shooting more bullets, also they do last for a few seconds after you die before turning off.\n\nor am i misunderstanding the situation?","replies":[]}]}
