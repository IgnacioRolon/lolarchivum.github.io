It would contain like 5 or 6 randomly selected live matches across different maps and modes at any given time ready for viewing at your finger tips, and I think it prioritise showing high elo matches too.\n\nThen Riot removed it (probably in favour of more promotional panels), and for some reason without announcing/explaining anything whatsoever when that happened too, which is just mind boggling.\n\nPlease bring public spectate back please, Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-08T09:17:12.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ohhh yeah I remember that, I didn't even realise Riot removed that what the hell that was so good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-02-09T10:47:02.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would be correct lol, i've been round since season 3 client and i've become more entertained by OPL/NALCS etc so i want to watch them in yolo queue and see how they perform, unfortunately the old client is busted for me and i can't go back to it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-02-08T08:29:44.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can do this in the old client if you go to your leagues tab, then click on the tab where it says \"top ranked players\" and scroll down the list to see who is in a game.\n[\nYou're likely to see clown fiestas like this though.](http://imgur.com/a/8rsdj)","replies":[]}]}
