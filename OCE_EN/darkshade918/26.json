If he's not stronger than literally every other ADC when mastered then there's absolutely no reason to play him other than to show off. Plus he has an obscene amount of required knowledge to play not only as him, but also _against_ him, something that violates one of Riot's core champion design principles ever since 2009. The kind of disaster release only CertainlyT could create.","replies":[]}]}
