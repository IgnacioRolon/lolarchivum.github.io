Mages that can cheese their way into that role don't count. Plus even when you have Brand support, they have to waste a little gold and give up the pressure of mid lane which is why they will only shine in team fights, unless they are fed enough to 1v1 the enemy adc. Annie would probably be the best candidate, and Zyra is very strong, but they can't carry in a 1v5 situation because at least some of them is dependent upon setting something up, they can't carry the way a Nasus or something can.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-28T19:10:25.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of my friends is a platinum support main and the rest of us are bronze to low silver (I'm probably around low bronze last I checked) but he can still carry 4 of us so hard that we can beat full teams of mid gold players when he plays thresh or zyra through making picks, raw damage and cc, and shotcalling with or without voicecoms (using pings and ingame chat).\n\nIt is quite possible to 1v5 hard carry bronzies without playing a hyper carry solo laner (I won't lie, it helps), though admittedly you have to be really good to do so and also have a good amount of contempt for your teammates so that you don't begin to rely on them.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-12-29T08:38:10.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, but my point is if you were all afk he couldn't carry. Even though he is doing everything, he can't do enough damage or push hard enough to carry, he needs his team to do stuff no matter how bad they are. I'm not saying it has to be a hyper solo carry laner, but someone like Thresh can't 1 one shot someone and can't split push, they can only land godlike hooks and plays which as a result carry the game, but it's not a 1v5 situation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2016-12-26T10:02:13.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chill out in norms.\n\nBut yeah, idk either.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-12-26T10:03:40.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bKwNFeT4,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-26T10:02:13.377+0000)\n>\n> Chill out in norms.\n\nBut i enjoy ranked (when i get decent teams both enemy and allied) if only there was a way short of boosting to avoid cancerous bronze","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-27T19:20:15.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or play an assassin jungler and dominate.
