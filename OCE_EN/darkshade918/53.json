The one war he should never have medalled in was one that noxus could have won had he not destroyed half of the war camp. \r\n\r\nAs noxus were about to win a war against demacia and take some land and then proceed to the city centre was interrupted by a man in a suit of iron armour charging into the fight killing hundreds of noxians and demacians alike, he then proceeded to charge into the war camp and knock walls and support beams down completely destroying the important buildings of noxus, as soon as the rubble cleared and the smoke disappeared the remainder of noxus’ warriors who were in the infirmary had been knocked off their beds onto the ground unable to be healed due to the carers being knocked out cold\r\n\r\nAs juggernaut sees what he did, he lets out a bellowing laugh, suddenly he is unconscious and woke up in a cell of sorts with an axe wielding man towering over him. “you are hereby punished to serve the noxian army to make up for the destruction you caused to our army camp, if you fail to serve us you will be killed” as the axe wielding man walks out a scientist walks in and builds him a suit of armour that is purely indestructible and instead of him being in control the scientist is.\r\n\r\nAbilities\r\nPassive:\r\nIndestructible – While moving towards enemies he gains 10% movement speed\r\n\r\nQ - Reckless Charge 13/12/11/10/9 Second cooldown Cost 4% of Current health\r\nJuggernaut Charges in a direction dealing 25/50/75/100/125 Physical Damage (+0.2% of Movment Speed)\r\n\r\nW – Stunning Charge 20/18/16/14/12 Second Cooldown Cost 8% of Current Health\r\nJuggernaut Charges 125 Units in front of him stunning all targets hit for 1 second and dealing 50/60/70/80/85 Physical Damage (+0.5% of Movement speed)\r\n\r\nE – Explosive Charge 13/12/11/10/9 Second Cooldown Cost 5% of current health\r\nCharges towards a direction at the end of the charge explodes dealing 80/85/90/95/100 magic damage (+0.2% of Movement Speed)\r\n\r\nR – Destructive Charge 150/140/130 Second cooldown Cost 15% of Current health\r\nJuggernaut Charges forwards (500/1000/1500 units) (passing through walls) dealing 115/120/130 Physical Damage (+0.85% of Movement speed) to all units hit damage is doubled for the first enemy champion hit and halved for each consecutive enemy champion hit","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss of Souls","date":"2014-12-17T01:34:54.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like the kit\nmight need a name change","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2014-12-17T02:07:39.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Abyss of Souls,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=YjH0OIT0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-17T01:34:54.612+0000)\n>\n> like the kit\n> might need a name change\n\nSuggestions?","replies":[{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-17T17:19:06.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about Ragnarok, or Rampage??
