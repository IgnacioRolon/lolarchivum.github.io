Don't play any account you're trying to climb on, have an account you don't care about for holidays. Kids have poor decision making abilities, short tempers, low emotional IQs and poor communication skills. This is in life in general, not just in league. It's a terrible set of traits for any activity that relies heavily on team work and keeping a level head though.","replies":[{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-06-26T10:30:04.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When does the school holidays finish?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-06-20T21:54:39.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to support life, where yesterday, most players in silver were monkeys, even players on the winning teams.
