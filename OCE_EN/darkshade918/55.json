First hint of toxicity and they get muted.\nIf you aren't happy with muting, then reporting will help relieve the stress after the game.\n\nAt the end of the day, never take those people's words to heart. They need to feel better about their gaming skill, because they struggle in the real world. Most of them are either stressed or have aggressive personalities.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noodlecake","date":"2016-03-31T15:21:52.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't care...just give them your money...play and stfu","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-03-31T23:45:09.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Noodlecake,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=dBpIfXOV,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-03-31T15:21:52.672+0000)\n>\n> Riot don't care...just give them your money...play and stfu\n\n*cough* toxic *cough*, this is what im talking about thank you for prooving my point\n\nRIOT TAKE THIS PLAYER AWAY\n\n*sirens in the background*","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-29T13:16:40.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes we get a bit of tall poppy syndrome here on oce.

Perhaps they were struggling with a champion fight and you happened to take the kill (not saying you KS'd, but just proved to be better in that scenario)? \n\nEither way it's good you reported them. I would always do so when it comes down to threats and abuse like that. Otherwise, I tend to avoid getting caught in the banter, they are either jealous or just frustrated by your game play in some way. At least you were getting raged at for doing WELL! \n\nIf not, you can't always have a good game.
