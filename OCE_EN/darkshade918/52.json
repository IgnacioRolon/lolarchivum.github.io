The injured man spoke up, “my name is malzahar, I am a prophet, I am here to bring tainted to the void” He coughed and spluttered, “You need to be still and get some rest before you are ready to continue to talk” Clarissa said in a calm voice.\r\n\r\nThe next day malzahar was not in his bed and clarissa woke to him at her bedside, “come to the void with me, we need a healer who can work with us void people” he stated, this confused her, “what is the void” she said “not what, where” malzahar spoke. “Soon” the voices in her head spoke, malzahar spoke “indeed, just come with me to the void and I will show you the voices” before clarissa could respond a portal opened up right in front of her and she was dragged through.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the void an entity appeared “thank you malzahar” he boomed, “clarissa can you help us and heal us so we can wage war on the inhabitants of this pitiful land” now tainted by the void clarissa has the ability to destroy and heal any of those who she chooses.
