I don't mean ruined as unplayable, I mean ruined the experience for myself. It's like how people say even the slightest change to Katarina will either make her asinine or ruin her completely.\n\nThe Karma rework, was one of the few I was disappointed with, to be honest. I'd love to see her reworked again to use her fans, as they were cool.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-04T00:28:39.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn Sup.
