Please explain to me, why someone who barely made silver 2 this season, is getting matched with gold+ players, who then abuse the shit out of me for being bad, when clearly they are higher rank than me.\r\n\r\nWhy/How is this fair?","replies":[{"poster":"JustGumbae","date":"2017-11-06T07:54:31.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i made a post asking bout this, got no response, sadly that's just how league is for normals, the parametres of similar mmr is whacked when it comes to norms, they just add up the average regardless of tier leagues, however in ranked its almost identical sadly, i actually hate norms,  as a new player i had to vs people completely better then me, so i just jumped in my placements , decided to learn the game in ranked, even though i am loosing a lot, it's better then having such a cluster fuck of elo's in norms, \n\ni dont believe its a population issue either, it's just how league (normal is) ive reviewed so many of my friends games in norms, and compare them to there ranked games and its so whacked, a challenger player could easily have a 95% wr in norms and 51% in ranked truth!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fl√∫ffy","date":"2017-11-06T07:01:08.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"guessing you play normals and not ranked shit happens better chance for you to learn against better players anyway","replies":[]}]}
