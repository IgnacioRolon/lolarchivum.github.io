Ending this reform period requires consistent displays of good sportsmanship. Your reform period isn't over after a specific number of games, or after a certain date, but is completely dependent upon your behavior.\n\nThe short FAQ section also has some answers\n\n>Why can't you tell me exactly when I'm going to be eligible?\n\n>Eligibility is dependent on a consistent display of good sportsmanship, not just \"be nice in X number of games or days.\" Negative behavior during this reform period will cause it to last longer.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n>How long does it usually take for someone to be eligible again?\n\n>There is no specific timeframe for eligibility, and the length of the reform period may vary on a case by case basis. It all depends on the severity of your punishment, and on your behavior moving forward.\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-25T15:31:04.841+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Smelly Sandwich","date":"2016-06-26T05:26:55.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until you are      _**R   E   F   O   R   M   E   D**_ {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:119}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-23T05:42:15.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They last until you have a good behaviour period, and i believe that is based on the amount of games you play more than an amount of time.\n\nEssentially, just don't be an ass and you will get it back eventually.","replies":[]}]}
