Lets make it a little more lively and get to know each other a little bit (as a community should)\r\n\r\nWith that, i pose a few questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is your most memorable gaming experience? (speedruns/nuzlockes/outplays etc.)\r\n2. What was the earliest game you played? (Was it on the old consoles, was it a favorite game etc.)\r\n3. What was your very first experience with games? Was it on Console or Computer?\r\n\r\nFor me, my most memorable gaming experience came when i was about 9 years old, the Sega Mega Drive had just been released, as far as I&#039;ve been told (my memory is fairly dodgy) i was so excited for it, that the minute i got it for Christmas, i played it for 8 hours straight, prior to this i hadn&#039;t played too many games.\r\n\r\nThe earliest game i remember playing was the original Age of Empires games (still love them to this day), and as for the mega drive, i played a game called Zoom, and of course Sonic the Hedgehog (i still play these two games too, we have the reloaded version of the Mega Drive, since we don&#039;t have the attachments for the old one)\r\n\r\nSo how about you guys/girls?\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}
