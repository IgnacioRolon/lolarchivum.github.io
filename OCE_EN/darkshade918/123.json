So i'm gonna start with the bad stuff, and move onto the good stuff at the end\r\n\r\n**The Bad Stuff**\r\n\r\n_No Tutorial_\r\n\r\nUnless i completely missed it, there isn't any in game tutorial that explains what to do.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is the **First** Game for every player should revolve around a 3 round mini-game, that covers\r\n\r\n* Ranking up a champ (ie. you need 3 Bronze for Silver, and 3 Silver for a Gold), and the Purchasing System (Possibly even the Shared Draft)\r\n* Combining Items (ie. Tear and Chain Vest = Frozen Heart), and the explanation of how those items work (With Indicators)\r\n* The Combination System (Such as 6 Assassins = 350% Crit Damage)\r\n\r\nCovering these things means newbies aren't thrust into a game without a semblance of knowledge of how to play, and experience players can learn the best positioning for a champion equipped with an Item like Zeke's or Frozen Heart, using the indicator as a guide\r\n\r\n_RNG _\r\n\r\nThis is a big one, there were many games were i couldn't break into fourth, because of Item Differences. So many games i spent waiting for items from the Minion Fights, and got nothing, whilst at LEAST one of my opponents already had two full items, before the second shared draft. This is extremely unfair, and at least from the first wave all should be granted at least one FULL item\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is grant every player a **MINIMUM ** of  **1 Item** from each wave of minions at the end of each Round. This means that the RNG troll that grants some people multiple full items before the first PvP have an equal chance, and it comes down to skill, not luck.\r\n\r\n_Shared Draft Block Timer_\r\n\r\nI understand why this was put in place, and it functions well enough as it is, but i also don't appreciate being bound for several seconds after 2nd or 3rd Place have gone, just because i have more HP (This is mostly just me being salty about getting gold and a shit tier item, instead of a High Quality Champ with a Decent Item). \r\n\r\nSuggestion: Shorten the Block Timer, so that people who are lower on the board get an opportunity, whilst the Higher Board Players get a chance to actually fight for an item/champ, instead of just getting what's served to them\r\n\r\n_Balancing_\r\n\r\n_Classes/Origins_\r\n\r\nAssassins = Broken\r\nBlademasters = Strong, but not broken\r\nBrawlers = Weak\r\nElementalists = Weak\r\nGaurdian = Never used, at least i don't feel like i've done it properly, but it just seems weak overall\r\nRangers/Gunslingers = Weak, but swapping their bonuses makes more sense (at least to me) and will put them in a good place.\r\nSorcerers = Weak\r\nKnights = Meh\r\nShapeshifters = Haven't used, so can't make a comment\r\n\r\n\r\nDemons = Fair, the mana burn doesn't really do all that much in the long run\r\nDragons = Too hard to proc the passive, i've only ever seen Shyv **or** Aurelion, never both in the same game\r\nExile = What's the point of this, Yas sucks ass...\r\nGlacial = Broken af, being Frozen for 90% of a fight, only to get unfrozen and nailed by a Sej ult is just stupid..\r\nRobot = Blitz is broken, reduce hook range, or change targeting AI, i love losing my Gold backline in a single round of combat...\r\nImperial = Too hard to proc, and not worth it overall, when you can just multi-stack assassins to buff Kat, or stack blademasters to buff Draven, i don't use Darius because he's shit, and Swain never appears in my Drafts/Purchase bar.\r\nPirates = Not worth it, if you utilise the interest mechanic, the bonus gold isn't worth that much overall\r\nYordle = This is just unfair, give all the Yordles PD and their passive, and you just can't hit them while Lulu Casts all game\r\nNobles = Not Broken, but definitely too strong when combined with other classes\r\nPhantoms = Difficult to Manage, and Broken when it works\r\nNinjas = No comment, they seem fair to me\r\nVoid = Good in combination with Assassin/Ranger/Gunslinger bonuses, but weak overall\r\nWild = Seems Weak, the attack speed bonus is useless overall, unless you somehow manage a Wild/Ranger Combo (which (Without Items) requires 8 champions on the field)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Class/Origins - Buffs/Nerfs_\r\n\r\nAssassins\r\nOverall this group is just busted, there are plenty to access, and you can get yomumus and put it on another champ to turn them into one. The damage they can deal with 6 is far too high given how much access you have, and at how low tier most assassins are.\r\n\r\n* Reduction in Crit Damage, from 150% to 125%, and from 350% to 275%\r\n* Or Increase each Assassins Tier by 1, and keep the damage where it is\r\n\r\nBlademasters\r\nSo i've spent a lot of time using this combo, its silly, having Aatrox, Fio, Trist (With BotRK), and Shen just alone are strong, add into that two more Blademasters (or two more BotRK users) and you have a somewhat unkillable group.\r\n\r\n* Reduce the chances of attacking extra times from 35% to 20%, and 65% to 40%\r\n* Reduce the Survivability of Base Blademasters (No BotRK users) by a 50-150 hit points depending on Tier\r\n* Increase Base Blademaster Tiers by 1 (Except for Yasuo, since hes bad anyways)\r\n\r\nBrawlers\r\nI've only used this in conjunction with void passive, as i don't see the Brawlers as being super useful overall, the bonus health doesn't really help, and their abilities are less useful than something such as Aatrox (When he has PD and no bonuses)\r\n\r\n* Increase the Health Bonus from 300 - 500, and 700 - 1000\r\n* Swap the Brawler Passive out, for something that increase Damage Per Hit, or a Base Lifesteal bonus\r\n\r\nElementalists\r\nThis is stupid weak, and a Golem doesn't really make a difference at all, i'd rather Go Demons/Brand than have Elementalist Passive at any point.\r\n\r\n* Elementalist Passive Should Be Changed to Bonus Damage from Casting (2. Bonus Damage for Elementalists 4. Bonus Damage for All) or A Higher Rate of Mana Regen for (2. Elementalists and 4. All)\r\n\r\nGuardian\r\nI can't really make a comment on how to fix this, because i honestly can't be bothered waiting for a Guardian class until such time as more \"Guardian\" Classes are introduced (I'd class Thresh, Maokai (with old ult) and Janna under this banner)\r\n\r\nRanger/Gunslinger\r\nSo the ranger passive makes more sense on a Gunslinger, and vice versa Gunslinger Passive on Rangers. A Ranger can prep more than one arrow at a time, a gunslinger can't load an extra bullet to fire at two targets (unless you're graves, or a knock off gunslinging movie star, where you can split a bullet with a machete...)\r\n\r\n* Swap Ranger/Gunslinger Passives\r\n\r\nSorcerer\r\nI didn't find the Sorcerer passive notable, even with 6 sorcerers (1 Non-Sorcerer with Yuumi, because morg sucks absolute ass...), needs a distinct buff\r\n\r\n* 35% - 50% Spell Damage (for 3) and 100% - 150% (for 6)\r\n\r\nKnight\r\nThe damage blocking knight, how meh can it possibly be... With Morde being shithouse, Kayle being a rare drop and Leo showing once in 10 Games (yes this was an actual thing, both in my purchase bar, and in the shared draft, i can't speak for other players, but no one ran it, even with a knight/noble composition). I can't see a reason to buff or nerf it.\r\n\r\nShapeshifter\r\nBonus health???? this is already the brawler passive and it sucks...\r\n\r\n* Instead of Bonus health, just full heal them upon transformation\r\n\r\nDemons\r\nThe mana burn doesn't seem to do much, or if it does i don't notice it, regardless of whether i'm opposed to it or running it.\r\n\r\n* Give Demons a Terrify effect when they drop to a certain health level or on cast, where they scare away all adjacent enemies briefly\r\n\r\nDragons\r\nLike i stated earlier, the passive is too hard to proc, and is arguably a waste of time trying to get.\r\n\r\n* Just remove this Origin, and change Aurelion to a Noble Origin (because the star dragon is technically a noble, he says it himself) and leave shyv as shapeshifter and give her the noble passive as well\r\n\r\nExile \r\nAgain, a pointless origin, until you add Riven, in which then it should share similarities with ninjas, having exactly 1 or [However many exiles there are in lore] total\r\n \r\n* In the mean time, i'd change exile into the various Exiles lore status, Yas into Ionian (add this, and then add the rest of the Ionians), Riven (when you add her) into Imperial, and so on so forth\r\n\r\nGlacial \r\nThis is fucked, being frozen for 90% of the game is no fun, and then to get hit by Sej ult just as you get unfrozen, sucks even more\r\n\r\n* Increase the Tier of Glacial Origins by 1 (ignoring Anivia)\r\n\r\nRobot \r\nSeems fair to me, i can't fault it in anyways, and it doesn't really need a buff or nerf to the class itself, just to Blitz\r\n\r\nImperial \r\nI've never procced this because its just so lacklustre, and the individuals under this banner can be buffed by other means, making this irrelevant overall\r\n\r\n*New effect: Powerful Leadership, Minions adjacent to an Imperial increase their damage by 10%, this stacks multiple times, but doesn't affect other imperials\r\n\r\nPirates\r\nBonus gold, how about instead of bonus free gold, you take gold from your opponent, like a pirate would\r\n\r\n*New effect: A Pirate's Life for Me, after you win a game whilst having [X amount of] pirates on your field, you steal gold from your opponents pool, each pirate you control increases the amount of gold taken, up to 4.\r\n\r\nYordle \r\nThe dodge mechanic of this origin is just unfair, combined with PD, Lulu and GA, and you have an unstoppable miniature army\r\n\r\n* Increase the tier of all Yordles by 1\r\n\r\nNobles\r\nThis is only a minor annoyance, unless you combine it with guardians or blademasters.\r\n\r\n* Reduce Armour bonus to 50 and Health on Hit to 15\r\n\r\nPhantoms \r\nThe ability is meh overall, and not really worth it, reducing a champ to 100 HP is not really fair, unless it goes off on a high health opponent at that point it then becomes broken\r\n\r\n* More specific, the Highest Health Target on your opponents field is halved (Need 3 Phantoms)\r\n\r\nNinjas \r\nThe ability is self-explanatory and makes sense, no need for buffs or nerfs imo\r\n\r\nVoid \r\nThe armour ignore is nice, but it could be nicer\r\n\r\n* 75% Chance to ignore armour (or)\r\n* Attacks made by all (3) void creatures reduces armour by 10% stacking up to 50% \r\n\r\nWild\r\nThe attack speed is lacklustre\r\n\r\n* With (2) wilds, Increase Attack speed by 10% per stack, Maxing out at 60%. With (6) wilds, this attack speed is doubled on \"Wild\" champions and the base bonus is granted to all other champions on your field\r\n\r\n_Champions_\r\n\r\nSejuani - Spell is stupid strong, and far too large\r\n\r\nCho - Same boat as sej\r\n\r\nKindred - Spell is too big, and i often find no matter how i position, none of my champs are ever in it, perhaps an AI change is in order\r\n\r\nKennen - Spell is massive, but does nothing? I've literally never seen it stun anything\r\n\r\nBrand - Pyroclasm comes up too soon, otherwise is fine, perhaps reduction in Mana generation\r\n\r\nMorde - Weak, Weak, Weak, even a gold is just garbage, his cast never comes up by the time he's about to die\r\n\r\nKha - Isolation is very difficult to proc, but when it does, instakilling something just isn't fair\r\n\r\nPyke - Cast is too long, and stun lasts too long. Halve both\r\n\r\nZed - Akali is just better, Just don't use this champ unless you want the assassin passive\r\n\r\nGaren - Too tanky, and too easy to get a hold of, Changing him from Tier 1-2 would be fine.\r\n\r\nDarius - Not tanky enough\r\n\r\nMorganna - Dies before she can cast, increased mana generation or a new ability (perhaps tormented soil, and bump her to tier 4)\r\n\r\nKatarina - She seems so squishy, i could be positioning wrong, but her cast doesn't come up in time, and when it does, it doesn't do much damage (Unless you have assassin passive, then its fucked)\r\n\r\nRek'Sai - Weak, literally a bait, just don't get this champ\r\n\r\nKassadin - Mana steal is too strong, i'd actually swap his ability to Force Pulse/Riftstep combination (Much like Blitz Hook/Powerfist), and increase him to Tier 2/3\r\n\r\nShen - Dodge Radius is too large for a Tier 2, i'd either increase him to Tier 4, or reduce the size of the dodge radius\r\n\r\nAatrox - by himself at Bronze he's worthless, at Silver he becomes too strong, add into that the blademaster passive and you have a super powered front liner, i'd increase him to Tier 4, and weaken blademaster passive overall\r\n\r\nGangplank - Barrels are shit until he's silver, and even then he often dies before he can pop them, survivability buff\r\n\r\nTristana - BotRK and The Gunslinger Passive, is just ridiculous, not only is she bombing your entire team, but also she can attack multiple EXTRA times.\r\n\r\nElise - very weak, needs a survivability buff and her spiderlings need a buff too\r\n\r\n_Tier Shifts_\r\n\r\nEve - No change\r\nAatrox - Possible Tier 4\r\nBrand - No Change\r\nVarus - Drop to Tier 1\r\nElise - Drop to Tier 1, she's very weak imo\r\nMorg - Drop to Tier 2, shes weak (Ability Change could make her Tier 4, Read Above)\r\nShyvanna - Not enough experience as or against to make a claim\r\nAurelion - He doesn't seem strong enough to be tier 4, tier 3 would be fine\r\nYasuo - Tier 4 at best, he's basically useless\r\nVolibear - No Change\r\nLissandra - Weak, Drop to Tier 1\r\nBraum - No change\r\nSej - Increase to Tier 5, Ult is too large\r\nAshe - Increase to Tier 4, Combined with glacial, she's just stupid strong\r\nBlitzcrank - No change\r\nKatarina - No Change\r\nDraven - Not enough experience as or against to make a claim\r\nDarius - No Change, still needs a buff\r\nSwain - Not enough experience as or against to make a claim\r\nFiora - Bump up to Tier 2\r\nLeona - Not enough experience as or against to make a claim\r\nLucaian - No Change\r\nGaren - Bump up to Tier 2\r\nVayne - Bump up to Tier 2\r\nGangplank - Drop to Tier 2\r\nShen - Bump up to Tier 3\r\nKennen - Drop to Tier 2\r\nPyke - Bump up to Tier 3\r\nGraves - No change\r\nMorde - Weak, No Change (needs a buff)\r\nKindred - No Change\r\nKarthus - Not enough experience as or against to make a claim\r\nRengar - Drop to Tier 2\r\nWarwick - No Change\r\nGnar - No Change\r\nAhri - Drop to Tier 1\r\nKha'zix - Bump up to Tier 2\r\nKassadin - Bump up to Tier 2\r\nTristana - No Change\r\nPoppy - Drop to Tier 2\r\nLulu - Bump up to Tier 3\r\nVeigar - Drop to Tier 2\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Good Stuff**\r\n\r\n* Enjoyable gamemode (even if at the moment is relatively repetitive, but it is beta after all, can't fault it)\r\n* 0 Toxicity (or at least in my experience, unless my friends spam pinging me for taking their champs is toxic?)\r\n* Relatively easy to pick up after a few games, but still needs a tutorial imo\r\n* Plenty of Room for Alterations, Additions and Other Goodness\r\n* The Silverwings are Adorable as Fuck, as a Grown ass man, even i think they're cute (the other Little Legends are ok i guess) (Tip for Silverwings: Spam Dance to Intimidate your opponents, trust me ;) )\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally my Suggestions for New Champs/Origins/Classes\r\n\r\n_Champs_ \r\n\r\nThresh - Guardian/Phantom, Tier 2, Lantern's Light (Allies adjacent to him gain a 100/150/200 HP shield at the start of the game)\r\nNocturne - Assassin/Demon, Tier 3, Duskbringer (All enemies in a line take additional damage from nocturne, for X/X/X Duration)\r\nMaokai - Guardian/???, Tier 4/5, Vengeful Maelstrom (for the duration, Maokai absorbs damage, redirecting 15/30/55% of it at the end of its duration)\r\nIrelia - Blademaster/Noble/Ionian, Tier 3, Defiant Dance (for the duration, all incoming damage is reduced by 20/40/60%, she is also immune to all crowd control)\r\nZiggs - Sorcerer/Yordle, Tier 5, Mega Inferno Bomb (Ziggs drops a bomb on an area, all enemies caught within the area take X/X/X damage)\r\nKog'Maw - Ranger/Void, Tier 4, Bio-Arcane barage (For the duration, Kog'Maw increases his attack range and damage against the same target)\r\nZac - Guardian/???, Tier 4, Let's Bounce (Zac jumps on the enemy team, after 1 second, all champions trapped on top of him, get picked up and lifted to a new spot on the playing field)\r\nAzir - Sorcerer/Ascended, Tier 2, To the King (Adjacent allies increase Azir's attack speed by 5% per additional ally)\r\n\r\n_Origins_\r\n\r\nIonian\r\nUnnatural World (Ivern/Maokai)\r\nAscended - (2) ascendants increase the damage of each other ascended (4) Ascendants restore 25 Hit points per attack","replies":[{"poster":"JinHae","date":"2019-06-28T07:30:33.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus t2 with rabbadons one shots every t2 on the enemy team that dont have magic reduction.
