Usually this kind of issues lies somewhere *between* you and Riot, not *at* the Riot servers. Far more often than not, it's the ISP or the area that is the problem, not anything Riot has any power over.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2017-03-19T03:00:27.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nThere are plenty of ways that packets can go missing to/from Riot's servers.  See [What happens when I press Q?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFNc04Xs0aw&feature=youtu.be) for some info there..\n\nFirst up - that kind of ping (especially ping instability, where it isn't at a constant level) can indicate any number of potential causes.  Here are a few to look into:\n* Home wifi interference\n* Overloaded / overheating modem or router\n* Family / Flatmates taking up all of your bandwidth (congestion at home)\n* Congestion in your ISP (too many customers sharing too little bandwidth)\n\nIf you haven't checked into it, try going through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article for a bit more info.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
