The village relies on Ionian teachings to master their powers and ensure its use will be for the good of the land.\n\n15 years after the attack on Ionia a boy was born his name was glaive and upon birth his arms became lethal for anyone to touch due to the heat he produced, so the current leader decided to seal him away in a metal that was incombustible on that can only be found deep below the surface of Ionia, however in the years he was sealed he saw katarina and the army led by swain, due to being sealed he was unable to speak he never learnt how to his only way to warn was to explode his flaming power and destroy the prison he was kept in.\n\nAs the prison crumbled many of his fellow villagers lied injured or dead as katarina slew all the higher ups of the village, furious glaive roared summoning a giant flaming  hell hound all of the noxian army stopped to look at what had suddenly appeared, a battle ensued as noxians fell left, right and centre at glaive’s mighty phoenix, glaive walked up behind swain and thrust his sword through his neck, but as he did swain disappeared and glaive noticed as the other noxians that remained did the same, a trick he thought to himself…\n\nGlaive: Melee (human form)/Ranged (Hell hound)\nTop/jg \nBruiser/tank\nGlaive gets ulti at level 1 as well as the ability to put a point in his Q, W or E\nAbilities\nPassive(s): \n\nFlaming Roar: Every 10th attack deals 10 magic damage and slows the target for by 20% for 2 seconds\n\nQ – Blazing Strike (human form) No Cost, 10/9/8/7/5 Second Cooldown\nGlaive lunges towards a target striking them and marking them for 5 seconds, each basic attack against the target does an additional 15 attack damage, the strike itself does 50/60/65/70/75 (+0.95% of attack damage)\n\nQ - Burning Glow (hell hound form) No Cost, Toggle with a 5/4/3/2/1 Seconds Cooldown\nPassive: Whilst in hell hound form Glaive gives his allies a 10% increase in movement speed whilst nearby\nActive: Whilst toggled on reveals all enemies within 1000/1500/2000/2500/3000 Units around glaive for 0.5/1.5/2.5/3.5/5 Seconds \n\nW – Explosive Slash (Human Form) No Cost, 10/8/6/4/2 Second Cooldown\nGlaive lashes out on a targeted enemy dealing 25/50/75/100/125 Physical Damage (+0.25% of targets missing health\n\nW – Flamethrower (Hell hound form) No Cost, 15/12/9/6/3 Second Cooldown\nGlaive spews fire in a cone in front of him dealing 20/40/60/80/120 (+0.85% of ability power)\n\nE – Crushing Blow (Human Form) No Cost, 8/7/5/3/1 Second Cooldown\nGlaive Strikes all targets in a cone in front of him slowing them by 15% for 2/3/4/7/10 Seconds and dealing 70/75/80/85/90 (+0.6% of Attack Damage)\n\nE – Chomp (Hell hound Form) No Cost, 7/5/3/2/1 Second Cooldown\nGlaive Bites his target dealing 25/35/45/55/70 (+0.85% of attack damage)\n\nR – Hell hound (Human form) No Cost, 3/2/1 second Cooldown\nGlaive summons a hell hound to take his place for 30 seconds gaining access to hell hound abilities and passive(s), whilst in hell hound form he gains 10% move speed and all basic attacks burn nearby enemies for 10 magic damage every 5 seconds\n\nEDIT: Changes made - \n\nRemoved Stun replaced with slow and on every 10th attack\n\nRemoved passive of phoenix form\n\nChanged from becomes a phoenix to summons phoenix to take his place for 30 seconds\n\nRemoved +0.5% of attack damage on human W\n\nEDIT 2 - changed to hell hound from Phoenix \n\nBeak strike became chomp","replies":[{"poster":"Aedridon","date":"2014-12-16T04:33:09.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Glaive, I think he has a few problems here and there. First, the Phoenix thing is kind of taken by udyr. Add to the fact that this Phoenix-ness is in both champ's ult, it feels kind of copied. And you said in the lore, glance *summoned* a Phoenix, not became.  I don't know what other animal to replace it though.\n\nNext up, both Passives are op. Human form is a stun every sixth attack. Get attack speed, triforce and furor and you'll be stunning the ***t out of the enemy. His Phoenix passive is an op version of Anivia's passive. First, they're both phoenixes, thieir passives are egg-related. The only difference is that Glaive's passive has no cooldown and you gain *armour and magic resist*. All Glaive needs to do is change form before he dies. \n\nLastly, the numbers are so op it's funny. Take human form Glaive's w for example. It deals flat amount physical, plus 50% AD, *plus* 25% of target's missing HP. And the cooldown is *2 seconds* at max rank. \n\nStill, I think it's a nice champion concept. It's just a little copied, and it's op. hope you'll update","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2014-12-16T23:40:35.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Aedridon,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=rd45Mnrv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2014-12-16T04:33:09.212+0000)\n>\n> For Glaive, I think he has a few problems here and there.
