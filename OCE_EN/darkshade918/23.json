If you think you can burst down the enemy rush a {{item:3128}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3089}} and if against heavy ad rush {{item:3191}}. Experiment with builds and see what suits you. \n\nIn terms of ability order it depends on what you like. I generally tend to max my Q, W, E in that order but I have friends who do it differently. \n\nHave fun :D","replies":[]}]}
