So either that means the players who were vsing them were shit or mao is op. You might not be building him correctly or doing something wrong because he's got a 49.94% winrate which is much higher than a ton of other champs.  \n\nI don't want to bother complaining with you here but he does have a good trade. If you do his combo properly, you can deal a significant amount of damage and then heal up as they damage you, making your trade off really good.  If they chose to get an item with grievous wounds, then you'd just have to play smarter.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lazarius3","date":"2018-10-01T07:07:10.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"corrupting pot is good, I suppose {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} ","replies":[]}]}]}]}
