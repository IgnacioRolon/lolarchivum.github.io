The minotaur he challenged was a big bull of a warrior, In the great barrier an archipelago was shaped purely for arena fights and challenges to lead the minotaur tribe, currently led by alistar. Zeno and the minotaur fought bravely but in the end the legendary jaguar won, however instead of killing the bull he asked for help, the bull agreed “you have bested me, let me show you where our food is” although they eat seeds, plant life, the jaguar warrior was used to this due to the remote jungle where he lived, the whole tribe and Zeno feasted until the break of morning the next day. Zeno was spoken to by alistar “you beat one of my greatest warriors in battle, then showed mercy, why?” Zeno replied “I was raised fair and just, to kill an innocent is not in my nature, however I can’t say the same for the rest of my tribe, my family and I left, due to how many innocents they kill for no reason” “thank you brave warrior, may I ask your name”, “my name is Zeno a jaguar warrior from the tribes of the plague jungle, if I may can I join your tribe as a warrior at your command?” “Indeed” alistar replied\n\nFrom then on Zeno was a warrior for the Minotaur’s tribe, he fought bravely and honourably repelling invaders as well as a minotaur would. \n\nMelee – Fighter – no resource to use abilities\nAbilities\n\nPassive – Challenge\nItem – Jaguar’s Heart – an item allowing him to “challenge” an opponent, use this to target an opponent, a text box will appear on the opponents screen asking them if they accept or deny the challenge\nWhile Challenged an arena of impassable terrain will appear around Zeno and his target champion, it will face of in a 1v1 situation, no other units, can enter the arena or attack through the arena while it is up, if Zeno kills his challenged target he will gain 15 armour and magic resist, however if he loses he will lose 15 armour and magic resist, dying while challenged will not count as a death therefore no gold or spree.

his team from interfering, but there are no changes i could make to this passive to make it still useful late game","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"miloboy","date":"2015-01-26T00:20:38.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just thinking, personally I think his cooldowns are way to low for not having any

yi/yas/fiora, so maybe i can increase cooldowns a little, but thanks for the input
