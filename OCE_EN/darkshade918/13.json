When looking a bit deeper, it appears that they have silver flex rank, and are queuing with lower solo rank players that have the bronze-silver flex rank. Hence, they are ending up in your games. In flex games you have to look at **flex ranks** and not solo ranks. \n\nFlex and solo MMR are separate, with the quick flex reset (even though it was pretty messed up) the only interaction they will likely have with each other. \nAlso, because it's a pretty new queue it will take a while for players to get back to their usual ranks (especially for a  ~month after a MMR reset).\n\nIf you want to have balanced games, wait a month before playing ranked queues. The MMR will reset again for both queues on the 7th of December, and I would suggest not playing till mid January when everything would have settled down again.

Eventually, I think the whole thing would fix itself and everything would turn back into normal.\n\nTbh, flex queue is really just a time killer to wait for the real deal to start which is next season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-11-18T11:04:31.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a game today with 1 plat 5, 1 gold 5 and 3 silvers vs all bronze that was fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-18T02:21:32.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeh. I was in my promos to Gold on Flex que, had 6 diamond players in the game (2 on my team, 3 on the other).

I learnt what i need to improve on from that game. The diamond players had a much better understanding of the macro level of the game even though their laning was roughly about the same, so it was although frustrating, a worthy outing.","replies":[]}]}
