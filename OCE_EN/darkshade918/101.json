You will need to be well cultured enough to take notes from multiple culture and sub cultures, \n2. With no completely out of the blue spell mechanics (stays somewhat in line with other champs), \n3. A coherent background lore that fits in the Runeterra universe and predetermined roles, albeit vague and shouldn't be the very center of balance, \n4. Proposed synergies with other champs in a meaningful way, \n5. Also the champ has to have a kit that fits gameplay and theme wise.\n6. Don't make overloaded kit, slightly can be ok but not full on overload.\n\nThere is a trend that people seem to make their champ as overloaded as possible for whatever reason, make sure not to make that mistake.","replies":[]}]}
