Nocturne had 20ad from longswords plus 23.2 ad from natural talent. \n\nThis is pretty standard for high elo nocturnes, but Gigabyte Marines is Vietnamese team from the SEA server and who knows what they do over there, we literally cannot spectate games on their local server from other regions.\n\nNocturne ult at lvl6 with 2 longswords does 201.8 physical damage, nocturne passive will do 137.6 physical damage, 3rd rank q does 182.4 physical damage. Fresh Blood does 16 physical damage. Thunderlords does 76.46 magic damage through at least 27mr (maybe more depending on if mr glyphs or ap glyphs). These were all the cooldowns and damage sources used on Karma.\n\nLethality runes and precision pierce through 14.95 armour in this situation. Giving karma an effective 26.15 armour assuming 9 armour seals, giving 12.7% physical damage reduction.\nAll this damage is amplified by +3% from assassin and +3% from double edged sword, but since galio is present, assassin does not proc.\n\nHence after accounting resistances, we get 498.1 physical damage taken from health, and 63.9 magic damage taken from health, giving a grand total of 562 damage dealt to karma during that lvl6 gank.\n\nNocturne wasn't exactly a weak assassin, it's just other ad assassin were stronger with the duskblade, however after nerfs were being released to balance all the regular lethality assassins, he sort of took the secondary spot as the best unpopular lethality assassin, since although his kit doesn't have as much synergy with lethality builds as much as say khazix and he puts himself at much higher risk than most other ad assassins with his kit. He has very high damage and scaling, giving him extremely effective burst when picking off stragglers or splitpushing squishies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-05T23:56:02.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cause he had like a 3 lvl advantage for most of the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-10-05T12:44:33.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his team got him pretty fed for that to happen but nocs always been able to do that since rito brought in lethality","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-10-05T11:43:29.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GPL gigabyte marines","replies":[]}]}
