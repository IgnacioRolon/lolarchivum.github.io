When they were young they were best friends never separate from each other, but it all changed when Cassiopeia met katarina through high school, she chose to follow the diplomatic part of life whereas venom wanted to explore and venture into lands unknown, already somewhat detested by his sister, he asked if she wanted to come to a shuriman sand temple he had discovered in his last trip to the glorious desert city. She agreed reluctantly but had she not she may not have gained the powers she has today both of them afflicted by venom from a shuriman tomb guardian, she was given the powers of a gorgon, he was given an affliction of pure venomous power. \r\n\r\nA great battle ensued between venom and Cassiopeia ending with venom being turned to stone due to her gorgonic power she left and all he could do was watch, then a light from the same temple guardian that changed them into what they are, it spoke in a deep voice “the power you have is to change the balance you are turned to stone for 30 years in time you will be released from your bound and your quest will be to end her tyranny.\r\n\r\n30 years past, venom was released from his stone curse and began his venture to wipe his sister from this world\r\n\r\nMelee\r\nMage/Assassin\r\n\r\nPassive – Venomous touch\r\nEach basic attack applies a mild poison that deals 5 true damage over 5 seconds per stack, stacking up to 3 times.

First of all, Cass is Kat's sister, and second of all, the kit would be far too similar to Cass's kit, especially the ult. Having two similar champions does not benefit the game very well, and his scalings seem a bit weird. For example, his w scales by a steady 5 extra damage per level, which is too little in the first place, and the final rank gives it 15 additional damage instead, which seems rather strange to me. The champ name itself is a bit too generic, and the ult name seems too similar to Cassiopeia's passive. \n\nOther than the names and the slight need to tweak the statistics around a bit, I really like the idea of this champion, as a reverse copy of Cass, similar to Garen and Dunkrius, though I feel as of current, his kit is rather unhealthy. (e.g. a useless late game passive, lack of gapclosers if melee, a very low amount of damage and a whopping 3 second aoe fear with no counterplay.)\n\nSorry for nitpicking, but what I stated out are what I feel like need to be pointed out. Good luck with your concept :)","replies":[]}]}
