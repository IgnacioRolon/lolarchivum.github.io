Supporting and ADC who you can either skype, or already understand their playstyle very well and is reliable will prop up your chances of winning tremendously, as opposed to queing up with some luck of the draw silver ADC who might be lagging, or have to AFK cause his mom called him for dinner.\n\nI am a dead set solo q'er, but that doesn't change the fact that playing with a friend/whole team of friends (fuck you dynamic q) does help you win. The only thing different is you have to deal with the guilt of knowing you played grouped games to get to higher elo. where as solo q wins give you that satisfaction, and that feeling of \"I'm the fuckin best\" :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-10-03T07:08:33.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I have had much more success playing with a solo laner or a jungler. When I queue with an ADC we usually dominate lane, but it is better to be able to rely on at least 2 positions getting fed. \n\nI pride myself on being a good support, usually able to go at least even in lane and adjust my play style to accommodate even the most stupid and cocky of ADCs. \n\nA good top lane is my favourite, as from soloq experience that is the lane most likely to go 0/11, continuing to split push even as a terrible split push champion. Their tp presence is also great, and a well timed tank/bruiser gank will never go amiss. \n\nMid lane is alright, getting your duo to roam bot is pretty good. Although it can bump up your wait times quite a bit. \n\nJungle is also pretty great, as most of the shots are usually called from the supp/jg positions. Being able to communicate efficiently and being on the same page with objective priority can easily help lead a team to victory.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-02T09:43:21.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adc and supp mains have the best chance of getting out nugget.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-10-02T10:07:47.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oE3AXYg5,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-10-02T09:43:21.931+0000)\n>\n> Adc and supp mains have the best chance of getting out nugget.\n\nHow, though, i know adc can just carry, but a supp needs a team/adc to carry him/her to a win, a supp cannot win by itself, and in this elo, the chance of a decent team, is below 0","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-10-02T10:18:47.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DarkShade918,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oE3AXYg5,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-10-02T10:07:47.113+0000)\n>\n> How, though, i know adc can just carry, but a supp needs a team/adc to carry him/her to a win, a supp cannot win by itself, and in this elo, the chance of a decent team, is below 0\n\nthrough heavy utility.

I went from S4 to P5 using Nami almost exclusively. Just always be aware that you can improve somewhere; be open to advice, keep trying to learn from high elo player's streams/guides, and don't focus on blaming anyone else for a loss.\n\nYou also want to be consistent. Don't flip-flop between lots of different roles and champions, just try to master a small selection. You can practice and learn other roles/champions in Normals, which will be good for learning the limits of your team and enemy. Make it a habit to watch the minimap and keep as many useful wards out as you can. Getting tunnel vision and constantly dying to ganks even if there were sufficient wards is a big problem for people focusing on their lane, but as a Support it's typically easier to divide your attention since you don't have to CS; as such, you'll often be the shot caller and the one warning the team of imminent danger through pings.\n\nEach match, the first thing you want to take note of is how your ADC plays. You do not want to play hyper-aggressive and die 3 times in the first 5 minutes because your ADC is super-passive. You conform to his style, or ask that he conform to yours. If he overextends, ward for him and/or danger ping him back. If your ADC is reckless and keeps taking risks that get you both killed, let him die alone, and you can go follow another carry after laning phase if he's particularly bad.\n\nRead those guides and see if you can improve your Runes/Masteries and builds. There is no perfect setup, and your build will change depending on the situation.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-02T09:01:12.152+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"win ratio 54%..... keep that up and you'll get out eventually\n\nkeep your supp pool small, you do well on {{champion:412}} and {{champion:43}}  and i see with a few more games you could do well with {{champion:201}} and {{champion:40}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Bigeyevo987","date":"2016-10-03T05:20:52.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^, if ur wr is 54% (I haven't checked), then don't worry, you'll climb.
