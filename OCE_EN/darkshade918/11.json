Supports are always so caught up in thinking:\n _\"Im the only one in this team that actually voluntarily goes support, that makes me a better team player, i do more for the team than they do!\"_ \nThat kind of thinking actually makes them the worst team player, a good team won't expect thanks from anyone, they do the job they are supposed to do and if they do it well they win, if they do it badly, they lose.\n\nSure its nice to get a 'TY' when you flash in front of them to take a Cait ult for them, and yea its nice to give a 'GJ' to the assassin when he kills off the ADC, thats polite and its always nice to see, and i always do it to keep up team morale, but once you start expecting it, then you're getting full of yourself.\nNever forget, as a support its your job to save them, if you DO save them, you are doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing, nothing more.\n\nSo don't expect the team to be grovelling on their knees saying _\"Oh thank you Nami for doing the very thing your champion is supposed to be doing, you are the MVP!\"_\n\nI am a mid Mage main, but i play support a LOT. When i play mid, I try poke their team down as much as i can before the engage, and during the engage I try to keep my CC on the ADC and other key players. I don't do it for the 'GJ' i get afterwards, i do it so that my team can do their job properly and without having to worry about doing mine as well.  I Don't expect to be thanked for it, i just expect them to do their job.\n\nWhen i play support, i dive in front of my ADC and sacrifice myself. not because i want a fucking medal for it, but because if i am alive and my ADC isn't, our team Is more disadvantaged than if the ADC was alive and i wasn't. and if they are more disadvantaged then they cant do their jobs as easily.\n\nBe like a school of fish, move as one smooth body, as soon as one fish tries to be ahead of all the rest... They get eaten.\n\nDont get eaten.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-19T22:13:08.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"brutal","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-19T22:20:39.803+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"And incorrect","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-07-20T06:38:34.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahaha this is savage asf and I love you for writing this (no homo)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-20T06:35:02.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The world is too PC.
