They left the room leaving sly, talon and katarina alone.\n\nThe note read\n\nDear Crimson elite, I have spared your warriors life for the reason of this, your warriors have attacked my people for the last time, if you dare attack demacia again he will not be so lucky. Face me with your greatest warrior and we will settle this feud so the war will end.\n\nSigned \n\nQuinn and valor\n\n“Hmph that girl and her blasted bird are interfering again” “Talon, do not fail me this time, come back with her crossbow, head and bird or don’t come back at all” he bellowed. Talon shrunk more into the slouch he was doing “yes father” he mumbled “BE ON YOUR WAY” Sly yelled “yes sir” talon sat up straight and left the building to hunt that woman, however talon could never kill her, due to his crush on her. “kat follow him silently ensure he does his job if he doesn’t,  kill him, he is weak and usless to the noxian army” “yes sir” kat smirked “I will ensure he completes his task” she walked off snickering to herself.\n\nAbilities\n\nAD bruiser/Tank/Assassin\n\nItem – Raiders charm - changes what it is based on the ability he chooses to start with\n\nStarting Q – becomes Raider’s Blade – when used on an enemy  it marks that target allowing him to deal increased physical damage to it by 5/10/15% (based on levelling his ultimate) before lvl 6 does 2% increased damage to that target.\n\nStarting W – becomes Raider’s Heater – Increases his armor and magic resist by 25/50/75 (based on levelling of his ultimate) and reflects 2/4/6% of damage taken (doesn’t stack with thornmail or while W is in use), pre 6 reflects 1% of damage taken. (all this damage is from basic attacks)\n\nStarting E – becomes Raider’s Dagger – allowing all his basic attacs to do 10/20/30 True damage to targets under 30% health\n\nQ - Thundering blow - Cooldown 10/9/8/7/6 Seconds, Cost 50/75/100/125/150 mana\nSly Slams his blade into the ground sending  1/3/5/7/9 sparks flying in a cone in front of him dealing 40/60/80/90/100 magic damage (+0.15% of Ability power) and stunning each target hit for 0.3/0.5/0.7/0.9/1.1 Seconds, no matter how many sparks he has they can still hit minions nearby\n\nW – Shield Wall – Cooldown 18/16/14/12/10 Seconds, Cost 50/90/120/135/150 mana\nSly brings up his shield to block the next basic attack from a champion/large minion/monster and reflects 2/4/6/8/10% of the damage he would have taken, after the attack is blocked, he gains a health shield of 100/115/130/145/160 (+0.45% of ability power) that lasts 3 seconds\n\nE – Assassinate – Cooldown 20/17/14/11/10 Seconds, cost 80/95/110/125/140 mana\nSly jumps at a target and deals 50/90/130/170/210 physical damage (+0.7% of targets missing health) if this kills a target he loses 25/15/10/5/1 armour and magic resist but gains 3/5/7/10/15 Attack damage (effect only works if it kills a champion or large monster)\n\nTo clarify how this works \n- only applies the loss of armour and magic resist upon killing a champion or large monster\n\n- This then encourages people to build him tanky damage so that he can use this ability\n\n- risk = reward thats the basis of this ability\n\nR – Captain of the elite\n\nPassive ability\n\nIf he has the sword as his item – he gains 20/40/60% move speed when moving towards visible targets under 30% health and when within 100 units of a target their footprints are revealed allowing him to track them\n\nActive ability Cooldown 140/100/75 Seconds, cost 200/100/75 mana\n\nwith sword strikes in a circular motion dealing 100/150/200 physical damage (+0.07% of his attack damage) to all units hit 200% damage to minions and monsters\n\nPassive ability\n\nIf he has the heater as his item – he gains 35/40/45% move speed when moving towards and ally who is below 10% health (as long as their is an ally below 10% and moves towards it he gains this move speed permanently)\n\nActive ability Cooldown 50/40/30 Seconds, cost 75/70/60 mana\n\nWith heater in hand he shoves it forward (not moving his position) blowing units in front of him away by 150 units dealing 40/80/120 magic damage (+0.2% of ability power)\n\nPassive ability\n\nIf he has the dagger as his item – he gains 50/55/60% move speed for 1/2/3 seconds after hitting a unit\n\nActive ability  Cooldown 120/100/80 Seconds, Cost 100/90/80 Mana \n\nThrusts dagger forward (ignoring 35% of armor) in a straight line in front of him (50/55/60 units of range) dealing 40/70/110 physical damage (+0.05% of unit hit's health)(+0.1% of attack damage)\n\nStats\nHealth – 380 (+15)\nMana – 245 (+7)\nAttack damage – 55 (+2)\nAttack Speed – 0.65 (+0.05)\nArmour – 45\nMagic Resist – 40\nMove speed - 315\n\nEdit: 1\n\nStarting W - Added\nall damage  reflected is from basic attacks\n1% reflection Pre 6\n\nQ - Changed\nRandom directions to cone in front of him\nNo matter how many sparks he sends out they can still hit minions\n\nW- changed\nduration of shield from scaling 1/2/3/4/5/6 to flat 3 seconds\n\nE - Changed\nClarified how it works\nchanged scaling loss of armour and magic resist from 5/10/15/20/25 to 25/15/10/5/1\nChanged scaling of attack damage gained from 1/3/5/7/9 to 3/5/7/10/15\n\nR - Added\nActives, cooldowns, cost depending on his item","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-01-31T05:23:22.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Item – Raiders charm - changes what it is based on the ability he chooses to start with\n\nInteresting concept. Differs from Rengar and Viktor.\n\n> Starting Q – becomes Raider’s Blade – when used on an enemy  it marks that target allowing him to deal increased physical damage to it by 5/10/15% (based on levelling his ultimate) before lvl 6 does 2% increased damage to that target.\n\nPretty good. Percentages seem low enough to not be broken but high enough to make an impact.\n\n> Starting W – becomes Raider’s Heater – Increases his armor and magic resist by 25/50/75 (based on levelling of his ultimate) and reflects 2/4/6% of damage taken (doesn’t stack with thornmail or while W is in use)\n\nSo below level 6 this does nothing? Also, you state 'Damage Taken', is this from everything, or just basic attacks (like Thornmail).\n \n> Starting E – becomes Raider’s Dagger – allowing all his basic attacs to do 10/20/30 True damage to targets under 30% health\n\nAlso pretty good. This is something I kinda want to see on an Evolved Kha'Zix Q.\n \n> Q - Thundering blow - Cooldown 10/9/8/7/6 Seconds, Cost 50/75/100/125/150 mana\n> Sly Slams his blade into the ground sending  1/3/5/7/9 sparks flying in random directions dealing 40/60/80/90/100 magic damage (+0.15% of Ability power) and stunning each target hit for 0.3/0.5/0.7/0.9/1.1 Seconds\n\nWhat's the range on this? Late game this can be incredibly broken as he can literally walk into a team fight and stun the entire time. Also and effect that is random is never going to be added to League. They've stated numerous times that a player should, at any point, know what is going to happen (to an extent obviously). I'm assuming this can hit minions at the number sparks is greater than 5. Think of how useless this would be if you were to engage the enemy, Q, and then immediately stun all the nearby minions and deal no damage to the enemy.\n \n> W – Shield Wall – Cooldown 18/16/14/12/10 Seconds, Cost 50/90/120/135/150 mana\n> Sly brings up his shield to block the next basic attack from a champion/large minion/monster and reflects 2/4/6/8/10% of the damage he would have taken, after the attack is blocked, he gains a health shield of 100/115/130/145/160 (+0.45% of ability power) that lasts 1/2/3/4/6 seconds\n\nSo just to be clear, it nullifies all damage from the basic attack and then reflects the damage back correct? Also, the duration of the shield goes from extremely pointless to extremely broken. I would change it from a scaling duration to a flat duration.\n \n> E – Assassinate – Cooldown 20/17/14/11/10 Seconds, cost 80/95/110/125/140 mana\n> Sly jumps at a target and deals 50/90/130/170/210 physical damage (+0.7% of targets missing health) if this kills a target he loses 5/10/15/20/25 armour and magic resist but gains 1/3/5/7/9 Attack damage (effect only works if it kills a champion or large monster)\n\nUhh...is this for a period of time or permanent? Also you stat 'he loses'. Do you mean Sly? Or the person he kills. Because if this is a permanent effect (I'm assuming it is because it only triggers if the person dies), this is either an absolutely terrible ability, or a stupidly broken ability respectively. \n\nIf this ability takes armour from Sly, I promise you that NO ONE will ever use this ability. Having 0 armour would mean you would die almost instantly to an ADC late game. Even if it's for a period of time, the damage it does it not worth the trade off.\nIf this ability takes the armour from the enemy, this is beyond broken. A Frozen Heart give 100 armour, the highest possible from one item. Killing the enemy 4 times late game make it useless. Hell, a Cloth Armour gives 15 armour. Killing at enemy early game completely negates it before it's even built into something.\n\n> R – Captain of the elite\n> \n> Passive ability\n> \n> If he has the sword as his item – he gains 20/40/60% move speed when moving towards targets under 30% health and when within 100 units of a target their footprints are revealed allowing him to track them\n> \n> If he has the heater as his item – he gains 30/50/65% move speed when moving towards and ally who is below 10% health\n> \n> If he has the dagger as his item – he gains 50/55/60% move speed for 1/2/3 seconds after hitting a unit\n\nWhat's the range on this passive? How close to the enemy/ally do you need to be before it triggers? \n\nHis ult seems pretty lackluster. If the R remains as a passive it needs to be fair more impacting, or each thing needs its own ability. Consider the passives of other champs with passives on their ults (Blitz, Jax, Master Yi, Miss Fortune, Olaf, Rek'Sai, Shyvana, Sivir, Sona). These passives either enhance some or all of their kit (Master Yi, Miss Fortune, Sona), enhance their play style (Jax, Olaf, Rek'Sai, Shyvana), or something completely different (Blitz). At the moment this ult makes you run faster.\n\nMy suggestion would be to add an active depending on the item. This is something that both Rengar and Victor lack, and further emphasis' the importance of your first choice. It would open him up a lot to different play styles and allow you to change depending the opposing team.\n\n-----\n\nAll in all seems pretty good for a first draft. Closing comments is that every ability scales in every aspect when leveling ie cooldown is always reduced, cost always increased, damage always increased ect. As mentioned for his W I would consider either putting some flat amounts or get rid of scaling on some stuff.\n\nA few changes here and there need to be made (his E and Ult in particular) but overall his kit seems decent.\n\nLook forward to seeing the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2015-02-01T23:43:24.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lonely Flame,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=AAnob6yc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-31T05:23:22.957+0000)\n>\n> Interesting concept.
