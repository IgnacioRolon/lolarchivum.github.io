It's better to shotcall on a microphone, because you can speak much quicker than pings or typing. For example, Baron is up and you need vision around it. If you ping baron, heaps of noobs will just go \"NO WAY!\" without understanding what the ping really means.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hideousbeast","date":"2016-10-24T10:37:41.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at the minimap a lot.\nPing anything that could help your team.

However shot calling is thinking about the test possible move you can make. \nFor simple shot calling 101 you just need to always think about objectives (turrets/dragon/baron). This translates to \"Kill the turret instead of kills, Take the dragons when the enemy isn't near dragon and take baron when enemy is bot lane or is dead.\" \nFor complex Shot calling, i will have to write an entire essay, so i rather not :P \n\nSo Biggest tip as shot caller: \n\"REMEMBER YOU ARE TRYING TO WIN THE GAME AS FAST AS POSSIBLE NOT PLAY AROUND\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-10-24T06:33:03.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're gonna have to be the nice guy in a way. I don't always \"shotcall\" for the team but I am usually the one who tends to take on the leader role when it comes to communication (unless I'm doing horribly).\n\nBut yeah you're gonna have to be the nice guy who in a sense has to solve tilts as soon as they show up with encouragement or shaking it off or my favorite and the most effective, give your uhh, \"tilted\" teammate an excuse for them so they don't look as bad.\n\nYou're also gonna have to be knowledgeable about League. I know myself to be a very average player but I've played the game long enough to know that for example if someone enters fog of war somewhere and there are certain wards where and where not, I can kinda map around possible gank paths or travel routes to remain undetected or not, or how long a certain champion's ultimate cooldown is etc\n\nOverall you need to make sure your shotcalling can be reliable. \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
