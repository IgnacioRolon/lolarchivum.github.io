Probably not \r\nIs it time to climb by &quot;troll picking&quot;? Probably\r\nCan i get away with it? Probably (providing i don&#039;t just int)\r\nWill silver elo ever understand the concept of off meta? Probably not\r\nDo i feel pleased with myself for tilting 9 other players just by picking MF support? You bet your ass i do.\r\n\r\nAhh low elo, you never cease to amuse me.","replies":[]}
