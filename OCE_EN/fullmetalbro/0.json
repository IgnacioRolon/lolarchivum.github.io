It feels like I&#039;m in a spot where I don&#039;t want to play anymore. I don&#039;t see any options and gone through enough of it. What I&#039;m talking about is the struggle to climb in low elo (yes, this shit again).\n\nI&#039;ve played 65 games on this account. I know that is nothing. I have had many other accounts and games, above my current mmr. 24 of these games have been 4v5&#039;s in which a team member has disconnected, resulting in a loss nearly every time. 2 of these games have been 4v5 in which an enemy has disconnected. I currently gain 14lp per win and lose around 25 per loss. This means I need to win 2 games for every game I lose, JUST TO BREAK EVEN. A 66% win rate would let someone climb in most cases, but it&#039;s not going to get me anywhere. Combine that with the frequent dc&#039;s (that have helped lower my lp gain) and it&#039;s feeling damn impossible. \n\nWhen i think about this I think about how \"it&#039;s more likely that the dc will be on the enemy team than yours\". Yeah, No. Not happening. Last week I found someone to play with to try and gain more of a chance to avoid getting the dreaded dc&#039;s. We played 3 games, all 3 with dc&#039;s on our team and 1 with 2 dc&#039;s. These people aren&#039;t raging (usually), they&#039;re just dcing or not connecting at all.\n\nI don&#039;t need anyone to tell me that I&#039;m a bad player or that if you&#039;re good enough you will climb. I know this, everyone does. But this situation feels like I&#039;d need to be significantly above my mmr to go up at all. And honestly, although I&#039;m constantly ahead of the people I&#039;m playing with, I&#039;m not that far ahead to single-handedly carry every game. Or carry the 1/3 of my games that are 4v5. And I don&#039;t know if others have recognized this but not everyone plays the hyper carry style, and that seems to be the only way to get out of this spot, to say another mmr where my consistent positive play wont be made negligible by the 50/50 chance someone completely throws the game from either team. \n\nSo this situation: the dc&#039;s, the lp gain/loss and my play style and skill level has me in an unpleasant spot where I might as well be headbutting a wall.\n\nWhat I suggest? Harsher penalties for people who dc from a ranked games. Make them take a couple days or a week off from ranked. Get rid of them. For those affected by the dc, it&#039;s a bit more complicated. You can&#039;t just give them loss forgiven, that would be abuse-able. But maybe you can give them reduced lp loss and reduced lp gain to winners when a &#039;serious&#039; dc is detected. Or make dc games not affect your mmr. This means your lp gain/loss in future games wouldn&#039;t be affected by the dc game.\n\nThis is a bit of a whine but I think it&#039;s a bit more than just \"I&#039;m bad but I want to be higher elo\". Any useful suggestions for me?","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-04-08T14:07:55.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can relate to you in my current situation in season 5 right now.

Simple things like pointing out they're a full AD auto attack comp and a frozen heart on tank would be a good choice for the team/individual. But, when you bring up children that is a huge issue for me. Vast majority of people (probably localized to my mmr) are straight up children or the maturity/mentality of such. You try to give information or ideas or talk, you get told to shut up, stop talking, \"play your own game\" (I hope anyone who says this gets cancer). They take it as if saying anything constructive or thoughtful is challenging their intelligence or dominance. And that thinking style goes hand in hand with - I carry or I lose this game. So many times they will do the exact opposite just to spite you. I don't know how to play where people cannot respond to an suggestion or idea reasonably. It is a strategy game, and they reject all reasoning. This is a huge problem for playing with people at my level. I think I need to find a team to play with, solo q just doesn't work this way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"5 Crow 1 Fiddle","date":"2015-04-07T13:03:42.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bro, I am different from your case but I am just gonna say it anyway. I played 5300 games from S1 to now, most of them are fiddlesticks, I can only reach D1/Master , around 400 on the ladder, I pretty much stuck there, maybe its my slow reaction time, inhibited my options to make the plays. \n\nI play league everyday, what I see is a dead game, since they nerfed the CC, added the mobility champions, for example riven, zed. Putting that dragon ending split push early gameplay, pretty much sealed all tanky junglers.\n\nNow I dropped to 800, because of the nerfs makes fiddlesticks pretty much can't defence against 2 invader in jungle. And lower and lower jungle speed makes me cry.\n\nI am currently AFK just like you until riot decided to buff instead of nerf, I am not saying buffing the champions, I am saying to buff other environmental objectives, don't make the late game happen too fast, don't make clearing waves and big team fight to be the only thing to do whatsoever.\n\n{{champion:9}}","replies":[{"poster":"I Really Irelia","date":"2015-04-07T13:25:29.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel for you man. A similar thing happened to me in Season 1 when they nerfed Evelynn to the ground by removing her stun and lowering her base stats. By then, I had over 500 games on her and she was the only champion I played. It was a hard blow to me but I eventually moved onto other champions when I realised Riot didn't care about the few Evelynn mains there were. A lot of my mains over the years have become FotM and have been nerfed. I learned to adapt.\n\nWell actually, I only adapted because I wanted to be a pro player. Winning became more important than having fun to an extent. If you're really not having fun, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\n{{champion:28}} {{champion:39}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Really Irelia","date":"2015-04-07T13:15:07.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started playing this game a few days ago after a 3 month break. It is terribly addicting and unfulfilling. For two nights in a row I went to bed at 6AM. Before playing, I never went to bed passed 12. Today I played again and I feel like this game is a huge waste of time and a negative impact on my life. I won't be playing again.\n\nA lot has changed since I last played. I grew my relationship with God immensely during the last 3 months and I feel this game gets in between me and God.
