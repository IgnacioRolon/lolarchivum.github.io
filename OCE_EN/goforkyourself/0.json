I'm winning more than im losing. yet im going down by about 20-21 LP per loss, and, as you can see, i just got 10 LP for a win. I understand the LP gain/loss fluctuates based on your match history, but wtf. i won my previous ranked as well, and pretty sure i gained about 16 LP for it.\r\nIs there any other variables that im not aware of?\r\ndo longer games earn you less LP?\r\nis it because i had to mute literally everyone to save my braincells?\r\nplz halp","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-24T02:49:46.243+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"No you certainly are not winning more than you are losing. your win/loss record is in the picture\n\nSee the yellow and white number above the score? Thats your wins and losses. You have 49 wins and 52 losses. If you have less wins then losses, usually means your MMR is going to be lower than average and thus give you small gains in LP.\n\nMMR takes a while to change from bad to good. So just because you are on a 3 game winning streak doesn't mean your MMR is suddenly going to say, ok hes good now. You have to have a positive record im pretty sure in order to have good MMR.\n\n> The exact amount of lost or earned League Points per game depends on your hidden Match Making Rating. If you have higher MMR than a set amount for your division you gain more LP per won game and lose less LP per lost game, if your MMR is lower you gain less and lose more LP per game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-03-24T05:18:02.905+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enemy team might of got loss prevented, which give you less LP for a win.","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-24T05:55:38.764+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"oh one of them did say that, guess that explains it, although why it was loss prevented i dont know, there wasnt any lag or DC's","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-24T04:21:48.208+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I meant to write \"recently winning more than losing\"\nand like i said, but no one seemed to read, my previous ranked game i won, and got 50% more LP than this one. i cant have gone down in MMR over the course of 1 day by not playing","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-24T05:00:19.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it also varies depending on the average MMR of the game. Perhaps the enemy team on average had a lower MMR then yours and the system expected you to win so you gain slightly less than you did the game before, when the average MMR was higher.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-24T12:34:56.771+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Another thread about low lp gains, when will you people realize the reason is because you have low mmr and will always be because you have low mmr, these dumb threads got old years ago, this is just fucking stupid at this point.","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-27T03:42:10.274+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"another comment from someone that cant read before judging, if you had spent an extra 5 seconds reading you would have noticed my statement about EARNING MORE LP THE VERY PREVIOUS GAME you ignorant twat.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-27T07:27:44.574+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I read it all, this is the same dumb thread that gets made over and over again, your LP gains are based on your MMR and it is different every game, don't call me ignorant when you're the one who is making a dumb thread about LP gains when there are hundreds of other threads exactly like yours, you fuckwit.","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-27T07:36:11.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"literally everyone knows that LP is based on your wins/losses. the ENTIRE POINT of my fucking post you goddam braindead shitstain, is that i earned 10 LP, when my previous win (AKA, my PREVIOUS GAME) i earned 16. what the fuck did you think it was about? \ndid you see the part where i questioned \"is there any other variables?\" and just go \"awww poor baby is having a cry\" or does your single braincell not remember the post by the time you started writing a reply?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-27T08:30:46.843+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"These insults doe, what are you 14?
