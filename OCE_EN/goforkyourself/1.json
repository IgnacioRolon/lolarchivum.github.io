And i can only assume the rest of my team did also, as 3 of them were DC for at least 5 minutes each.\r\nI can understand, there is a huge playerbase, and its not profitable enough to sink lots of money into decent servers for OCE, but why in situations like this, would there not be a loss prevented, where the other day (my last thread i created) literally no one had any lag or DC issues at all, the other team got their loss prevented, causing me to earn sweet F-all LP for an hour long game.\r\nyes before anyone comments, i am F-ING MAD.\r\nthis game used to be great, i would get about 20 games in a day while working at an internet cafe, they were fun, people were friendly, some of the champions were overpowered but that was fine, it was still fun. Now, i get in 2-3 games a day because either the RIDICULOUSLY MASSIVE number of absolute morons playing the game piss me off, or the game itself fails to hold up to standard.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-03-27T08:44:52.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sort of post amazes me no end.\n\ni bet your the sort of person who stubs their toe then blames the coffee table.\n\nthe servers are pretty top notch i've rarely d/c'ed or had any issues, same goes for all my friends that i speak with.\n\nwilling to bet you have a toaster PC and garbage internet OR you have good internet but its shared.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-27T11:24:46.213+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"funny, i had the least lag on my team, if you had bothered to read my thread before commenting you would realise this (seems to be a common theme with stupid people, read 2 words then blame OP). my internet is fine, my pc is fine, literally everyone else on my team had connection issues, and you somehow think its my fault. hmmmmmmmmm","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2015-03-27T06:30:06.739+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life is shit but most of the things that make it shit are what you are doing yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-27T07:38:56.648+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh certainly, but thats why things that are shit that i cant do anything about piss me off so much.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-27T08:14:17.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You play league, that is a thing you can do something about.","replies":[{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-31T00:19:26.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League is a fun game, it's just the community that makes it crap.
