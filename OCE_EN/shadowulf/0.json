The reason for this is because I have runes that I won&#039;t use soon and will just be sitting there for the rest of eternity and I am sure that others may be bugged by this. Another thing might be that you could sell / discard them and earn a small amount of hextech essence. Maybe you would like this added to League of Legends.","replies":[{"poster":"ItsInflux","date":"2016-06-25T09:15:24.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great idea. Maybe selling runes for 1/2 the price you bought them. I don't think selling runes for essence is a good idea though because essence is meant to only be obtained through disenchanting champion/skin shards, and there would be no point of disenchanting shards. But an all-round great idea!","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-25T09:13:45.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if you ever reach the cap, you can request rito to remove some, otherwise, there is no real point to getting rid of them, because at some point you might actually use them.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-25T09:14:35.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=bbXeEKHE,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-06-25T09:13:45.705+0000)\n>\n> Well if you ever reach the cap, you can request rito to remove some, otherwise, there is no real point to getting rid of them, because at some point you might actually use them.\n\n^ Beat me to it.
