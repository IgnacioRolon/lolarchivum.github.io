Cutesy wings (one angel and one bat of course). Support role.\n\nPassive - Trick or Treat\nQWE have different effects depending whether they are cast on friend or foe. If a player (friend or foe) has one effect on them already active, any other skills will have diminished (50%) effect.\n\nQ - Lift Spirits / Sink Spirits\nFriend - Regenerate targets HP over time\nFoe - Drain targets HP over time\n\nW - Sugar Rush / Burnout\nFriend - Movespeed boost\nFoe - Slow\n\nE - Bolster / Boo\nFriend - Increase damage\nFoe - Decrease damage\n\nR - Costume Party\nHallow switches \"costume\" with another team member. Map icons, hp bars (only in visual), and player models are swapped.\nIf either player casts, auto attacks or is attacked, the spell is broken, and a small area of effect fear is created around each player.
