Games are still random, and each team can be built somewhat competitively.","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-09-02T07:32:17.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, that's actually really interesting!! Kind of like playing Pocket Tanks and fighting over the best weapons xD\nOne problem would be though not owning all the champions, there might be a champ in the pool that only one or two people own and those two people might pick different champs, meaning that there's no one left who owns them to pick them? See the problem there?\nI do like that idea but I don't think there's a problem with the current ARAM system. Occasionally the enemy team does have an insanely scummy comp, but just as often as that so does yours. It just comes down to luck. Also a lot of the time I've thought the game was over at loading screen but then just end up completely smashing them!
