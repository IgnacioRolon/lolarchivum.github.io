He specialized in creating wards, for use in the many battlefields across Runeterra. He was very successful, and was well known for 'sitting on the fence' as he freely sold to all combatants.\nAaren caught word that a new prototype item was being made that would render people invisible to his wards, so to protect his profits he infiltrated the laboratory where it was being kept. His knowledge of wards and their placement enabled him to get in undetected.\nHe found the prototype item, it was a shoulder guard that looked like it was made of black glass, the black so dark it seemed to draw light from room around it. He looked upon the item for a second, before he picked it up and threw it to the ground. \nDark energies exploded around him, seeking a new vessel and finding only the ward maker, and the several wards he held. The wards became new eyes which sprouted all over his body, and their invisible nature transferred to Aaren, he watched as his hands and body became transparent.\nSecurity rushed into the room, only to see the frightening apparition float through the wall and disappear.\n\n**Base Stats**\nHe will have very low base stats across the board, his ethereal nature prevents him from being able to harness the full nature of corporeality.\nWith weak ranged auto attacks, he stares intently at his target, willing them to take damage. Crits make a small spark between him and his victim, the gaze was so intense.\n\n**Passive: The Wanderer**\n- Ghast always has 360 degree vision, regardless of walls and bushes\n- Upon death, Ghast returns to a pure Ethereal state, able to move around for the duration of his death timer. Recall time is shortened, to go back like all the other dead pplz if he must. Standard enemy vision of him still applies in wanderer form.  At the end of the timer he comes alive (full hp/mana) where-ever he is on the map.\n_Whilst you can be a mobile ward, you cannot farm, gain xp, even see or destroy enemy wards in this form. Don't forget to go back and buy. Be careful where you decide to reform too, if they have wards they might be waiting._\n\n**Q - Intense Stare**\n- Passive Effect - Ghast's auto attacks add a stack of \"Creeped out\" to his target. No limit on stacks.\n- Each stack of \"Creeped out\" decays over X seconds dealing a small amount of true damage as they are forced to shrug the feeling off.\n_His gaze can unnerve even the most steadfast of heros and monsters._\n\n**W - Ethereal Disposition**\n- For X seconds, Ghast can ignore wall and object collisions, and gains % damage reduction. At end of timer, if still in wall treat like flash to that location.\n- Medium cooldown\n_Designed to give him a measure of survivability during setups and escapes._\n\n**E - Matter Manipulation**\n- Ghast focuses his energies to shift things from a distance, in a specified direction.\n- Long Cooldown\n_The castable radius will be about same as Maokai E radius, with a push distance of Thresh E, cast like Rumble R (for direction)_\n\n**R - Possession**\n- Ghast can take control of target champion (melee range, think cho R) for X seconds. During the possession he may cast one spell of the target provided its not on cooldown, but this breaks the possession instantly and puts that skill on cooldown for the enemy. The target players vision is completely shut off during the possession. \n- Very Long Cooldown\n_Hmmm think of all the havoc you can create, but only one skill? Better choose wisely and quickly. They might not be very happy when you leave them._\n\n**Audio**\nNocturne ofc.\n\n_Champ Select_\n- \"Death holds no secrets from me\"\n\n_Taunts_\n- \"I have witnessed your end, it isn't pretty.\"\n- \"I can see right through you\"\n\n_Jokes_\n- \"Hey, where'd you go?\" looks around frantically...\n- \"Peek a boo, I see you!\"\n\n_Howling Abyss Bonus_\nShopkeeper - \"Will that shipment of wards ever get here?\"\n\n**Character Visual Concept**\nSomething like this with many eyes, but more see-through.\nhttp://stylegerms.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/13-Amazing-unbelievable-Photoshop-Image-Manipulation-03.jpg\nor\nhttp://imageproxy.jxs.cz/~nd01/jxs/cz~/320/148/fba39276d5_50794823_o2.jpg\ncant forget pride (i dont think pride would like to be \"support\" though, heh):\nhttp://www.theanimegallery.com/data/thumbs/790px/0137/tAG_137679.jpg\n","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-06T09:26:50.582+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-06T12:03:53.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-06T22:59:40.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}} \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-07T02:43:26.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"http://t.qkme.me/3tn9hh.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-07T03:47:23.732+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-07T04:01:54.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"that downvote hurt my feelings....","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-07T09:42:31.261+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt downvote \n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-07T11:09:49.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"but you didn't upvote either. feelings still hurt.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-08T23:02:55.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-10T06:17:57.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that down vote hurt **my** feelings.\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-10T08:10:13.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There, i got your back!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-10T09:30:19.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-11-09T03:47:05.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive way to Over Powered","replies":[{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-10T08:31:33.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"All his other stats are very low to balance this. \n\nIs it returning to life anywhere that is too OP?\n\nEasy fix, wander until timer expires then reforms at base.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"w0otness","date":"2015-11-06T03:54:07.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Updated with some backstory and finished the skill list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SYS Navie","date":"2015-11-02T23:06:00.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His/her passive looks kind of op, does he grant vision to his team whilst dead?
