Alright so down to business. I've been playing LoL for 4+ years, but just started getting into ranked in season 3. Due to some poor choices I've been stuck in bronze ever since. I know quite a bit aboot the game, and have a lot of experience herein. Now I'm NOT a strong jungle, but all my other lanes are pretty good. I'm looking for a serious team and/or Duo partner to finally get out of this Bronze HELL. IGN: Ganja Pirates. Hit me up please, I'm tired of being looked at as a noob. :/","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-12T03:22:46.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs well, play safe until you can kill someone 100%.\n\nYou're on your way to Diamond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XURiN","date":"2015-01-12T02:49:16.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me in client","replies":[]}]}
