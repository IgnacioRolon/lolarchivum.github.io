There probably is. But being able to rewind yourself to your previous location sounds like a way of making the Chronokeeper funner-er and actually out of the trash tier winrates. {{champion:26}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:14:02.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed and LeBlanc are already bad enough.","replies":[]},{"poster":"T S","date":"2015-03-24T20:55:37.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would probably be the buggiest thing on the planet.","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-03-25T06:46:47.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if dota 2 can do it lol can do it aswell","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-03-25T06:46:10.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Ok guys so WHAT IF: Zilean's Rewind teleported him to his state and location 5 seconds ago? \"\nlol isn't that weaver off of dota 2?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-25T00:28:29.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> W-Rewind: {{champion:26}} targets a champion. \n> \n> Allied: Zilean can target an allied champion, rewinding them back in time if they are hit by an enemy champion attack or spell, allowing the champion to this time dodge the attack (Lasts 2 sec).
