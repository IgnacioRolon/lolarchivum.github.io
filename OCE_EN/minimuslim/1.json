If he has the most points in Offense masteries, Q gets a 5 sec shorter cooldown; most in Defense gives W a 5 sec shorter CD, and most in Utility gives E the shortest CD. His runes affect his ult.\n\n**Q: Overload-** 550 range. Ryze throws out big red electric orbs in the direction of the mouse as long as Q is held down at a high mana/Orb cost. If he runs out of Mana, he casts with Health instead, the cost stacking rapidly. Overload can be cast while moving, and each new unit hit buffs fire rate+range [max 5/sec and +200 range].  Orbs always move 10% faster than Ryze when shot.\n*Magic damage/Orb: 10 / 20 / 40 / 80 / 160 (+30% AP).*\n15 second CD. 15% max Mana+40 Mana/Orb, OR 300 HP+100 HP/Orb (stops when at 5% HP and 0% Mana)\n\n**W: Rune Prison-** 550 range. Ryze targets a unit in 500 range and makes a big white hand hover over their head. If they do not use abilities/summoner spells for 3.5 seconds nothing happens, but if they do, the the hand will clamp down around them 0.5 seconds later, rooting them for up to 1.75 seconds and dealing damage.\n*Magic Damage: 70 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 200 (+20% max HP) (+20% max Mana) *\n15 second CD. 25 Mana if target is rooted, 75 Mana if they aren't. Will  punch Baron in the face rather than caging it. Features in taunts.\n\n**E: Spell Flux- 550 range (bounces 250).** Ryze skillshots a pure Mana tendril that bounces between Ryze, allies and enemies up to 5 times, favoring further units. Enemies hit are damaged, and allies hit are granted 25 Mana (+1% Mana). Every different target after the first grants Ryze 30 movement speed, up to a flat 150 for 3.5 secs.\n*Magic damage/bounce: 50 / 70 / 90 / 120 / 150 (+ 25% AP) (+ 10% of max mana)*\n15 second CD. 50/69/88/95/100 Mana. Can only hit the same target 3 times by the nature of the bounce.\n\n**R: Thornmagicks/Desperate Power.** Passively, Ryze reflects magic damage back to attackers as physical damage. Actively for 5/6/7 seconds, he multiplies all his runes' power by the number of enemies outnumbering him [max 5] and his attack range becomes melee, knocking enemies back for 100 units. R passive stops while on CD.\n*Physical damage: 1 (+0.1% max Mana)*\n75 second CD.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-26T03:14:17.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't Ryze anymore...you might as well rework it into a new champion concept...","replies":[{"poster":"minimuslim","date":"2015-03-26T18:34:46.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except it is still Ryze.

Ryze would still spam lots of skills rapidly. Ryze would still run around fast. Ryze would still be a tattooed blue tanky mage with a scroll on his back, a red spammable Q, a white targeted W, a bouncy blue E, a steroid R, and a CD passive.\n\nHe would still be a low-range, high-rate of fire electric spell caster.\n\nA player playing my Ryze and someone playing the old Ryze would look *nearly exactly the same*, except my Ryze would move more while casting spells, and punch enemies away on ult if they get too close.

Also it will cost him more Mana to cast it.\n\n* Building Banshee's Veil will block Rune Prison's effects when you trigger it; Sivir or Nocturne are also good choices, and Morgana's Black Shield will prevent the lockdown and a good portion of some of the magic damage. Banshee's will also stop one hit from Overload or Spell Flux. A good Ryze will try and pop your Banshee's before using Rune Prison.\n\n* A small amount of Armor will fully negate the damage of his ultimate's passive, Thornmagicks, until he stacks full Mana.\n\n* As a short-ranged sustained damage tanky mage, Ryze is strong against melee tanks, melee assassins and high mobility squishy kiters; and poor against ADCs and long range mages. Champions who outrange him, outburst him, or can shoot through minions to hit him are a good choice to pick, as ranged champions will not be worried by his melee knockback. Anyone with a silence, such as Cho, is also effective, because Ryze needs time to do damage.\n\n* Counter summoner spells include {{summoner:4}} for leaving his range, {{summoner:3}} for stopping him from kiting and lowering his damage, or {{summoner:1}}  for escaping his Rune Prison once you trigger it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"minimuslim","date":"2015-03-25T18:27:52.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, it keeps the feel and look of his base kit the same for old Ryze players, but does what Riot said they wished to do: Increase his skillcap [by adding one and a half skillshots] and increase his counterplay [he keeps a targeted root, but now gives his target a go-ahead-punk-make-my-day choice to trigger it or not which becomes a silence or root by their choice].\n\nIt makes three build paths almost equally viable- AP builds give high, reliable damage on Q and E, Health builds make him tanky/give W more damage/give Q more spam time, and Mana gives him more ammo for spell spam, more damage on W and E, more Mana granted to allies,\n\nIt also keeps his original focus on AAs/Q/W/E, leaving his ult as a Singed-style steroid which you acknowledge as increasing your power and don't have to think about, because to me adding a new skillshot on R just wouldn't fit the Ryze people are used to.\n\nFinally it balances his power a bit more towards the \"fighting lots of enemies\" side away from the 1V1 duelist side.\n\nHopefully, my rework will make him viable in the toplane, jungle, midlane and support position, and more fun in general.","replies":[]}]}
