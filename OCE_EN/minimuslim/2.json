Once you have an alliance with someone in-game, your attacks will not affect them and your ally-cast abilities can be used on them, and you can communicate in chat and in the game. You can ally with up to 4 other players, and you can break the alliance in-game by alt-clicking to surprise attack them.\r\n\r\nThe map has a Nexus at the centre, player spawns round the Nexus, monster spawns on the map edges, and lots of jungle &brush.\r\n\r\nYour objective is to survive. Being alive is 1 point every 10 seconds. Champion kills are 10 points, Monster kills are 1 point. Staying at the Nexus makes you lose 1 point every 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:14}} \r\nTo make surviving more difficult, your Health drops by a little every 5 seconds; champions like Mundo with high health regen experience slower drop and champions who use Health as a resource use 10% less health to do so, but everyone's health always drops, and Mana regen is 50% slower.\r\n3 Teemo shrooms are also randomly distributed in bushes on the map.\r\n{{item:2009}} \r\nTo help you survive, there are 45 items stashed at the Nexus that make you stronger if you grab them; there are Biscuits, Mana pots, yellow trinkets, red trinkets, blue trinkets, Frost Queen's Claims, Black Cleavers, etc. Grabbing these are highly risky because everyone else will want them. In the jungle, killing weaker monsters and finding Biscuits grants you HP. Killing an enemy makes them drop their items. When there are only 10/5/3 players left, the lowest health players get 5/4/3 Biscuits.\r\n{{item:1039}} \r\nIf a player dies, they stay dead but are not out of the running to win- they come back as a Giant Greater Wolf, Raptor, Brambleback or Golem, who respectively run faster, can fly over walls, apply burn, or are 25% slower with 3x the HP.\r\n If a monster kills a player, they steal 25% of their points. If you die as a monster it respawns in 60 seconds on the edges of the map.\r\n\r\nThe winner is the player with the most points at the endgame, even if they were a monster; the person who survived the longest and got the most kills are also listed. If you get the most points in a match, get the longest survival in a match, and get the most kills in another match, you get a thunderbolt Summoner Icon.\r\n{{summoner:30}} {{item:3460}}","replies":[]}
