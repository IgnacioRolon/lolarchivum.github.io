She gains movespeed while running in this direction.\r\n\r\n**Q- Make it Rain:** MF calls down a grapeshot volley from her off-screen mercs which scatters over a rough circle [rather than a neat one like we have now], slowing targets hit. Make it Rain applies Grievous Wounds, and deals physical damage  (+%AD).\r\n\r\n**W - Keelhaul:** MF throws a ship&#039;s rope lariat, tethering herself to an enemy from afar to force them to drag her along from 750 units away for 5 seconds, dealing damage (+%AP) to them as they move, and is able to AA them while riding as well. If the unit has less max HP than Miss Fortune, she will pull them along with her instead a la Skarner, but they are not suppressed for the duration.\r\n\r\n**E - Double Up:** MF&#039;s magic flintlocks increase their damage, and hitting a target applies Grievous Wounds and bounces the attack to a target behind it for DOUBLE (+%AD +%AP) damage, for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n**R - Bullet Time:** Miss Fortune fires two separate cones of bullets moving in the direction of the mouse which widen or narrow depending on how close the mouse is to her. Deals damage (+%AD) +(%AP)\r\n{{champion:21}}","replies":[]}
