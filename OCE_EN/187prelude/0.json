People main Garen, it doesn't make him any more skilful to play.\n\nNothing is 'wrong' with Lux, she's just a very powerful champ that doesn't require a lot of effort to play. (and everyone knows this)\n\nHer combo is more powerful and easier to hit than most other AP champs, giving her quite a big advantage over them a lot of the time.\n\nCompare her and Taliyah for example. To hit Lux's full combo, you need to land Q... Thats it, once you land Q, you have to be a vegetable not to be able to proc your passive, land E then ult. \nFor Taliyah to land her full combo, she needs to hit them with her E, then needs to hit them with her W, knock them back (in the right direction) into at least 4 rocks of her E, AND hit all 5 individual rocks from her Q..\nSo Taliyah has to hit 11 spells (none of which are guaranteed to hit) in order to land her full combo, Lux needs to land 1 spell, and then all her others are _guaranteed_.\n\nSo my point is, standing up in a court of law and saying \"But he's a nice guy!\" When the bodies of the people he's murdered are lying in the floor. just isn't a valid defence.\n\nIts like Standing up and saying, \"Garen and Yi don't have enough power\". You cant defend them, its like arguing at a brick wall.\n\nPeople know Lux is easy to play, one of the easiest mages. She has more damage than most mages, and very very strong CC. Thats just a fact. \nStanding up and trying to defend her low movement speed would get you laughed out of court. \n\nLux is easier and more powerful than Anivia, and Anivia only has 325 movement speed. But it doesn't make Anivia weak.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-07-11T08:02:42.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"really not sure how u got to this big long post u have here from \n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XEGf1GMl,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-07-10T11:45:52.365+0000)\n>\n> Dude, you&#x27;re defending Lux, LUX! \n> \n> Let that sink in for a second.\n\nand \n\n> [{quoted}](name=Hikari Kitsune,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XEGf1GMl,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2016-07-10T14:05:08.143+0000)\n>\n> And your point I main lux. What&#x27;s wrong with lux\n\nanyway point is don't even begin to compare lux to Taliyah they r 2 completely different champs lux is a burst mage so if u fuck up and get caught by here snare your meant to die that the whole point of a bust mage. also u say that lux only needs to land her snare and that's it all the others are guaranteed. Whats your point that's the same for a lot of other champs to for example{{champion:134}} land your stun and she can do a full combo, {{champion:103}} land her charm she can do a full combo, {{champion:136}} land his stun he can do a full combo, {{champion:101}} lands his stun can do a full combo. I'm really not seeing your problem here with lux landing her snare and being able to do her full combo. As for comparing her to Taliyah its like u went out of your way to pick the 2 most different champs u could just so u could have some straw man argument. Taliyah unlike lux has self peel, a ms boost when she is near walls and can make a massive wall that can go through terrain she is not a burst mage she isn't ment to kill u in 1 rotation of her spells she is meant to weave in and out of the fight","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-11T19:19:28.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not comparing their roles I'm comparing how easy they are to play.\n\nAlso, {{champion:134}}  full combo takes a lot longer to hit than can be achieved in the duration of her stun...

You smack people with stars until they die, you stop them from running away with Q and if they get too close you push them away with ult...

Firstly his Q windup uses most of that time anyway, and how are you supposed to fit in all 5 ult shots? (and if youre close enough to hit them with his stun, i seriously doubt you should be ulting.)\n\n{{champion:163}} not supposed to burt you in 1 rotation of her spells? Mate Taliyah is one of my favourite champs and she can burst just about anyone in 1 rotation, especially late game.\n\n**Ill tell you what:** You go away and play only {{champion:136}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:163}} for a few weeks, and then come back here and try to defend Lux.

Also not sure where u get the idea that xerath doesn't have as much pay off. 1 his q can hit an entire team if they r grouped up and aim it right. 2 a lot of lux's damage comes from her passive so if she cant aa then shes doing shit all damage unless she is really fed. as for lux 2 man biding so what it only snares 2 champs if one is right behind the other so don't run in a line and she can only snare 1 person ","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-10T14:40:20.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously you were getting very defensive about Lux, don't worry I won't shatter your precious illusion.
