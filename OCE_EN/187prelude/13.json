Perhaps i have life responsibilities i place above pixels? That being said, $320 isnt much money. However, to spend it on a game... Go out into the real world and tell random people you spent $320 on random chance to obtain some pixels in a game... as the OP said, for all the attention it'l get them. Mature people, just shake their heads wondering what means something to you... Pixels mean alot, you derive your selfesteem off it, i understand. It's important to you and your circle of pixel loving friends. But to the rest of the world.... It's just sad you're playing digital scratchies hoping to get some pixels before others hoping that the younger audiences will admire you. \n\nShows a real lack of personality is all :)","replies":[{"poster":"187prelude","date":"2016-04-24T08:56:29.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rofl","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"187prelude","date":"2016-04-24T05:31:40.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just find hextech annie valuable because it's exclusive to a system that came out and not many people have it or are seriously lucky enough to get it in a box.
