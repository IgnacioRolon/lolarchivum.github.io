And if you feel tilted/tired, stop playing because you most probably aren't going to reach that next division like that.\nTLDR; focus on getting better at a role (or two). Lower your champion pool to 4 and perfect their mechanics. Play champs that can carry solo. DONT RELY TOO MUCH ON TEAMMATES CAUSE THEY ARE BOOSTED APES. And last but not least...
