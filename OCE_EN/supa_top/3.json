And also should i play with him and make him be paired against very hard and annoying players or should i just let him play solo and help out in the background till he grasps the basics. Also is the tutorial and begineer help decent at showing the basic of the game. and any youtube guides on basic concepts of the game would also be appreciated. Back when i first started the game was a lot easier and i had a group of ~5-7 playing so it was very easy to get addicted but i cant help but feel his initial experience is going to be terrible worse and cause him to give up on the game. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated. What helped you climb to lvl 30 and beyond?","replies":[{"poster":"Sonatics77","date":"2017-10-17T09:22:58.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When I started playing League I didn't even know you could buy items :P until I queued with a friend and he played supp while I played adc and he taught me how to play and now I'm lvl 30. You could try playing supp and teaching him the basics while keeping him from dying (which makes playing much more fun when u start). Try teaching the basics in Coop vs Ai and then start playing PvP, when I started playing PvP I always liked playing with someone else so I don't get flamed by other people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-10-08T00:44:00.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started back in season 4, and like you I always had a large group of friends to play with. I think that's what made the game the most enjoyable and is the reason that I have kept playing for as long as I have. \n\nThe downside of sticking to bots is that you don't really learn much, since AI and actual player movement and play patterns are completely different. It also doesn't give you that much of experience in different match ups since its always the same over and over again. \n\nIt's definitely hard to make the switch over to PVP from bots, and its even harder if you are jumping straight into level 30 games when playing with friends. That being said, I don't necessarily think its a bad thing. I was shielded from a lot of toxicity as I was constantly in a full premade at least the first year I was playing. It meant I was able to learn the game at my own pace and I wasn't flamed too hard to be put off the game when I made a small mistake. I know quite a few people who I tried introducing to the game were put off by the toxicity, even in bot games and low level games. \n\n* [League craft 101 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz)series are pretty good at introducing basic mechanics (that a lot of low elo players could also benefit off learning). \n\n* There is also the mentor system over at [leaguecoaching.gg](https://www.leaguecoaching.gg/) (like coaching but free and for new players just learning the game).","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2017-10-08T03:11:51.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks a heap, like you the only toxicity i got before i hit 100 games into lvl 30 was banter in comms with the premade, i feel it will be very different for him as he would most likely only have me. ill try get him to watch the youtube guides (as i did when i first started) and help ive been really thinking of throwing him in the deep end after we play bots and him just duoing with my main account and trying to get him to slowly understand the game through watching other players in PvP. Since worlds is on i think we will watch that today while his client does the 15 Gb update.\n\nwhat lvl or hours played do you think i should try transition from AI to PvP. Personally i played from i think lvl3 - 30 only in PvP norms back in s5 when i started and i feel it was a lot more fun then AI games. (P.S nice mentor post on the climbing wouldve loved to read it but i went through my own self progression and climbed before i read it)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2017-10-10T10:33:36.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played my first normal game at level 17 or something and honestly had no idea what to do. Everything from lane assignments to cs is different. \n\nI think the earlier the better to get into PVP so players don't pick up and stick with bad habits in bot games. Definitely in a premade up until level 30 though, since league is quite a learning curve and you want to be able to provide a safe space to try new things out before being exposed to potentially toxic teammates who will flame for the slightest of things. \n\nAyyy, grats on the climb :) I hope you enjoy your rewards this season!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-10-07T10:29:46.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play bots?","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2017-10-07T13:02:36.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"looking for more specific tricks or such not rather the only gamemode he can play","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-10-08T00:42:34.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gaming genre is personal preference, either he like it or he doesnt.
