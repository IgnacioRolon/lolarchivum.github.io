That leaves Kayn with 35 more damage on his Q.

Kha's Isolated Q gains 62% scaling, and 28 base damage. 62% of 350 = 217 + 28 = 245.\r\nKha'Zix - 120 + 245 = 125\r\n\r\nKha'Zix has a net gain of 125 extra damage. **BUFF**\r\n\r\n______________________\r\n\r\nNocturne's R gains 30% scaling and 50 base damage. 30% of 350 = 105\r\nNocturne - 120 + (105 + 50) = 35\r\n\r\nNocturne has a net gain of 125 extra damage. **BUFF**\r\n\r\n______________________\r\n\r\nRengar's Q gains 10% scaling. 10% of 230 = 35. Rengar's E gains 10% scaling. 10% of 350 = 35. Rengar's R gains 20% scaling. 20% of 350 = 70\r\nRengar - 120 + (35 + 35 + 70) = 20\r\n\r\nRengar has a net gain of 20 extra damage. **BUFF**\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nShaco gains a 70% scaling, and 50 base damage (plus an extra AP scaling I wont even bother to include). 70% of 350 = 245\r\nShaco - 120 + (245 + 50) = 275\r\n\r\nShaco has a net gain of 275 extra damage. **BUFF**\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n\r\nTalon's passive gains 70 base damage.

As opposed to (220 + 315) + ((220 + 315) - 134) + ((220 + 315) - 134 = 1337.\r\n1605 - 1337 = 268 - 120 = 148\r\n\r\nZed has a net gain of 148 extra damage (and thats without the extra damage added on his ult). **BUFF**\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nLee Sin's R gains 150 base damage.\r\nLee Sin - 120 + 150 = 30\r\n\r\nLee Sin has a net gain of 30 extra damage. **BUFF**\r\n\r\n___________________\r\n\r\nYes. I did the maths.\r\n\r\nThese changes give everyone except Kha'Zix a more powerful game between starting the game and getting first item _(a time where assassins SHOULD NOT BE POWERFUL)_. and when it's late game and everyone is full build all of these champions with or without duskblade, are stronger than before.\r\n\r\nSo yea, in my books, thats a buff.

Wouldn’t that give him a little back what was taken from trackers? \r\n\r\nWith deadmans if you wanted to make it a more fighter orientated item why not instead give it double/ triple momentum generation when a dash is used, keep the auto attack lockout  but let the slow and damage scale based on momentum stacks. So that during a fight the fighters can realistically get addditional utility and damage out of it. As it currently stands it’s essentially a 1 time use slow and maybe +1-10 momentum  stacks worth of damage each auto.","replies":[]},{"poster":"magma lord","date":"2018-03-20T21:04:11.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the little table on the pizza, very nice detail.","replies":[]}]}
