I might ward a place which is incredibly important to me, which you would consider less than optimal since optimal of course would also depend on meta, strategy, game condition, and current tactics. If you're winning then deep wards in the enemy jungle and no wards in your own jungle are fine since you're controlling the map. If you're losing then it's the opposite. \r\n\r\nIt also depends how many wards you have and there's a lot of spots which are even in importance, again, depending on meta, strategy, condition, and tactics. Nocturne for instance doesn't need to move up river to gank a lane so warding against him is different to warding against Olaf since he needs to run all the way up to you.\r\n\r\nSeeing where other people ward is more useful for refining your knowledge of their meta, strategy, tactics, conditions, heroes, etc, than knowing where a good ward should be, barring the obvious things like tri brush.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Giant Rat","date":"2015-11-19T03:20:24.151+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are some much more common places than others and for the moat part in worlds they only swept areas were there had been or was a ward, so for the most part they were on point.
