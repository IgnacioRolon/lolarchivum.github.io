Major disappointment that it's still not available to us at this time. It's been more than 5 weeks now since the original launch date that was given to us. I moved countries since September of last year and worked really hard to get into the rank I am now and decided to wait 2 months. 2 months turned into 4 months... I even started a new account and it's just not the same without all of my hard earned rewards, skins and champion pool.
