Chiefs had a strong line-up, you can't say that their Top, ADC and new Support would have held them back. Gerard Murphy must have made them a good financial offer. Can't argue with acquiring Swiffer there. If Tally can improve from being a wave management expert, and if FBI can make decisions on the fly rather than be a 'yes' man, these guys could have a great season. If Rogue does shotcalling well, he could well be the glue to this team.\n\n**LEGACY ESPORTS:** Some of their 2017 Roster was a bit overrated, this is a totally new look team bar the mid laner Claire, who was very up and down in 2017. The top laner Ceres was also rather inconsistent last season, so they have a lot of work to do to improve themselves. There were better options in the ADC role surely (who loses lane as a Kalista to DaSticks in soloqueue?). Decoy is an unknown quantity, but maintained a high level last split during soloqueue and might be a good pickup. Overall, this team should struggle in the OPL, don't think they will make top three this split.\n\n**SIN GAMING:** The eternal problem for SIN is the exodus of players after a good season for supposedly stronger line-ups. Retaining Juves is great, but the main thing about this team is their coach who makes vast improvements out of players that are seemingly not good enough to be on a pro team. It should take a while for this to happen, so I think they will struggle. A hard worker in the top lane, and a solid russian mid gives Bencel something to work with.\n\n**TECTONIC:** Now with the Tainted Minds saga out of the way, some people might be more inclined to support this team. But their roster looks extremely weak and I would predict them to finish dead last this split. I mean you can't really play Sona support every game can you? Coach Saiclone has a lot of work on to tame his rookie botlane, but with the acquistion of the improving Papryze at least its not all doom and gloom.\n\n","replies":[]}]}
