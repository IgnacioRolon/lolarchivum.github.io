I feel as if this competition was not fair at all.. Hand drawn pieces are much less vibrant in colours and are less enhanceable compared to computer programs.. If you take a second to look at the short list you'll notice that there is only one physical artwork out of the 20 originally (now 18). And if you think about it.. If you got the people who submitted artworks that were created using computer programs to hand draw their pieces then they wouldnt even come close to looking as good as they do on a screen. This competition wasted many hours for the people that did physical art works... So unfair.. Should have been split from physical to pixelated pieces.. Hate how this competition was set up..
