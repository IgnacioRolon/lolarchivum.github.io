The fuck is wrong with Riot? And the bonus ultimate cdr is going to render Ultimate Hunter irrelevant, congrats yet again.\r\n\r\nElder Drag execution is bullshit. It will instantly override Baron as the most important objective, because it will essentially reduce the health of the entire opposing team by a significant amount. Fantastically game breaking stuff introduced without solving the old problems. This seems to be a pattern, you guys.\r\n\r\nToplane impact - the problem isn't a lack of XP, the problem is junglers deciding toplane, ranged cheese being overpowered, and mages being the superior class against both tanks and bruisers.\r\nRemoving true damage from Conqueror is going to kill bruisers, and tanks aren't going to be played anyway, because their itemization against magic damage is shit.\r\nAt least Klepto is less annyoing, even if ranged cheese itself didn't get fully nerfed.
