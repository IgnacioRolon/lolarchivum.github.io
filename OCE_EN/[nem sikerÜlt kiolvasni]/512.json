And even during the game i like it how is give a very realistic looking \"battle\" quote when she goes to fight. She actually looks like she is trying to make conversation when she emote. I also really love it how her jokes flow and its not just a repeat of the exact same line over and over. This an awesome feature, adding a real depth of personality to characters in game and I really do hope you guys keep it up.\n\n\n(Maybe you guys could give yasuo a nice \"model rework\"(facial animations))","replies":[]},{"poster":"CruxTemplar","date":"2015-12-15T22:29:30.159+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"A very interesting read.
