Also, just inviting 4 other random people to a premade group for a party ip boost is not a bad thing in itself -- it allows you to play with new people and to make new friends in itself. A program which happens to give you incentives for inviting friends is okay, but if you're solely doing it just for the rewards and not to make the experience enjoyable as a whole in playing with friends, then I think it isn't.\n\nRiot is working and collaborating in trying to come up with new ideas to make the overall League experience fun -- just because RAF is coming to an end, does not put that to an end.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-06T05:21:58.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also.
