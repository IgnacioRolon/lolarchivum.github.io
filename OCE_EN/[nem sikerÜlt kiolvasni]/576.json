For example, applying {{champion:75}} 's Wither (W) ability to an enemy for (at max rank and time [5 Seconds])95% slow and with Talon suddenly, no, IMMEDIATELY jumping to them afterwards and applying a gobsmacking 99% slow... and wait for it... for 0.25 seconds, at all ranks mind you (IIRC this is the strongest slow in the game, albeit at the cost of a tiny duration). By doing so, you basically defeat the purpose of someone applying a slow over a longer period of time with it only to be immediately cancelled with a immensely stronger yet much much shorter duration of a slow. Now before you argue that the {{champion:91}}  should either jump first or jump afterwards the slow is finished, a stupid idea in it's own right, I then wish to simply say that the overall change is still a correct course of action, just that there are a few tiny holes in the change that may need to be addressed or at least considered.","replies":[{"poster":"WilloAndy","date":"2015-07-08T09:17:37.718+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that the strongest slow is applied over all other slows, then after that duration runs out the next strongest slow applies until that runs out and so on. I think that was to target percentage slows stacking with each other which made playing against a team with lots of slows really annoying because you can literally get reduced to 30ish movespeed against team with nunu, kogmaw and tryn and that is not fun to play against. So in your case I'm guessing the talon's slow would work for the 0.25 seconds and after that the nasus slow will kick in.","replies":[{"poster":"Pattern of Pi","date":"2015-07-08T10:10:42.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do like the idea, but it would mean that some abilities' slows are useless.
