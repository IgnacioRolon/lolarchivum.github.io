Instead of grinding for IP to get that new champion we all want, we will be rewarded with a chest every 40+ games (coz thats how long it will eventually take to level up) that might grant us 500 BE (assuming we get the right shard). Sounds all nice and fancy, but ultimately will result in the majority of the playerbase being forced to pay physical money for new or even old champions. Im sure Riot loves this idea though. Not to sound like a pessimist, but this new update could break this game, resulting in hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of players leaving league for other MOBAS.

If you think about it, it would be great Riot gives the champion skin shards from the loot a higher disenchanting value at the very least or give a higher drop rate for more costly champions so we get more disenchanting value every time we level up. Another thing is the leveling cap. It seems that the only driving force for levelling up is to receive BE from disenchanting skin shards. It actually doesn't sound enticing as most are rather pissed off with the value of BE we get per level which may vary due to how lucky you are; mostly low value. This makes levelling not really worth it. However, if Riot were to implement a milestone system for example at level 30 for newcomers, they will get 6300 BE instant. It would feel rewarding. They can also provide milestone every 10 levels which scales up starting from level 30, then 40, and then 50, etc. Unless you are reluctant, you can switch the BE suggestion to more loot boxes instead. 2 at level 30, 3 at level 40, 4 at level 50. Stopping at a maximum of 9 loot boxes which will be level 100 which I assume by then players would have collected all champions or most of it to a satisfactory amount.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SP Focus","date":"2017-11-10T05:00:58.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WHAT WE WANT\r\n\r\n- BE after games\r\n- More on Champion Mastery (Rewards, Milestones, Champion Emotes etc)\r\n- Make tanks do less damage\r\n- Show Takedowns/CreepScore/Gameswon/played on profile for everyone","replies":[]},{"poster":"I am a robot","date":"2017-11-09T23:20:10.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So we dont get BE but we get a capsule every time we level up, and how do we supposed to unlock champ shards?
