To expand on the point regarding equal treatment of everyone in the league, my involvement with Tainted Minds' owner John McRae is the same as it has been with anyone else in the OPL. I have no prior, nor current, personal relationship with the owner, nor are we engaged in any form of business relationship, other than his being the owner of one of eight OPL teams.\r\n\r\nJohn approached the league after a colleague of his from New Zealand contacted me looking to explore esports. They were interested in entering the esports industry and I assisted them as he did their due diligence into the operation of the league. This is a standard process for all potential owners. Let’s Play Live then approached Tainted Minds and in late 2016 a deal was done.\r\n\r\nLet's Play Live works with our high school team in running tournaments in New Zealand. While we consider this a good thing (the more opportunities to play LoL the better) we, and I, would never let this compromise our values or rules. The high school program is not operated by the esports team and I have had little to no visibility on what they have built together.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Nizu","date":"2017-03-16T09:52:07.718+0000","up_votes":17,"down_votes":6,"body":"> As the head of esports, it's part of my job to speak for the league on these sorts of issues. \r\n\r\nWhat a fucking joke. \r\n\r\nAs the accused party you should have recused yourself from the matter for investigation and at the absolute, very least, not been the face of the PR statement. \"Guys, guys, trust me, I checked it out.

However, I will forever remain skeptical and doubtful of anything you say. Ever since you BLATANTLY lied about as something small as gifting NA transfer to OCE players when it opened up with new OCE specific skin for free (which I had been involved in since day 1 in the forum about the idea of what the skin should be; hell i was one of the very first commenter in this post; until the comments in the archived post miraculously edited/deleted) and told everyone that you didn't say it was free then later sold the skin for a generous profit. \r\n\r\nIf you think you don't reek of corruption, you are soooo mistaken sir. The conflict of interest between you and John Mcrae is not a small thing to ignore, when there are better claims out there that you do have prior relationship with John Mcrae, the invester, director of LPL, who is also the invester of TM. \r\n\r\nAnd if my experience with RIOT OCE and YOU tells me anything? You are full of lies. You change facts to suit whatever seems beneficial for you. Simply put, I cannot believe a word you say.","replies":[]},{"poster":"falcano","date":"2017-03-16T08:05:57.799+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":3,"body":"Hahaha same guy accused of being biased writes this shit.

If this is not the case it shows a sheer lack of governance for our esports division and shows team owners how poorly they can treat their players without any repercussion, there are legitimate concerns for the Health & Safety of the players. Regardless if the articles intent was to look at the scenario objectively there will always been a reasonable sense of doubt that the article is made with bias.\r\n\r\nI also like the comment you made \"A condition of being a partner in the Oceanic Pro League is the commitment to operating a professional organisation\" Its a little hard to take this comment seriously when riot was clearly aware that the players practice environment was poor and appears for no attempts to rectify the issue. From what Cake has shown there have been numerous attempts to organise a time for the players and the team owners to arrive at a resolution but was constantly delayed. A professional organisation which appears to be riots standard  should attend to the matters in a fast fashion, not only to the players concerns but to maintain the reputation and integrity of the Tainted Minds brand. As part of  the fiduciary duties which  occur when taking on employees or contractors when you operate a business, you need to make sure the working conditions are at a safety standard and management practices internally in place.Since the players are contractual obligated to perform their role as part of their signing contracted they too should expect to meet a standard workplace health and safety requirement, let alone why did riot not have a bare minimal standard in place to protect the players. \r\n\r\nAs someone who would like to see the Oceanic Esports scene to grow, it pains me to see the fact that riot has to let this Tainted Minds debacle reach to a point where players have to turn to social media to get their concerns heard? Why is it that it takes public ridicule for their to be any kind of response from Riot, let alone from the worst possible person that could have made it given the scenario only to then use it to help their PR. Scenarios like this and the whole Rich Gang debacle is why oce is experience very little viewership growth, because the community cannot take the scene seriously. Riot, to legitimize the Oceanic Pro League you need to set a reasonable living standard for the players so there is incentive for players to play professionally and see Oceania grow as a international competitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Selemena","date":"2017-03-16T21:00:52.797+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great.
