I feel this may be the reason NA challengers do this (human errors are going to happen at some point). As for the Korean's, they my take it to try and reduce the time to move a finger between the ping key and the flash key (maybe saving a few ms of time which may be crucial), which while I personally don't agree with (I assume the amount of times you die from accidentally using flash would be greater then the deaths you save from being a few ms earlier on a flash), I can respect the reason. \r\nJust my opinion though.","replies":[{"poster":"st0rmbreak X","date":"2016-02-25T03:12:00.303+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by reducing the time between ping keys? I don't understand why people would use G and V to ping when you can easily do \"ALT + Left click\" and \"CTRL + Left click\" respectively which takes mispressing keys completely out of the equation. Since your thumb is naturally on the spacebar, pressing ALT shouldn't be a problem at all. Pressing CTRL to ping back might take a little getting used to, but you can still ALT + Left click, then drag in the relevant direction.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the reason I feel people take Flash on F (for me anyway) is that your Flash (F) button is closer to your Ultimate (R) and is ergonomically easier to press. Having flash on D means using your middle finger then your index finger if you were to use your Ultimate, which isn't too comfortable especially for people with long fingers. Having Flash on D means that I would be pressing my Flash with the fingernail of my middle finger. I can't do that since it's not a reliable means of using a game-changing spell.\r\n\r\nThe reason I feel people take Flash on D is that they are likely playing with 3 fingers, with their index finger starting on E instead of R, and reaching over to press their Ultimate (R) when required. Since Ultimates are usually on a long cooldown like Flash, they may think that they shouldn't require a finger on them 100% of the time, and feel that using their pinky, which is our weakest finger, to press Q which in general is a poke and skill shot (Ezreal, Jarvan, Aatrox, Caitlyn, Zed etc) or mobility spell (Vayne) unreliable.\r\n\r\nStillllllllllllll probably down to personal preference.","replies":[{"poster":"TheBioB","date":"2016-02-25T09:21:55.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ermh...Dude, Riot posted this to end the feud.
