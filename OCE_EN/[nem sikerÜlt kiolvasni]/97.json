Don't even get me started on the store; it's so unnecessarily FAT.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the concepts, I commented saying I think that having a champ icon is really old-fashioned. Honestly, if you don't know what champ you're playing, you should just alt-f4. Requiring it on the HUD to jump to your champ, implying you don't use the bound key to do so, is simply announcing that you're using inferior methods.\r\n\r\nWhen scaling down the UI, the character stats icons are almost unreadable. This won't be a problem once we learn what's where and can just glance at it, but why was the panel completely replaced by this stupid little pop-out thing. I just think it feels like it was tacked on as an afterthought.\r\n\r\nI could go on and detail every little thing that I think could be improved but most of that would be fixed if they just made the entire UI modular, allowing players to drag, drop and resize things on the HUD - They obviously already have the basics of this implemented, as you can do all that to the chat. I don't know why this update wasn't held off until we could see something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...But seriously, wtf with the store page?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quixotiix","date":"2015-07-23T00:15:09.549+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just letting you know that I am having trouble moving items around after this patch.

It might seem trivial, but that might be something to do, so you can arrange lanes there as well.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe, considering the amount of customization that is possible in the display of the TAB screen, perhaps an extra few seconds of forced inactivity at the start could be useful, so that you can still rush out and get vision where you want it, or protect against invades whilst still being able to arrange the TAB screen safely.\r\n\r\nThank you for listening.","replies":[]},{"poster":"scURVE","date":"2015-07-23T10:34:17.061+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"I don't understand why people complain after every new thing Riot does, everyone bitched hard when the new map came out and now everyone seems to love it, things just take a while to get used to when they first appear.
