A nice and cool feature everyone could have would be to customize their own champ border when you enter into the loading screen.\r\nTo be able to do this gives everyone a sense of \"wow & that's cool\" feel.\r\nBut what this also can do (I think) is that it can potentially up peoples way of playing the game, as in a more positive attitude to the game and to see everyone else's borders on their loading screen and be like \"That's awesome\". It brings out that creativity in everyone and can make people feel a lot more better about themselves in and out of the game.\r\nThis could also motivate peoples minds to really tune into this game and just play heaps. (this is only what I think)\r\nBut not just people that play the game but also people who don't. People who see this can see this as a cool thing, and interactive feature which can possibly attract a lot more people and gamers particularly to just play this game.\r\nBut of course to customize a border for a specific champion this would obviously cost Influence points (IP) to get different types of designs and various little shapes and all.\r\nBut rare and cool looking features and designs could cost riot points (RP) and can also possibly be in the hextech crafting for randoms.\r\nBut then again this is what I think you guys can or could do. It has many benefits in my mind but you guys might have a fair bit of negatives about this but again I think this is a great idea and this can be awesome for others to do.\r\nLhuka.\r\nP.S - This could make money (COULD)\r\nJust putting that out there sorry others who hate this part of the comment.......","replies":[{"poster":"PokapokaCHU","date":"2016-07-19T10:47:21.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good idea man, this way my team will look at loading screen and not say: \" Wow wtf lux took {{summoner:1}}  thats bs who the hell takes {{summoner:1}}  against a zed\" kappa\r\n ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MikuruKisune","date":"2016-07-19T01:13:16.490+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So let me get this straight. If we wish to get the special border that comes with the upcoming Project skin we'll need to unlock these hextech crates in order to claim it that's also random?

Atleast it's not RP and it doesn't require keys.

Assuming you somehow magically get a box or key fragment every single game, this totals to **1,000 games** for a single Hextech skin.
