I am guessing that Rengar is getting a sort of {{champion:86}} /{{champion:203}} targeting mechanic, where killing a \"Threat/ Villain\" gives him a reward. \r\nI am not too happy about changes to Ekko, I get that they want to put him in a certain niche, and they had that for a while, but then they nurfed him to the point that lower elo players couldn't do anything with him, and thus Tank Ekko became a thing. (Though I am sure the Idea came from a high elo player, and the lower elo just accepted that as his new role) I am mostly just upset about this because whenever I start playing and getting good at him again he gets changed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kawaii Meowth","date":"2016-10-10T21:44:32.558+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"That means that champs like rengo, Evelyn, talon and shaco can no longer be countered using a pink right?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-10T22:24:00.702+0000","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe that Evelynn will definitely count as camouflage, and as such WILL be detected by pink wards.\r\n\r\nI would imagine that Rengar and Shaco (as they are currently) would also be detected by pink wards.

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Awesomeman001","date":"2016-10-19T04:01:33.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that copy and pasta","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CJ TGM","date":"2016-10-11T10:17:17.574+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:24}} a lot to take in\r\n(That's)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-10-11T10:50:12.745+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jazzalingco","date":"2016-10-11T08:41:13.467+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOOK AT THE CLEANSE LOOK AT THE MOVES\r\n\r\nFAKER \r\nWHAT\r\nWAS\r\nTHAAAAAAAAAAAT{{champion:238}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoubleChinSwege","date":"2016-10-11T08:25:28.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should make shaco's passive scale with level or something to balance out his early ganks.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"NcyFzwYfS0","date":"2016-10-11T06:32:53.191+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god for this man i was so sick of getting blown up by leblanc i can finally enjoy playing garen now!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Los Pollos","date":"2016-10-11T06:34:58.788+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ikr, I think tanks are really under powered right now.
