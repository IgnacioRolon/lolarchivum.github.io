It will be called Janitor Pantheon. The cost will be 1350 RP. In this skin Pantheon is a Janitor. For his spear he wields a mop. and his shield is a yellow sign reading \"caution wet floor\". He is wearing a blue Janitor suit and for his helmet it is a bucket on his head. For his passive when he has the block up the shield will be going around him. When he uses his Q he throws the mop and when it hits it makes a splash. When he W he jumps on them with a splash as well. With his E Its the same the only difference is that it is with the mop not the spear. His ults, he jumps up and when he he lands water and soap goes everywhere in a splash. With his recall he starts to mop the floor around him and then slips and goes to spawning pool. For his joke he says \"mop up the mess, oh wait thats my job\". For his taunt he says \"After I kill you ill have to clean up your mess\". For his dance he dances around with the mop and spins around. For his laugh it will remain the same. When he dies he spins around in circles and and falls on the floor. If you do go forward with my idea may I please have the skin for free (Oceania).\r\nSincerely, Størmrider","replies":[]},{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-04-22T00:04:46.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey Guys,\r\nSorry for the delay.
