Doom Bots was like a missing hard and nightmare mode\n> for Co-op vs A.I! I would rather have Doom bots replace ARAM as the alternative mode that is always available.\n\nL4T3NCY touched a bit on this in one of the previous Ask Riots:\n> We're still forging the path at the moment with our current stable of modes, and we’re carefully looking at how each one is received and how people are engaging with it. Unfortunately, we can’t tell you exactly when your favorite mode, like say Doom Bots, is coming back but we can talk about how we’re selecting each mode to include in RGM.\n\n> So far the modes we’ve included in RGM represent the widest spread of gameplay with strong engagement, URF for example, is a mode we consistently hear about from players, which is why we chose it among our first releases. That doesn’t mean RGM is a popularity contest. Any game mode that we've previously released is a potential candidate for the RGM queue. If your favourite mode isn't in there yet, there's a chance it will be eventually.\n\n> We also want to try and offer something that’s updated, so as we look at other game modes, it’s important we deliver something more than nostalgia. As you’ve seen with Definitely Not Dominion, we don’t just want to throw old modes into the queue. We try to keep everyone updated on what modes are coming in the near future - so make sure you check in weekly to see what’s coming up. – L4T3NCY\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/rgm-ip-and-tons-damage-ask-riot","replies":[{"poster":"Prince Noobcake","date":"2016-07-26T10:35:08.570+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh....

The majority of the traffic that the regular queues receive moves over to URF.\r\n\r\n People wanting to play the original game or play ranked for its competitive nature are forced to wait significantly longer in their queues. \r\n\r\n Simultaneously, the matchmaking for these queues worsens and as a result people find themselves in uneven games, playing with/against people of a higher or lower skill level.\r\n\r\n URF aside, matchmaking fairness and queue times have been two very hot topics at Riot over the past 6 months, with these being the number 1 most complained about issue in League of Legends since the introduction of Dynamic queue.\r\n\r\n Riot is still in the process of making the matchmaking more consistent in terms of both speed and quality, and if they were to open URF they would be causing more issues and complaints with the regular queues (even if it is just for the weekend).\r\n\r\n As much as I personally love URF and would like to see it as a permanent queue, it isn't ideal for the core/original game mode(s) that made League of Legends the success it is today.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sneakytiki","date":"2016-07-24T09:56:01.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"RITO logic we wont give you urf cause we don't wanna overplay it and make it boring but we will play the fu** out of the other sh*t game modes that no one already cares about  ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Avenue","date":"2016-07-24T06:00:08.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**#BringBackBlackMarketBrawelers **","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrankTheStar","date":"2016-07-24T04:39:39.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"We'd love to hear your feedback\" -Rito Gaems.
