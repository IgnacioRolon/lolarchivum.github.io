Disagree with the bond of stone changes, because of the taking others damage you have extra protection to offset the change and now its boring and less viable than even before. My thresh dislikes you intensely for that.\r\nNEXT patch you guys need to make a change to thunderlords because this is the real annoying part of it. Giving too much power to Aoe dots and crap where that one ability will add a stack towards thunderlords, which is just plain silly. Also by doing that it might usher people in the right direction with who they pick thunderlords with. Bursty attackers with casts and melee should stay in benefit with this change (such as riven or jax) and people who like to play morgana cant just q and w someone to proc thunderlords while staying safe as a button. Same for MF, rains bullets way out of safe range and still gets to proc thunderlords, damage needs to stay skill relative and not free. \r\nAlso love the changes to the mortal reminder and such items.
