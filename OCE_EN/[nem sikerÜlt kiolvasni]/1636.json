Having said that though, they didn't deserve to progress any further.\nUntil OCE teams hire people that can train their teams in macro, decision making, and communication, they will keep missing out on the international stage. Unfortunately there is only one team in the OPL that has such a trainer, and their players are lucklustre compared to Dire Wolves :(\n\nSharp, if you are reading this, I can help you guys out, send me an email that I can contact you on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"askar1","date":"2017-09-27T01:36:42.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"from an outsiders view they didn't respect their opponents in game 3. They were overconfident and kept fighting team one on their terms and eventually started losing.
