So as all three champions have similar item builds, roles and even rune pages the reason for the differing keystones is within the differences within the different kits that the champions have. The main differences in performing as a tank that exist between these three champions is the reliability and consistency in being able to lock down targets with cc effects, the way in which they mitigate damage they take and the way that the utilise their auto attacks. Fizz only has the 1 second knock up from his shark for cc and a small reduction in basic attack damage from his passive in terms of damage mitigation, Ekko has the delayed stun from his w for cc and for damage mitigation he has the shield from the w and healing of his ult, while Maokai has consistent healing due to his passive and 20% damage reduction from his ult with more consistent and reliable cc in the form of his q knock up and his targeted root. In terms of auto attack usage, Fizz has his w passive and active linked to auto attack usage, which provide execute damage plus his q which applies on-hit effects. Ekko has execute damage on autos to targets below 30% health and an on-hit effect applier in his e. Maokai only has his passive which utilises his auto attacks to heal him. This then explains the reasoning behind the tendency to take fervor of battle over grasp of the undying on Fizz and Ekko as the increased damage that it provides gets further increased due to their ability to generate extra auto attacks and their execute damage as the increased damage is more valuable to them than sustain due to their lower consistency in mitigating damage through cc or other means, in particular for Fizz who often will take 18/12/0 in order to make use of dangerous game for sustain which further benefits him for taking fervor over grasp as the healing from dangerous game will be more beneficial to Fizz when low than the healing from grasp, and fervor will allow Fizz to make use of dangerous game more sooner and more frequently. For Maokai on the other hand, grasp adds another source of consistent healing which can often buy him enough time to get another usage of his passive, which increases his ability to mitigate damage by more than just the healing from grasp. In summary, fervor allows Fizz and Ekko to get kills faster which helps mitigate damage for their team as the damage output they stop from opponents due to killing them faster is more damage stopped then the amount they would be able to block by healing from grasp, whereas Maokai is able to mitigate more damage through healing than increased damage output.

By using Fervor of Battle, you're able to diversify your damage (which is usually sustained for both these champs seeing as they're pretty tanky). This means that you can still do a lot of damage to the squishies even if they do build a defensive item (like how you'd see adc go mercurial [Magic Resist] and mages go Zhonyas or Abyssal). \r\n\r\nAlso, the amount of damage Fervor does once it's stacked up (which is easy to do on Ekko and Fizz because they incorporate autos as well as spells when fighting) is vastly superior to grasp of the undying at almost all stages of the game [In a late game scenario with level 18, full build: 2.5% of ~3.5k hp is only 87.5 magic damage every FOUR seconds whilst fervor will be doing a bonus 111.92 damage PER auto, since we've already established that it's very easy to stack fervor quickly] (especially when you go iceborn since it doesn't give hp, so you're losing more scaling on your grasp procs). \r\n\r\nAlso, I reckon Fervor is pretty good into tanks since they'd have to use more gold to build resistances against AD and AP damage coming from Fizz/ Ekko. When your fervor is fully stacked you'll be doing a lot more damage to squishies as well as tanks especially compared to when you were running grasp!

Grasp of the undying has its perks in laning and short fights, however with lane swaps occurring frequently grasp of the undying isn't helpful for the first 10 or so minutes. Fervor of battle on the other hand provides a good mixture of damage, kill potential, and the ability to win all ins. While grasp provides percentage damage and sustain alot of the top lane builds consist of a lot of resistances rather than health giving fervor even more of an advantage. Another reason which quite a few people forget about is the 'piercing thoughts' that provides 7% magic penetration mastery which counters the resistance stacked items the enemy top laner most likely will build, AP tanks struggle to kill tanks with magic resist as they dont have any magic penetration through their items.
