I should also point out this isn't to say riot doesn't look at the data for these game modes, but more likely they only store the bulk of the data for only a short time, or don't record as much data for those game modes, and thus isn't worth releasing minimal data, since as players the general mentality is to keep asking for more.\r\n\r\nOf course this is mostly speculation on my part, so I could be wrong as to the reasoning.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LOLXBAD","date":"2018-08-09T11:21:12.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My starts are on par or even better than challenger and I am silver 3.
