I purely posted my thoughts of what may or may not be fair compensation. \n\nAssuming I would have played anyway, and citing that I was moaning already proves that you cannot hold a viable conversation. Why not just refer to me as being alike Hitler next? \n\nI indeed stated that I was happy with the real life contributions. But if you want to be just another cog in the machine, go ahead and be my guest. But to ask for a little more from them is certainly not unreasonable. Considering, aside from Ocean week... what else is free? They make money all year round from us. We deserve a little more slice from that humble, humble pie.\n\nP.s\nHope you don't cry from my comment back. \nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2017-02-28T06:52:24.416+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The crux of the matter is, you play a game. correct? it has an event that makes the game a bit more interesting for the players of said game. why do they need to personally reward you for them making an effort to get more people to enjoy the game, to give us more satisfaction from playing the game and winning. you should just be happy that they are willing to give you any reward, and not as i said, moan on the boards comments that they didn't give you in particular enough ig swag to reward you for doing something you would do anyway.\n\nEDIT- - i missed one of your points, they earn revenue from us by allowing us to purchase aesthetic upgrades which do absolutely nothing other than look cool for us, and for the other players in game with us. If you dont like that fact that they \"make money from us all year round\" just dont spend any and move on. We deserve, realistically, nothing, they create a service for us to alleviate boredom and stress and to enjoy ourselves, be happy with what you get man.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-02-24T10:21:15.040+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whooo homeguards.
