That being said, this Nemesis Draft is absolutely horrendous, and Nexus Siege wasn't fun at all, so why are we getting these crap game modes instead of the one game mode your community asks for literally every week? \r\n\r\n\"We’re looking for your feedback as we go, so let us know.\"\r\n\r\nThen give us URF you fucking peasants!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-08-21T17:48:02.767+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they gave us URF every weekend everyone would get bored of it and noone would play it after the first 2-3 weeks. URF is a fantastic gamemode don't get me wrong, I love it, but the complete exaggeration of all things in URF means it gets stale very quickly. \n\nIt's kinda like console-ing in items or playing with OP characters in games like Skyrim. It's fun, often incredibly so for a good while to be such a badass you can one shot everything, but then it gets old, and you need a solid break from it to really enjoy it again.\n___\nAs for your comments on the other gamemodes, I quite enjoy Nemesis draft, though it has the same downfall as OFA (an honestly ARAM) in that, despite the whole point of the gamemode being \"you will probably get a champion you can't play well\" the second someone sees a champ they don't like they'll either dodge or drown the game in salt.\n\nPersonally I don't really enjoy Hexakill TT all that much (Hexa SR would be a diff matter), but I love Nexus Siege. Is it very League-y? No, not really, but it's something incredibly unique, and as a fan of tower defense games, throwing in the action but still strategic combat of League is a fantastic twist.\n\nI have no particular opinion of Poro King and would love to see BMB and Doom Bots come back (though Doom Bots especially will have a lot of updating to do so we'll be waiting a while).\n\ntl;dr Too much URF and everyone will hate it. Just because you don't like or hate a gamemode doesn't mean everyone feels the same, and doesn't mean it isn't worthy of being on the roster. You like Hexa TT, I don't. I like Nexus Siege, you don't. They both have their place.","replies":[{"poster":"Pacification","date":"2016-08-22T08:06:55.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The estimated wait times speak for themselves. Everyday of Hexakill and Poro King, the estimated wait time is under 1 min. 1 day into Nexus Siege, and the estimated wait time was 2:43. 1 day into Nemesis Draft, and the estimated wait time was somewhere in the 3 minute region (these were all during midday when the game sees the most players). It's fine to have an opinion, but listening to the minority instead of the majority will only lead to the downfall of the game. Just look at RuneScape. They polled their community to make a massive change to the game and would only not go through with it if the poll was 70% against it. They got around 65% against it, but since it didn't meet the 70% requirement, they went ahead with it and now RuneScape is pretty much dead, excluding OSRS. No one's asking for URF every week, just give us URF as much as they give us Hexakill, Ascension, Poro King, etc.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-20T05:11:45.065+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No one wants any of this shit just listen to the fucking community and give us urf ","replies":[{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-08-23T11:25:36.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Genius.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mrs Buvelle ","date":"2016-08-20T00:29:59.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i've stopped doing any gamemode, till they bring back URF. seriously rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-08-23T11:33:18.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am definitely not asking for URF every week but I am really longing to see it back in rotating modes in the coming weeks or months....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zeralin","date":"2016-08-23T09:02:16.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"legit all the modes are bullshit except urf and you dont put that shit on and i dont really get it why\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-08-22T08:52:58.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how they look forward towards our feedback.......\r\nYeah right the only comments u guys will actually read is the ones that have no relevance to urf.....
