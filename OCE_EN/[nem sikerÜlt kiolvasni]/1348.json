Because I think it is a good reward that really makes challenger players stand out. Most challenger players in every region are affiliated with some kind of income source for riot games, So money shouldn't be the reason why this reward is included or not. also lots of players put endless time into your game to achieve these high ranks, and it would show that you care about them with making the challenger jacket a permanent challenger reward.","replies":[]}]}
