Every champ in this game has the ability to fill whatever role they want if a champ is played right. Bard can actually be really strong when played correctly letting team mates survive in situations they wouldn't and opens up the possibility for surprise engages when the enemy is not expecting it and after bard ult cannot stop it. He also can stun two people in fight really easily. But besides this, it is true he does not have as much teamfight potential as other champs but excels more in early-mid game with heals and skirmish 2-people stuns for example, the 2v2 bot lane which he is most prominently used in.\nThat is a brief overview of my opinion, ask if you wish for more explaining.\n\n*tips hat* {{item:3090}} \n(there aren't a lot of hats, are there?)","replies":[{"poster":"RagingHomosexual","date":"2015-08-17T05:48:10.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need more hat items","replies":[{"poster":"thetrollmast3r","date":"2015-09-28T06:30:08.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mad Hatter Champion?
