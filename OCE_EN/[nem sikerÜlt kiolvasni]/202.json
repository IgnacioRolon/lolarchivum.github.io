Aussies only though.\r\n\r\nUni students are a burden on the Australian budget as I have said before. They borrow money and 80% of the bludgers never pay the money back to the tax payers.\r\n\r\nUs common folk have not much choice but to work as we need to live and these Uni guys get a nearly free ride to riches awesome? Wait!! Off our backs though, you know the poor people of Australia.\r\n\r\nI have seen a lot of these Uni guys and girls and they party, take drugs and etc....... They just get given their shit and look at us common folk and laugh at us. This is true I know, know you say! Yes they say to me and others hey man I have a Uni degree you don't know what the fuckk you talking about! Hhhuu talking about? I have been doing this job for 10 years I know what I'm doing. No you don't I went to Uni idot!\r\n\r\nLook Uni people will carry on about this but at the end of the day TAX PAYERS ARE PAYING THIER FOR THIER ED.\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Imasweatygay","date":"2017-07-24T10:16:01.078+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine like the last time you tried to state your opinion, you not only stated incorrect facts to prove your argument but also can't make a coherent statement.\r\n\r\nWe can tell you haven't been to uni, nor have you passed year 12; but enough poking at the low hanging fruit. \r\n\r\nYou got any statistics about that 80% of uni students borrow money that they'll never repay? I can prove this next point too; not all university students party, take drugs or even drink, mostly because that shit costs money that we don't have. Maybe there is a reason why our favourite pass time is a free to play game. :thinking:\r\n\r\nSo please become a little more educated the next time you try to ruin the fun of our community.","replies":[{"poster":"Bamboopanda","date":"2017-07-25T09:21:45.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guys, his bronze 5 with 145 games, cut him some slack :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lame","date":"2017-07-24T09:14:10.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} Feel better now?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2017-07-24T10:01:12.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should have tried harder at school and gone too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TempaBurnt Out","date":"2017-07-24T09:57:23.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck me dead dude, how big is the rod up your ass??\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Forge God","date":"2017-07-24T09:07:41.105+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roses are red\r\nViolets are blue\r\nLife is tough\r\nYou'll get through","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buckit","date":"2017-07-25T00:24:02.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No wonder you're so against university and education, you can't even construct a sentence. \r\n\r\nStudents pay tax as well and to say all uni students party, take drugs and etc is completely ignorant and such an incorrect stereotype.\r\n\r\nYou're as dumb as dog sh...

The rest are working their asses off trying to graduate while paying bills or keeping a job that they're trying to use to pay off debt. We know who's paying for our education. Would you rather the American model, where we have to save since birth to have a chance at university? No, neither would I. \r\n\r\nAnd hey, university is stressful!! That's why clubs like these E-Sports clubs exist, to make campus life a little less stressful and a more positive experience. Sure there's parties and whatever, but there's also stuff like anime clubs, dancing clubs, hiking clubs, sporting events with sister schools. \r\n\r\nYou made your choice to work instead of going to uni- that's fine, but don't shit on the folks who go to uni to try and achieve a better quality of life and get a better job through getting a degree. How do you think we have Doctors? Or Lawyers? Ever think about that before you spat the dummy?\r\n\r\nGet your petty, jealous bullshit out of here.
