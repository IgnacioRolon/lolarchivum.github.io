Transfers do become unavailable every patch until relevant regions are on the same patch (have to be on the same patch to transfer) but that is usually a matter of a day. As to why they are unavailable now I'm not sure, and I'll see if I can find out.

There is planned maintenance from the 17th of May to the 15th of June. I don't recall that end date changing but it's possible it could have if things were taking longer than expected. It sounds like you've been rather unlucky with the issues in January and the maintenance now, but hopefully it'll only be a few more days.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
