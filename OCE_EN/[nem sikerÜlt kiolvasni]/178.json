Do you think that by it being irregular it makes it more of a novelty and hence appealing to players? I don't think so, I don't see why it needs to rotate at all. Also with the rotating game modes, those three days may be inconvenient to some people. So why not just have it as a normal seven day rotation system: one week of ... then one week of ... I don't understand the obsession with three days. That is all, I would be really grateful is someone from Riot cleared these up with me, it might make me respect and understand the system a lot more. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Jortair","date":"2016-04-05T11:30:26.805+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, when reading other comments, turns out a lot of people play outside those hours.
