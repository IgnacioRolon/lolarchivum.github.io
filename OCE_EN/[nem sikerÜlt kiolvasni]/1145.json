What Happen To {{champion:136}} Escape Velocity it is still called that yet their is no burst of movement speed when hit by a champion was it taken out or is it just not working and also Aurelion Sol shouldn't be able to lose his escape velocity stacks unless their at 100 or its just plain mean. Also i understand silencing or stunning Aurelion Sol should stop his Celestial Expansion but why his passive too theirs soo many other champions which would be great if we could silence their passives too isn't that why their called passives and not actives.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-03-25T07:41:33.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So in other words... He has counterplay?\r\n\r\nthats a good thing.\r\n\r\nIf his stars hit everything within his radius he would possibly one of the most broken champs in the game, yes he isn't less brain dead to position than other champs (which is also a good thing as there is far too many brain deadness in this game already) but if you do position well it pays off. \r\n\r\nWhy would % damage make sense? he's a mage, not a tank. \r\n\r\nStarsurge is used in conjunction with comet of legend and any move speed items you have, if it was easy to keep up with it without those things then you'd just spam lane wide stuns at will, and that offers no counterplay. \r\n\r\nNothing about Escape velocity gives you a boost of move speed when hit by a champion, i dont think that was ever the case, intact the opposite is true, being hit takes away your stacks.\r\n\r\nIf he wasn't able to lose stacks then he would too quickly be able to float around everywhere, (again, counterplay) \r\n\r\nA stun is supposed to be a 'disable' to an enemy, but seeming aurelion sol's damage comes passively, a stun doest give the enemy a chance to kill/escape from him because his damage continues regardless, also Stun/silence does work on other champs, like azir and his turrets.\r\nhe would have very little counterplay if there was no way of stopping his passive.\r\n\r\nBasically, he isn't the easiest champ to play, if you're looking for brain dead champs, unfortunately theres plenty to choose from, but just not this one which is a good thing, the more skill required to play a champion the better!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NCTzen","date":"2016-03-26T05:28:21.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will the skin be on sale soon?
