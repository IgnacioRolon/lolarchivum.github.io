Big Swips isn't the best top laner in OCE, he's just in the best team. He gets a lot of support from Spookz and when he doesn't he is regularly HAM with blinkers on and doesn't have the same prowess that Chippys has to 1v1. With the way the meta is shifting, Chippys has the better playstyle and champion pool to hold his own topside.\r\n\r\nMid: Swiffer. Hands down best Midlaner, second place isn't even close, pretty obvious choice (and also the choice we need given only 2 chiefs members can be selected). He has been known to tilt hard, but when he's on point, no midlaner in OCE can touch him.\r\n\r\nJungle: Carbon. I do feel like Spookz is the better jungler, but is he the BEST by far? No. Carbon is right at his heels and we need Carbon's leadership over Spookz ' slight skill ceiling.\r\n\r\nADC: K1ng. I actually am unsure whether this needs to be K1ng or Raes, and I would be happy with either. K1ng has more consistency over Raes, over a longer period of professional play, so I've slightly edged him up. Why not Raydere you may ask? I've been against Raydere for many years, not because I think that he isn't the number 1 adc in OCE, because he is. The problem lies in his ability to perform on the world stage. Against other OPL teams he shines and is almost always on his game, especially in his micro-play. This changes at international events, as I see his performance as a flip-of-the-coin. He doesn't seem to perform at his peak level, and for this reason, I feel as though someone else needs an opportunity to step up to the plate.  \r\n\r\nSupport: Egym. I will give my love to Rogue as a very close second, because I feel as though when Egym plays badly, he PLAYS REALLY BADLY, and can throw games. Rogue is so close to Egym and may even surpass him on a macro level, however Egym is the overall package when you also consider Micro-play, leadership and vocalisation. Overall I feel as though he is definitely the better pick, but the way I know that casuals are going to vote, Rogue will end up with a spot as he is the second most popular support, and likely 2 other chiefs members will get in over Egym, so if this does happen, then Rogue aka likeadontknowhowtospellrogueproperly (yeah you know the joke), I wish you all the best.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-10-24T23:25:52.792+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heres my team:\r\n\r\nTop: Sazahu - best top laner by far, you just never saw much of him.

Put him in the right team and that'll happen a lot more. Carbon would not fit in a team with Egym and Swiffer. Ever.

My prediction of who is ACTUALLY going to get picked: \r\n\r\n4 Chiefs (including ex Chiefs), Swiper, Swiffer, Rosey and Raydere (with Raydere and Rosey no longer on Chiefs they will qualify and be on the team)\r\nThe reason this will happen is it takes the biggest margin to pick the 2 members from each team. As Swiper and Swiffer will have a bigger differential between first and second most favourite picks for their respective roles, it means even though Egym has the most votes for support, he will miss out and the second most popular support will get in, which it seems will be Rosey (although I wish it was Rogue).\r\n1 Carbon - obvious reasons are obvious\r\n\r\nI wish it didn't have to go this way, as we are going to end up with just about the same team that usually makes world stage and quite frankly, chokes more than not (you may hate my opinion especially the fact that I am just a low ranked scrub, but it is pretty much a fact as history has shown). I wish this was decided by the pros and casters not the viewers, because analysis and strategy would go into it giving us a better chance to have the best winning team, rather than just a popularity contest where the same people are going to be voted in every year because Chiefs have the most renown/followers/likes.
