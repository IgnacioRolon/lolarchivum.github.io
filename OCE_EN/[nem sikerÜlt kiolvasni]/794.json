Like more often than not, a particular skin we may want may not be on sale often, and when it does you may not even have that champion (like right here; the Officer Vi skin I _realllly_ want, however I don't own her). It would be cool if you made that an option as you could only really use the skin IF you eventually saved up and got the champion, otherwise it sits on your account until then. Cause you'd still make some money from the skin, however usually when a skin comes along on sale, you don't necessarily have that much RP/IP to buy the champion as well and to save up for most champs it's like 4800+IP or so...","replies":[{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2015-06-23T00:30:46.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's money they want.
