It's a good move by Riot as long as they (Medieval Twitch and Grey Warwick) DO \"return as rewards for another social system somewhere down the line\". RAF became pretty hard to do after the initial influx of people who started playing LoL. Not to mention RAF was never enabled on OCE up until a few months ago after all of my IRL friends had already started playing. The only way to get RAF rewards was by making smurfs, which is not what RAF was created to achieve and is what prompted the massive rework of RAF in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"BlueSpiritFire1","date":"2015-08-08T17:41:17.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've said it very well my friend! \r\nAs long as those skins are/will be made available via another route, I concur with this decision.
