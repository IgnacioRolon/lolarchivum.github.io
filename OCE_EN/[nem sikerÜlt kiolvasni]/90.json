We're really sorry about the delay -- I know it sucks, and we have people working through the weekend to make things move along faster.  We now expect that within a couple of days, we'll have completed alerting everyone who applied that their account can now access the alpha.  \n\n**Keep checking your email for your notification and instructions**, and if you've received an email but still have difficulty getting into the new client, please file a player support ticket so we can take a look at your account and identify what's wrong.
