THIS POST IS IN YOUR GREATEST INTERESTS, TRUST ME.\r\nthis is a little unrelated, however today on the 17/02/15 i have made a discovery which i thinks confirms the release of our beloved game mode ultra rapid fire!\r\nAPART from the fact that riot hinted URF would make return in 2015, upon awaking this morning i have realized that the OCE TWISTED TREELINE servers are off air. I love TT and was upset to find it missing; as the permanent server riot introduced sometime last season has been greatly appreciated.\r\nthis downtime is completely unscheduled and as riot games are great at filling us in about server downtime for updates, maintenance, ect.. I am lead to believe that they wanted it all to be secret this time (as to generate maximum hype when they unveil the URF servers) and that they wanted this server spot for another new game mode..\r\na game mode (and server allocations), unlike nemesis or less popular modes, that would be large enough to support immense amounts of traffic, (also who the hell would be playing TT while urf is about?)\r\nI strongly beleive that this week we will see the return of our beloved ULTRA RAPID FIRE,\r\nWhether its the classic urf we know or even more ultra crazy TWISTED TREELINE URF, WATCH THIS SPACE AND BE READY FOR IT.\r\nYOU HAVE BEEN WARNED SUMMONERS","replies":[]}]}
