Why don't you just f**k fiddle up even more and make him only viable as a jungler. All you needed to do deal with the poke Riot was is increase the E cool-down NOT f**kin nerf the damage. if you going to nerf damage on E then give it back bonus damage to lane minions so Fiddle is one again viable as a Mid mage","replies":[{"poster":"itsjustmattyo","date":"2018-08-01T07:32:59.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree... {{champion:9}} should've just had his E reworked to do less damage against **champions** early, but scale to the normal ratios at higher levels...

It’s too hard to get close with a fiddle around, especially if you’re a melee support or short ranged or squishy. Nerfing the support items alone are not a good choice. Affects too many other supports just for one champ. Bonus minion/monster damage however is a good idea.
