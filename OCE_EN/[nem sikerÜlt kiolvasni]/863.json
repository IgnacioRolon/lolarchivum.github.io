Game health.)_\r\n\r\nIm not complaining! haha it's balanced, it just feels weird xD","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-06-14T07:14:08.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea good point, the thing about LoL that sneaks past us all is that there are so many \"special cases\" that sort of pop up over time, not rooted in any preset rules or logic, and we just get used to them.
