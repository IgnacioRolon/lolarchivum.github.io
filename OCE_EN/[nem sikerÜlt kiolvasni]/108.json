Making support a more interactive and exciting role is cool, but I hope the items aren't too strong since I like my unique support utility.\r\n \r\nAlso rito, smite buffs were the main reason you managed to force junglers to take smite and now you're removing that with plants so welcome back junglers who take exhaust+ignite and never manage to get objectives, I hate you all more than a million toxic yasous and ward teemos.\r\n\r\nAlso assassin update, too much love for meta things and making adcs life harder so I'm going to have less competent adcs to protect against even more stuff and that's never fun, especially as the skillreqs for a support also increase.\r\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about where you are going with this game and I simply hope it's not as bad as it sounds.

It really isn't.\n\nFor instance, making fizz harder to peel against. Yep making an assassin that can 100-0 an adc harder to peel against will totally make keeping my out of position caitlynn safe easier. \n\nMaking khazix immune to pink warding. Totally makes it easier to protect my adc against unseen threats. \nImproving Zed's deathmark damage, as if duskblade was killing adcs fast enough. \nMaking rengar exclamation mark not give an approximation of how close he is and stopping me from using a sweeper or a pink to reveal him. Yep adc is going to be totally fine and not going to get murderised.\n\nRead the details. For some assassins, yes the counterplay is improved, for instance looks like leblanc will be much easier to peel against, same with katarina. For others not so much and honestly Fizz is slippery enough, stop making it worse.\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with assassins but I honestly feel that even though we're moving to a tank meta, adcs are still having a tough time.
