Also adding it to hextech crafting I think isn't a good idea because I just generally think the skin shouldn't be obtainable anymore.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think rarity means anything at all in this game. 1. Bragging about having a 'rare' skin isn't very nice, and is likely to leave a sour taste in your teammates' mouth. I also don't think people even care unless they were interested in the skin themselves, and if they are, it's kind of not right they can't buy it because they didn't even know the game existed (applicable for the really old skins) or just weren't able to at the time for whatever reason. 2. Considering you can't sell second-hand skins in this game, having a 'rare' skin means nothing at all. It's not like if they re-release a skin, a person will pay any less than you did. That said, I realise people bought accounts that might have contained said rare skins. Account selling and buying is illegal however, so it's their fault for breaking the law in the first place.\n\nIt's not like they're releasing Victorious skins, which actually required effort to obtain. All that was special about Championship skins is that you had RP in your account when it was released. That's it. You didn't have to get to Diamond or win 1000 games in two weeks or whatever.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2016-06-24T02:18:40.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What about those that didnt have to spend anything to get hextech annie?

This skin is not a reward. It's for everyone. Just because you started playing in season 2, does not mean you're more worth than any of the other LoL players.  Do you realise how difficult it is to get championship riven in a hex tech crafting system. Just fuck what others say and simply place it in the LoL store. This is only a skin, why should i have to pay $300+ for a skin others got for 975 RP($10). Absolute BS. Here's my advice. Stop being so selfish. You have the skin and that's great, however that rest of us want an equal chance to that skin. If you were on our side of the argument. (Ie. you don't have the skin) then your argument would completely change. You don't understand what it's like to want something and be denied every right to it. Or even wanting something and having the slimmest chance at actually getting it. All of those whom already have this skin, excluding those who won it at last worlds, did not have to work a day in their lives to get it, you guys just don't realise how lucky you are to have that skin. IDGAF how rare it is. Skins should not be concealed from us. To conceal a skin and only make it available to the lucky few who somehow knew about the game in season 2 is very unethical. Re- evaluate your decision to place it in hex tech crafting, that only makes it that much worse for those who really want it. Taunting us with a slim to none chance at obtaining the skin whilst flaunting it in front of us is torture. Please just make it an in game/ store purchase so we can just end this dispute. And if that doesn't convince you, then an easy way to maintain its rarity would be to make it a legacy skin like the rest of the championship skins. Why should championship riven, literally the only skin I want, be unavailable to me or so difficult to obtain it might as well be, when you can simply make it a legacy skin, This therefore promotes a sense of rarity as well as allowing those who missed out on a chance to obtain the skin, a chance to obtain it every year, like the other championship skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Placebo","date":"2016-06-29T06:10:58.145+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"With that argument, why can't I buy a house for the same price as they were back in the 1960's (with inflation and all adjusted)?
