As normal, OCE will receive the patch first in the world, but as this preseason is packed full of major changes, we want to take our time to ensure the rollout goes smooth globally.\r\n\r\nWe're confident in patch 7.22's stability (as it's been on the PBE for a while) but we're going to be paying closer attention to the OCE launch in particular — so we're going to be releasing the patch a day early to allow more time to get everything right.\"\r\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CastingDeath","date":"2017-11-05T13:26:12.170+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I do not see many people talking about this and hence I am going to mention this here.\r\n\r\nMastery level 6 and 7 came out patch 6.10 (the patch after mid-season). Mastery 6 requires getting atleast a S- two times and **500 blue essence**. Similarly Mastery 7 requires getting atleast a S three times and **600 blue essence**. This new mastery system had only been out for less than/around a year before Riot told us about the Preseason and blue essence changes. \r\n\r\nThis may not sound like a lot but considering that existing blue essence is multiplied by 6.5 in the new season this adds up pretty quickly. I have only 3 champions mastery 7 and 3 champions mastery 6. To get 6 champions to level 6, **500*6= 3000** blue essence. To get 3 of those champions to mastery 7, **600*3 = 1800** blue essence. A total of 4800 blue essence spent. Converted into the new system, **4800*6.5 = 31200** blue essence. Subtracting the cost of mastery level in the new season: **31200-4800 = 26400**.\r\nEffectively meaning that by hopping on the new changes with the mastery system within a year, I have **\"lost\" 26400 blue essence** which I could spend on the exclusive blue essence shop. \r\n\r\nI understand the partial discount for runes and rune pages as they have existed for basically the lifetime of league but the mastery thing is pretty new and is being completely neglected. \r\n\r\n**Will we get a refund? Will the cost of mastery also get multiplied by 6.5?** \r\n\r\nBTW: Pretty hyped for the new runes! More to pre-game than just stacking stats now.","replies":[{"poster":"Fuerdai","date":"2017-11-05T23:43:36.777+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot already claimed that the cost for levelling Mastery 6 & 7 in new system will be multiplied by 6.5 as well. So to get Mastery 6, it will cost **500*6.5=3250** blue essence and to get Mastery 7, it will cost **600*6.5=3900** essence after the new system come out. You didn't lose anything for it.

I've been spending up large(ish) large for me lol. Blue essence aint the easiest thing to get at the moment and looking at your calc for how much we've spent compared to what we would spend next season.. Does make me wonder if we will get refunded or given a couple of blue essence shop items of sorts? I dunno, something in return would be a wicked bonus.

I'm not entirely sure how i feel about this massive update.

I'm honestly hoping that Riot don't make this over thought and making it way to in depth for no reason. This really could be my personal make it or break it for league.
