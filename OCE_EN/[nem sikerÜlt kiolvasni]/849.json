But yeah it definitely changes the way the future players come through - we believe that this way will focus attention more on the player and his/her skill than being promoted as a team. We also agree that even OOL players don't just want fun tournaments - we are expecting a full range of amateur tournaments for prizes, for positions in teams (OCS/OPL), partnerships with universities, all types of things to keep competition alive for aspiring pro players :)","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2017-11-30T21:50:39.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't seem to reply to your comment below for some reason, but this is in response to 'You’re going to find it difficult using these “community only” events with no promotions to ocs “as a team” to actually find players who have motivation.'\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with this. Success in the OCS won't be easy and becoming an OPL player take a LOT of determination. There's nothing wrong with raising the bar for how much effort is required to compete because success in the OCS and OPL will take high levels of motivation, so getting there should take some as well.\r\n\r\nI do agree though we will need to invest time educating the players on how they get into the OCS. Players will move into the OCS and OPL as individuals, not as groups which is obviously a shift from the way the system worked before.

If they fail, Riot will tender the slot and pay out the OCS team (minus any costs involved, like brokerage).\r\n\r\nHey there, just trying to understand the changes here and correct me if I'm wrong please with the following statement:\r\n\r\nIf a team of 5 soloq players group up and make a team for the OCS, and then proceed to qualify for the OPL but are unable to form a brand/organisation for the OPL, they will be denied entry into the OPL.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2017-11-30T12:31:07.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few things to explain here.\n\nFirstly, entry into the OCS isn't something that's open to anyone.

However we felt it was in the best interests of the various parties of the LoL esports ecosystem, those being the Pro Players, Teams, Riot, Our partners and of course, the Fans.
