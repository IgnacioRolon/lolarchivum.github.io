The effort shouldn't be in \"educating\" it should be harsher bans targeting ranked players trolling for fun not the players abusing the individual for ruining the experience for 9 other players.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2019-04-18T01:18:43.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah definitely agree with the sentiment - Pro players definitely do get targeted even more than the regular player and this was no exception to that. The unfortunate reality of being a pro player is that people get to see you, they know who you are, what you do and can be quick to form an opinion about you. The bar for OPL players behaviour is high as they are seen as role models for a lot of players - so the expectation from them is that they will never be the ones to be instigating it, and are generally expected to ignore / not get baited in by trolls.\r\n\r\nHope this helps provide some context.","replies":[{"poster":"Ocky","date":"2019-04-19T05:34:45.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this not the same for all players...?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Durry Jesus","date":"2019-04-17T23:53:29.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCS competitive rulings announced when.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renoboldroom","date":"2019-04-18T07:18:53.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is bullshit, this player should of received a one year ban.
