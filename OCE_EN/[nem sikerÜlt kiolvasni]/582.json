It'd be awesome if we had a mascot named Rumble.\r\n\r\n_GHIN_ - I know Jhin is spelt, Jhin. But the devil needs it's own name, so we spice it up with a G. I reckon naming a Tasmanian Devil after someone who kills people for theatrical reasoning, is a sound and sane idea.\r\n\r\n**My female names are ;**\r\n\r\n_FIO_ - Because our female devil longs for a worthy opponent.\r\n\r\n_GERALDINE_ - This is an exception it's technically two names if you get a male tazzy devil we could call it Gerald :D. I've always loved these names, I don't know why I like them/\r\n\r\n**Now for the second highest four.**\r\n\r\n__INKY, BLINKY, PINKY, and CLYDE__ - I know you're only getting two but if we named Tazzy devils after one of the pioneering video games Pac-Man...

MY past partner was named Eliese and played League of Legends with me, we both had shitty PC's and I still do. They only run League at 60FPS When they feel like it's a good day. Anyways, we lasted 1 year and a half and the reason her name is here is because she passed away a while ago about 2 years now, and I loved her dearly so, she gets paid homage whenever I recall names.

It was a rare name during the Viking era, and only seems to have become commonly used in Scandinavia after the coming of Christianity – which suggests that it was connected to Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Fritha is a main character in the novella, The Snow Goose, by American author Paul Gallico; a sentimental tale of friendship blooming against the backdrop of World War II which was very popular in England. There was a British actress called Fritha Goodey who you may have caught a glimpse of in the movie About a Boy, starring Hugh Grant. Sadly, she died a few years ago in tragic circumstances while still quite young. There’s also a musician, Fritha Jenkins, who played with UK pagan heavy metal band, Skyclad. Because of these associations, Fritha seems like a very “English” name, despite its origins, and also quite artsy.\r\n\r\nNamaha - This is a Sanskrit word which is an element of sacred Vedic mantras. It means “to surrender with love”, and literally, “to bow (in a gesture of homage and respect)”. It is a negation of one’s ego, and an affirmation of the greater Self becoming one with the Cosmic Soul. It is pronounced nah-ma-hah, with unstressed syllables.\r\n\r\nSatanica - This is the Latinised feminine form of the word “satanic”, which can either literally mean giving veneration to Satan, or more generally, suggestive of being diabolical in nature. Satan is from the Hebrew, meaning “the adversary, the opposer, the obstructor”, and in the Hebrew portion of the Bible, Satan is an agent of God whose thankless task it is to tempt humankind and then accuse it before Heaven. In Christianity, he is seen as the Devil, the personification of all evil. Satanica is often used in black metal music as a title, and there is band with this name. There is also a manga series called La Satanica, so it can be seen as a name from popular culture. Satanica cannot help but be controversial as a baby name, and I think it is a heavy burden to place on a child; this name even made me feel depressed just thinking about it, which almost never happens.\r\n\r\nBOYS NAMES\r\nManuka - This is the name of a small tree or shrub native to New Zealand and south-east Australia – including, of course, Tasmania. It’s scientific name is Leptospermum scoparium, and it’s also called tea tree (not the same tea tree that tea tree oil is made from). The name manuka is Maori, and comes from history, where one of the sea-going canoes that brought the Maoris to New Zealand is said to have been called Mānuka. It’s pronounced mahn-OO-ka. Manuka honey is not only delicious, but recently it’s been discovered to have powerful antibacterial properties, and you can now buy medical-grade manuka honey to apply to wounds. There is a town in Tasmania near Hobart called Tea Tree, which may be named after this useful plant.\r\n\r\nAmbrose - This is the English form of a Latin name derived from the Greek, meaning “immortal”. It is connected linguistically to ambrosia, the food or drink of the gods in mythology, and is said to not only taste delicious, but to have a delightful aroma. In fact, it has been argued that ambrosia means “fragrant”, rather than “immortal”. If ambrosia had any basis in reality, it may be describing a honey product, although another theory is that it refers to the hallucinogenic mushroom, Amanita muscaria. The most famous namesake is probably Saint Ambrose of Milan, a 4th century Doctor of the Church who converted Saint Augustine. Interestingly, according to legend, bees swarmed on Ambrose’s face as a baby, leaving behind a drop of honey; this does seem to link the saint with the mythical ambrosia. An old-fashioned name, this fits in with the antique name revival, and the S/Z-ending for boys names. The meaning, and its associations with divine sweetness, is also hard to resist.\r\n\r\nEsmond - An Old English name meaning “gracious protection”, this fell out of use after the Norman Conquest, and became best known as a surname. Thackery’s History of Henry Esmond is a historical novel set in the time of Queen Anne, where the hero spends the whole book in love with his foster-sister and cousin, but marries his foster-mother instead (also his cousin). This surname is part of Australian history, because James Esmond was an Irish-Australian who was one of the first people to find gold during the Victorian goldrush. He was also politically prominent in the miner’s organisation, and commanded a section of miners in the Eureka Stockade rebellion. It’s tempting to wonder if baby Esmond is a descendant of James, or whether the name was chosen in honour of this famous rebel.\r\n\r\nIluka - This is a small coastal town on the Clarence River in New South Wales, and its name is derived from an Aboriginal word meaning “by the sea”. It is pronounced eye-LOO-ka. Iluka is a popular tourist destination, blessed with beaches and rainforest, and people who live in the chilly southern parts of Australia may enjoy spending their winters here. Maybe the parents of Iluka spent a happy holiday in the town? It’s easy to see the appeal of it as a name, because it is so similiar to the popular Luka, but has a distinctive Australian meaning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanishment","date":"2017-06-23T23:48:10.022+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bazza and Dazza, because there's not many like their kind.
