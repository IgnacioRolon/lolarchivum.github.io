ADC usually went bot (from the topside) solo, or top (from bot side), and if it proved too tricky, it would be swapped into mid or the opposing top/bot lane. From this early meta, Renekton was released, so functionally he wasn't designed to be played solo.\r\n\r\nWith the change in JGling happening a while back to not be so difficult and just be reduced to a handful of champs who could comfortably do it, to now being virtually everyone, Renekton has alot more playstyle options than just \"top\" lane in current season... \r\n\r\nAs well as mastery builds/keystone and item builds.\r\n\r\nMy list of lane choices with your teams synergy is important, if you solo que alot in normal play, your most likely thinking Top is a good choice, well... it's not.... in my opinion it's more like his 3rd best option.\r\n\r\n1st choice) Jungle! What's the difference? Your first 9mins you get to farm, keep an eye open for ganking chances and there's little threat in return due to your kit, getting the Warrior jungle item will drastically improve your damage without ever being zoned / ganked (smart wards for early counters like Lee/Kha/Rengar is required when level 1-4 when they're in game, if you find yourself getting your jugle visited often, on your first back, don't make a blue/white jg item, make trackers knife for more ward placement, your jg path is ALWAYS the following krugs (open with smite, start with stun, get smite stun off, use your own stun after, optional on using on smaller krug, i save it) head to chickens, cull the wave with your 65-73 rage, knock the li'l ones down asap, use stuns etc, you can kill chickens without starting your potion cycle, head to red, smash them down, little ones first, you should be close to 50rage t the start of the fight, cull all 3 for the heal, smite the red for the heal, use your first pot, rush the crab in top, its very quick to drop with an empowered stun and red buff, check minimap, can you gank or at least force a back from top or mid? if not, if its around 3min mark (or in after doing red, drop a ward in enemy blue whilst heading to crab, if enemy jg visits... say hello with your full QWE combo at the right moment and try to steal, or engage blue at around 50% hp, the urge to finish blue off rather than attack you is huge, as everyone knows, you may just turn around and Q W it at the right moment. IF that gank fails, move immediately after crab to your blue side, help mid if possible, but gromp (smite if up, you should actually be close to... if its close, sae it for blue, if its up, clear gromp asap as the dmg output from the buff is similar to smite for the entire fight at blue) again, clear wolves head to crab, look at bot lane, if not head back to chickens and do krug if mid isnt gankable, first back should be around 1100g rougly 6min30seconds and just about to ding 6. your generally ahead of most lanes and enemy jg unless he's done the exact same path, if he's 6-9cs behind and has an assist, yo're still ahead of him. Even if you're 0-0-0. From there red should be close to starting up again, however if not, by the time you return to base, shop and head out, you can clear blue side again and look at ganking (blue buff is gone yes) if not an option, return to red, its usually op, if you're top half, start counter jg or camping top/mid, bot half... look at ganking the adc/supp, use your ulti a good 5seconds before engaging for the fury regen and just open with some absolutely AMAZING damage, now... dont use your dash to engage, try your best to position your walk up tat if they freak out and flash, you may dash thrugh something and dash again and stun, and they hve no further escapes... hello easy kills. Once you know your JG path and damage output and taken, you can drop warlords 18/6/6 is your dmg build in JG, once you're comfortable drop warlords for fervor as you can get 4-5 stacks with your opening combo which makes you hugely buff...\r\n\r\nDon't be shy in picking on the weakest person for 2-3 kills early just to complete your JG item and get upgraded boots for the best possible early roam and gank chances by 12-13min mark..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2nd position- is actually a tank support, 12/0/18 with Undying keystone, similar to rengar strategy in a way, or any other tanky type. Look to cleverly engage without a good enemy trade response, if it looks bad, save your 2nd dash to escape with only taking 1/4hp usually.\r\n\r\nEarly item build i find great- Relic (first b) Targons, Dorans Shield, Ninja tabi, you become quite a buff little pseudo tank that can afford to run up to the AdC at times, and with exhaust and your stun.... with a competent adC, you're actually a very good sup, learn how to use your relic procs, how to position at certain times, most of the time you want brush control, but you need to be aware of the age old river gank, and know when you need to body block for your ADC, do a quick stun and fall back (dash back),\r\n\r\nafter your early 3 tanky items (targons, dorans shield, ninja tabi.... 2 good early game regen items, dorans shield blocks 8 damage and ninja tabi reduces 12%dmg along side your armor which is generally around 25-30% come level 6/7, so thats say 40-45% dmg reduction early game!!! and you can empower your attacks for damage... pretty awesome aggressive supp! (12%!!!!), i tend to get either phage or sunfire cape materials going, depending on your situational needs, hurting from harass? clothvest+hp... but your first item should always contain HP, you can dive into Black Cleaver or Sunfire cape on this part entirely up to you and the circumstances allow. \r\n\r\nARE YOU THE ONLY TANKY TYPE ENGAGE? You will want either Banshee's or Spirit Visage for the health / CDR / defensive MR bonus and both go well with our loved croc, more regen from heals or block an ability on your engage... i personally prefer SV. Need more MR? No more flat defensive, you'll have no presence late game... Time to bring out the bruiser side. Get yourself a MAW! That shield and bonus MR with flat dmg... is exactly where you need to go, if you have HEAVY cc / malz/veigar on enemy team... well get Mercurial Scimitar instead, unlesss its hard CC, don't make this a staple item, Maw is overall better. Situational steraks cage (gage?) also, you will ALWAYS have a black cleaver, if you end up going boots and 4 defensive items(not maws)... 3 are usually for me, Sunfire, Spirit Visage, Face of the Mountain, you may postpone upgrading Targon's embrace all game after getting it to tier 2 from relic at around 5-7mins. If vision is sfuffering and causing pain for team, get an eye of equinnox. quite possibly before a 2nd defensive item. If you find the enemy overall tanky/well supported and want more survival, probably one of the best balanced supp/tank items around is Zzrot's Portal. Not only does it buff your armor/mr nicely but it also offers more regen and a method of lane control.\r\n\r\nWarmog's is optional, with so much health and Q and a spirit visage, honestly the in combat regen to mog's in late game with stack'ed hp already... Isn't that crash hot, it just allows you to fall back and have full hp in 10-15seconds from nothing. However if your contribution is only stunning and your damage is ignorable, i find mogs... well... there's better contribution items....\r\n\r\nMain damage for me regardless of recommended builds as supp is generally, Black Cleaver, Maw coupled at times with Deadmans Plate or Mortal Reminder. Your damage may be low, but an empowered double dash with BC and MR is roughly 45% + 30% (after 5 hits of physical) + 20% from dash... 95% armor pen? And you're a supp tank...\r\n\r\nGo enjoy your S and S+ games! remember, most games you should actually end with around 80+ cs generally positive KD ratios, and assists... you've got a gazillion ways to contribute in fights, assists should as always be high.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to ward as much as possible and drop the occasional pink to kill wards. \r\n\r\nIf you're team mate is a friend, you can take the ignite option, i always prefer the amazing control of exhaust on renekton coupled with stun and alot of ADC's having a slow style CC to really capitalize on your stun engage, but when possible, hold the stun for the final combo move on engages if you're allowed to walk up... it's not always for just opening for some damage and retreating, this becomes easily countered if it becomes to frequently obvious ans surprise is always renektons best friend.\r\n\r\ntop, don't start dorans blade, run a shield... you don't really do enough damage to warrant the 3% early when it's setting the tempo for who's the bully and who's the bitch (hey Susan!), but top... i'd probably go warlords for better lane bullying. \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Goku Senpai","date":"2016-07-01T04:44:53.361+0000","up_votes":21,"down_votes":0,"body":"how do you feel about writing my english essay?","replies":[{"poster":"isaac181","date":"2016-07-08T15:15:46.388+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahahahah","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Best TwitchtvGFX","date":"2016-07-01T02:54:29.441+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logged in just to upvote your reply because you spent so long on it.

Why is this?\r\n\r\n{{item:1083}} A lot of the ranking system has to do with **CS**. I've noticed when I support, I quite often get S to S+'s due to the fact I end up with around 60-70 CS, 4-5 kills, minimal deaths of around 4 or so, and high assist count ranging from 17-30 depending on game length.\r\nWhen I support I also happen to duo with an ADC, and we often have him getting S and S+'s too, why?\r\nAs an ADC I've noticed that CS makes an _even bigger_ difference. I would watch an ADC go 11-0-6 and then complain they didn't get even an S-, they didn't die at all the entire game, why didn't they receive an S+? \r\nUpon looking at their stats, in a 30 minute game, a very skilled player would have around 280ish CS, but the 11-0-6 would only have 150. Imagine the difference.\r\n\r\n{{item:3092}} I have also found that contributions to objectives play another role in the ranking system. See someone taking dragon? Hit it _at least_ once to make sure it considers you to have assisted in the objective. Someone taking a tower? Try and assist those too (I do recommend however that bot lane support walk relatively far away from the ADC when they take the Tier 1 tower as it give the ADC 400 gold as opposed to the split gold if you were nearby, 400 gold is a good spike for an ADC early game). \r\n\r\n{{summoner:7}} Remember that shields, heals, and other useful skills and items such as _Frost Queen's Claim_ also give assists to kills, so remember that if you aren't in range to damage the target directly, casually \"help\" your team with a sneaky shield of item pop that didn't actually help them, but will directly help you.\r\n\r\n{{champion:26}} Well that's what I've found to be key elements in getting your Level 6 & 7 Mastery tokens.

Their games finish just before yours does. You go 10/4/22 with a cs of 332 in a 45min game, help get dragon 4 times, 2 Barons and help drop 3 towers and get an inhib. Fairly respectable score and participation, right?\r\nBut if 4 of the other Rene players playing, whose games happened and ended just before yours did, had better KDA, cs and objective participation, this would drop you into 5th place, lowering your Mastery Score for that particular game to an 'average' Rene score, possibly getting you an A or high B.\r\nRespectively, if they all played like crap and you were the Best Rene OCE *at that time*, the exact same KDA, cs and participation as above could net you an S or higher.\r\n\r\nSo, your Mastery Score is all relative to everyone playing that champ... at around that same time... on your server.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you play a top pick champ at peak playing times and get a S or higher, then feel good about that.

I have found as lee sin, if you go to the lanes with the best players on the enemy team, and assist in killing them, and or kill them with a score of 13/3/8 with around 150 cs, going to all lanes atleast 3 times, with success in kills and objectives. also getting the dragon. and finishing around 25 to 30 minute mark","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slither2312","date":"2016-07-06T01:30:06.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if you were to create urgot as some sort of high tech Mr Hide cross Necron esc  character style. Say outlining his kit to be a slow movinng (escapeless) beffy damage dealer dimilar to nasus but focused more on constant disruption rather than avoiding him outright.\r\n\r\nsay replacing his E with a sort of toxin that gives him a shield based on how many units it hits and if the shield is broken anyone hit with the toxin is feared briefly and slowed for x seconds. going for a close range meaty disruptor with sustained damage rather than burst. Maybe his weapon could be changed to a meatier bladed glove and his Q could be a slash of some sort that slows enemies and grants a debuff that allows urgot to heal on auto attacks. I'm sort of just throwing my brain in the wind here but I think that having a ranged hulking mass doesnt suit particularly well with someone tryiing to induce fear, he should be tearing up frontlines not backing off into the distance.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"DesignsHD","date":"2016-07-05T06:04:08.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am having trouble with yi I get A+ ALL THE TIME but never S or S+ it took me 105000 mastery points just to get to level 6 is there anyone with some advice on how to get mastery 7 Yi","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Goldfoot","date":"2016-07-04T10:44:04.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL this ranking system is not fun!
