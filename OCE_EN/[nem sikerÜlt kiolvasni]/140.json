Example. \r\n(Relic shield line works when you basically last hit a minion using this item and a friendly champ being close by at the time.\r\nYou heal your friend and you gain gold. How nice.\r\nCome late game when just about every other player can one shot minions and there is a huge feast on for cs and your're trying to get that one last hit to gain gold plus if Relic Shield Line passive is active not only do you get the gold so does the next friendly champ next to you up to 4 minions. \r\nBut everyone else just kills them right before you get your last hit.)\r\n\r\nCan we possibly think about having only items for support champs. \r\nDoesn't matter who you pick it's the support role that's being filled.\r\nBut I guess it will make certain champs more op being one of two who can use them.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when you view a champion it just says for Leona \r\nMagic\r\nStyle\r\nDifficulty and a few other stuff but that's it.\r\n\r\nGive champion a role. Main role then a secondary role and if a champion has support in either main or secondary then only those champions can play support role. \r\n\r\nJust a thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n     \r\n  \r\n  ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-22T12:13:26.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I'm no longer allowed to play Liss support because she's Mid/Top?
