Like now for example, everyone is being very abusive in the comments section and expects Riot to read all of it and kiss up to them for their trust? The community needs to meet Riot halfway for there to be any trust.\r\n\r\nAlso, Riot is probably afraid to play their own game with the community. Could you imagine the pressure? Just because they work on the game, doesn't mean they have to be good at playing it. That and given the current relationship between Riot and the community, it would be expected for some people to attack Riot during game play. I'm sure Riot must set up private matches with each other from time to time but playing with the community will accumulate better feedback as it will come from those with different perspectives and experience with the game. I just hope that will be possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Kilyrka","date":"2016-09-16T08:55:46.394+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally agree.

Riot needs a team which is both skilled at the game and understands its design. Not to be rude to the current balance team, they're clearly trying to be cool about it, however a lot of the changes are only slight changes to competitive champions and the moment it comes down to casual play Riot has no idea what to do so they try to fit the best of both worlds and rework champions entirely, which imo sucks.\nAs a Kat main I love her current design. I love her speed, her wardjumps, her functionality and everything about her. I don't mind that she is snowbally and I don't mind her flaws at all. However it pains me to see it when Riot has to resort to a full rework to try and \"fix\" a champions overall design. Imo her current kit fits her perfectly, but hey, Riot wants to make another minigame like Draven and rework Fiora because they want to \"increase her skill cap. and make her healthy\".\n\nOn a more serious note you are 100% right and honestly Riot SHOULD be playing more with the community and talking to champion mains before completing changing champions. They should actually listen to the insight players have. A little bit of self endorsement here but I made a Kat rework over on /r/KatarinaMains under the name \"WQLFY\" and it's pretty comprehensive. If Riot could actually pay attention to small ideas from the community the game would be a great environment. Sure, people think it's a double-edged sword since naturally people want to be pessimistic, but you won't know until you try it. \n\nAll I want is to see the game return to how fun it was seasons 1-3 and mid season 4. Before all of this competitive nonsense and before this current time where Riot only cares for the money and views. Also, their changes don't benefit competitive play at all, the opposite. All the changes make it boring and completely one-dimensional. Sure, there's SOME hype, but if you remember the tournaments throughout season 2 you'll remember just how much more hype was generated over teams like TSM, Cloud9, Fnatic, Moscow Five and the rising stars Taipei Assassins. Crowds went absolutely nuts over this stuff, games were entertaining, there were funny moments during them (especially by swaglord Darien) and competitive players actually had a LOT of fun playing the game, as opposed to now where they only want money and fame. If you want an example, where do you think the \"xPeke\" meme came from? Yeah, you're right, that one moment when xPeke on Kassadin backdoored at ~1/3 HP and won the game for Fnatic. People were cheering, the crowd was actually entertained and happy. Nowadays it's literally just like \"which Korean team did you vote for?\" and they make a friendly competition about which one wins. Not being racist about Korean teams, ik their work ethic and determination are insane, but like....the game and its meta are perfectly suited for them. It's overly safe and there are no real options for insane plays, unlike previous seasons (before season 4) where players could carry the game by doing risky plays. Ik lane swaps still existed and the like, but.....there was insane champion diversity (apart from ADC to an extent, and the Renekton era), hell you even saw GP jungle from time to time.\n\nSure, LoL is now a competitive game, but that's not what it deserves to be. It has the potential to appeal to both worlds, and all that has to be done is proper balancing to do it. Plus, 6 years into this game and the report system still sucks, as does the tribunal. Pick up your game Riot. Also, for the love of god, could you PLEASE make Urf permanent as well as giving us a gamemode which allows us to play pre-reworked versions of champions (bar pre-release TF), that would be amazing and it would give later players a chance to perhaps test out versions of champions they've never seen before and honestly it be the best form of nostalgia one could hope for. To top it off it'd also be nice if we could have the option to revert to the old map (it still retains the same hitboxes and jg+drag+baron changes) as an icing on the cake.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suppeh","date":"2016-09-18T15:06:47.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"who the fuck are u white knights protecting riot give me a specific example of what they have done that was \"in the best interest of the community\" instead of just saying general stuff and assumptions u have clearly made with no evidence","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lobbie","date":"2016-09-16T02:06:41.328+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":2,"body":"when is 3v3 ranked coming to oce {{champion:17}} ","replies":[{"poster":"WizardlySundew","date":"2016-09-16T08:42:36.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Møøkie","date":"2016-09-16T01:57:03.312+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":5,"body":"If rito wants our trust back they should #FreeTyler1 hehe xd","replies":[{"poster":"Mikkyy","date":"2016-09-16T02:56:06.945+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":3,"body":"#FreeTyler1 hehe xd","replies":[{"poster":"BCD Crimson","date":"2016-09-16T06:00:58.553+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Free Tyler1","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowVeteran","date":"2016-09-18T12:10:54.654+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"A question I would like to ask Riot?

His ult usually just gets CCed or slowed if i don't land my Q first. His passive as well is quite useless cuz the opponents always crowd around you when you die and you usually revive with not too much HP left; even when I try Q away its so slow i die half way through the Q or its still on cooldown so I just die again straight on the spot. I think someone mentioned this below but a burst damage on revival or a stun would be nice. As mentioned before I also think his ult is quite lacking... it just seems like a master yi ult just with no movement speed or resistance to stuns... and no other unique abilities. Maybe a passive cooldown reset function can be added to make it slightly more useful? But even with this function I don't think you can stop an aatrox from always dying.

Why not listen to the community on this issue? \r\n\r\nIt would be a very good idea if instead of making excuses maybe just maybe admit you made a mistake and revert these awful changes in a slight attempt to regain our trust to make it seem like u give a single fuck about the communities opinions and desires.\r\n\r\nTo say you have been lacking urgency is a very big understatement here riot. There has been no sandbox mode or replay system or voice communication in the chat in this multiplayer game for all this time in six whole years. In comparison Blizzard has had sandbox mode and replay systems in all their games from scratch since the original starcraft in 1998. Blizzard never makes any excuses because they unlike riot are a good reliable company.\r\n\r\nAlso why are riot games with a plural, you have made one game and its a rip off of dota so thats just not correct either. \r\n\r\nMore seriously, why have u been so silent in the first place if your intention was to set a healthy relationship with us ( the community) why have you, RIOT \"GAMES\" made it clear that you only want to make your own decisions if this is not the case and you really listen to any feedback please provide us with some examples where u have done so in the last 6 years. \r\n\r\nThis is clearly a poor effort to reach out to a very frustrated and neglected community on Reddit and on the forums, if RIOT really cared about our opinion on the homepage there would be a feedback tab or popups asking about how the current state of the game is more regularly. Rather than now it is very late and very lazy of them to pretend like they do so after such a long long time. Everyone in this community should realise that they have been mistreated in this way and clearly this is a false white flag from RIOT, just ask the all the professional players what they think of the last patch and whether RIOT ever asked them if it was the right decision to make laning phase more like solo q and terminating lane swaps.

No one wants to deal with toxic players, and you are about to become one of them.

His immense survivability/damage W.\r\n      2. The fact that he was a very risk-reward champion.\r\n\r\nThe reason I stopped playing him was because of a simple core concept. The risk was not worth the rewards the champion gave me. When I think of Aatrox from a lore standpoint or even a generic standpoint I think of a profound war hero who feeds off the strengths of his fallen enemies and rallies his comrades to strive for victory in the most desperate moments.\r\n\r\nIn all honesty Aatrox feels stale, like he gives his team no benefits other than a scrappy, easy-to-kite, frontline tank with very little damage most of the time. What I propose of a possible Aatrox rework is to put the risk-reward factors back into his kit.\r\n\r\nThis can be done a multitude of ways and one that relates to his lore is fighting with less men on his side. In his lore it states: \"Just when all hope seemed lost, Aatrox appeared among the ranks... he urged the soldiers to fight to the last before throwing himself into battle.\" What this could translate to, gameplay wise, is during fights when he has allies that have fallen he can get a buff, which can scale with attack speed and little attack damage for every ally around him that is dead. More-or-less like how Irelia's passive makes her tenacity increase for the difference between the amount of allies in the fight.\r\n\r\nFor instance: The attack-speed scaling and attack damage scaling could be with his ultimate level (In this case: levels 0/6/11/16, so: 7.5%/15%/22.5%/30% and 5/15/25/35 attack-speed and attack damage respectively for every ally on his side that has a dead body near Aatrox. This ensures a reliable buff to Aatrox's damage as a sustained-fighter while also not making his kit extremely over-powered. (For reference the maximum buff for each level is 30%/60%/90%/120% and 20/60/100/140 assuming that all four allies on Aatrox's team are dead around Aatrox) \r\n\r\nThis could be his new passive because it would add the risk-reward factor and due to the fact that there are currently three revive champions including Aatrox (The mechanic seems almost stale at this point with every Guardian Angel that's bought). Plus, Aatrox's live passive gives him nothing to work with right after he's come back from the dead, having his bloodpool drained immediately upon revive.\r\n\r\nFor any rioter that reads this, I loved Aatrox, he was my most played champion in Seasons Three and Four and I want to see him make a comeback to the top of the ranks by the end of Season 6 or Pre-Season 2017.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gritty Kitty","date":"2016-09-16T18:09:06.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's the point of doing these if you only answer 2 questions lmao.
