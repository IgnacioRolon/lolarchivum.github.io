Glad Riot decided to finally take a look at Warwick and Galio, but there are many other veterans of League, who are also in dire need of the rework. Of course the list may be incomplete or wrong, so don't be afraid to correct, but please no bs about my decisions.\r\n\r\n1. {{champion:266}} Aatrox - Has been requested for a damn long time and for obvious reasons: easily countered, scales very poorly, and overall does not feature a good kit to truly fit the fighter/tank category he was meant to be in\r\n\r\n2. {{champion:54}} Malphite - Famous for his wombo combo ultimates and nothing else. Has one of the most boring and pointless kits in the game. Only unique and useful crowd control he brings as a tank is his AOE knockup, apart from that, his kit takes the №1 place for the most boring kit in the game right now\r\n\r\n3. {{champion:33}} Rammus - AKA the Sonic of League, but does not have a single reason for why he would be better than any other engage champion. Bonus speed is a unique quality, but he is ridiculously easy to kite even when the movespeed persists, not only when it's over. Rest of the kit too, is plainly a buff to his stats and one single-person crowd cc skill, with some pointless AOE on the ultimate. Honestly, he would probably take the silver for the most boring kit in game.\r\n\r\n4. {{champion:6}} Urgot - By far the most underrated adc of the whole game and for a good reason. His mechanics fit into one scheme: hit e, turn on w shield, and pepper the target with q's and autoattacks. If e misses, wait for the cooldown and repeat. The simplicity in mechanics makes him just outright boring to play against, with the lack of mobility and a completely useless for an ad carry ultimate, makes him the most unpopular adc ever. Technically, since the niche he was supposed to fill was the tank-oriented marksman, it still could be fixed, but in a current state it is obvious why nobody plays him.\r\n\r\n5. {{champion:23}} Tryndamere - The catastrophe of the healthy gameplay number 1, Tryndamere could easily beat Teemo in the rush for the most annoying champion to lane against. No matter if you beat him in lane or not, later in the game he will just sit and push top forever, forcing you to stay in lane or risk being pushed to the base. His ultimate allows him to disregard any advantage you have gained over him and turns him into an unstoppable menace for the duration long enough to win a 2v1 even if ganked or simply escape. His early-game crits are stupid enough on its own to give him the advantage in early lane, and later on it becomes even worse\r\n\r\n6. {{champion:2}} Olaf - One of the last of the non-reworked juggernauts left in game, Olaf is the iconic immobile initiator, who runs in and gets kited to hell or gets chunked to death in a matter of seconds. His only uniqueness comes from his e with the true damage and his ultimate's disable immunity which gives him the only edge of the kit. His q is the definition of a spam ability, which if you abuse in lane, allows you to poke the lane opponent out of the lane with ease, or be insanely weak for the duration of the lane phase if not abused. Olaf has the potential for a solid rework, but in his current state, no wonder he lacks popularity in the player community\r\n\r\n7. {{champion:36}} Dr. Mundo - The definition of \"unkillable\", Mundo proudly takes the spot of the insane health based tank that he is, but his kit suffers from the same plain lacklusterness as most other juggernauts mentioned on the list. His q bis the iconic poke ability, is one of the core components of his playstyle, but all his other abilities could be very easily reworked into something 2 or 3 times better than it is now. The potential Mundo has is massive, but he does require a fair bit of attention to get into operation reshaped from what he is now\r\n\r\n8. {{champion:82}} Mordekaiser - One of the biggest failures of Riot rework team (sorry, but it is true), Mordekaiser is the only champion who does not feature a crowd control or a mobility spell in the kit. This was tweaked with the bonus movespeed on his new w, but the overall concept of turning him into a melee botlane AP carry, was truthfully just not in a good placeto be implemented in the game. This latest rework made him unplayable, except for the team comps in which he would not be kited, which with the state the game is in now practically never happens.\r\n\r\n9. {{champion:35}} Shaco - One of the most unfavourable assasins in the game right now, Shaco is somewhere close to Rengar in terms of playstyle, but is drastically weaker, due to his incredible reliance on ganks and counterjungling and the severe mid-late game weaknesses. Unless as Shaco you get fed off succesful ganks, he becomes almost useless, unless he gains advantage early to get the items to allow him to burst harder and more effectively. His ultimate too, while allowing him to pull off some impressive mind games, is in most scenarios pointless as it gives him no real combat advantages, neither adds to his burst\r\n\r\n10. {{champion:20}} Nunu - The iconic counter-junle monster, Nunu is only ever played in two ways: either full AP oneshot monstrosity, or the frontline tank objective controller. In both situations at least two of his skills make absolutely no sense to be on the champion: q and w in the first role and w, r in the second. Nunu, by nature is supposed to be a team-oriented tank, and while his ultimate enables him to make some extreme baits happen, it and his w do not make sense whatsoever to have on a champion like this\r\n\r\nThis is where I will stop for now, but prompt me with some feedback on who else i could include and why, and if any Rioter would like to argue for the cause, I would be happy to discuss!","replies":[{"poster":"TrainsRunOn","date":"2016-09-01T20:57:45.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree with your logic on so many levels but I can agree that some of those deserve reworks. This is my opinion on who Riot will probably rework.\r\n1. yes \r\n2. no\r\n3. no\r\n4. yes\r\n5. Would be difficult to rework him given his theme. Kit is not entirely unhealthy as there is a moderate level of counter-play. So probably no.\r\n6. -_-  yes and no... probably yes in the end, but I doubt it will be a bit one.\r\n7. no\r\n8. yes but as you said they already tried and just made him worse. So might take a while before they give it a go again.\r\n9. Hard to rework given the unhealthy nature of stealth. So I doubt we will be seeing one anytime soon.\r\n10. Given the split nature of his kit, he is one that no matter how they reworked him, lots of people will be unhappy. So I believe they are avoiding it for now.","replies":[{"poster":"Vitklim","date":"2016-09-01T21:24:28.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand why you disagree with some of my decisions on who would deserve a rework, but let me explain why\r\n\r\n2,3 and 7 - Yes they do have a spot in the meta and people still play them, but in the end the whole difference is that one engages by running in and hitting whoever andtaunting them, other by ulting in and doing almost nothing afterwards, and the last one does not even engage, just throws cleavers and ults when low. Honestly with the mechanics this trio has, you could easily program some bots to play on a level of average player.\r\n\r\n5. Don't know about you, but as it seems to me, his kit right now is THE most unhealthy in the game (except the champions who soon will be reworked). Let me sum up all he offers: random crits from the passive, stupid heal in lane from q, chasing tool on w, which with the rest of his kit makes it impossible to get away, e which with his ult allows him to get out of almost any situation and the ult, which is the definition of broken, since before it runs out and you can kill him (which even then is hard), he has enough time to take out 2 of the carries and get out. After he gets some items you can't fight him in lane and the only way to stop him is to send a 3 man squad toplane repeatedly. Honestly, in the state he is in right now, he's a living shame to Riot's \"healthy gameplay\" policies.\r\n\r\n9. Truthfully, I don't think his stealth is in such a bad spot. Of course it will have to be nerfed to keep him balanced once the res of his kit is fixed, but what I think deserves a rework on it's own is his w and ult, as they are veeery situational and sometimes unreliable to use.\r\n\r\n10. His \"split\" nature dates back to practically the beginning of the game, when he was meant to be played support. Now, no one even tries it, because they know just how much other supports outclass him. That being said, nobody plays him that much in the first place, and even those who do, have to agree that he's one of the most outdated champions in the game today and deserves some attention from Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"TrainsRunOn","date":"2016-09-02T17:16:49.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2. All of his problems stem from his ult and they can't change it as it is iconic.\r\n\r\n3. I will admit I am probably biased against a rework. The amount of fun this champ is to play and the amount of build options available make me never want to see him change. Unfortunately he has a few problems, however, I feel they are different to the once you have listed. I feel his and galio's passives just don't belong in the game anymore. That and his ult. while really cool, doesn't fit with the rest of his MO, unless you are building him ap :P\r\n\r\n7. Tank fantasy ~ also not every champ needs a difficulty cap off the planet. \r\n\r\n5. Ok, I initially wrote out the equivalent of two pages going into each of his abilities and pointing out the counter play and how his kit is actually quite weak but you can just look up a video about it. Basically he relies on opponents making mistakes, otherwise he just loses and that's if the players knows how to take advantage of cds etc. I mean no offence, but if your team has even the slightest bit of communication it is easy to force him out of the game even if he gets fed early (which he shouldn't because pre-6 you can beat him in lane pretty easily with most top laners).\r\n\r\n9. I meant the unhealthy nature of stealth in general and how stealth is over powered unless you have a revealing effect, in which case its weak as a soggy biscuit. This makes it near impossible to balance stealth champions fully.\r\n\r\n10. You are probably right, however, I feel they are still going to leave it while there are others that need reworking.\r\n\r\nIt is nice that we can have a debate without it resulting in insults XD.
