In otherwords, loot just got more random, i'll be avoiding the augmented cases, i won't be joining the little flashy light display craze, it'll be the normal pretty soon with every champ with a project skin, if you had a way to unlock ANY champ as a project, and as you should. This would be justified, it just looks like an expensive way to randomly create a project skin, i'll stick to Hextech loot and try my luck with gemstones that way, cause unless a Riot staffer comments otherwise, Hextech loot chests should STILL have a chance to unlock a champs project skin and buy it through orange essence. Which, unless you're specifically after Hextech gemstone skins, there's no reason to add another pool of random loot to your chest. I'll stick to champs, skins wards and random icons from hextech. Out of the 50 or so chests ive opened, ive had 6 gemstones, i just turned them into more chests because thats how uninspiring hextech skins are, even on Annie! Yeeeeah nah... Not really worth augmenting when you can get bundles directly for the skins, get your project bundle, avoid the augmented caches, unless riot releases near all champs access to project crafting, its not worth randomizing for like 6? 7? project champs. Especially if you have other skins/champs to get, since my account is newish, i still prefer the chances of free champs, free skins, which over time. has really been alot cheaper and alot more beneficial to me, my level 7 grinds (5 to date, more in the works, just grabbing another 4 champs to pick from in any game regardless of role) and more chance to get things i enjoy for its uniqueness, not because its an overpriced flavor of the month nearly everyone will have in 4-8weeks if they play the champ. Nice way to kill a cool team concept Riot.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-08-02T02:58:50.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Really disappointed the only way to obtain a gemstone certainly is to spend roughly $30 on RP and cross your fingers for it... For 10 caches.... which previously were 975 without the project bundle... so normally it would be 1950 for the 10 caches, less than $20 in RP... You're trying to justify the project boarders/skins and a gemstone per 10pack for around $30 in RP value or $35 at once if you dont buy it in 2 bundles (less bonus, not even worth doing $30 tbh). This is a hugely disappointing cost process. Some people will end up spending $350 in RP just to acquire Hextech skins. Nice work Riot, nice work. Play on peoples paytoplay addictions and their huge desire for pixels. I don't mind the RP side of things, but honestly, you should have included the gemstone in the 5pack and just made it 1100rp. Going straight into the deepend of the \"haves\" and \"have nots\". I'm not interested in any project skin or borders anyways. So you won't be getting my money for it. But it's really disappointing alot of people will shell out for it, affordable or not to them. And you can only do bundles once per day, so you're doubly playing on peoples urges. So many gamers just quit life for the next week so they can buy each bundle per day. Responsible effort Riot, real responsible. Turning into a digital drug dealer pretty much. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[]}]}
