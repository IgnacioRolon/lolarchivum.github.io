Reason is that I want to relax, not play ranked sometimes, yet while I'm fine with it sometimes, there are many times when you are disadvantaged in blind pick. Ever thought of adding these changes into other servers later on in 2K17","replies":[{"poster":"Emú","date":"2016-10-01T07:01:59.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are so many picks that I want to take that require certain champions to not be picked (due to low mobility on most ADCs), which makes learning them in blind pick incredibly difficult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-29T20:38:51.650+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Rumble changes the core game experience. Pick and ban phase becomes about banning out specific team comps, strategies, and specific team members instead of just taking out champs that happen to be powerful (it’s infinitely more meaningful to ban out the opposing jungler because you did your homework than it is to ban Zed because he’s strong, and it’s satisfying to feel the respect when you get banned). Teams get coaches. You scout, scrim, and review tape.\r\n\r\n^ This is what we need! But also likely what we will never get in normal ranked.\r\nAs long as there are powerhouse outliers like Zed and Yasuo, most elos cant afford to ban strategically. A half-decent Yasuo will almost always rip through opposition like well.. a sword through the wind. \r\n\r\nLee sin will more often than not, be the more efficient jungler in all elo's. He is tanky enough to survive most things, but also has enough damage to make junglers like Kindred and Fiddlesticks not worth picking in solo queue. He has more mobility than almost all other junglers (not to mention all other champs) \r\n\r\nIncreasing the number of bans will help for sure!, but it alone might not be enough. You need to cut down the tall poppies. For example: Lee sin has everything a jungler (and a champion) could want, he's mobile in and out of fights, he's a tank wth assassin like damage and can knockup the entire enemy team. So why does he need 350 movement speed?? It seems to unessecary for a champ thats already so powerful to have so many little extra things like this. Where Kindred, (whose entire job is to try and get to her marks QUICKER than the enemy, has only 325 ms) which makes jungling against a Lee near impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is not a crusade against Yasuo or Lee or whatever, but if you want strategic banning to come into normal ranked, you are going to need to cut down the tall poppies.
