Juggernauts are unstoppable meatshields in the late game but have weaknesses in the early game. \r\n\r\nShyvana isn't going to be great at ganking like Lee Sin or a lane bully like Renekton. However, she will be able to dive your backline and get to your carries. \r\n\r\nLeague is an incredibly complex game. Being able to counterplay requires an understanding of how a champ plays and what their win conditions are. Being able to stop a champion getting fed and being able to play around when they are is a skill worth developing. \r\n\r\nTL;DR \r\nShyvana being fed doesn't make her op.
