There is some troubleshooting we can do to help with this problem.\n\nFirst, Make sure you have at least 8 GB of hard drive space available on your computer.\n\nSecond, clear the temp folder by following the steps in Microsoft&#x27;s guide for your version of Windows. [You can find the guide here](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup). When you run the Disk Cleanup utility, ensure the following is selected for cleanup:\n\n* Temporary Internet Files\n* Offline webpages\n* Recycle Bin\n* Temporary files\n* Thumbnails\n\nOnce the cleanup is done, reboot your computer. Try running League of Legends again.","replies":[]}]}
