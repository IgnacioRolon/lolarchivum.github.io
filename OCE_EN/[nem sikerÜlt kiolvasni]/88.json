Keeping this segmented in to boxes like the legacy client keeps the information from overlapping and competing for attention.\nAnd I don't understand why you couldn't keep the game selecting type simple as it is in the legacy client.\nFurthermore the chat \"box\" thing is incredibly frustrating to use when trying to have multiple chats as it is laggy (probably will be fixed with beta) and ,imo, TOO compact.\nOther than perhaps overthinking information display and a couple of bugs, its all looking and functioning very nicely ;) {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lidia28","date":"2016-10-21T15:40:57.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks nice and I think is a bit easier to navigate through but for some reason I was looking for how many wins I got in what type of game and I couldn't find.
