I love Riot; a great game creator which once had its community at it's heart. Why would you take my prestige points away besides so that people need to purchase them again? This is disgusting. I purchased the last event package solely for the prestige points (my first and fucking last time). I stare at my 25 PP thinking about what i can do with it in 3 events time; which seems like a good player retention system. Yeah, nah. Just take away my work/time/money. If this is followed through I will never play League again. I will resign my 3 accounts with over 250 skins. \r\n\r\nMake smart choices. Please anyone from Riot, contact me to talk about, explain or even justify your actions - via Lol account names Woodyxoxo, nk9 or via the mail attached to Woodyxoxo.","replies":[{"poster":"BrownEyedGirl","date":"2019-09-24T13:29:37.944+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"when Prestige Points came out it has always been said they will expire... go to your loot and hover over the points... this is not new information... stop crying they have given you an answer on what to do with your 25pp... buy a emote","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vynlerian","date":"2019-09-24T02:58:28.641+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Because at the end of the day why would they care about you at all. The exact reason they want them to expire is to make people want to spend extra money to make sure they have enough PP to get the skin/s they want.

Its to attract people into the idea of limiting sale periods. Same thing occurs with designer brands like surpreme. Its only available for a limited time to increase popularity while it is available.

Even though you could get somewhere through your own hard work / effort, it felt like the game was biased in favor of people who could afford to pay money.\r\n\r\nNot only because they could get cool skins, but because they could afford to get champions runes faster via IP boosts, learn things quicker and have an advantage.\r\n\r\nI was delighted when both the rune system and the whole currency system was revamped and not only that, the crafting system was introduced.\r\n\r\nThis completely leveled the playing field in terms of being able to bring out champions full abilities because you didn't need to buy a specific rune set to do that anymore.\r\n\r\nFurthermore with the crafting system it gave even non-paying users a chance to own awesome skins.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with Riot and this game all over again.\r\n\r\nTime passed, i had to take a year off. I come back a couple of weeks ago and what do i find?\r\n\r\nThe prestige content.\r\n\r\nOK... how do i get prestige points? You **must** pay for them.\r\n\r\nExcuse me? Furthermore (i've learned from others in the forum) you don't get keep the points you've earned from previous events...\r\n\r\nWhat happened Riot? Your ethos this entire time has been providing UX first, now you've done a complete 180 and are now discriminating implementing a class system (i.e. those with prestige and those without)?\r\n\r\nIf you need a steady stream of financing, stick 1 or 2 ad banners in the game loading screen.

I have played from season 3 and spent countless hours and money buying skins and grinding for them. The whole skin system is just getting ridiculous now. How much money are we expected to pay for skins like these? Having like one a year would be great but I certainly will not be sitting in ARAM again for 4 weeks per event just to grind for tokens for a skin that I really really want. The prestige skins are no longer unique because Riot just releases one after the other because people like different champions so they get more sales of loot bundles. Well I've had enough. Not going to bother buying anymore skins or grinding for them. I have spent enough money on this game and although its been great, I'm done with trying to collect certain skin themes etc its just near impossible. How can anyone have the time or money to get like 600 prestige points in one year to try and get all of these nice skins. NO skin is worth that much I don't care how nice it looks.Riot, come back because you're too far out the gate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FlayBoy","date":"2019-11-07T10:16:15.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a little confused so if within the next week i reroll a prestige skin i get the border but next year if i reroll i wont.

OCE is a tiny community and represents a very small percentage of the player base.\r\n2. Riot is owned by Tencent now, a Chinese conglomerate who care about nothing but their profit line.\r\n\r\nI would like to think that Riot still cares about their game and community and these money grab decisions are not their own. Ultimately the only way you'll see things change is if Tencent aren't making the money they want to. So the best way to make changes would be to not put any money into league of legends or any Riot (Tencent) products.\r\n\r\nAlso, to Riot, it sucks you guys sold out, and if anyone at the studio does have a say in these decisions maybe you can stop greedy decisions like these from killing your game after players start boycotting it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Digitalpiggy","date":"2019-09-24T22:43:54.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey since you are sharing this information, can we get some regarding gemstone skins?
