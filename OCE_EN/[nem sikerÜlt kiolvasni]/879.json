A real Rioter? Hi! :)\n\nAnyways, I wrote a big essay about why eSports is productive and they completely ignored it. I used many articles that have been featured in the client about High School eSports and they all just ignored it. It was very upsetting because I spent near 2 hours on it and to have no response at all and no feedback as to why it isn't possible is unbelievable. I appreciate your efforts to start clubs in schools and I'm sure many players from schools all over the world are grateful for what you have done in this push, but unfortunately I (and others like me) can't participate due to the negative stigma set by the older generations.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-05-01T08:45:25.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in seeing that essay if you'd like to share it with me.
