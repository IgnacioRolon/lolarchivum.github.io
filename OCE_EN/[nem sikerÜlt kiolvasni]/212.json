When you self-cast it it also automatically targets a nearby allied champion or minion, and vice-versa when targeting an ally. Making the damage proximity based with the other unit means that when Mord is roaming or retreating, it becomes a mini Armor and MR buff and the only ability in his kit that won't build up his passive (no damage means no shield).

Darius in a teamfight is now going to be hell, whether he gets full stacks or with his ult.

He can just waltz in, KS, then go on a rampage with no effort. I think He should only get his bloodrage from fully stacking someone, or ult killing someone with full stacks on already. (So it refreshes the duration and it's not just wasted before you can use it on another champ.)\r\n\r\nAnother question I have about {{champion:122}} is if you get bloodrage, will the duration be reset from attacking someone else giving them immediate full stacks?\r\n\r\n\r\nI kinda agree on you with {{champion:72}} though. I think it will be annoying, kind of being forced to counter jungle, or give your opponent free gold. I don't like that it gives gold if they take it, but I'm fine with it otherwise. Maybe if it healed the enemy, or something like that to help their clear instead, but not forcing you to help the enemy snowball. That seems unfair to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Eshe","date":"2015-08-05T23:20:29.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:122}}  The bloodrage only \"activates\" once he has full stacks of his passive OR executes with his ult. So basically he could literally come in, ult someone and get bloodrage activated and basically attack everyone in sight. Because with bloodrage active, any champion he attacks gives **full stacks of his passive**. So basically it means in a game with Darius, once he hits lvl 6 you'll just have to be more wary within a teamfight as he gains increased attack damage and also applies full passive stacks onto you.\n\nWith {{champion:72}}, although he is a jungler, with the neutral \"objectives\" especially during the start of a game the enemy jungler would be able to capture a few on their jungle early game. I think if the objectives were to spawn not immediately into the game it would provide a better chance. I think its good that anyone on his team however, may capture it for him, especially the positioning of these objectives. Because more often than not, someone on his team may need a buff and can help capture the objective whilst doing so, and also around Baron and Dragon -- that's where most of the team usually groups regardless to capture objectives throughout the game. I just think with this they're trying to add too much into it for {{champion:72}}  in my honest opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IForgotURFrumpy","date":"2015-08-05T12:34:35.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot crew,\r\nThis is a great comment about my main, {{champion:122}}.

I suspect it will be tempered since I think his role is to deal damage under first-engage conditions, so a {{champion:122}} hiding in the bushes would provide a lot less damage where he normally would for the team. An out of control **bloodrage** at the minimum of how many stacks he has achieved of **hemorrhage** in a string of play makes it more dependent on being earned.\r\n\r\nTo boot: If the pros don't play him even on occasion, he's underpowered.\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n\r\n        _\"I've had my ordoeuvres\"_\r\n        Darius","replies":[{"poster":"Raymoclaus","date":"2015-08-05T15:01:24.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Saying you main Darius is like saying you main a spoon when you eat your cereal.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raymoclaus","date":"2015-08-05T15:00:01.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Skarner change might make more sense if they don't get gold from capturing it while it's neutral at the beginning of the game.
