How is that going to fix it, if anything it'll make it purely luck whether or not you get a good champion on or not. What if you get yasuo and you're pretty much useless compared to other champs? Am I meant to suffer through a 20min+ game most likely doing nothing and getting no kills? What if your team is unlucky enough to get all the bad champs and your enemy get all the good champs. Winning would be completely based on luck and that really shouldn't be the case. I can't fathom how anyone would like this change, do you want games to be won based of RNG? Cause that's how it's going to be with this change.\r\n\r\nThe dragons have this issue too, if your team is lucky enough to get a 2 infernal drakes in a row, your team has a pretty much won all the teamfights. If your team gets multiple mountain drakes in a row, objectives will melt in seconds. It influences the game A LOT and completely RNG based. Once a team is ahead and gets these drakes, there's pretty much no coming back and winning a game from behind is one of the best feelings, now gone due to them just being lucky for that game.\r\n\r\nWho exactly said that URF was stagnant? As I remember, everyone wanted URF and you were praised for giving it to us. Then you were fired upon when you removed it. The majority liked it the way it was, I have no idea where you got this idea of people not liking it. All I saw on the post where you said you were removing it the comments were flooded with people asking why. People liked it the way it was as per these posts with the top comments literally having thousands of upvotes.\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/ultra-rapid-fire-bows-out-0\r\n\r\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/ultra-rapid-fire-future","replies":[{"poster":"TSM Bengi","date":"2016-09-09T07:27:18.189+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"please dont complain when youre in bronze. you dont know how 99% of the game works, and therefore have no right to comment on the state of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakescape","date":"2016-09-09T22:16:50.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Jakescape","date":"2016-09-09T22:25:03.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Who the classic 'you're bronze' rebuttal.

A lot of the community found it very boring, mainly because the League Of Legends community doesn't know how to have fun. URF is nice once and a while, but over and over it does become boring. People ask for it back, but only because they can spam the OP Champions like Zed with no concerns. We have not seen it in a while, so it is only natural people will be asking \"What is going on?\" \n\nRiot wasn't bored of it, they were just aware of how unhealthy of a gamemode it can become. People ask for Hexakill to come back, the same goes with One For Alls. \n\nThose gamemodes however are a lot easier to balance in a lot of aspects, so they come back more often. People were asking for URF to be changed, because the spamming of the same 20 champions became very monotonous. People want Doom Bots back now don't they? But I'm sure if it was put in 3 weekends in a row people would get a little bit tired of it. \nRNG URF has been a requested idea since the creation of the gamemode, you clearly just haven't been around long enough. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-13T23:15:18.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But it's just a merri-go-round, mention any RGM and there will be a fan section, and a haters section all arguing about which is best. Of course **some** would get sick of doom bots 3 weekends in a row. But why would you make it 3 weekends in a row anyway? Thats just silly.\n\nIf you read the comments section for every RGM update they post, there are always people complaining about \"Not poro king again we've had this too many times put something else on\", \"We hate nexus siege its boring\" etc etc (not to be specific about those 2 modes, just examples).\nThe point is they are holding 1 popular RGM back so it doesn't stagnate, but leaving others in to become stagnate.\n\nI personally haven't been around long enough no, but many of my friends migrated to league from the get go, and most of them either hate all RGM's and just don't bother playing them, or want a schedule that puts every mode in, in an equal amount of times. To the latter I couldn't agree more.\n\nThe best way to not make any 1 single thing stagnate or boring, is to have greater variety. And what better way to have more variety than not having 1 more than another, distribute them evenly to the masses. If more modes are created, great add them in. But keep the old ones too. Some will play it, some wont. I honestly only hate ascension, the rest i don't mind. But i'd be happy to have ascension in the queue just as much as the other modes, because i'm sure others really enjoy it.\n\nRiot is preaching variety here by changing a mode that was rarely seen and already waited upon anyway, but why not make the whole thing (RGM) a variety, not just a small portion of it (1 mode).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sir Pixelfist","date":"2016-09-09T21:02:10.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stagnant and boring are two different things, but Stagnant gameplay can lead to it being boring.
