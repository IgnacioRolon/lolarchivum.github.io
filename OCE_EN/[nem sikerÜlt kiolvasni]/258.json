(I don't mean juke, I don't mean Lux just missing, I mean, Lux being on-point with her aiming but her target can literally dodge the skillshot before it hits them).\r\nLux's Light Binding is an outright underpowered ability at the moment, and when it goes on cooldown she dies because it's her only hard CC and her only good defensive option. If you're letting yourself get hit by light binding in season 6 then you deserve to die anyway, because it's not hard to do with all of these movespeed buffs lying around.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Froxah","date":"2016-07-25T20:51:54.879+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Dragon trainer kled? :D ","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiXIVIUS","date":"2016-07-26T06:46:48.604+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:150}} +{{champion:107}} raised by {{champion:41}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"spiller90","date":"2016-08-03T08:30:19.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when is this champ due to come out looks great","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-02T05:31:09.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is riot just smashing out champions for the sake of it?
