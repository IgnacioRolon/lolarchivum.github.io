Maybe not including his shield in the VU means he'll be squishy like sona now? Because keeping his tanky stats as they currently are while adding these kit changes look really unbalanced. \r\n\r\nAs for his new kit, he now has an AoE heal, AoE stun, double shield and AoE invunerability, and his ult looks like it still allows your teammates to move and attack seeing as they're not frozen like zhonya's.\r\n\r\nSo my biggest question now is... what happens to Bard{{champion:432}} from here?
