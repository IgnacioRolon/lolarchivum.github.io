Damn damn damn. I hoped this would never happen. Jungle Gragas is labelled a dark horse and suddenly I can never play him again in ranked.\r\n\r\nFor the record. I am currently Plat 3 and play jungle Gragas in ranked quite a bit. Plat 3 isn't anything special, I know, but I feel obligated to say something here for anyone interested in this idea.\r\n\r\nFirstly, clearing up a few misclarifications about this article;\r\n\r\ngragas is a powerhouse early; pre 6 ganks are phenomenal, and have a high success rate even with flash up in lane. Late game, Gragas can do practically nothing. Damage builds on gragas are VERY gold dependent, and the jungle is not the best place for that. Tanky is the best way to build him, more the ONLY way to build him, so if your team already has a bruiser Gragas is a bad choice.\r\n\r\nGragas does NOT need a good initiator to be relevant, he has very powerful initiate by himself. his body slam lances (hits further than the damage reticule) extremely hard and will knock up from insane distances. Exploding cask can be chained with body slam for devastating initiates, but you have to be good. like... very good.\r\n\r\nGragas is NOT overly mana dependent. Leaving body slam at level 1 means you shouldn't be using the damn thing to farm. explosive cask is expensive, sure, but your drink move is your main dps to monsters and it only costs 30 mana. Early to mid game may cost one or two mana potions, but as long as you get your sheen not too long after your finished jungle item, mana is rarely an issue. You can still donate blue to midlane.\r\n\r\nNew gragas players are usually tempted to leave their barrel to charge up during ganks. Don't. Explode it before the enemy flashes away, and you'll still often be able to catch and kill them thanks to the rediculous slow. and DON'T TRY TO USE YOUR ULT TO KNOCK THE ENEMY INTO YOUR BARREL. Just because lcs players can do it does NOT mean you can.\r\n\r\nGragas is NOT weak to lee sin and rek'sai. Gragas is an incredibly effective bruiser and can contest camps phenomenally well. Make them fight in your barrel and you can get some free damage as well as use the slow to get distance or close in for the kill. Contested camps go down fast with a w-smite combo, and are impossible to smite steal from you if you time it right. Gragas can take objectives quite fast, and his drink move offers a huge advantage against the scuttlecrabs, since it eviscerates them thanks to their high health.\r\n\r\nNow for the one thing they got right; Gragas is hard. Please don't take this straight into ranked and ruin 4 other people's days.\r\n\r\nDo not play Gragas if your team lacks late game damage.\r\n\r\nDo not play gragas if your enemy's damage is hard to peel (zed, hecarim, vi, etc. Gragas does counter J4 though)\r\n\r\nDo not play gragas if your enemy's damage is hard to pin down (akali, zed, vayne, etc) or have a lot of dashes. Gragas' damage and peel are both zone-based\r\n\r\nDo pick gragas if the enemy team relies on charge dashes or inconsistant dashes (charges - vi, j4, lissandra. Inconsistent dashes - Rek-sai, tristana) Body slam can interrupt all of these\r\n\r\nDo pick gragas if you need both damage and peel for a vulnerable team. Gragas has 3 effective peel moves as well as good objective control.\r\n\r\nDo play gragas if you think you'll get invaded. Gragas has good mobility and can win duels with most foes, as well as EASILY stick to isolated targets. If the outcome doesn't look good you can also easily escape.\r\n\r\nIf people honestly do rush out to try this, I hope they at least do it well. Gragas is not a troll pick, but he is niche, he is not a mainable champion. Don't pick this unless you have a damn good reason.","replies":[{"poster":"The Zucchini","date":"2015-03-30T10:03:30.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"wait so we need to not pick gragas when they have hard to peel damage (vi) but do pick him when they have inconsistant dashes (vi)....... getting mixed messages here bud {{champion:254}} >{{champion:79}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RokMelon","date":"2015-03-26T21:08:40.056+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Somewhere in a bar, Gragas cries, thinking he was still a known jungler up until this point.\r\n\r\nAlso jungle Gragas with exhaust makes ganking so nice","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-03-30T16:15:38.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"130+ champs in this game im sure theres some one you havnt tryed every where people should not judge so harshly and except that in a democracy every one is entitled to an opinion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"redwoolfred2","date":"2015-03-30T10:18:52.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\r\nGank early, gank often\r\nGragas is very mobile (for a guy his size, anyway), which means that when he's in the jungle, he's got plenty of opportunities to gank. Before level 6, he already has a stun and a slow. From level 6 onwards, his ult gives you the chance to break hard-to-gank positions and even open up tower dive opportunities. Plan on your top lane ganks to be more focused on pushing out the enemy laner compared to his bot lane ganks, where he can be more aggressive and engaging with Explosive Cask.\r\nCan build to take damage - or dish it out\r\nGragas will always have a big impact on teamfights due to his abilities, which means that you can build him to tank damage and still stay relevant later in the game. However, Gragas' abilities also have nice AP ratios, so you can choose to build offensive items and make him more fragile, but his cask won't be the only thing exploding here and there.\r\nGo home, Gragas(do rio)\r\nWatch out for mana usage, aggressive enemy junglers\r\nGragas needs a strong early game in order to stay relevant later on, and his impact will be most noticeable after you build Cooldown Reduction and Ability Power items. Also, you'll need to be conservative with your mana usage; Gragas spends a lot of mana to clear camps, and if you don't save some, you won't have an effective presence in lanes. This dependence also makes it hard for him to deal with aggressive junglers like Lee Sin or Rek'Sai, who can make your life miserable by contesting your camps and starting duels you'll have a hard time winning.\r\nNeeds a good initiator\r\nGragas relies a lot on his teammates to make plays by tackling out-of-position enemies or forcing fights. Lissandra, Maokai, Leona and Blitzcrank are excellent teammates for our keg-draining friend.\r\nPowerful tools take practice\r\nGragas has a lot of useful tools, but they've got pretty steep learning curves. A poorly-placed ult can help the enemy tanks dive your own backline. Hitting your own barrels can also be hard, and it takes a while to learn exactly when to use your Body Slam to get in (or out) of a fight. Always keep your mana at an average level so you can gank or move around the jungle if necessary.\r\nYou can add Gragas to your champion pool for 553 RP (30% off), and his Superfan Gragas skin for 525 RP (30% off) from March 27 until 17:59 AEDT March 31.\r\n1\r\n4 DAYS AGO\r\nPROMOTION\r\nTAGGED WITH: GRAGAS\r\nDiscuss 27   comments   sorted by  BEST\r\n\r\n\r\n Posting as redwoolfred2 POST\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n Lauricella3  - 3 days ago REPLY\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nA zhonyas can work instead of abysal as well depending on your team and enemy team.\r\n\r\n The Zucchini  - 13 minutes ago REPLY\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nI just came here to read up on how to counter  jungle.\r\nSince we're now going to be seeing more \"Gragas mains\" trying this...\r\n\r\n Joerick  - 3 days ago REPLY\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\njust like the spike in  last time rito pulled this shit\r\n\r\n Nazzareno  - 3 days ago REPLY\r\n\r\nComment is below threshold (show)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nJust because Gragas isn't meta doesn't mean he isn't both viable and fun to play.
