If you did that you would have a lot more people playing the game as they would be able to play what they enjoy not what they feel like they have to play in order to win. And you would also allow the pro scene to be more diverse and allow more interesting matches that don't all play out in a very similar manner. Different heroes bring different aspects and play styles to the game. The more that you are able to capitalise on that, the more people will watch and the more ad revenue you will get as a result.\r\n\r\nAt least that way you might be able to get away with a chance like this WITHOUT pissing off half of the community that has been loyal to your game as a result.","replies":[{"poster":"Frommo","date":"2017-07-01T04:23:40.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"RP refund is what you should be asking for, making the new rune system free is compensation enough for every bit of ip spent, so why the fuck are you saying it is unfair with ip.
