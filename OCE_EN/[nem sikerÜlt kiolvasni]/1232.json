That's a fact.\r\n\r\nLast season all we had was random pick order so you had a 20% chance of getting your role. You've now got an 80% or greater chance to get your primary role for every role except mid, which sits at just over 70%.\r\n\r\nAutofill its designed to kick in when the matchmaking pool is just not large enough to get a game in a reasonable time. This was implemented because both the data and community feedback indicated that queue times were a major pain point for some players. You're still not likely to be autofilled unless you're playing at extreme high or low elo or if you're queuing up at off peak times of the day.\r\n\r\nSome players want their role more often, some players want shorter queues instead. Your feedback is hella important, and any feature implemented is going to do its best to meet one preference without sacrificing too much of the other.\r\n\r\nAll prior seasons we sacrificed role selection (it wasn't a thing) and queue times/matchmaking were much easier to balance. Now that role selection is a thing, its priority must be balanced with the other two aspects (queue time/matchmaking).\r\n\r\nI get why role selection hurts more to lose, it's the one thing that you now have primary control over.\r\nRegrettably, short queue times with perfect role selection and perfect matchmaking can't be a reasonable expectation so the system is designed to meet all three the best it can. We'll continue to make adjustments and share progress as we've done in posts like these.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-21T04:31:40.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't speak for everyone, but I for one don't care about emblems, I care more for having matchmaking fair for everyone, including those who mainly solo.
