Also the W change is a bit interesting and i am fine to go and test it out that is if he was not currently in a pick/ban sort of state.  It just feels like not garen has shifted for a tanky option top lane to more of a bot lane pick to counter champs that need to win their lane.  He was also the champion that I learned top lane with and would at least once a patch go back to and make sure i still know the basic top lane mechanics and am able to have a good champion to practice and improve them with and feel like that has been taken away from him.  His e stacking conq. is fine but with close to 20 per cast it feels like it is the only viable option right now.  Running him with Grasp and Phase Rush work fine for basically every match-up in the game and he was fine in the top lane without any need to take conq. like the other juggernauts.  His health regen on his passive post lvl 11 also feels quite week.  While the amount of health regen'ed scales per level now having it kick in after a few seconds out of combat about when a warmogs would helped him either get some health back after being chuncked in a team fight or get some health back after full pushing side lanes or taking towers then rotating to the team to help with an objective or a team fight that is about to happen somewhere else on the map.","replies":[]}]}
