You put points in it because you were already tanky and wanted to be tankier. \r\n\r\nThe other nerf that is bs in this patch is the Farsight Alteration. This is the only item in the game besides Sightstone and its relatives that can give regular vision that isn't even consistent. As soon as an enemy finds it, poof gone. The vision game is seriously the one thing that I am hating Riot for. This one thing is the first to actually piss me off. Now it feels as if they are seriously trying to make it the support's job to ward and only their job because of the distinct lack of warding that is available.\r\n\r\nHonestly, 5 fucking pinks isn't giving vision of shit, especially since they are probably being used as a gank counter-measure rather than for actual vision of a critical location. And as soon as they lose a tower that isn't bot lane, then boom all hope for vision is gone because there are simply not enough wards now. The warding totem is shit because it gives vision for about a minute with a two and a half minute cooldown. And now Farsight radius nerf is literally a poke in the eye. \r\n\r\nJust please Riot, revert all these vision changes because seriously you can't see shit anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wizfoz","date":"2015-12-09T07:11:53.465+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GG Riot should go back to year 8\r\n\"...outplays **their** known for.\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"p3rp","date":"2015-12-09T02:38:26.639+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"thank fuck you sorted out that quinn blind being so strong...\r\nI have a much greater preference for real blinds than \"psuedo\".
