Besides tft, we have been starved of an actual \"rotating\" gamemode since Nexus blitz or a little URF after the mishap. \r\n\r\nI would really love to catch wind of a new mode in development or the team has been working hard to bring back some of the more popular classics (Nexus blitz, all for one or even a new mode like Odyssey or star guardian event).\r\n\r\nAs a player who has played for at least 4 years, while constant missions and skins keep the ball rolling, the game has been lacking the WOW factor from actual events.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I feel League needs more actual events (rotating modes, Odyssey etc..) and frequency of the new skins + buy pass.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading :)","replies":[]}]}
