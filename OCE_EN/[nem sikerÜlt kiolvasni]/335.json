Top laners are able to utilize the attack speed and cool down reduction much more efficiently rather than crit chance,which definitely benefit attack speed oriented bruisers, such as irelia, jax and illaoi to the point of being competitively viable. Jax was never able to utilize the crit chance efficiently and the increases in attack speed and cool down allow for more empowered strikes, leaps, more counter-strike up time and for more grand master's might empowered strikes. Irelia also could not effectively use the crit chance and the changes to attack speed and cool down once again benefit Irelia in a similar fashion, by allowing for hiten strike empowered auto attacks, with higher hiten style up time, more cc to lock down carries from equilibrium strike and slightly more sustain with the decrease in cool down of transcendent blades. Illaoi has always been a sleeper top laner with hidden potential but never utilized in competitive play, but with the recent buffs to Illaoi's kit and better optimization of trinity force, she may see competitive play. The changes to Illaoi increases the amount of sustain and damage output within team fights, by increasing the amount of harsh lessons she can output. an increase in attack speed also allows for a faster attack animation, allowing her to more efficiently utilize grasp of the undying within team fights. Another sleeper champion, which may not be competitively viable but definitely benefits from the changes to Tri-force, is a personal favorite, Urgot. Urgot was unable to utilize the crit chance within the zeal, however, with the new Tri-force, Urgot has a more favorable build path and final stats, which allow him to free up item slots that would have been spent on cool down reduction and increases over all damage output.{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{champion:6}} ","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-06-17T05:25:48.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh god not the Urgot!

Neither of the champions really needed or made any real use from the critical strike from the old version as their primary damage both comes from abilities (Irelia's W, Jax's Ulti Passive). However the both benefit much more from the CDR and Attackspeed allowing them to put out more of their enhanced auto attack and it allows Irelia to put out more Q's E's and Use her ult more often from an earlier point in the game (She does often end up with high CDR anyway this allows it to occur much earlier in the game) and for Jax it allows him to have his counter strike up more often and his Q and W more often also, vastly increasing the damage output he has over the duration of a team fight. To Summarise why i think it Makes Jax and Irelia much stronger, It Allows Jax to pump out abilities more often and it allows Irelia to have her same impact on a game but from a significantly earlier stage in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-06-11T14:01:20.605+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jax is back. With the higher AS and 10% more CDR, it gives him more versatility. Q goes on a 3.6sec CD and E on <5sec. The AS buff on Trinity Force also works great with the buff to Jax's passive this patch too. If ADC's felt useless last patch, it's only going to get worse.

Ponies don't need to crit, and having the extra CDR early on can only be a good thing.

Irelia having an early power spike with triforce with the added attack speed and cooldown reduction just makes her a strong duelist while also having great sustain in lane with decent split pushing power, with the added bonus of rift herald, she is just simply a menace to deal with. Even if Irelia is ahead she can snowball out of control and force objectives much earlier as well as being a  dangerous threat to carries. With her being played more and the changes to Tri this pushes Maokai out of the number one contested pick. With the popular pick of Irelia we may even see a resurgence of Olaf or other champions back to the top lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucetheman","date":"2016-06-14T23:32:29.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TSM IS NOT THER???\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"starbreeze","date":"2016-06-12T05:10:19.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Change to Trinity Force from critical chance to cool down reduction is really beneficial on some champions like fizz but a nerf for others like yasuo. Fizz never really strongly benefited from the crit so having the extra cool down reduction really makes it a better pick than ice-born gauntlet at the moment. The attack speed is also more consistent so this definitely helps his damage and it just makes him deal more damage in general. I also think it could see some light on kayle, maybe not the best buy but it is a decent item in my opinion with the phage speed boost. This also may give variation to the standard nasus builds of iceborn and spirit visage for 40% cdr, its in a much better place though than before as zeal was too costly to build early and not worth the investment. it really benefits mostly on the bruisers and tanks but it definitely wouldn't be a first item rush.","replies":[{"poster":"EShadeSlayer","date":"2016-06-12T12:39:35.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mate, still not as helpful as lichbane fizz. qw and e away and the adc is under half health. rinse repeat. dont even need ult","replies":[{"poster":"starbreeze","date":"2016-06-14T10:31:30.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was mainly talking about tank fizz, ap fizz isn't really in the meta at the moment but tank fizz is really prevalent up top and even in the jungle.
