Secondly it is actually a really good idea, if you get autofilled into say support instead of the usual mid lane, you wont lose anywhere near as much LP as you used to. And also if you win your mains rank still gets LP. This could be the year where ranked is actually playable and you wont be paired with someone who is good at top but gets filled adc and feeds. Because their adc rank will be lower. \r\n\r\nJust see what it's like, you might like the changes. I think its an excellent idea and to be honest I dont think you've read into it very well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YoBuggered","date":"2019-01-25T06:14:40.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue i have with positional ranks is that, if you're really trying to rank up in a certain role and you keep getting auto-filled or your secondary role... it would prevent you from ranking up in the role you wanted.","replies":[{"poster":"NZL","date":"2019-01-26T05:33:51.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's unlikely you will get autofilled or secondary that much though, especially because of autofill protection. So you still get to play your position a decent amount, and I don't see how this is worse than before - it's objectively better than what we had for maining a role (sure it's not perfect but a lot better) which was the goal of these changes. Also in off roles you get some MMR for your main role anyway so it's not wasted. Before you used to get hit with a huge MMR tax every time you got your off role, now it's a lot less and you can still get loads when you actually play the role.\r\n\r\nAs a cynical veteran silver player I am actually quite positive for these changes, I hated the idea of forced flex q and other big changes but this one seems like a good idea for once.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Banana I","date":"2019-01-19T10:22:12.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys, is placements based off lp/rank or MMR?","replies":[{"poster":"Arrowhead","date":"2019-01-24T23:02:54.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so far, everyone who I have seen play their placements, including me, have been put 1 rank down to start off of their first placements game, for example: if you're gold 4 you would start out at silver 4 in placements and work up from there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2Q3WREQAEwtZQAey","date":"2019-01-19T12:35:19.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"both","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MaximumWifeSteal","date":"2019-01-24T18:48:52.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please start banning new champions from ranked for like 2 weeks on release so you can still get normal games without have to permaban new champs","replies":[]}]}
