I have, far too many times.\r\n\r\nThe long-range champions will do literally nothing with these changes, and the short-range champions will be *more* overwhelming, particularly the tanks, they were bullshit beforehand, now it's beyond idiotic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jeöngmin","date":"2019-04-03T09:23:13.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bring back Urf please!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"defpony","date":"2019-04-03T05:28:06.493+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AR(-10)AM\r\n\r\nNot liking the bans.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SurrealBeast","date":"2019-04-07T16:27:01.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you think they should bring in reporting to the next level as the do in other games like ranks games to ARAMS .. getting sick of people who afk etc  and you  report and report but nothing done about it in ARAM games ..its time to upskill the reporting make it better  ","replies":[]},{"poster":"DocDooom","date":"2019-04-03T13:18:38.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont like the bans.
