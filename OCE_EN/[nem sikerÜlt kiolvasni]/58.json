As I am not a computer programmer and have no idea what running a server entails(as I am sure a large number of players aren't) is there a set reason why having them up the entire time during the weekend would negatively affect the system?\nDoes it cost more to keep these game modes open? \nDoes it put too much strain on the system? \nI am assuming that it is not because you need people to monitor the system as it is running until 3 am in the morning. \nThe money thing doesn't make much sense in that there are already 2 round the clock available maps with a total of 3 modes (normal blind, ranked and ARAM) as well as all the custom stuff.\nIf the issue is that you need a window to edit any problems that arise like bugs or glitches why not run the game mode for a period of time on the Friday and then make it 100% available to be played during the Saturday and Sunday. \nDue to our location as the first server to reach the weekend is our server kinda being used as a bug checker for the other servers? \nI believe the time allocation is not for preventing of enjoyment but for a particular reason, but unless that reason is explained the people complaining will be backed up rather than ignored or told to go read the article they are commenting on.\n\nAlso as I am sure you are aware there is going to be a LOT of unhappy players if the time limit thingy happens for URF\n\nThank you for your time, I look forward to an answer.","replies":[{"poster":"Blizzard9789","date":"2016-04-09T12:23:20.739+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly sure that they do it because weekends are generally the peak times for game activity because most people are free during then.
