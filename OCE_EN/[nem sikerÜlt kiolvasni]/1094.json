E.g Blitzcrank is unlikely to secure first blood (obviously) but he is instrumental in achieving it. The amount of times a Blitzcrank support jungle invade results in first blood is phenomenal. With some champions (I'm looking at supports), it would be more interesting to run the regression on first blood secured by the team with the support champion picked. This way we'd find out how often support x results in the team getting first blood rather than the (obviously low and not very useful info) of support x securing first blood themselves","replies":[{"poster":"Tameru","date":"2017-04-01T11:40:06.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a support main, I'd like to see how much chance x support has of getting their adc first kill (blitz would be low, high chance of the blitz getting the first kill).
