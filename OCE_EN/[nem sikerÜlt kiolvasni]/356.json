Leona/Graves was hard when Ashe could poke with W, now that she can't use it past a tank/minion wave...\r\n\r\nYou don't seem to understand how her new passive and Q will work. She will no longer have a random critical strike chance, instead all of her basic attacks against targets marked by her passive will be classed as critical strikes that deal damage equal to 110% + (Critical Chance x (100 + Critical Damage Bonus) / 100) and with just an IE and PD which gives 55% critical chance will come out to 193%. So that's 7% lower than the normal base critical damage which again will be applied to **all** of her basic attacks on targets that have her passive, and if you build more critical chance to get 100% cap this damage increases to at least 260% (50% IE bonus damage) up until 305.51% if you have all critical damage runes (maximum 95.51% damage with all runes + IE).\r\n\r\nThen there is also her Q which with 5 focus stacks will transform her basic attacks to fire 5 arrows at once dealing 27% AD each at max rank, and her passive damage bonus is applied to each individual arrow (unless the target is somehow immune to her passive slow) which with just IE and PD results in 260.55% damage and at 100% critical chance you are looking at 351% (up to 412.44% with all critical damage runes). Her Q lasts for 4 seconds and at max rank gives 40% attack speed, with just Grieves + PD + masteries that's 1.8 attack speed at level 13 and 1.9 at 18 easily allowing for 7 attacks during the 4 seconds Flurry. \r\n\r\nThat Vayne has more to worry about from being wiped out from existence by the new Ashe being able to get 7 guaranteed hits of at least 260.55% than the current one who can only get a 1 guaranteed 250% hit with only a chance of more happening randomly with zero guarantee they will and even if they build 100% critical for that guarantee they will only do 250% damage while the new Ashe would be doing at least 351%. And I'm not just doing some theory number crunching here, I have actually tested her on PBE so I know how she works and how my numbers line up against my experiences playing her.\r\n\r\nThe lack of those potential 200% critical strikes and changes to W might make her early game a bit weaker, which you are really over-dramatising and with the permanent free slow on the passive and the guaranteed extra damage against afflicted targets is debatable if it even will be weaker, it simply means at worst you need to think a bit more about how/when/where you use your W and when to engage or back off from a possible fight.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lunaci","date":"2015-04-29T00:22:15.151+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Maybe {{champion:22}} will have more mana now her frost shot is her passive.

This gives her higher consistent damage throughout a fight than the normal random critical strikes give.\r\n\r\nSecondly her 5-stack Q changes her attacks for 4 seconds to fire 5 arrows at once which at max rank will deal 29% AD each (135% total), and each individual arrow applies the passive bonus damage on its own which with the IE + PD mentioned above will increase their damage 55.97% each and 252.88% or 279.85% in total (depending if the target already had Ashe's passive applied for the first shot or not). Her Q also increases her attack speed by 60% at max rank, with just PD + Grieves + masteries that's 1.75686/1.867404/2.02664 attack speed at levels 9/13/18. This gives the potential for at most 7-8 attacks if lucky, easily at least 5-6, with guaranteed 252.88%/279.85% damage each compared to the 5-8 random chances for normal critical strikes to happen at 250% damage with the same attack speed.\r\n\r\nSo really it isn't taking away from her damage, her burst has just been shifted out from her normal attacks into her skills while her normal attacks have been empowered to compensate for their lack of burst.

There are so many ways you can pick Ashe out of existence.\r\n\r\nAshe is only a real problem when they're last pick and you have a team without a single gap closer or ranged hard CC but that's on your team for creating an environment where Ashe can do her thing.

Ashe has soft CC and for most of the game she has pretty low burst, so she can't instakill anyone, but she also can't stun and run. Once you start picking according to your team comp rather than what you're individually comfortable with then Ashe is a lot less scary.\r\n\r\nDoes your team have hard CC? If no, pick someone with that. Does your team have a gap closer? If no and you're AD, pick Cait, Kalista, Graves, Ezreal, someone who can ignore soft CC. If jungler, Jarvan, Zac, Lee Sin, Malphite (his gap closer is also hard cc and on a low enough CD that you can use it reasonably reliable, his Q is soft CC as well and a decent poke so it's still good against Ashe), Sej, Amumu, etc. Is your team all AD and you're jungler? Karthus or Fid. Pick according to what your team needs rather than what you like, and you will win a lot more games. Maybe, trolls and AFK's will still make you cry.

Graves/Leona crushes her, any CC crushes her, any burst crushes her. The only people she was OP against were people she could kite, like Varus, and if you picked Varus into Vlad then you kind of deserved to get wasted.\r\n\r\nAlthough even then Varus could auto/auto/auto/ability and really chunk Ashe for most of the game, while Q poking from further range than Ashe could, the balance only changed mid-late game when Ashe really got going but if it was a diving/ganking jungler then she was screwed anyway. Any jungler who had a gap closing ability crushed her, Lee Sin, Nocturne, etc, because the slows just didn't matter.\r\n\r\nSame as now. She'll be powerful when it's just her and her opponent, if her opponent is a low mobility champion. Against a high mobility champion (Graves, Kalista, Ezreal, etc) or CC/divy support (Leona, Alistair, Sona, etc), she's going to get wasted. She can't even W poke through minions or past tanks, and only one arrow is going to hit opponents which means no W burst/poke.\r\n\r\nShe's still going to be hard mode in good matchups, against bad matchups it's going to become impossible. Unless that passive damage is just off the wall but that makes her unreliable as it'll be a prime target to get nerfed if the perception is from opponents that it's too powerful.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bubberboy","date":"2015-04-29T13:37:50.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg {{champion:22}} +{{champion:117}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"senpaiUwotm8ski","date":"2015-04-29T09:43:03.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I CAN FINALLY LEASH WITH ASHE!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-04-29T09:40:18.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that q though","replies":[]},{"poster":"II The Doctor II","date":"2015-04-29T09:28:54.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make her Ult scale with AD.
