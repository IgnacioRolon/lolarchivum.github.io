Yi has been OP since his changes and has been abused in challenger with the crit build/shojin. Its easy to judge changes when you have no idea whats happening in the game. Rammus was also in the same spot as amumu in low elo. They didnt nerf yi to the ground nor rammmus nor amumu, your overreaction isnt needed.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-05-31T16:34:59.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Low elo. Not an excuse. It's not my fault riot employees are hard stuck silver players.\n2. Yi isn't op. Low elo players just dont know what to do. Yes no cast time on q is very strong but before you could disjoint from Q so its already a tradeoff. Combine that with conq rage nerf crit yi is too volatile and risky and easily countered.\n3. Again you're complaining about low elo. If you had any idea how much 10% ad and 8% attack speed does to yi you'd know these nerfs hurt him too hard early game to be a viable pick in games that aren't hard stuck silver to iron mmr.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2019-05-30T06:09:55.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-3% damage on Amumu after autoattacking or ulting.\r\n\"destroy\"ed his damage","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-05-31T15:56:27.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"-3% TRUE damage.
