After that it was the rotating gamemodes that was on every weekend and then just stopped, then there’s the rumours that URF will never return again due to “burnout” and now this. \r\n\r\nThis game has nothing to offer anymore apart from toxic, slow placed and boring Summomers Rift and Aram. Now I don’t personally care about the twisted tree line been removed but what about the people that do? Why can’t it remain in customs so people can play if they want? There’s games that came out many years ago that offer more gamemodes or maps in private/custom lobby’s. \r\n\r\nWhy doesn’t this company care about what the community wants? I know it’s kind of running gag that Riot doesn’t care but enough is enough!. There are countless forums on here, YouTube, Reddit, surrender@20 etc that has thousands of people BEGGING to have URF remain permanent or have the Crystal Scar back in customs so we can have fun away from the main game in peace but it gets ignored every single time, year after year. \r\n\r\nThis game has so much potential to be amazing but instead it remains stale. An example of something to add is the ability to toggle settings in custom games like starting gold, passive gold income per second (like the crystal scar) walk speed, disable minions in lanes etc etc and that way we can create our own hide and seek experiences since you guys refuse to add it back.
