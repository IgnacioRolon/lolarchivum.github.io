However the key thing to note, is that everytime Raydere plays in high pressure matches vs international opponents, he cracks under pressure. Is the solution to keep throwing him in these matches and hope he learns, or is it to perhaps give another ADC a chance to see if they can shine under pressure? I'm not at all surprised Raydere got the votes, due to the fact that this is a vote led by casuals who don't follow the scene and just follow the title summaries. If more people understood the pro scene, I think we would have scene k1ng picked to give him a chance and see if he would be able to turn up to an international event and actually perform.","replies":[{"poster":"NekLvl","date":"2015-10-15T01:37:13.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ikr ! the only knowledge they have of raydere is that hes no.1 and 3 in soloq but never watch him vs international opponents.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2015-10-08T11:56:45.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"pretty sure every member of chiefs got the most votes for their role, what is this bs","replies":[{"poster":"Squire Pug","date":"2015-10-09T12:17:40.487+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well except for Carbon, who beat Spookz handily....","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samska","date":"2015-10-09T11:47:46.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only 2 from each team can go.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NewTronix","date":"2015-10-08T08:06:56.683+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Screw Raydere fanboys, I agree he's a good player, but please give Ryoo some credit for being a god.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PiPiN88","date":"2015-10-07T11:13:12.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Chief's ftw! {{champion:12}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"kt Mata","date":"2015-10-08T07:06:24.396+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"how did chuchuz get chosen of claire, what claire did on ezreal was nothing short of godlike","replies":[{"poster":"NekLvl","date":"2015-10-15T01:42:29.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"godlike on any other champions? or just ezreal? lol no time for one trick ponies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"1Archangel1","date":"2015-10-08T08:32:14.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ChuChuz was a better player on too many other champions.
