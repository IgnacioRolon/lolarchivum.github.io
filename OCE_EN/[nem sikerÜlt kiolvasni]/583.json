Now it requires double the health difference that it used to, hence bruisers are now unable to fight tanks.\r\n\r\nFor champs that stack health such as Cho'Gath, yes you may still be able to purchase Lord Dominik's Regards just for him, as the health difference will reach near 2000, but as for the rest of their team it won't be there. But as for normal tanks who utilise all defensive stats including Armour and MR, when they sit at a ~1000 health difference they can't be countered. The item just isn't worth the poor stats it now offers, as you would now only reach half of the Giant Slayer damage as you used to.\r\n\r\nDoes Riot just want ADCs and Mids to counter tanks, and to leave top laner and jungler fighters in the dirt? Fighters are supposed to be able to contest tanks, especially in top and jungle where 1v1 skirmishes often happen. Maybe we just have to go glass cannon now in those roles. Or maybe Riot wants us to only buy Mortal Reminder, which is what it has always been, just now twofold and now requires tedious build-pathing. This was already a problem which pretty much removed the possibility of ever buying the item, which as of now is definite. These types of changes are what lead up to the meta, of tanks outright replacing bruisers because they do what bruisers do, only better with no counterplay whilst also being easy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BronzeGotBoosted","date":"2017-12-18T04:27:24.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmm \r\nCTRL+F'ing \r\nwhat does it mean?\r\nshow FPS?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wrench Me","date":"2017-12-15T04:28:22.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH","replies":[]},{"poster":"DeepFriedJoefish","date":"2017-12-15T02:00:24.536+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When they buff Bruisers\r\n{{sticker:fiora-cool}} ","replies":[]}]}
