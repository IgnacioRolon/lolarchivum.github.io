Her new visuals look awesome and very up to date now. I love her new swing when she stands, _does she have recall animations?_\r\nKit wise though, Although this may be considered quite a large buff to MF, I still wish it was enough to make her respected in ranked games and such. As much as I do love MF, **I don't believe this was enough to finally have her compete with the other  META ADC's that are stomping the game right now.** She still falls behind champs like {{champion:222}} , {{champion:15}} , {{champion:236}} etc. And wasn't she one of the last AD champions to have grievous wounds? sucks that it's removed. I'm no expert but key aspects of MF that should've been really looked into are things like how oddly her E synergizes with the rest of her kit, her passive just going to waste when hit by a minion (ruining her chances of becoming a split pusher), her weird magic scaling and the fact that her ulti just becoming completely useless late game. Fortune really needed that extra big 'oomf' damage and kit wise, to actually get her in the respected spotlight.\r\n**Overall I'm grateful she was noticed and I'm happy for the buffs but I just don't believe it was enough to get her to where she actually needs to be.** Who knows, I might be completely wrong and this change might just result in Sarah Fortune living up to her iconic Bounty Hunter title.","replies":[{"poster":"Gigashrubbz","date":"2015-07-07T23:59:17.251+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"A million times this.

Obvious examples of this are her E which you would not use in a 1v1 fight and having no time to bust her ulti in a 1v1 fight either since its a more team fight based ult and it's damage is just not that impressive as compared to her auto attacks that prove to be more useful in most cases.","replies":[{"poster":"FraggingBard","date":"2015-08-31T03:05:12.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been experimenting, it's entirely possible to turn MF into a hardcore duelist. Youmuu's, Trinity Force, Black Cleaver, decent crit for auto's and sheen procs go a long way towards focusing her damage. She can be built AS too (Wits, BotRK, etc) and AS builds seem to do a ton of damage to any and all comers.\r\n\r\nI've solo'd Vaynes, the biggest difficulty has been manevuering as if MF gets pinned to a wall then MF dies. Much like if Ashe ults Vayne then Vayne dies. But so long as I can avoid getting pinned MF can kill a Vayne. You just need to itemise for it.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side I'm finding MF to be one of the most versatile AD's I've ever played. About the only change I'd like to see is a little more base damage on her E (less AP scaling on it to balance) forcing people to take it seriously other than just using it to slow people down so I can ult them to death. Possibly also having double W stacks on her ult...

Her ult actually does scale with AD in a way; it applies impure shots magic damage which scales from AD.

And it can be killed by champions who have their own hard CC (Kalista with teammate, Vayne, etc), all the while your opponents (Ezreal again, Graves, Lucian, etc) are all firing their ults off on the move. Caitlyn isn't but her ult does a high amount of guaranteed damage against at least one opponent which they can't dodge out of.\r\n\r\nIt's not a very reliable ult which makes it annoying early/mid game and it doesn't scale well enough to be useful late game when you're seeing more teamfights which is when an ult like MF's is actually pretty useful. Being able to stand outside a teamfight and fire into it is so much better than having to get into AA range.\r\n\r\nExcept Lucian can also do that, and he can do it whilst moving. His ult is useful early game because of that, and it scales nicely so it's useful lategame too against hard hitting carries when getting into AA range at the start would hurt him.\r\n\r\nMF is nice but it's like playing Sejuani. You'll have fun but you'll spend the whole game knowing that you could have picked another champion which did the same thing as your champion can, it just does it a whole lot better.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-07-30T07:07:17.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sejuani is great tho.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"esnevip","date":"2015-07-07T18:57:34.048+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miss the laugh on her ultimate.","replies":[{"poster":"Escutcheon","date":"2015-07-08T06:02:18.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know right!

I enjoy playing her because of her strong early/mid game where she can 1v1 many other marksman, and contribute large amounts of AOE damage to teamfights. I think this visual/mini-ability update is good, but there a couple of things that I'd change.\r\n\r\n1.  **Keep grievous wounds:** GW was one of the abilities that set her apart from other adcs and it really synergised well with her lane-bully early game, lowering the power of enemy summoner heals and potions, as well as helping take down the likes of {{champion:36}} {{champion:50}} {{champion:8}} in the mid to late game.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  **Alter strut like you changed Garen's passive:** When Garen hits lvl 11, damage from jungle camps doesn't stop his passive heal. I'm proposing something similar for MF, where strut is not stopped by minion damage after lvl 11. This would give MF a helping hand in chasing down enemies, something I've always found difficult with MF. Many other adcs have dashes /slow/speed boosts to get away, and MF loses hers by running through a minion wave while in pursuit.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3.  **The ability to cast E (make it rain) while moving** Syndra can cast her q while moving, and while I know this is a core part of her kit, giving MF the same power on her E would be a great quality of life improvement to her kiting/chasing ability. \r\n\r\n\r\n4.  **Her ult and auto-attack visuals could be tweaked** I think her visual update looks brilliant, but when she auto attacks fast she looks like one of those inflatable tubes from a used car market-arms everywhere! In my opinion, her new ult looks... underpowered somehow. One of the reasons I love playing MF is how you are rewarded when you position correctly, line up and ruin enemies with a ridiculous stream of bullets. The new visuals looks slower, and have \"gaps\" between the bullet waves, which I'm personally not a fan of.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than that, the update looks really good! I'm glad you're keeping her voice the same, it definitely suits her.
