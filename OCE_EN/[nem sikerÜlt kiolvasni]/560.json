A nice and cool feature everyone could have would be to customize their own champ border when you enter into the loading screen.\r\nTo be able to do this gives everyone a sense of \"wow & that's cool\" feel.\r\nBut what this also can do (I think) is that it can potentially up peoples way of playing the game, as in a more positive attitude to the game and to see everyone else's borders on their loading screen and be like \"That's awesome\". It brings out that creativity in everyone and can make people feel a lot more better about themselves in and out of the game. \r\nThis could also motivate peoples minds to really tune into this game and just play heaps. (this is only what I think)\r\n\r\nBut not just people that play the game but also people who don't. People who see this can see this as a cool thing, and interactive feature which can possibly attract a lot more people and gamers particularly to just play this game.\r\n\r\nBut of course to customize a border for a specific champion this would obviously cost Influence points (IP) to get different types of designs and various little shapes and all.\r\n\r\nBut rare and cool looking features and designs could cost riot points (RP) and can also possibly be in the hextech crafting for randoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut then again this is what I think you guys can or could do. It has many benefits in my mind but you guys might have a fair bit of negatives about this but again I think this is a great idea and this can be awesome for others to do.\r\n\r\nLhuka.\r\n\r\nP.S - This could make money (COULD)\r\nJust putting that out there sorry others who hate this part of the comment.......","replies":[{"poster":"Evil Kermit","date":"2016-07-16T13:22:59.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fuck yes riot please do this i missed out on project border for zed by a single day, i was in perth ;-;\r\nbut yeah other than my personal gain this would be good fun if you didnt have time for a full game you can just make some borders. i also think its smart to pay ip to get a border on a certain champ, maybe half the amount the champ costs. this is probs better than one border for everything because it might get in the way of some splashes. also you can make it fit the theme. please make it more ip based though i dont want it to be pay to look cool, more of you spend your time making it to look cool, after all it would take ages. also with this another thing, make it so when you are creating them you can export the file and import it (gotta be a special file type though just for this) and yeah when creating it also allow symmetrical mode you you only have to do one side and the other mirrors it (optional)\r\nrito this took a long time to write, and i beg that you implement this as soon as you can it would be awesome :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"1point5Bro","date":"2016-07-16T09:41:12.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats actually a really slick idea ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ghost Toast","date":"2016-07-15T06:27:10.405+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you ever going to rework old skin such as gentleman cho gath?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flyedlice","date":"2016-07-18T15:41:29.845+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins Idea\r\n\r\nHow about for the amazing price and the amount of funds generated by Riot RP.  \r\n\r\nThat there's the option to NOT have updated skins forced on you, replacing the ones you liked.  \r\n\r\nI didn't appreciate at all, my armour of Taric's being altered! This skin, I bought is now shocking HOT PINK! That is not what I paid for when spent my RP for, ty Riot.\r\n\r\nYes I respect the TOS, the reality check here is no choice but to, its a bit authoriterain like it or lump it.\r\n\r\nI liken it to this random scenario, you buy a flash expensive car, you love it take it to a fancy hotel, with valet parking.  Afterwards when its time to pick up your favourite car.. \r\n\r\nThe car pool guy drives out a VW and tells you its exactly the same thing to the same value and  here's your car..now in improved shocking hot pink!(of the same value) and via the TOS basically, deal with it..\r\n\r\nSo please, Riot you change so many skins.  \r\nThe ones I bought, I liked. Precisely that's why I spent on them.. \r\nThen Riot change them to things I don't like.\r\nWhy am I going to buy more skins, only to have them changed ..
