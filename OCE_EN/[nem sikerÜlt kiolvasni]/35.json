Celerity needs needs a slight buff. Good job on nexus blitz 10/10. Sudden impact nerf is trash. Scorch should be reverted to help champions that struggle in lane ( solo q no jungler ). Aery good nerf. The tanks nerf are why.. Tanks aren't even played ( solo q ) needs to get reverted + buffed. Wukong nerf is good but needs a little more health, if he falls behind he's useless.
