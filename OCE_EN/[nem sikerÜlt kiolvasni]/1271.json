I think this mode could evolve into a \"PVE mode\" or \"Co-op Arcarde Mode\" for casual players who just want to have fun. For example, add 4 more maps to this one mode with each map having new enemies, and each map has a boss to beat. But that is just my opinion, take it or leave it. \r\n\r\nI don't agree with missions however. I think the player should not be forced to beat onslaught mode with classes that are not to their liking. It makes playing this mode a chore. Maybe beating Onslaught mode once should be reward enough.\r\n\r\nI am already too tired of the summoners rift. I don't like being under the pressure of the other players over the top standards. With a Co-op mode, I have more room to be experimental and I think other players are more forgiving of my mistakes compared to PVP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheyCallHimTeemo","date":"2017-09-23T01:30:04.764+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"This event was garbage thank god","replies":[]}]}
