I just want a refresher on what Lucian's Q looks like, I TOTALLY want to watch the rest of his abilities too.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are some features of the Beta Client that are neat, but as someone who changes their load-out or sometimes even what champion I'm playing is like playing {{champion:96}} without {{summoner:4}} to me when I have absolutely no way of knowing what team colour I'm on whilst in champ select in anything but ranked.\r\n\r\nWhy did they take away the tinted displays of \"Your Team\" and \"Enemy Team\"? That was such a simple and easy way of notifying players of what side of the map they're starting (and sometimes finishing) on.\r\n\r\nWhy am I not able to change both of my summoner spells at once and instead have to go through the idiotic song and dance twice?\r\n\r\nWhy on the legacy client can I instantly change my runes and masteries several times in the time it takes for once mastery page change to go through on the beta client?\r\n\r\nWhy does the friend!chat look like facebook? It's like Riot is trying way too hard to be cool and hip like your dad. Just give me Yellow and Blue text on names, I don't care what order, then a little : and then white text for one persons messages and ever so slightly grayed for the other persons. Don't need any of this stupid background crap or sparkly jingles whenever you get a message.\r\n\r\nI see no reason at all why we should be forced to use this pathetically limiting \"upgrade\" and for one hope I'm not one of the unlucky few \"small group of randomly-selected players\" in Phase 1 so that I can remain enjoying the good old days where I know what I'm going to get when I click ANY button and that's ALL I get.\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"ummyum","date":"2017-02-24T03:13:41.449+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"To all the positive feedback, I can tell you that I regret ever signing up for the new client. I've personally tested custom-built pcs with a base of EVGA 1060ftw+ (vr enabled,pre-overclocked, benchmark easily exceeds most game, running on 40 down - 30 up speed, 22ms,350-450fps 144hz asus monitor, I know you won't be able to read that much Ultra rip), but it cannot handle the spike that comes from champion select switches.  Likewise a spare pc, AMD MSI counterpart with a base of 150-170fps. These 2 pcs can handle any game on the market currently even sc2 without melting the gpu. The client and games will indefinitely lag or disconnect sporadically. The client itself isn't anything special though, it is a downgrade. Judging from the years I've played both Blizzard games and League, it's going to get worse and worse since 2014. As to why that is, you guys can do your own research should you choose to. Do not get hooked in by their \"selling point\", do your own research and testing. Even if you personally ask a GM, the answer would be the same. Laptop or PC, the answer is still the same. If I could turn back time and go back to the old client, I'd happily take that chance.","replies":[{"poster":"RisingSwell","date":"2017-02-28T22:28:25.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well if your wall of text isnt bs and you genuinely do know what your on about, any idea why its going ham on your GPUs and my combo of weak 1gb AMD laptop gpu + integrated isn't overheating or even being pushed?
