The nerf damage is negligible at best and mana regen runes with meditation mastery fix most of the mana sustain issue. Even if it is going to make him go oom you can very easily time it with a wave push and recall timing. Maxing e is still going to be really obnoxious.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"grimnear","date":"2017-05-19T02:28:34.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please can we have All for One, Urf, ARSR or summoners rift hexakill we have had ascension and poro king back to back for ages!!!! why do we have the same que to weeks in a  row?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"FUKWORLD6KILL","date":"2017-05-17T01:55:57.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been 4 patches now and still there is no fix for the movement prediction bug :):):):):)","replies":[]},{"poster":"jclar371","date":"2017-05-16T21:44:25.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Aww come on im pretty sure that most people want URF and ascension was here not long ago","replies":[]},{"poster":"DankEnthusiast","date":"2017-05-19T11:42:29.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How about URF?
