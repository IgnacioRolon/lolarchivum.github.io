However since blue/gromp and red/raptors can be taken together, and scuttle gives resources when killed, it's not that hard for me, as a jungler to balance between objectives, farming, vision and ganking. Drake and herald can be easily soloed as well so while I do wish for a buff, I think that the current meta is not hell for junglers per se.\r\n","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Âhri","date":"2020-01-07T20:09:23.505+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:103}} Fix client instead of releasing champions and stat changing cause how are players going to be able to play if your client is shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-08T01:47:40.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll mention first that those are entirely different teams. \n\nRegardless, as far as I'm aware the major issues have been resolved.

When he is played he can easily 1v3 with any combination of weapons and requires no thought or strategy to do so. He has an overloaded kit with ridiculous numbers that gives him the edge over any other adc. His passive free stats allows him to stay in lane longer and dominate while other adc champions need to recall and shop for items to close the stat difference. The only way to play against an aphelios is to to get your jungler to camp bot and hope you can somehow kill him repeatedly and end the game early enough that he doesnt get back into the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RBree2","date":"2020-01-11T00:20:40.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure where else to put this, but: Riot what the HELL were you thinking in making it MANDATORY for players to play RANKED games in quests? 90+% of all prior quests were obtainable in PvE, and of the less than 10% which did require PvP, they could be done in Normals. Requiring we play in an environment many people such as myself deliberately avoid, for the sake of completing a quest? Very very very upsetting, because I have to choose between subjecting myself to that environment I deliberately avoid, or missing out on 100% completion for the questline.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A short way","date":"2020-01-08T06:25:15.276+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fix the client please.

As I understand it, it's largely to let the patch itself settle and ensure there aren't any major issues before also throwing a new champion into the mix.\n\nAs for the skins, unsure why the Sylas one is so early, I would imagine it's to get people excited about him once the season starts now that he's had some pretty heavy QoL tweaks. \n\nAs for the others, the Night and Dawn event doesn't end until the 14th, and presumably, there will be a Mecha Kingdoms event to go with the new releases, so they can't overlap. Given that Sett is \"The Boss\", I imagine him releasing a day earlier is a nod to his lore, possibly combined with some other practical reason that eludes me.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lorddan87","date":"2020-01-08T11:11:54.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"happy that your giving us some hp regen back on support items good work riot ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dont Kill Me plc","date":"2020-01-14T23:38:22.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLEASE BUFF AATROX OR FIX HIS PASSIVE PLEASE!
