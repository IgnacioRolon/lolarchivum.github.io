This is just ridiculous. \r\n\r\nHow about allowing us to edit settings for custom games such as gold income per second, walk speed, disable minions, disable parts of the map etc etc \r\nPlaying on summoners rift is getting really boring and not been able to change anything that isn’t the practise tool just seems strange.
