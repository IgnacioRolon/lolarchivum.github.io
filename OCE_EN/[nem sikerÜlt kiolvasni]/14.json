No ty.  Snowball already bridged the gap for tanks.  If they don't play bad they win after about 15 minutes, that was the tradeoff.

Looking at you kaisa and nidalee. \r\n\r\nI'll admit I may be biased towards Sona, but why does she need a 25% healing reduction, on top of the -50% healing to allies. That's not even counting for increased damage taken and reduced damage dealt.
