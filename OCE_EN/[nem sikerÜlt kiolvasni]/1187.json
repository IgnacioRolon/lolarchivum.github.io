Why don't they just give us urf instead? it costs them literaly nothing as they haven't even tested it. why give us a crappier version rather than the most requested game mode. instead of being 'grateful' think about what it is they have done that you are trying to be 'grateful' for. Also don't come out attacking people and implying that they are whining without thinking the point through. Making the point that people like urf not arurf is highly valid so why get on people's case about it?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"juzzykuzzy","date":"2018-05-27T08:29:51.519+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"When does arurf exactly finish?
