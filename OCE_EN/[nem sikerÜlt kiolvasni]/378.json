I live in a tiny NSW town in the middle of nowhere but we have a TAFE and because there is LITERALLY nothing to do here most of us play games (and league).

I used to go to the TAFE here but for my degree I now do my course Distance Education through the TAFE in the city because Graphic Design is not available here. I have been wanting to run tournaments or an internet cafe or something here for a while now to give the people something to do. My first question is who would I talk to in Riot for help with setting up something regular for us to do. Ok now the hard one, can I start a LoL-Club for two or more schools? Seeing as not a lot is on offer here a lot of us have gone to Distance ED or moved but we still all want to compete together and have other people join in as well.
