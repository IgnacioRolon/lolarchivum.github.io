Only those final 3 games count for the mission.\n\nAt any rate, there are a few things you can try:\n- Sometimes it just takes time to update, and waiting can be enough. \n- You can try a different browser, some people seem to have better luck with different browsers.\n- You can try a different viewing mode. Try putting it in fullscreen and see if that helps (obvs having multiple monitors is a plus here).\n\nFailing all that, submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey might be able to give you some other tip to get it to register, or may be able to manually update it. I don't know how this stuff works on their end, but they can likely at least point you in the right direction.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Kizza","date":"2019-04-06T15:26:38.795+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are no VODS available for OPL, is there any way to watch the vods to gain the rewards for oce?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-08T09:39:42.281+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're up now :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"naian616","date":"2019-04-06T00:26:26.808+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"wheres the lck icon?","replies":[]},{"poster":"WhyM3","date":"2019-04-08T04:17:31.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but, you need the VODs to be there to watch if you missed it ....
