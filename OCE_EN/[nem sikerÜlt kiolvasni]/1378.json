Super expensive skins, prestige points (to a degree), emotes, passes, chromas, you name it. But this is just too dumb. Stats. Goddamn stats are now being peddled as some sort of premium feature, as if every other game out there doesn't just track these for you without you having to fork out cash for them. This is a total joke, and whoever is behind this stupid idea needs to take a step back and realise that not everything needs a real life cash value attached. \r\n\r\nWhy not make it BE? Most players who would be buying Eternals already have every champion and a boatload of BE and nothing to spend it on. If you're really designing this as some sort of 'achievement' system for certain champions, why not make it an ACTUAL ACHIEVEMENT to get, instead of this backwards, EA style 'pride and accomplishment' payment method. It's a really underhanded way at making more cash with no effort put in. \r\n\r\nWhat does a designer actually have to do to implement a new Eternal set into the game? Change a few numbers? Add a few new buttons? That requires like 2 coders at maximum and requires little to no upkeep at all. This should be at most a BE cost feature, and should probably just be free for everyone once they reach a certain mastery level on a champion. I get that Riot needs to make money, but there are more than enough cash sponge features already in LoL without whole new systems coming in to drain players wallets.\r\n\r\nThis is a disturbing trend that Riot is falling down. NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO COST MONEY. Instead of thinking about how amazing someone's stats are in game, I will instead be thinking about how dumb that player is for dropping REAL LIFE MONEY to TRACK RANDOM STATS ON A CHAMPION. Like seriously. This just proves that Riot cares little about player experience and is solely focused on separating every player from as much of their money as they can get away with. I hope Riot understands this at some point, but I severely doubt it.

I understand businesses obviously need to pay their employees etc, but the selling of achievements seems to go against a general policy of playing to earn your status. \r\n\r\nIf you really want to keep the option to purchase them, I would still be far happier with Riot as a company if you allowed the players to earn them through their skilled gameplay. Perhaps gating them behind a mastery 7 of a champion, or even using blue essense or champion shards to pay for them instead? There are many options here that wouldn't affect the bottom line whatsoever. In fact, the simple introduction of a merit-based earning system I feel would keep players coming back for more regardless. \r\n\r\nI'd also add that I'm speaking as a person who has probably spent over $200 on skins.
