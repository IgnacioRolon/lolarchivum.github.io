I have a pretty dank mic setup and am creating a database for champions, items, timers, literally everything in the game. I plan to begin casting when I feel confident enough in my knowledge of the game (i've only been playing since kindred came out) . anyways I was wondering if you all could give some advice on everything and anything, how does one get into the industry of casting? so far ive found that you just have to work your way up from nothing and once you get good enough and have a substantial viewership someone will notice you. am I right?\r\n\r\nMany thanks, \r\ntoested\r\n\r\n(p.s. spawn you are my idol <3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SIN Raven","date":"2017-02-24T04:30:46.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is the best OCS toplaner and why is SNA Raven","replies":[]},{"poster":"CAZTAMAN","date":"2017-02-24T04:03:51.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you play league of legends successfully?","replies":[]}]}
