I think Raydere's time has come and gone. I see a lot of very good ADC's tearing apart teams and I don't think Raydere is really on the same level. That being said, it will be interesting to see how the new ADC fits into the CHF's as a team. Hope everything works out and they win finals! ;) ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T11:17:10.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the legatree will have something to say about this.","replies":[]}]}
