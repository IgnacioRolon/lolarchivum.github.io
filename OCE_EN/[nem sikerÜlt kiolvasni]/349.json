In just the past month or two, we saw an incredible amount of completely useless and worthless content brought into the game. Let me just break down all of the points which have been brought up already in the comments before.\r\n\r\n1. The missions, which were promised to be meaningful goals for the players to work towards, from the moment they were introduced and still are just another instrument for making more cash off the new skins Riot keeps pumping out. There has not been a single instance in which this new, wonderful system has been used for any purpose aside from promotion of new skins. VS event, Omega Squad, Arcade and now Star Guardian. All of these came as specific events, the sole purpose of which was to promote the new skins and encourage people to buy them. And that's not mentioning the fact that the majority of the rewards consist of completely worthless summoner icons, aside from the larger event bonuses (have to give credit on that). As Riot promised in one of their posts prior to introduction of missions: \"Our goal with Missions is to deepen all sorts of aspects of the game you already enjoy.\", but instead of providing consistent rewards to players who invest more time in the game then others, instead in most cases presented with a meaningless trinket that does nothing gameplay-wise.\r\n\r\n2. The refund for the runes, or more so the absolute lack of it. I'm not going to reiterate the whole outrage that the announcement caused and for good reasons. For the older players, who've wasted a great deal of their IP to assemble rune pages, to receive a 15% refund for all that time and currency wasted is like a slap in the face. But to show at least one example, in the preview for the new blue essence store, the legacy Urfwick skin cost 150000 blue essence. That is the double of what an average veteran player would receive as a part of that change. If anoyone would like to educate themselves on the math behind the conversion, and just how much shit Riot deservingly received on the matter, check out these two posts: http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/09/riot-pls-leveling-ip-and-rewards/  http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/\r\n\r\n3.The stupidity of the just released Star Guardian skins. This is just an opinion, but i'm sure as hell some people out there would agree that these skins are bleak rip-offs of the cliche \"magical girls\" type anime, that have no reason to exist in the context of League. What sucks even more, however, is the fact that the event missions in this case are worse than all the previous by a huge margin. I logged in one day into the game, was invited for this new game mode that just got released, in a premade 5 man group, and not knowing about any of the missions existing yet. I picked a champion that I wanted to play, only to immediately have the entire team scream at me and promptly forfeit the game. All because of one retarded mission that requires you to play a specific composition of champions in a premade game to complete. So, does this seem like something after which you would even consider playing that game mode and trying to accomplish the missions? To me it does not.\r\n\r\n4. Emotes. Just imagine a concept like this in a game which is so notoriously toxic and unforgiving. I cannot even begin to focus on one problematic aspect of this, because there are numerous. One, gameplay-wise it is a completely useless addition that only incentifises bming and trying to intentionally tilt the enemy team. Two, this completely ruins the more or less serious nature of the matches and instead devolves a game of strategy and quick reflexes into a circus, where showing off is more important than playing well. Three, if Riot was going to make a completely garbage system that practically no self-respecting player would use, they could as well make it IP-worthy, since as they previously complained, there is nothing to waste it on for some people. Instead, they are trying to salvage even more money from an idea that nobody asked for, nobody wanted implemented, and is worth 0 for gameplay purposes. Oh, and for the community response to this \"awesome\" idea, can be found here: http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/08/dev-introducing-emotes/\r\n\r\nJust to sum it up, I have to say that Riot has been screwing up in their priorities and relation with community more and more over the past weeks. I always thought that the developers of League, unlike many others, cared about the quality of the game and their community much more than most other game companies. But not, I really begin to question it. I don't want to lose faith in a game I enjoy this much, but it's difficult not to after all this.\r\n{{summoner:21}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Monoki","date":"2017-09-14T10:41:31.081+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":2,"body":"Just to poke at you comment about the SG, I appreciate your opinion however it is nice to have something that the female players can enjoy in the game you know?
