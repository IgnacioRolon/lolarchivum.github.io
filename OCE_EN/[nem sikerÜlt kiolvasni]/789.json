By chance, I queued up for a game and was placed in a group that has now become the best group of friends I could ever ask for. I became close with all of them over the course of a year before my partner's best friend noticed the mutual, unspoken crush between me and my partner. He sort of forced us into a skype call, spilled the beans for us, and left us to a bit of awkwardness, but our relationship soon began only to hit a few roadblocks. You see, he lived  in Australia and I lived in Texas and had never left America before; talk about a 12000 km wall! Not to mention my family was anything but willing to let me run off to another country for a guy and his mother had herself convinced I was a child predator. We fought long and hard, but I was able to enrol in a course, move to Australia and now we're waiting for our De Facto visa to process. So I'd like to say to Riot: I was stuck in the mud for awhile and you gave me the chance to change my life for the better. You helped me meet my partner, we couldn't be happier together and its all thanks to you and your amazing game! We're proud to support League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-16T18:19:10.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"I got a lot of guns\" - Smiles MURICA","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kwaliet","date":"2015-06-16T05:43:54.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This could be me with you but you ran away from me {{item:3073}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freyä","date":"2015-06-16T01:02:11.518+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Dr FACE","date":"2015-06-16T02:40:32.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your not alone {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]}]}]}
