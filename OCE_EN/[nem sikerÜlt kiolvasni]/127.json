Everything they say is important, pause the video at times, reading all text at the bottom of the video, normally what they say enhances your gameplay. I think that is why they include their videos on oce as we don't currently have our own youtube gods of ip lol. Perhaps oce should contact them ask if it's okay to produce an oce version for us and give them some credits, like COLD HARD CASH to thank them. Cheers.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Thnom","date":"2015-10-27T01:46:56.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I clicked on this thinking that Bobble-heads were being sold.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Statik","date":"2015-10-28T22:44:05.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Classic Australian racism.","replies":[]},{"poster":"EDDlE","date":"2015-10-28T00:39:05.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-10-27T09:48:50.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"There's cold and hot baths\"...

After that kindred can build these three or four items, depending if you omit the blood. 1. Dead man plate. 2. Mercury Treads 3. Depending on enemy, maw+scimitar or banhsee and visage (pick two). 4. If enemy is damage, you go thornamil or frozen heart for the 20% cooldown reduction.\r\n\r\nKindred also loves the spirit reaver for the cooldown reduction and the manage regeneration, if you go the spirit reaver, you build it first to maximize it''s advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen kindred has unlimited mana and stacks on passive above 10% she can not be stopped.\r\n\r\nHer main advantage is the fact she only really needs the hurricane and perhaps one other attack speed item to win games. We can play witgh four tank items on her and still go 1 vs 5 and come out victorious.\r\n\r\nI suspect in time we will see at the next worlds a kindred tank if she gets stacks.\r\n\r\nIt all depends on the first fiteen minutes of the game, if you grab 7+ stacks on kindred, you can tank and still match the enemy adc/etc dps output, meaning, you can tank them and come out victorious in a 1v1 against anyone.\r\n\r\nI suspect kindred is the first hybrid tank/slash adc/slash jungler we have seen.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, kindred can kill the baron in ten seconds, faster than any other champ that takes 18 seconds on mass damage attack speed lifesteal... (18 seconds on half health).\r\n\r\nso kindred kills things 4 times faster if you stack her to 12.5% max life damage.\r\n\r\nKindred is also the second anti-tank champion we have seen with vayne's silver bolts. I suspect kindred will be even more dominant.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, her w is a zoning device mid and late game as it nearly kills one single enemy if they stay in it's target radius.\r\n\r\nOnly xerath and possibly caitlyn/tristana can shoot kindred in her w. the rest have to eat wolf bite to even get close to her.\r\n\r\nI run a combo on my runes which are: 2xquints scaling mana regen, 1xquint flat mana regen, scaling armor and magic resist seals and glyphs and armor penetration marks which give her MORE DAMAGE than the early game spike of the damage marks.\r\n\r\nIf you're good at cs, you do not require the extra damage which are invalidated mid and late game, but armor penetration or attack speed marks never become invalid.\r\n\r\nI think you should part with your secrets. For example, during the tahm kench game, u wrote he builds sunfire cape etc, but when faker played him, for a split second  on one frame only. I paused it and it flashed his item set... He went with the standard rod of ages slash tear of goddess build on most of his mages.\r\n\r\nSo please, don't dis-advantages the world, tell us the truth cheers.","replies":[]}]}
