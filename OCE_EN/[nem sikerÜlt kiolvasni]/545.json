Plus, Wally the wombat is pro Legacy, so can't go wrong there.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the series against Legacy, things don't get any easier for the Chiefs with Dire Wolves and Abyss in Super Week, followed by tricky matches against Tainted Minds, SIN Gaming and Avant Garde. While they could potentially drop out of the top two with any more slip ups, I still think Chiefs can nail down a top 2 spot by taking their next series against DW to get a buffer between the teams.\r\n\r\nWhile Dire Wolves are definitely capable of finishing top 2 this split, I think having 2 of their remaining series' against both Legacy and the Chiefs will prove their achilles heel in the pursuit for Top 2. Their remaining two matches are against Abyss and Hellions so I'd say Dire Wolves would be quite safe for 3rd.\r\n\r\nAs for fourth, almost all of the remaining teams seem capable of mounting a case for 4th but with their full roster back together, the nod goes to Avant Garde, who have proven capable of coming back from a deficit when they have their full squad, with their losses coming against Chiefs, Dire Wolves (playing with subs) and Tainted Minds (who they will rematch in a highly anticipated Week 9 clash)\r\n\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thighdeology","date":"2016-06-25T10:41:25.613+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my prediction for the top 4 OPL Teams\r\n\r\n1. Chiefs:\r\nDo I even need to explain this? They have shown a dominating performance this season, still holding on the the OPL legend title. Their team is well oiled and know how to work together, unlike many of the roster changes and new teams in the OPL. I believe that the only way that they will lose the title and/or get kicked out of first place is if they can shut down Swiffer.. Swiffer has had a dominating performance so far and if he is allowed to get ahead he will snowball you to oblivion. With all the focus on 5v1 mid lane champions (namely {{champion:8}} and {{champion:50}} if one of them gets ahead it is extremely easy to go from there.\r\n\r\n2. Legacy:\r\nLegatree HYYYPE, again, dominating performance over the split and (although I don't think that Avant are bad) Legacy were down their top laner which I think really broke the team apart. If I was to pit the full Legacy lineup against the Avant Garde again, I would have to say 2-0/2-1 Legatree, this fact gets them into a close second.When they do face up against the Chiefs I want to see something new and exciting brought out, just to catch Chiefs off guard. I think that this could let Legacy take the upper hand and win the Best of 3. (cough cough {{champion:14}}  Support)\r\n\r\n Dire Wolves:\r\nAfter Legacy it takes a pretty big drop, the way I see it is that the OPL is in 4 tiers, (Chiefs + Legacy, Dire Wolves + Avant Garde, Sin Gaming + Abyss E-Sports, Helions + Tainted Minds) and I think that Dire Wolves are just a bit better than Avant Garde. Not much to talk about here other than their matchup into Avant. Honestly looking at Avant right now they are playing pretty well (with a 2-1 Win against Legacy) but I don't believe that Avant can beat Dire Wolves. That's really all I can say about this.\r\n\r\nAvant Garde:\r\nIt seems that I have been talking about these guys in the entire post! They have been playing pretty good over the season and I think that if they can play just right that they can sneak into fourth. I want to talk about Triple and Chenyboy. Both have the high potential to carry (if you look at Triples games, he does pretty well usually) but if they get behind I just feel like they don't do AS MUCH. Chelby has been playing amazingly and is a truly a talented man but it just hasn't been enough.Talking in my own opinion here, if these 3 step up and start to carry, I wouldn't be surprised to see Legacy or even Chiefs having their spots contested. But as of now I have to put AV in 4th\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my predictions for the Top 4 Teams in the OPL, its really cool that you do stuff like this and I hope to see more of it in the future :) I hope that I didn't just talk garbage from my mouth as that is also very likely XD","replies":[{"poster":"Thighdeology","date":"2016-06-25T10:44:13.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This forum just ruined all my beautiful formatting... {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} ","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-06-26T08:52:01.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's ok!

Dire Wolves are also tight on legacy's tail and are serious title contenders at their current state. I think chiefs have guaranteed this split and the only way they could lose this is if legacy step up their game by a whole league or if Dire Wolves strike lucky by utilising sybol to his maximum potential and the dire wolves bot demolish chiefs bot. Legacy are really stuck in a tough place at the moment and they need to step up, i think they won't have too much problems holding 2nd place with tally back but they can't afford to lose anymore. The only other spot thats really contested is 4th and thats between avant and tainted minds. abyss and hellions are way too behind to even catch up at this stage and they'll be fighting to avoid relegation and sin seem to be sitting pretty comfortably even if they are resurging at the moment. I think avant will nudge out tainted minds just slightly due to their experience and just the threat of triple who has been consistent all split even pushing chiefs to the ropes. Avant are really showing high hopes and it makes sense why a few splits ago when immunity was called chiefs, they were a threat to them. Although tainted minds seems more consistent, i'm believing in the carry of triple and hopefully the rest of avant can play to their best. \r\ntl;dr chiefs is basically guaranteed first, legacy should have an easy second but the way dire wolves playing now, it will be close and avant will nudge tainted minds out purely on their experience in tournaments.

Indeed, that loss to AV has hurt Legacy, they'll need to play well to hold off the potential of DW sneaking into a top 2 position at their expense should they drop to Chiefs in Week 6.\r\nDW are travelling well enough to warrant a place in the four, it's been sketchy but they're getting there and points on the board is what matters. Their one loss was to Legacy 2-0, so they are showing enough to stay ahead of the pack but I doubt they've got enough to grab a top two off of Chiefs and Legacy.\r\nMy final spot is the one most up in the air. The current standings would suggest that without capitulation, the top 3 are set. Fourth would probably on form be between Tainted Minds, Abyss, Sin and Avant Garde. Sin have pedigree, but I think they've fallen a bit too far behind to realistically reach the four, Abyss seem to be in a similar boat, they just can't get the wins on the board to be up there right now. Coming down to it, I think it's AV vs TM for the final spot. Both have shown skill so far, but the win on the board that TM have over AV may well just do it, as both teams are posting some close matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-06-28T09:04:17.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top 4: Chiefs, Legacy, Dire Wolves, Abyss\r\n\r\nChiefs because they have the best staff and macro plays (also the gaming house now!). Legacy should bounce back from their jitters with Tallywhacka back in the lineup. Dire Wolves are quite a strong team that could upset anyone on their day, but they are inconsistent. As for the other teams, i think Abyss will make the 4th spot because Looch is super solid in the mid lane and they are improving as a squad. Also their ADC's potential is starting to be realised. The other teams are not so great, especially in the ADC and TOP roles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"You Stole My KFC","date":"2016-06-28T05:11:29.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:236}} {{summoner:14}} {{item:3074}} {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"You Stole My KFC","date":"2016-06-28T05:10:55.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave a comment{{champion:226}}\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"clifton77","date":"2016-06-25T06:22:12.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:55}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"clifton77","date":"2016-06-25T06:21:47.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:1038}} Leave a comment","replies":[]}]}
