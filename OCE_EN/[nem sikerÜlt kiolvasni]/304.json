WTF Why nerf her again?? She is already so squishy and you nerf here!! Do you even play your own game that you made ??\r\n\r\nI knew this would happen. You introduce a stupid RUNES sytem that's no where near as good as the Runes and Masteries system was. Champs don't play or feel the same to play anymore. There are lag spikes when playing the game now. I know this as hundreds of people I know or have known say the same thing and now a lot of them are giving up on this broken game(so sad).\r\n\r\nI think the new RUNE system you made is basically a lazy system for people to play your game so you can sucker them in faster for more money. What I mean is if it takes a person to long to choose Runes and Masteries they will just say, (Ahh screw it takes to long). So you catered for the few and not your long term players thxs a lot. It does not pay to be loyal to any (Game Dev's) anymore as they show you complete contempt and only care about the cry babies, pro players and the minority players.\r\n\r\nI have said it before how long till this game just completely falls apart (broken). Just like other good game that started out great they added to much crap and the game started to lag and more bugs started to show EG: How long does it take to fix a Blizt Crank Skin? Over a month like wtf, you guys don't know your own programming (lol, lol, lol).\r\n\r\nNerfing all the champs is a sure way to see 70% of them get stuffed into a cupboard until one day Riot says, Hey why is know one playing Sona? Ohhhh that's right we nerfed her so hard that she's not playable. Ok then we will increase her and the nerf her again. We are so smart at Riot, yes we are :)\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}  \r\n","replies":[{"poster":"Averach","date":"2017-12-06T05:43:01.891+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Gee how many times are you going to NERF all the champs ffs? Sona!! WTF Why nerf her again?? She is already so squishy and you nerf here!! Do you even play your own game that you made??\r\n\r\nRiot nerfed Sona to tone down her poke as her heals, move speed buff, damage buff and large AoE stun already compensate for her squishiness. Having her do a chunk of damage to enemy champions every time she presses Q is a bit too much considering how her abilities are already AoE. And note that Riot nerfed her Q damage. Nothing else in Sona's kit. This is something that has to be done with many champions in order to make sure there is nothing game breaking within the game. It's called balancing.\r\n\r\n> I knew this would happen. You introduce a stupid RUNES sytem that's no where near as good as the Runes and Masteries system was.\r\n\r\nPersonal opinion. It is only stupid and no where near as good as the old rune system was in your opinion.\r\n\r\n> There are lag spikes when playing the game now. I know this as hundreds of people I know or have known say the same thing and now a lot of them are giving up on this broken game(so sad).\r\n\r\nIt's preseason. Riot has to do some tuning to make sure their servers can keep up with all the new action and coding. It could also have something to do with your internet provider or router that you are not fully aware of.\r\n\r\n> Just like other good game that started out great they added to much crap and the game started to lag and more bugs started to show EG: How long does it take to fix a Blizt Crank Skin? Over a month like wtf, you guys don't know your own programming (lol, lol, lol).\r\n\r\nTrue games often become worse over time but Riot has to deal with the balancing of champions with the new rune system, release and monitor new skins/champions, nerfs/buffs and make sure their game is running well. Their skins team was most likely working on the new Christmas skins and Hextech Kog'Maw and had no time to fix the Blitzcrank skins. If Riot didn't know their own programming the client would not even open.\r\n\r\n> I think the new RUNE system you made is basically a lazy system for people to play your game so you can sucker them in faster for more money. What I mean is if it takes a person to long to choose Runes and Masteries they will just say, (Ahh screw it takes to long). So you catered for the few and not your long term players thxs a lot.\r\n\r\n1. There is no option to pay for runes apart from new rune pages.\r\n2. The new rune pages can still be bought with BE.\r\n3. 'What I mean is if it takes a person too long to choose Runes and Masteries they will just say, (Ahh screw it takes too long).' That's why the preset's exist. To get u familiar with the new runes and give you a template if you don't want to make your own rune page.\r\n4. 'So you catered for the few and not your long term players thxs a lot.' Riot catered for both the \"few\" and the long term players. The long term players get to make their own rune pages which can fit their own personal play style. The \"few\" as I understand it, are those that do not invest much time into League. These \"few\" have the presets there to help them if they don't understand what each rune does.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, your reasoning is flawed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"i Am JuNgLe","date":"2017-12-06T04:33:23.487+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze V player deconstructing and exposing riots plans. {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} ","replies":[{"poster":"You Pawn","date":"2017-12-07T03:02:27.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"@ adeafchronicler: \r\n\r\nDude it does not matter about the B5.

The game with Nunu was me as the Nunu, I could do anything I wanted and be okay up to and including fight 1v5 and be fine anytime after level 10. These champs have very low cooldown slows so they can constantly get in and stay in range of kiters and keep hitting them, and the power of Grasp of the Undying is outstandingly strong for them. Even building Grievous Wounds proved ineffective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jotaro Kujô","date":"2017-12-06T08:42:29.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"legit all i want is one for all. these new game modes just suck i hate dark star, i hate legend of the poro king, i hate ascension and this new project one is by far the worst. how about instead of making new game modes after releasing skins, just use regular urf or add custom urf games.\r\none for all is by far my favorite game mode i would appreciate if riot would focus a little more on bringing it to the current client i understand from a business perspective making new game modes with the skins is a good way to earn money. i just want riot to not be as focused on profit and help casuals like me out","replies":[]},{"poster":"LighttningFarron","date":"2017-12-06T08:02:15.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:53}}   So is Lancer Blitzcrank finally out this patch after the Store Bug???","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eréndira","date":"2017-12-06T00:17:23.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATEDPRESS THREE ATTACKS Exposure is now added to targets after the damage from the attack that applies it\r\nanyone mind telling me what does this mean actually?\r\nEnglish isnt my mother tongue so i am not sure what does that mean.
