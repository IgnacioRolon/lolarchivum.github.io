ARURF, on the other hand, drives away a significantly smaller fraction of the player base, so they're trying to find a way to introduce URF again without having their long-term player base leave.

(queue rant):\r\n\r\nI have been getting progressively worse at League since 2016. Logically, this doesn't make sense as I play as much now as I did. What I have come to realise is my pure distaste for this game originates from the fact that League players have to adapt as the game evolves. It's either play a new way or lose. And the way the game is evolving is a path I very much dislike, and as such because I don't like playing a certain way, I am losing more and more. \r\n\r\nFor example, I have never been good at assassins or mages or adc's, my playstyle is tanky support. Along comes Ardent Censer, and boom my lane turns to ashes and the only way I can adapt is to play crappy supports like {{champion:40}} or learn a new role which I hate. So I went to toplane. I got good at it. BOOOOOOOMMMMM PRESEASON. Toplane is garbage, my support is garbage, I hate every other lane...\r\n\r\nA game shouldn't require the players to constantly change what they are comfortable at. A game should remain the same. Granted, I understand balances are constantly in order, and that is fine, I understand that every patch will be something that was overlooked, but changing the whole meta of the game is not good.\r\n\r\nBack to URF, last ARURF was what bought back my will to play. To play Ornn, my newest and most beloved champ, was what I wanted most. 'Oh, it's only snow themed champs; Oh, still can't pick my champ' but there is hope *remembered absolutely adoring AP Ashe in previous URFS* - *Gets Ashe 6 times in champ select and every single time someone dodged*. I genuinely had my ideal champ 6 times and not once did I play her, despite playing 5-10 games EVERY DAY ARURF was out...\r\n\r\nSo yes, after the gamemode vanished, I once again left League as it clearly was something I didn't enjoy. If URF had of been what I remembered and cherished, it would have bought me back...alas...","replies":[{"poster":"Deadcauseofu","date":"2018-01-31T01:00:23.884+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Engage/tanky supports are currently in as the power build for Bot, so I'm not sure where you're coming from there. Tanks are also in for top, since your choices in top are tanks (of which, Ornn is best) or a long range poke (of which, Jayce is best). So I'm not sure where you're coming from there, either. Also, if the meta never changed, why would long-term players continue to play? Once you've mastered the meta, why keep going? Riot has exactly 0 compulsion to drive away their long-term player base with a stale meta, particularly one that forces everyone to play a specific champion type (see also: the Ardent meta), so why should they introduce one just because it would favour your play-style?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Baked Alien","date":"2018-01-31T00:38:57.913+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3691}} WHERE {{item:3691}} MY {{item:3691}} SINGULARITY {{item:3691}} AT {{item:3691}}  \r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2018-01-31T12:33:42.848+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please, for the love of god, make them permanent in custom games.

With URF, they were seeing a rise in players, then a drop of players GREATER than the rise. It could have killed the game. 2. the gamemode doesn't accomplish some goal of riot games, or they are unhappy with how it turned out. i think black market brawlers was one of those.
