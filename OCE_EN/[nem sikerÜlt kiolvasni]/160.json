My questions are; having worked at many levels of casting and involvement on the LoL scene, particulary the EU LCS and now being one of the best and most popular caster identities out there, what are your future short term and long term goals, in and outside of LoL, and have you ever toyed with the idea of spending a considerable amount of time, perhaps even a full season, casting in another region outside what is considered your home soil (EU), we'd glady have you here in OCE.\r\nFinally have you been able to do much homework and study of the players, teams and regions competing in the International Wildcard Allstars event, and if so what are your predictions of what you think we can expect from them during the event, is there anyone you will be keeping a close watch on or looking forward to see play?\r\nThanking you, love your work, keep it up.","replies":[{"poster":"187Juggernaut","date":"2015-11-24T08:14:10.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well i learnt from this that i should of just posted a really short question via twitter cause that's where all the questions were picked from, the length of my question here does not fit in a twitter tweet. live and learn, next time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Krupt21","date":"2015-11-23T15:08:23.537+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"fancy a root?","replies":[{"poster":"Indian4TheWin8V2","date":"2015-11-23T15:11:52.069+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cmon Sjokz, give the poor lad a chance.

Don't write me off as some weirdo because of my name (it does have a meaning) because ever since I started watching esports you have been the one caster that always stood out. Heck my friends probably get sick of how many times I yelled \"ITZZZ SJOKZZ\" at the worlds viewing party. \n\nI've watched so many interviews and the ways you conduct them are brilliant, you know exactly when to let the other person respond and the questions asked are never simple yes or no questions, but instead questions that trigger a deep and interesting conversation so that us (the audience) get a real grasp of the topic instead of a snipit that leaves everyone confused. Geez this is starting to sound really fanboy now, so I'm gonna ask you a question that I've been wanting to ask for ages.\n\nI'm only 16 and I love the idea of adressing the world to help everyone understand a concept better so it has always been a dream of mine to present myself to the world.\n\n**QUESTIONS**:When you first discovered your dream and decided that it was the path you were going to follow, how did you advance into the wonderous world your in today? it's obviously not a perfect world so what were the obstacles you had to adapt to and overcome on your way to the top?\n\nP.S.
