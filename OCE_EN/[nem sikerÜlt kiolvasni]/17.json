The same with Zombie and Spirit fire brand.\r\n\r\nor PROJECT: Yi/Ashe, (or any of the project skins tbh) once you have those, all others seem invalid.\r\n\r\nThe only main champs I play, that I _regularly_ make the cycle through all the skins would be: \r\n\r\nKarthus\r\nPoppy\r\nGnar\r\nShen\r\n\r\nAnd to be honest it only happens with those champs _(with the obvious exception of Gnar where ALL the skins are evenly)_ because none of their skins are particularly great. \r\n_(like seriously, how easy would it be to change the colour of Karthus' particles?... come on)_","replies":[{"poster":"Firebolt","date":"2016-08-12T00:04:25.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"You know changing the colour of particles isn't as easy as loading up a palette and using \"Fill\" right?

Yes. Its really really easy to change just the colour of the particle effects.\n\nMaybe I'm just stupid, but where does it say it only took a day to make that custom skin? \n\nWhile I think the skin is pretty cool, it has a terrible colour scheme for visual clarity (would you even see minions anymore if that Q is on top of them?) and it also looks pretty clunky (Lux freezes after every action). That's why skins take time to make: Riot has to be 100% sure that the skin doesn't break or hurt the game in any way at all otherwise potentially thousands of players could be affected in a negative way.\n\nNow I don't claim to know how the skin making process works, but as someone who is studying IT, I can guarantee you that almost anything that can go wrong will go wrong. It's better for Riot and players that skins take 2-3 months to make and release, and ensure that they are bug free, rather than release a skin every 2-3 days and hope to God your game doesn't decide to go ballistic.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BorisOZ","date":"2016-08-24T08:26:13.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you look in the game files there are literally \"swatches\" which are just a solid colour and thats the exact colour that the skin changes to with the chroma.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bluegills","date":"2016-08-17T11:41:02.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do not know a thing about design... do you?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"uwu Daddy uwu","date":"2016-08-12T06:30:30.903+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think your outlook on chroma's is spot on, and i eagerly await what you do with it.\r\nthe inclusion of IP sales for chroma packs is a really nice move to see to help out players who may not always have rp to buy skins, so being able to change some of the base skins/the skins they've already bought will be a really nice touch.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FluffehWalrus","date":"2016-08-12T01:35:50.248+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Guess we don't get anything for having bought the chroma packs for 590 rp {{item:3070}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kaze Enigma","date":"2016-08-25T17:17:18.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly thanks for the IP sink on the new chroma sales.
