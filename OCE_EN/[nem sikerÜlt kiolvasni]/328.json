In the interest of keeping her strengths strong, we're limiting her early lane control with the powerhouse pushing of Tormented Soil so she isn't great in every situation\r\n\r\nAre you people at Riot retarded? You want to nerf Morgana, but you keep nerfing the wrong f*cking thing every single time \"you attempt to nerf Morgana\". Either nerf her Q so people can stop bitching about the root time, or nerf her black shield so she's not a f*cking anti CC machine. Why the hell can cast an {{champion:2}} ult every 15 f*cking seconds? They should rework it so it blocks ONE form of CC, not almost every single f*cking thing for 6 seconds. And people who are dumb saying \"oh, but you can pop the black shield herp pe derp\" its not exactly that simple popping the black shield, especially in teamfights when she can just black shield the initiator and let them run wild, wrecking people in teamfights and almost guaranteeing a win with her bloody CC\r\n\r\nAnd {{champion:75}}...god I hate this champ. I hate him regardless of who's playing him or what team he's on. He truly makes my blood boil. RIOT, JUST REWORK HIM ALREADY! He either is a useless piece of sh*t who will AFK farm for almost the entire f*cking game turning it into a 4v5, or he will become so insanely strong that he can almost one shot Q anyone who is stupid enough to let him farm for the entire game, and the fact he can INFINITELY increase his Q damage! He's either a useless piece of sh*t or an unstoppable piece of shit, and I despise anyone who even thinks of playing this ridiculous champ.\r\n\r\nAlso...WHY THE F*CK ARE YOU NERFING {{champion:92}}?! FOR F*CKS SAKE LEAVE HER ALONE ALREADY!!! SHE'S ALREADY BEEN NERFED HARD OVER THE YEARS! IF YOU CONTINUE NERFING HER SHE'S GONNA BECOME LIKE OLAF!\r\n\r\nAnd seriously, {{champion:23}}'s ult needs to be reworked so that he doesn't use it all the time to just run away unscathed, or tower dive with no consequences or just simply stay in and kill an enemy before running off with his E!\r\n\r\nHonestly Riot...what the hell are you guys doing...\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-05-14T23:28:45.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the bans will change hope fully and really olaf is strong but 15 seconds is long compared to some and extremely short to others champion diversity is a good thing but maybe we need to up the bans to 1 per player not just the leader bringing it 6>10 it could be a good thing  :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gutsyou","date":"2015-05-15T08:49:03.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spot the riven main\r\n{{summoner:2}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-05-16T05:19:49.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The {{champion:92}} nerf is next to nothing...
