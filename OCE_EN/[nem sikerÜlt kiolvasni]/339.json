So tanks being the strongest champions in the game isn't the meta? Anything in the meta is either a tank or good against tanks. Maokai is one of the stronger top laners, there was ekko, and of course things like Swain are insane right now. Lucian i the best adc right now, mostly due to the Black Cleaver/Youmuu's build. It shreds tanks, so it's good. Much like with MF making a slight comeback. Ezreal can keep his distance, making him good against the tanks, or at least better.\r\n\r\nAzir in the mid lane, is super good against tanks, as magic resist is often harder to build, and he has some of the highest dps in the game. And then there's Vlad. Vlad, is pretty much the same case as Swain. Rek Sai is one of the better junglers again, along with Gragas.\r\n\r\nSupport is really one of the only roles with true diversity.\r\n\r\nIn saying all of this, the tank meta appears to be slowing down, especially with the death of ekko top, thank goodness. Personally I want a meta where adcs are strong. Not like Graves or Kindred, but proper adcs. Its been quite a few seasons since the adc was the single most impactful champion on the rift.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CadoAzazel","date":"2016-06-09T23:35:01.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wish they'd answer the VoIP question","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mons Olympus","date":"2016-06-10T10:14:06.721+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nice fedora!

I have come up with(with a few friends) some game modes that would be very interesting to see what riot thinks about them. One of them being changing champions, where each person picks a champ and every 5 mins you swap champs with the person below you(on the tab menu). This would obs have a 10 sec count down so you know its about to happen(you are not randomly swapped when in the middle of a team fight. And gold would not swap with the character so you would still have the same gold. Same as you would get 500 gold each swap so that you can build that champ the way you want for that 5 mins. This is not unreasonable either since it is 5 mins and a normal 30 min ARAM/SRift game would only have you swapping 6 times. It would definitely give premade teams an advantage though and would require teamwork to succeed, but whats fun without a challenge. Not a programmer so not sure how difficult this would be. This is not the only game mode we have come up with so somewhere where we can send these ideas would be great. Please respond. Email is Samcdownie@gmail.com if that helps.
