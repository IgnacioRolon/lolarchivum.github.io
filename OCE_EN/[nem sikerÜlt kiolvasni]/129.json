Your support spends more money on dropping random wards and more mana on healing full health adcs than doing anything actually relevant (not to mention how to differentiate between healing supports and non-healing supports in a feasible manner), all in the name of stats.

Will instalocking Annie support regardless of matchup be worse than a Soraka that heals full health champs to gain a few more xp towards a meaningless objective? If your answer is yes, I worry for you.\r\n\r\nThe real question here is does anyone who comes up with half-assed \"solutions\" to any given problem actually bother to put more than a few seconds rampart thought into it before they sperg all over the forums with meaningless crap that doesn't actually benefit anyone, ever.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, what the hell is wrong with a meaningless accompishment anyway?
