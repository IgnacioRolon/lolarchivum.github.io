The basic shapes feel a bit generic and some are not immediately recognisable (MR = circle, for example). While the old rune set did not have a unique icon for each type of rune, they felt more ornate and visually interesting - which I prefer.","replies":[{"poster":"John TheONE","date":"2016-07-22T07:13:24.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also wish I could see the list of runes and mastery pages similar to friend lists rather than having a drop down. Also being able to compare two rune pages would be amazing like comparing items in RPG games. The difference between active keystone mastery and unactive(?) should be more clear and distinguishable. \n\nMatch histories are exactly what I wanted though.","replies":[{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2016-07-22T08:33:37.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I think both of these suggestions about runes would be very useful indeed.\n\nI also agree that it's a bit hard to tell between selected and selectable runes. I think this would also be a good point to add a prompt to users who hit level 18 to tell them to select keystones and just overall teach them about the masteries system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"UltraFireFX","date":"2016-07-22T08:31:17.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally disagree, I feel like the runes look very sleek and match the whole look and feel of the new trend of art work.","replies":[]}]}]}
