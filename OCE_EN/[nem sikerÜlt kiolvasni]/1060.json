During an event plenty of things seem to have the event name attached to them, be it chests and assorted other loot drops, but that doesn't really indicate that what you get from those things is specifically event content, e.g. it might just be another way you can get general content drops but wrapped up in an event-themed thing.\r\n\r\nHowever as best I can guess (not having gotten one yet) the [Event] Skin Shard item only gives skin shards of that event (with the exception of brand new ones which aren't included), yet it doesn't make an effort to specifically say so. People could think it's just named for the event like all the other stuff, but thinking that the skin shards it drops could be anything. Not to mention the skins themselves don't follow the naming convention either, they aren't \"Lunar Revel\" rather stuff like \"Warring Kingdoms\", or \"Lunar Wraith\".\r\n\r\nIt'd just be nice if the description said something like \"Contains a skin shard for a previous Lunar Revel event skin\" if that's what it is, because I'm still not fully sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T05:31:03.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does say in the Loot and Rewards tab with all the other descriptions:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4mGo5xK.png","replies":[]}]}]}
