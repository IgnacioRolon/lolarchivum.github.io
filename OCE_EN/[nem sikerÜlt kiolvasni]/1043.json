Im not an Aatrox main, never was a main, so understand this.\r\n\r\nBut, this all seems like a good in concept - bad on paper idea. It seems, so rushed (funny puns for a funny mistake from riot).\r\n\r\nI would've rathered Aatrox be tampered with at a later date, he definitely doesn't deserve this treatment... and sorry of my brutish Australian bluntness takes over, but it's a halfassed change.\r\n\r\nThe overall theme of Aatrox is really cool, but as a lot of champs he has a lot of issues. For instance, as some people have said his Ult isn't impactful, most champions Ultimate Abilities are designed to be Impactful.\r\n\r\nHis ult in itself, is still cool? It's literally 'I'm going Super Saiyan watch as I whack you all to death.' but it's still sounds mediocre right? It's like giving someone the one weapon that will save humanity, but it's a wet noodle.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about design, or balance and respect that Riot want to change Aatrox, because he does need a change, but I think in order to change Aatrox he needs an entire kit rework, or re-arrange. \r\n\r\nHe doesn't need a VU, or anything special, just a better designed kit for his theme of 'The Darkin Blade' a weird Ancient Race that are viewed as gods among men. Aatrox is basically a God of War, he appears on battlefields and turns the tides as he see's fit!\r\n\r\nWorking around that would be interesting, seeing if his Ultimate could change the tides of a Teamfight. That's what Aatrox screams to me as, a good Teamfighter. He's not Team reliant, but he's a Team player.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2017-03-09T11:31:57.634+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question on aatrox's passive, is it supposed to only work when in blood rush?

I'm now an aatrox main and I got my first penta with him! After these buffs (?) I enjoy him so much more and I play him a lot. One thing I think you could do is set up a YouTube account for people to send in clips of their best plays and get their plays shown on your account! This could be a great way to hype up the oce  community and even get more people to show why they don't belong in bronze..

In Kassadin's case, he was still strong enough to merit another three of four rounds of nerfs, and Veigar is stronger now than he ever was, he just needs more skill. \r\n\r\nThis seems completely like a case of \"it's different to what you're used to, so you're gonna see it as bad, but once you get the hang of it, it'll actually be quite good\". \r\n\r\nHis passive is going to need better timing, instead of being \"my blood well is up so I can dive at any time with little danger\" and now heals a flat 30% of his hp, instead of being reliant on how full his well is at the time.\r\n\r\nHis Q now does less damage, yes, but it was absurdly powerful, being able to deal silly amounts of damage, even when built mostly tank. His W heal now goes so well with tank items, making him an actually viable tank/offtank. Blood price also deals less damage, but now costs NOTHING, and neither does his Q. E now costs flat health, making the cost almost meaningless late game, and they flattened out the slow and damage scaling to be more consistent. \r\n\r\nIf you compare this all to the Kassadin changes, where they just plain took away over half of his damage, the silence on his Q, which was often the only reason he could trade with many ranged mid-laners, and then STILL halved the range of his ult, and he's still a really strong champion, this Aatrox balance really doesn't look so bad.

Eg. Playing against a Warwick, Warwicks fear lasts long enough to completely drain blood rush. This greatly reduces Aatrox's team fight power as the drain is so fast that any CC removes him from the fight completely. I feel there needs to be either a small timer in which it doesnt drain after filling it up again, or pause the drain while Aatrox is CC'd.
