Its good to see that Riot at least know of some of the mechanical or meta shortfalls players experience in this mode. My concern is that they have no idea of how to change the rules to create balance and improve the overall fun of ARAM.\r\nHere are concerns I have that have not been addressed:\r\n\r\n1) Queue dodgers\r\nIt's easy to win games if you don't care about queue dodging an game that doesnt have an OP/wombo lineup. Maybe restricting leavers to only free lineup toons for their next ARAM as punishment for leaving a game could alleviate this problem a little?\r\n\r\n2) Rerolling without asking if anyone would like the current hero.\r\nThere is noting more disappointing than seeing your only AD toon rolled out because that player didnt like the hero they rolled. Maybe put a 5 second trade timer on a hero before the reroll happens for anyone else in the team to be able to trade toons? Or the hero drops to the banned hero section for anyone to grab within 5 seconds before it rerolls?\r\n\r\n3) ARAM accounts.\r\nIn an ideal world, every hero would be viable and there would be no such thing as an ARAM account. Sadly, this is yet to happen in League. With a full lineup of S-class ARAM toons plus the passively acquired reroll points, ARAM accounts are always at an advantage over accounts that have a high number of heroes unlocked. Either remove the minimum reroll points accrued per game, so less toons = less rerolls, or increase the points acquired for accounts with higher numbers of playable heroes. (Or both)\r\n\r\n4) Tank meta + snowball initiation.\r\n  In ARAM games I've played, a Tank vs ADC duel often has tanks locking down and killing the ADC while building straight survivability. Being able to initiate without boots, lock down a carry, then solo kill the carry is something that doesnt make sense. Sadly within this meta, I have no idea how this could be fixed.\r\n\r\n5) Healers OP.\r\n  Healers are an issue in ARAM. A healer can nullify the total post game hero damage of an enemy champion, but also be able to deal a substantial amount of damage too. They can also make it that a team can turtle to start a fight at high HP. A possible work around would be that heals become a malphite like shield on your health bar, which falls off XYZ seconds after the first damage is received. Or allow the healing debuff of items to kick in at a higher health % than they currently do.\r\n\r\n6) Lack of team participation on snowball initiation.\r\n  Traveling to the marked target should ping the target similar to how Panthions ult pings the location. A little helpful heads up for your team when 'that guy' dives deep.\r\n\r\n7) the removal of move speed buff (and armour/magic reduction) on Guardians Horn.\r\n  This was an engage/disengage item. The rework is odd...\r\n\r\n8) Oricles extract now having sweeper fuction.\r\n  Feels like it will become OP making teemo and shaco traps useless. Not needing to enter brush to spot traps leaves no risk or skill to trying to clear traps. Not to mention what it will do to wukong and talon stealth moves.\r\n\r\n9) New Guardians items provide too little early game strength for their value. \r\n  These items cant build into late game items, and games are geared away from snowballing off of first bloods and early kills. For example: Guardians hammer gives 150hp, 15 AD, 10% life steal @ 950g. Vampiric scepter gives 15AD, 10% life steal @ 900g, plus builds into late game items. 150hp combined with 10% life steal at level 3 doesnt give you all that much of an advantage to this dead ended item.\r\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"MountBicephius","date":"2016-06-15T08:35:07.071+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are we ever going to get anything to help deal with trolls in champ select?
