It's definitely a shame we couldn't start with every region within OCE but I want to share how we approached LOO and where we're going to go after the event this weekend. \r\n\r\nWhen we first started talking about the event we didn't know how popular it would be. So, we decided to start off with a fairly basic concept to test the waters. Once we know how passionate the fans are about the concept, we can use that insight to make decisions around what we do going forward.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to team selection we decided the priority was high competition, rather than inclusion. We looked at where our OPL and OCS players grew up, and felt that NSW, Qld, Vic and NZ had way more pro players than the others. Queensland was actually touch and go, and that's for Australia's third my populous state! \r\n\r\nWe also kicked around the concept of an All Stars team, but decided that in the long term it would be better to encourage the other regions to produce more pro/semi pro players rather than throw them into a 'the rest' team.\r\n\r\nIf LOO goes well and we start seeing more players emerge from the other regions, I'd love to see Tas, WA, and all of the regions have a team. I think a pacific island team would be really cool! So the best thing you can do to make a case for your region is start competing in the OOL and other grass roots tournaments and make a case for inclusion!","replies":[{"poster":"You Pawn","date":"2017-06-11T08:52:53.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude go do yourself you have discriminated against us","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fire Ashe","date":"2017-05-28T16:49:29.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure where the other states are at. By sheer population alone VIC NSW & QLD should b in the top 3. In saying that were's TAS WA SA NT???\r\n\r\nIm KIWI born ex 40 yrs South Aussie now in Darwin.. Which makes ya go wtf??\r\n\r\nIm a 4 yr lol player with 2 lvl 30 accounts. PVP has given me some experience but im not into the glitz & glamour of nationals or worlds. Leave it to the guns.\r\n\r\nThere is some awesome talent out there & if Brazil 2017 is anything to go by.. Faker went 0 4 0 in one match alone in first 10 mins., \r\n\r\nSo there's hope for anyone serious enuff.. \r\n\r\nThe KIWI team have certainly done their homework & it will b interesting to watch..\r\n\r\nGood luck to everyone.. \r\n\r\nNT is a fly in fly out state mainly, not sure on the LOL population.. I don't C many locals in my games & chat rooms.\r\n\r\nLots of support for AFL. NRL is either a QLD or NSW thing.

If you want a team in your own state/territory, it would also cost to run it, what many people couldn't be bothered with.\r\n\r\nHope this answered your question :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fire Ashe","date":"2017-05-28T16:56:50.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There would need to be enuff player support to make it financially viable to recognize & host an event. \r\n\r\nBut I don't think the population has the numbers..
