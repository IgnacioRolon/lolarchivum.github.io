What do you mean by, \"Thats 48 champions you cannot use when your getting chests till next season!\"?\r\n\r\nMaybe I have misread your previous post. \r\n\r\nI have copied and pasted the info about Hextech Chests below for clarity {{summoner:13}}  (from the guide, https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207884233-Hextech-Crafting-Guide )\r\n\r\n\"Earn these through achieving a Mastery rank of S or higher, or purchase them in the store for RP. A chest requires a key to open, and will contain a shard and possibly some amount of essence (more on all that later). Some details:\r\n\r\n- You can earn up to four chests at a time, with one chest slot regenerating each week. Purchasing chests doesn’t contribute to this limit, so even after earning four chests in a week, you can purchase another. You can purchase up to 25 chests per day.\r\n- Once you earn a chest from achieving S rank on a champion, you won’t be able to earn another with that champion until the end of the season. You can see which champions you’ve earned chests with in your profile’s Champions tab. This chest cap resets each season.\r\n- If someone in your premade group earns an S rank, you’ll receive a chest as well! The chest you receive is tied to the champion you’re playing, so that champion will be unable to earn more chests for this season.\r\n- You can only earn chests if you're playing a champion you own. So, if you rent a champion or play an unowned champion on the free rotation, you won't be able to earn a chest with them. However, if your premade partner earns an S rank on a champion they don't own, you can still earn a chest from their S rank as long as you own the champion you're playing.\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Rapid","date":"2016-03-25T04:38:06.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get keys from ARAM?","replies":[{"poster":"RING of FIRE","date":"2016-03-27T08:26:50.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not come across anyone who has earned a key fragment from ARAM wins, some players have won 20 games and not dropped a key fragment as yet..............{{summoner:2}} \nCan anyone bust the myth that ARAM keydrops are glitched?????","replies":[{"poster":"Rapid","date":"2016-04-05T09:25:00.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EDDlE","date":"2016-03-27T09:45:26.162+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"RING of FIRE","date":"2016-03-26T11:58:25.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else noticed players not more likely to surrender in normals?
