Ok you wanted to deal with stealth because he is banned out in championships all the team NOT!\r\nOk ok I let the stealth slide but his slow really you had to touch the only defence he had???? Twitch original slow was an instant aoe slow this got him out of trouble when champs ran at him and it gave him enough time to stealth, so what you guys do hey not many people play twitch lets see we can minimize that even more lets make it so he has to aim that slow make him stop to cast it and make it so he can not hit everyone with it. Then laugh at him while he trys to live through the 6second delay he has while trying to go stealth so he lives, but wait he can not make it too his turret before his stealth runs out lets just run to the turret.\r\nSo now that you screwed with his defence lets see if we can really screw up is attack. So he needs the surprise attack so you walk around a corner ~~stealth~~ camouflage to kill the laner you do not have the surprise any more as he can see you and you are dead. Twitch lose to most adc unless he surprises them. And now he can not even stealth through the fight to drop aggro, not like it work that well any way you would have to stealth before the fight engage live for the 6 seconds and you was good.\r\nHis W was a good start I think after screwing it but would prefer to see the aoe slow back, it dose give him another button to press in team fights apart from R.\r\nAnd maybe having his Q an instant cast would be a good move as well considering, you can see the !@#$ !@#$ while !@#$ camouflage now any !@#$ way. Or maybe even giving him an increase on the speed boost like eve.\r\n\r\nINVISIBLE CHAMPS - Are the sweepers going to be able to see them???\r\n\r\nInvisibility effects don't last long enough for users to move from one lane to another - And what champ can do that if you have ward with pink ward ? Twitch have not been able to do that since season 2.\r\n\r\nBut are well-suited for maneuvering in combat (whether that's to start a fight or reposition within one).-Like they had trouble before they all have gap closers apart from teemo and he is not stealth if he is moving. \r\n\r\nTurrets are the only entities that passively see through Invisibility, in line with their nature as safe havens. Yea so only fight near your turrets when vs the one's listed below. So at any time a invisibility used you should disengage from team fight because your it is too high a risk for your back line.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LESS SHORT LIST The following stealth abilities are Invisibility effects:\r\nAkali’s W - Twilight Shroud-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\nKha’Zix’s R - Void Assault-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\nLeBlanc’s R - Mimic-She is almost dead but it would pay to back off in both.\r\nShaco’s Q - Deceive-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\nTalon’s R - Shadow Assault-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\nTeemo’s Passive - Guerilla Warfare (formerly “Camouflage”)-You see him you are all ready dead, you can not ward the whole map with 5 control wards.\r\nVayne’s R - Final Hour-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\nWukong’s W - Decoy-In lane you back off in team fight you disengage.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTED BY THE CHANGE - Really only one\r\nEve - No change.\r\nRengar - No change as he can jump on you while still out of vision, only change he can no longer use his R as an escape now.\r\nTwitch - Every thing from engage and disengage that rat is dead. If You can get to him he is dead.\r\n\r\nMY THOUGHTS\r\nRoit made a mistake with the wards and are too stubben to say they were wrong and they should of roled them back to season 1 warding system.\r\nAnd from reading this post it seems you want to fix the snow balling of the AD champs, but what about the Akali's What is going to stop her from snow balling. And after she fed from lane how do we deal with the fact that we wont be able to stop her from 2 shotting our apc and adc when we can not see her.\r\nIs this the reason every BOT game I have been in tonight has had an akali in it ?????????\r\nBy the way your bots are stupid I camouflage with twitch and found unless they walked on top of him they would run up to the turret.","replies":[{"poster":"Nintend064","date":"2016-11-09T23:20:42.687+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has a long history of ignoring the community when it comes to things they change (remember the outrage when they replaced the HUD and everyone asked for the ability to toggle between the old and the new one?)

We are not riot staff but we helped grow the community as well as your employees shouldn't we have a say?\r\nI understand that your trying to make it an even playing field but just think about it, Gross Gore is just Doing Vlogs now, His not playing Twisted Fate, all the new players watching youtube videos on how to play assassin champions are now meaningless, everyone is learning together but the original players will still pave the way and craft their methods faster than ANY new player could! So Who are really helping? I don't know if the game has peaked but when Bjergsen and Doublelift stop playing what then?
