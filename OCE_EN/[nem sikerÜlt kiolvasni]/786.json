We buy skins because we like the way they look. With the update all of them were changed, and they were changed after we had already forked over the cash for them. You took something we payed for and changed it into something we didn't pay for. In any other situation with any product if you do not get what you pay for, you take it back and get the actual product or you get a refund. We got neither, because rito \"doesn't do refunds after the karthus update\"\r\nAlso with her snowball potential, it's now even greater. If she gets a lead, just one combo will force you out of lane or kill you outright, and good luck surviving her ultimate. Her old ultimate was better in teamfights, if you were behind you could still inflict damage. Her new ult required the ability to move around, something you don't get in teamfights.\r\nIf she is ahead and catches you, she kills you?\r\nNever{{champion:11}} seen{{champion:107}} that{{champion:238}} before{{champion:84}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Hot Cousin","date":"2015-12-28T01:09:07.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still pretty true that if she catches you without flash you're dead.

Her unique set of abilities was really what got me into playing her. However, with the new {{champion:114}} I feel as though it is a **completely** _different_ champion. \r\n\r\nThe change on her Q was fine. The dash is somewhat similar to the one before, and its provides more play potential as she can jump mini walls.\r\n\r\nHer W on the other hand was a disappointment for me. It feels awkward using it and having all these defensive attributes put onto her W was really weird. I feel as though a simpler auto attack block was fine, especially for top lane. The slow/stun doesn't really fit her (at least in my opinion).\r\n\r\nHer E is also fine. I like the new abilities that RIOT is implementing. It provides a little twist, which makes it a whole lot more interesting - rather than press E for an simple attack speed boost.\r\n\r\nThe new ultimate is basically what made me stop playing {{champion:114}}. I can see where the \"pool of healing for team\" idea comes from, but it is not very reliable in team fights and doesn't suit her ~~play style~~ new play style. I think she was fine with her old ultimate where she would \"perform a waltz\" and attack multiple targets, making her quite viable in team fights. With her new ultimate it focuses too much on single targeting, and although it may be trying to reference the \"fencing one-on-one,\" the end result of a heal is really awkward. Also, hitting all 4 of the targets \"weak spots\" is **really hard**. Especially if they decide to lean on a wall. So even in 1v1 situations, its not really reliable. In a team fight, its also hard to use it on the right person at the right time. For example, getting it on the ADC is almost impossible unless you jump into their team, or the ADC is out of position. Their mid laner will back off, and basically any other smart champion will do so too.\r\n\r\nOverall I think that Fiora _wasn't_ \"fixed\" or \"improved\" with the changes, but rather _mutated_ into a completely different champion with a different play style.\r\nI feel as though her old hairstyle suited her more than the current one. The armour changes are fine, but her hairstyle really added to her personality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RadRed609","date":"2015-12-28T05:08:42.421+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"something tells me that riot felt so much backlash against the new splash art because those that didn't like it complained loudest. Rather those of us who liked it thought it was great, so didn't go on to the forums to whinge about it.\r\nThe original severeness and angularity gave her so much character. and a relatively distinct one too. There are more than enough \"pretty girls\" in LoL, but heaven forbid riot makes a character slightly less young/pretty. we can't have that or the world might just implode from a lack of teenage tits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vetr0","date":"2015-12-24T05:37:58.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Keep new \"Q\"\r\nGo back to old \"W\"\r\nKeep new \"E\"\r\nGo back to old \"R\"\r\n\r\nKeep it simple.

All other abilities are fine, but the change of the ultimate R really ruin the hero. In the final stage of the gameplay, the little heal is not going to help the team, and there are other player in the team can do a better job. Ruin the R really kills a good damage exporter(and earn the damage through early gameplay), in the final game play the hero become useless, and too hard to master and not as fast and flash as it used to be. Since then I stopped playing LOL.\r\n\r\nThe art isn't too much trouble, just buying other skin can solve the problem.

I think she needs to be put back on the drawing board as it feels even harder to place her in a team now than she did before.
