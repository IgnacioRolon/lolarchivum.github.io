They just need to increase his cooldown times and increase the time it takes for him to lvl up. That way he will become more of a jump, kill and run assassin with end game potential instead of dominating from the start and controlling whatever lane he is in. They certainly need to make him more difficult to play though, with the free rotation noobs are becoming surprisingly difficult to kill.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHRONICxLUMINARY","date":"2015-05-30T00:31:27.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ekko so broken haha","replies":[{"poster":"MICHAEL CHINA","date":"2015-05-30T00:56:09.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"New cham always like God，op damage，op displacement，op control skills","replies":[{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-05-30T09:41:59.797+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you seen Bard{{champion:432}}?\nGuy got a buff day 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Nonna","date":"2015-05-31T09:35:39.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All champs except supports.
