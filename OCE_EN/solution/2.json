I am a support player that is good at both making plays and playing conservative and can adapt to different play-styles. I keep consistent wards, although I am not 100% with warding I do try and maintain a pink and all 3 wards on the map when I can. I am a very unselfish player and don&#039;t mind taking one for the team if things go south. I have a very good track record with my supports, with over 65% win ratio on both Janna and Thresh and a 90% win ratio on Nami. I have experience versing teams on a challenger skill level, although we don&#039;t win those games, we do make them very close, with a better team and communication, as well as consistent practice I believe I can bring an excellent new element to a team.\r\n\r\nI am 20 years old and am located in Newcastle, NSW. I have teamspeak 3 for communication and a server that I am willing to give use to the team if they need one. Best way to contact me is in game, but if you leave a message here that should be alright as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-05-22T13:06:53.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey S0lution,\nI currently have a S3 team that has started to get inactive(everyones leaving etc) so if you would like to join that would be great we currently have myself who fills but pref is jg and 1 other person who can fill if you would like to join just post here or add me on LoL, oh and don't worry I do ward as jg unlike many other jglers I have seen","replies":[]}]}
