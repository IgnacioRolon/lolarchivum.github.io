As most ranked 5s teams are already full and aren&#039;t looking for members very often I&#039;d like to give a chance to a select few people to join this ranked 5s team. The only requirements are to not be a dick and wanting to get better at the game competitively. We will be entering the weekly Sunday tournaments and playing on a regular basis ASAP. I will be organising a timetable which will be working around everyone from the team. I understand people have other commitments, I&#039;m not a nazi! ;) Anyway. Leave your details below, or PM me on league for a faster response! :)\r\n\r\nPositions Available:\r\n\r\nADC - \r\nMid - \r\nTop - \r\nJungle - \r\nSupport - S0lution","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-06-09T07:42:27.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, Can i please get an explanation on why you kicked us and like never told us what is happening please don't say sht first game we are plat-diamond vsing challengers yes we won't win we tried and we get kicked the next day and you deleted everythingâ€¦.
