I usually get around 70ms in game, and i almost never get spikes unless i&#039;m downloading something whilst in game. Yet, just today, i&#039;ve had horrible lag spikes. My fps is stable, and even when i get disconnected from the server, i can still load up all web pages and download something at my usual speed. Played two games today, the first one i had horrid lag, cost my team the win. Was never below 300ms, and always spiking. Second game, twice both teams disconnected, yet i was the only one experiencing the bad lag. Then, i disconnected from the server, and when i relogged into LoL to reconnect.. It went to the waiting for stats screen, and in my match history there is no record at all of the game. I&#039;m assuming this is a server issue? Was just looking for some information.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-19T04:13:05.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm assuming this is a server issue?\n\nBased on everything I've seen the last few days, I'd say this is right on the money.\n\nWhat OS are you on and who's your ISP?","replies":[]}]}
