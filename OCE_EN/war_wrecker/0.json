Make E easier to land but have a lower duration and a lower cooldown. Decrease its power elsewhere as needed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSo, why?\n\nIt&#039;s all to do with powerbudget and reliability. In short Urgot gets away with having a lot of power because his moves are unreliable, but at the same time his moves are forcibly gated based on their ability to increase reliability.\n\nHis ultimate is his one true reliable spell, as it is targeted hard crowd control followed by a powerful slow.\n\nHis auto attacks are not reliable due to their short range, his Q and E are not reliable because they are relatively slow moving projectiles.\n\nHis E makes his Q homing thus increasing its reliability.\n\nHis R suppresses and then slows an enemy, making his E easier to land, thus increasing its reliability.\n\nUrgot&#039;s gameplay on even footing is centered around 2 binaries which produce 4 options: either he hits E and wins, he ults to hit E and wins, doesn&#039;t hit E and has to ult to not lose (which mostly is followed up by hitting E and winning), or he doesn&#039;t hit E or have his ult and he loses.\n\nIf we split those back into binaries we have &quot;if ult: win&quot; and &quot;if hit E: win&quot;. At no point does his passive, auto attacks, Q, or W have any relevance to this. This is of course because his Q is unreliable, his auto attack is unreliable, and both his passive &amp; W are applied by Q and auto attacks. But his Q is made reliable by E. Which is made reliable by R. So landing E enables Urgot&#039;s entire kit, and R lets Urgot land E.\n\nSo the key thing here is that it&#039;s feast or famine whether or not Urgot lands his E, and that his ultimate is gated by the fact that it lets him easily land it, so the obvious solution is to make landing it less important.\n\nUrgot currently has 2 windows of power (not counting his ultimate) that he often overlaps, one where he slows his targets and another where he reliably hits them from range. With his W alone Urgot has trouble reliably slowing targets, and with his E alone Urgot has trouble stopping targets from just walking out of his range. Alone, both skills have counterplay. But together they create the anti fun no counterplay binary gameplay that needs to be removed from Urgot&#039;s kit.\n\nMy proposal is specifically around shifting the power, uptime and reliability around on his E and W. Currently as it stands both E and W have a moderate duration and a moderate cooldown that both gain a relatively high uptime with 40% CDR. However while E can miss and be dodged which creates a large window of vulnerability for Urgot simply because so much of his power is locked into a moderate cooldown spell that can miss so easily, his W cannot miss, it can only be destroyed by receiving damage.\n\nIf we make E easier to land by increasing any combination of range, AoE, and projectile speed it&#039;s more reliable and consequently Q is more reliable. If its cooldown is reduced along with its manacost, and its duration reduced, essentially the alternating windows of vulnerabiility for Urgot and his targets have been compressed, making each individual E less significant. Additionally damage and other effects would have to be nerfed to compensate.\n\nHowever these hypothetical changes do mean that E would be up more often because it would have a similar uptime but it would be easier to land, so to reduce the strength of overlapping E and W, W would need an increased cooldown or reduced duration, which would be complemented by increasing its power. So we reduce the power and reduce the cooldown of the unreliable E, while increasing the power and the downtime of the reliable W. As a bonus concentrating the power of W into a smaller window gives it greater synergy defensive with R and punishes Urgot for ulting when it&#039;s not ready, although stacking W and R wastes the slow as they do not stack.\n\nThis changes the current non ultimate Urgot dynamic from &quot;kill Urgot because he missed E and his ult is down&quot; vs &quot;die to Urgot because he landed E when I was too close&quot; to &quot;force Urgot to pop W to save himself and then kill him later&quot; vs &quot;run from Urgot because his E will wear off and he can&#039;t R to keep me in range&quot;, and shifts the counterplay from being around the uptime of the E to the uptime of the W.\n\nAdditionally, in it&#039;s current state W will have a very high uptime if it&#039;s not being attacked and a very low uptime if it is, which rewards whoever is ahead in that match up, whereas increasing it&#039;s power while increasing it&#039;s cooldown means it will have a medium uptime if it&#039;s not attacked and a low uptme if it is attacked which still allows it to fulfill it&#039;s purpose, while giving everyone more agency over the situation.\n\nSpecifically I need to note that the last set of changes to Urgot&#039;s W did exactly what I am proposing: they increased the power by giving it mana scaling while they decreased the duration because at the time 7/12 with 40% CDR was 7/7.2 (which was 98% uptime), and now with 45% CDR it&#039;d be 7/6.8, actually having over 100% uptime. Now it&#039;s only 5/7.2 and 5/6.8.\n\nI have no idea what numbers would work but I think something more like 4/18 -&gt; 4/10.8 might be more appropriate for the W while the E might have something more like 3.5/8 -&gt; 3.5/4.8 (as opposed to its current 5/11 -&gt; 5/6.6.).","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-12T03:58:54.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Make urgot R his Q but with any damage taken interrupting it","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-07-12T16:18:24.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lul wut","replies":[]}]}]}
