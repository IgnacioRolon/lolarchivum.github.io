They&rsquo;re born, they live, and they die: all without meaning. It makes no difference whether they die in a week or in a year - one moment they&rsquo;re alive and the next they&rsquo;re not. It doesn&rsquo;t matter who they were before, whether they were old, young, man, woman, good, bad. Nothing is more certain than death, except perhaps love.\r\n\r\nEveryone lives for love. For most this is a love of family. For others it is a lonelier calling, such as a love of duty or a love of knowledge. No one love is without merit, and few love but one love. But not all loves are equal, and few loves can match Khada Jhin&rsquo;s love of killing.\r\n\r\nWhen a person dies their life ends and yet their flesh remains. Each drop of blood spilled and spent paints a picture giving insight into the story of their lives in their most important moment: death. It is in these moments where people perform their final feeble dying acts that Jhin is truly alive. To most murder is nothing more than the destruction of lives, but to Jhin it is transformative; to Jhin it is the creation of something more. As his magically charged bullets and blades tear through hapless victims a greater art unfolds.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nToday was the day. Jhin had spent weeks preparing for this performance. The traps were set, and the rifle was ready. He looked up at the sky, as if check the time of day by the rising sun, but it was blocked out by the the noxious clouds from Zaun&rsquo;s dubiously legal and definitely unethical thaumaturgical industry. Were it not for the street lights and the pale bioluminescence radiating out from the sewer grates it would&rsquo;ve been pitch black. Despite all of it&rsquo;s quirks and safety hazards Jhin appreciated the city&rsquo;s emphasis on freedom and innovation. It was a shame he had to work there, but to make truly great art there must be sacrifices.\r\n\r\nJhin assumed a firing stance, and stared through the scope towards his target. He had a clear shot to the stage in front of the council building, although nobody would be there for hours: this was simply a dress rehearsal. Zaun was in the midst of an election and at noon there was to be a political candidate making empty promises regarding the treatment of the disenfranchised lower classes of Zaun. A noble cause, one that he would die for.\r\n\r\nHowever it was never so simple. Earlier in the morning the peasants and peons would get the factories running, and the sump works directly between Jhin&rsquo;s alcove and the council building would fill the air with smoke - by noon it would be impossible to see through. Of course that was exactly why Jhin had selected his perch in a clock tower obscured by smog more than a kilometer away from the stage: nobody would be expecting it.\r\n\r\nWere it his usual artistry, he&rsquo;d be using Whisper loaded with chi-infused bullets and have placed lotus traps behind the podium which would simply let him feel when and where to fire. But today had called for a more subtle approach. Jhin readied the Piltover rifle in his hands that he&rsquo;d practiced using for weeks and drew a bead to the empty podium.\r\n\r\nIt was perfection: all Jhin had to do was wait in position until noon. When the bell tolled, he&rsquo;d fire a single shot through the smog, with the bell&rsquo;s chime silencing the report of the rifle. By the time anyone checked the clock tower he&rsquo;d be long gone, leaving no sign of his work but the smoking gun.\r\n\r\nThe politician would become a martyr to his people, doing more in death than he&rsquo;d ever hoped to accomplish in life. The people would see through the framing for what it was and Zaun would tear itself apart as the working class rose up against their corrupt council. It would be weeks before the council forcibly restored order, and months before they realized that none of their own had arranged the assassination. Having cleared their own council of that specific crime the wrath of Zaun would turn towards Piltover and from there things would escalate uncontrollably.\r\n\r\nThe bell tolled. Jhin sat motionless. Four more hours of waiting was a small sacrifice to start a conflict that would spread his art to the farthest reaches of Runeterra. His performance would bring meaning to their lives. And then they would die.\r\n\r\nToday was the day.","replies":[{"poster":"War Wrecker","date":"2016-07-09T15:32:19.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wordcount 754.\n\nBefore anyone asks about the presence or lack thereof of “fours”, firstly Jhin is not written like that in his quotes or his background lore, and secondly it’s terrible, I tried it and it just doesn’t work.\n\nIn my interpretation of the character outside of “summoner’s rift” this is very much an average day in the life of Jhin, nothing more than plotting, planning, scheming, and then the waiting before the pay off. As a perfectionist master assassin magical sniper Jhin would realistically spend the vast majority of his time simply waiting and I felt nothing would capture Jhin better than internal dialog regarding an upcoming performance.\n\nAnd sure for some political destabilization might be considered out of the ordinary but for Jhin it was just Tuesday.","replies":[]}]}
