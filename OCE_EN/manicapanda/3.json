I was wondering if we could find out the individual artists who do the splash art&#039;s? Specifically for the Project splashes so those of us that want to could do a little research and look at other work they might of done in the past for Riot and on their own.\n\nA big thank you too, to all the artists it&#039;s awesome seeing our favourite characters in a new light every time a new skin comes out really appreciate and love the work you guys do.","replies":[{"poster":"Jimz","date":"2015-09-10T02:49:05.261+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are the personal sites of some of our concept artists.\n\nhttps://christianfell.carbonmade.com/\nhttp://www.jasonchanart.com/\nhttp://alexflores.deviantart.com/gallery/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Manicapanda","date":"2015-09-10T06:30:10.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you :) And thank Marauder for me if he got you to reply to this :) You guys are awesome!\n\nIs there any chance Riot will ever give us some kind of art board or directory to the artists who work so hard on all of these amazing splashes?","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-10T07:20:02.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is one on NA","replies":[]}]}]}
