Is this actually working correctly as is or should she actually gain stacks? She is the source of the poison effect after all.\r\n\r\nI've been contemplating the stupidity of trying to Cassiopeia jungle just for the fun and as an experiment however the inability to stack her poison off anything except the minion kills makes things very difficult.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-05T22:28:11.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> What are peoples thoughts on the interaction of gromps buff from being smout and cassiopeia's passive?
