Wanting to know whether having a diverse champion pool is better than one-tricking or playing very similar charles. (eg. Just hook champions) \r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2019-11-06T10:31:07.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a support main, and while I can play pretty much all supports to a decent level, I usually pick one to one trick each season. \nI find climbing a lot easier that way, you are really familiar with the match ups and since support is usually autofilled you often have that advantage as well. \n\nIn saying this, it is also important to have a small champion pool behind your one trick just in case it gets banned or your team is missing something really important. \n\nI would suggest something along the lines of:\n\n* **Engage support** - looks like you and your hook play style has this covered\n\n* **tank support** -  looks like you have this covered as well, thresh can be build off-tank and naut is a tanky boi. \n\n* **Mage support** - the understated and often flamed support. Mage supports are really handy to have because quite often in soloq you will have a team of full AD. Picking something like a brand or a zyra will help your team because its likely the enemies will build armor and forget about you, and you will shred them on behalf of your team. It's also pretty handy to have in case you have a less than skilled ADC and need to carry the game.\n*  **Enchanter support**  - the heal/shield. There are definitely times when the meta favors these types of supports, they are also pretty handy to whip out if you check your ADC in champ select and they die a lot or are going into a poke match up and you don't trust them. Good, easy enchanter like Raka or someone a bit more durable like Janna are pretty easy to pick up. \n\n\nEveryone has their own play styles and some will find it easier having a decent pool of champs and matching their opponents and optimizing adc-support synergy, and others will find it better to one trick a champion and to learn everything about each matchup. Have a play around and find what works best for you ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-06T07:56:06.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am a fan of having a larger pool of champions at my disposal.\n\nI personally find one-tricking actually detrimental to the game itself. _(Although not necessarily to the player themselves)_\n\nI agree with what Seras has said, start small just play who you like.  And focus on learning the ins and outs of the overall game.  Once you’re comfortable with that, branch out, try as many as you can, and then refine into a pool of champs you’re comfortable with, enjoy, and can perform with.\n\nHaving a wider pool of champions means you not only know how to play those champs well, but you know how to play against them too!  And what champions in your pool cover the weaknesses of other ones.\n\nFor example, If Twisted Fate is one of your champs, that’s great but when you have to VS a Zed, you’re going to go through hell.\nBut you have a champ like Swain, you can pick more safely into Zed, rather than jumping in as TF because he’s the only champ you’re comfortable with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-05T15:37:59.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are pros and cons to both.\n\nMore variety in the champs you play means more champs you know more intimately. Knowing one champ really well and sticking with it means you can focus more on other aspects of gameplay than just champion mechanics.\n\nSome of it comes down to personal preference too. Ultimately, this is a game and you should be having fun before anything else, but do acknowledge that doing purely one or the other will leave you with some weaknesses to account for.\n\nAs Jackayy mentioned, playing only support comes with its own strengths and weaknesses as well. I disagree in that I feel support is a perfectly adequate role to learn on but again it's about being aware of your weaknesses and working on them if you're wanting to improve.\n\nSupport will teach you map awareness, playing as a team, and vision control faster than most other roles (Jungle shares much of this to varying degrees), but you will also lack practice and experience with CSing and solo lane trading and can develop a heavier dependency on other players.\n\nPersonally, I would say real early, stick to one or two champs you like, and learn the game first. Once you have a decent grasp of the game mechanics, diversify your champion pool and therefore champ knowledge and flexibility. Once you have a good grasp of those narrow down your pool and focus on your weak points. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAgain though, it's personal preference, and everyone learns differently. The fastest way to improve is to identify your weaknesses, and find what works for you to improve them. If that's playing the champ you struggle against, or practicing certain combos in practice tool, or whether it's just getting a mate to 1v1 you depends on you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jackayy","date":"2019-11-05T12:59:42.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't recommended playing support to learn the game because you wont learn to cs which is a big part try to pick someone like ashe or jhin but what I learnt was that support holds back alot of potential in learning","replies":[]}]}
