(mostly because the old client is about to be deleted permanently soon)\n\nNew client works, it has it's issues, bugs and glitches but they hopefully will be fixed as Riot are investing time and effort into the new client.\nIt's missing features that some people like, but that's not a problem since those features were only used by less than 5% of the community, and honestly in my eyes if less than 5% of the community used those features they shouldn't come back.\n\nThe new client looks better, and is faster than the old client.\nI haven't had enough time to put it to the test though since I've switched over to it, I've had my time taken up mostly by Warframe, LoZ:BotW and ME:Andromeda.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-28T06:38:03.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The new one is like having a ufo, but only having a chipset from a toaster to use in it for most people.\n\nIts high and fancy and all that, but their comps arent strong enough to run it, so its slow and laggy.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2017-03-28T05:33:34.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer the old one, I'm more used to the interface and legacy runs much much smoother for me\n\nI'll really miss the old client when it's completely replaced...:c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-28T05:09:01.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still on the old client.
