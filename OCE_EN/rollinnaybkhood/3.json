If you&#039;re on a winning streak? Tough, you&#039;re going to eventually lose a whole lot of games after that, basically wasting your efforts and time. Ranked games are such a coin flip now, I honestly feel like this game doesn&#039;t take skill into account at all and typically puts you in an elo where your team is full of monkeys and your enemies are just ten times better, don&#039;t believe me? I&#039;ve deadass been matched against gold 1s as a silver 1. My team ranges from silver 3 - gold 5 whereas the other team ranks from gold 5-2, what kinda bullshit is that?\r\n\r\n[Click here to see my match history.](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=BloodS3)\r\n\r\nI in no means am saying I&#039;m a &quot;FANTASTIC 10/10 IGN WOULD BANG AGAIN OMG FAKER WHAT WAS THAT! POGCHAMP&quot; player but I&#039;m DEFINITELY not the worst.\r\n\r\nHonestly I feel like riot needs to fix their matchmaking system, its so bad compared to other ranked queues. They shouldn&#039;t punish a player for doing good, I know that riot attempts to force a 50% w/r for &quot;reasons&quot; but I feel as its unfair for a player who are THAT good to be held down because of such constraints. Its honestly frustrating for someone to play well just for them to be put into teams where the players have been on a 7-10 game losing streak just because you&#039;ve been winning way too many games. \r\n\r\nI have a couple friends who are diamond and have said the same exact thing, &quot;it doesn&#039;t matter about how good you are, if you spend a lot of time on the game you&#039;ll eventually reach diamond without really having to improve much other than your mechanics. The real test is after diamond 3+.&quot; and in my opinion, I believe them. I spent a whole season just trying to improve and I&#039;ve gotten to the point where I can win lane decently and can extend my lead, however that&#039;s all in vein when you have players that go 0/20 in 30 minutes, and even when given a lead, it&#039;s always thrown away. Don&#039;t get me wrong, I don&#039;t ALWAYS lose games because of that, I&#039;m just saying when I do play EXTREMELY well which is in most of my games (most of the time during win streaks), the system decides to put me or really anyone in a game with 4 other retards in which I get a laner that isn&#039;t someone that I&#039;m supposed to be vsing. Like come on, you&#039;re really going to match me against a plat 5 Lucian and a gold 2 soraka when I&#039;m silver 1? \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t get it twisted, I do lose lane from time to time as well. And I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m sometimes the reason why my team DOES lose.\r\n\r\nYes, you do need to improve. However, you&#039;ll eventually climb to the rank you want if you keep playing and make slight changes to your game play. It&#039;ll take you a couple seasons to get their depending on what the goal is. You&#039;ll just have to deal with a shit ton of cancer during your climb as you&#039;ll be punished for winning!\r\n\r\nAs for some of you high elo players who are arrogant and say &quot;Get good&quot; &quot;You&#039;re just bad&quot; &quot;To be X rank you have to play as X rank&quot;, get off your high horse. You&#039;re high elo because you spent a shit load of time on this game that literally hinders your success and makes you grind even more for a rank. You CANNOT say that you haven&#039;t been through MANY setbacks during your climbs to anything equal or higher than diamond. Most of you that are diamond+ say its easy because, YOU&#039;RE HIGH ELO.  Its like me saying bronze is easy to get out of cause I&#039;m silver even though I spent countless hours struggling and pleading with cancerous teammates not to feed/int/afk. Try making an alternate account and try to climb straight from bronze 5 to diamond+ and see how many wins:losses you get. I bet you any money even Faker wouldn&#039;t be able to maintain a w/r higher than 60% during that climb.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-10-03T18:02:15.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fully agree.
