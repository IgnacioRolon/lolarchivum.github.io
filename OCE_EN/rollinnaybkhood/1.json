I find this to be stupid due to the fact that sometimes people have the skill level of a diamond but still lose in silver/gold (examples would include pro LCS players). Now i know what you maybe thinking however, this is **definitely** not a QQ thread. Its just annoying when people say that &#039;improving as a player&#039; will help you climb which  is true to an extent but is still complete bullshit. One person in this game cannot carry solo, otherwise there would be an influx of smurfs playing this game which would be even more annoying.\n\nHowever there are so many people that i have seen in silver elo that should belong in bronze V, and trust me, i&#039;ve climbed from B5 to S5 in one season playing Vayne adc, and to be quite frank, imo that was all luck due to the fact that i found so many good team mates that ended up carrying me. Sure i was dealing dps and had the most kills at the end of the game, but the people in those games never fed.\n\nThings like \n\n&#039;Mute your team mates&#039;\n&#039;Ward&#039;\n&#039;Practise&#039;\n\nIs understandable, IF THIS WAS A SOLO CARRY GAME. I believe that if you feed, and your team is trying hard to win, it is definitely YOUR fault if you lose, however if your team is feeding and you try all you can to stop them but they decide to run into 1v5&#039;s because they thought it was a &#039;good idea&#039;; it is never your fault.\n\nAs dunkey has stated about this game\n&#039;Pro league of legends are in matches where all 10 guys are amazing at the game, in real league of legends theres gonna be 3 decent guys and 7 retards.&#039;\neven GOSU himself has said that \n&#039;solo queue is such a coin flip&#039;\n\n\nAlso another thing that tilts me about this game, the LP system.. oh god..\n\nImproving as a player increases your LP? nope. Wins/loses determine your LP and rank, if this was a game that based their LP around individual skill, people would be earning LP even if they lost but played so perfectly. You lose or gain the same amount of LP no matter who is on your team, +19 if win and you&#039;re silver playing with bronze 5&#039;s, or -19 if you lose playing against challengers. its not like if you go 18/0 and get 3 inhibs, 2 barons, 9 towers, and the past 3 drags all by yourself and lose, you&#039;re gonna (-5) LP only, NO! You lose a whole 19 LP and 40 mins of your time because of that AP tryndamere that could.\n\nThis is why sometimes i like DotA 2&#039;s MMR system, it actually bases your skill with MMR, if you lose a game as a support but you ward, heal, stun, shield, and stayed with your carry... YOU GAIN MMR! that is what you would classify as a game that bases rank off &#039;SKILL&#039;.\n\nNow i&#039;m not saying that its never my fault that i don&#039;t win games, i&#039;m saying that if you&#039;re basically trying climb and get to challenger, /JUST/ improving as a player isn&#039;t going to get you there, your team is a major factor as well.\n\nyou&#039;ll see this dude &gt;&gt;&gt; {{champion:8}}  \ntaking shit like this &gt;&gt;&gt; {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:1}} \nwith items like this &gt;&gt;&gt; {{item:3812}} {{item:1412}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3070}} \n\nas a mid laner... like how are you supposed to win with people like that? ward placements?!","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-10-09T12:11:31.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoyed BloodS3's post, it was quite a good read.

Your attitude and anger have to be controlled to get to a higher rank?! nope, take a look at Nightblue3, tyler1, grossgore, etc..\n\nThe most annoying one is when you are the top laner and split pusher (e.g. a Tryndamere or Kayle) , but you team is crying for you to group, even though it would take more than 2 enemies to kill you in the splitpush because you are so fed. Your team meanwhile are not very fed at all. You tell them to just not fight, and to back off if 5 enemies come forward at them. Also you tell them to ward the side of the lane that they are in. Then one of the retards presses go and loses a stupid 4 v 5 battle, and the opposition take all of your towers and essentially win the game. \"FUCK YOU, YOU DIDN'T GROUP\" is the warcry because their understanding of how to play splitpushing is severely lacking (btw this is true in most cases under Diamond level). All they had to do was listen to you and the game was a free win. Except they had to be heroes and try for kills. Frustrating.\n\n> I, in no way agree that i&amp;#039;m a good player, but when people say that the way to improve is to blame yourself and say, &amp;#039;hey, what could i have done better?&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;maybe i should improve on something&amp;#039;.

One person in this game cannot carry solo, otherwise there would be an influx of smurfs playing this game which would be even more annoying.\n\nIn OCE most smurfs cheat using scripts to boost people, because of how random the matchmaking is in the lower divisions. Skill levels are all over the place. Some players might be only good at micro and mechanics, others only at macro, others only at farming, others only at vision control, etc etc. Essentially OCE is a very bad region in terms of skill level. You can see this when the pro teams go to international events. They can gain leads or apparent leads and just shit the bad afterwards, they always do.\nIt is true that the game has shifted from the solo carry of the past (e.g. seasons 2 and 3) into a more team orientated game, and this is why often you hear people in low elo saying \"pick tanks!\" because at lower elos, macro plays and engages and teamfights are generally played poorly, and tanks are a cover for that weakness. Also at lower elos opposition don't punish tanks early enough, crossmap plays are not attempted etc etc.\nSo yeah to take a one game sample size is just not realistic when it comes to improving. You'll need to consistently improve all areas of your game to become a better player. Eventually after many games of grinding, you will start to climb. This includes many frustrations. For example, my friend has played over 2000 ranked games this season and they went from silver 5 ---> platinum 2, but it was only in the last month of so did they clear the elo hell divisions (gold 5, plat 5) and the game seems to be more enjoyable. And matchmaking is seemingly better for them, but it sometimes depends on the time of the day whether many players are online or not (they still get the odd gold shitter ruining their games).\n\n> However there are so many people that i have seen in silver elo that should belong in bronze V\n\nVery much so, especially in Silver 5. The quality of gameplay in that division imo, is worse than in Bronze 1 and 2. This is because of a mental block that players have, thinking that Silver 5 is some promised land. Either they got boosted there, placed into it, or lucked into it, and now don't want to drop to where they really belong. These sorts of players are not even focusing on the game at hand, and only their division, lp, kills or other irrelevant shit that doesn't matter to their current game. When the reality is that Silver 5 is only about 50 MMR away from Bronze 1. I think Riot should really do away with Divisions entirely, and just list players MMR numbers like they used to. However I doubt whether they will change this, because it covers up for the inadequate matchmaking at the extreme ends of divisions.\n\n> Is understandable, IF THIS WAS A SOLO CARRY GAME.

If 4 monkeys beat their chests at the same time, there's not much you can do about it. But like I say, 1 game is a bad sample size when considering climbing overall.\n\n> This is why sometimes i like DotA 2&amp;#039;s MMR system, it actually bases your skill with MMR, if you lose a game as a support but you ward, heal, stun, shield, and stayed with your carry... YOU GAIN MMR! that is what you would classify as a game that bases rank off &amp;#039;SKILL&amp;#039;.\n\nI think Riot are hesitant to produce such a system because of the fear of creating \"KDA players\", or \"Mission players\". Its certainly something to factor in, however. I believe a much harder system of qualification for ranked would do wonders for all western servers though. For example, having a certain amount of wins in normals before qualifying for ranked. Something like 200. Players in the past had more pride when attempting ranked, now any noob that buys an account just jumps straight into it.\nAnother thing they could do is revise the tutorials. For example, currently most bronze have no clue what experience and farming mean to them and their team. This should be emphasized in a tutorial. Currently they have the battle training and basic tutorials which are so basic that players that pass those can still lose to bots in co-op mode. Ranked qualification throwing in newbies before they are ready weakens and demoralises players a lot. When you are on that team with the newbie level 30 player doing their first few games in ranked and bumbled (got carried) in their first game to a win and in the 2nd game are versing all Gold players, is not a nice scene for them or their team.\n \n> you&amp;#039;ll see this dude &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {{champion:8}}  \n> taking shit like this &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {{summoner:11}} {{summoner:1}} \n> with items like this &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {{item:3812}} {{item:1412}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3107}} {{item:3070}} \n> \n> as a mid laner... like how are you supposed to win with people like that? ward placements?!\n\nYep you can chalk that game down as a loss in your mind, but still play to win of course during the game. Just like the classic oce special of picking an all AD team in soloqueue when the opposition have tanks in their team. And the classic oce special of that team only losing 50% of the time instead of 100%. \nSome players are adept at knowing when to dodge queues and when not to, but I agree that this sort of thing should be minimised by better tutorials and better qualifications for ranked games. Overall using a chess rating system (where there is no one else but youself to blame for losses) for a team game, even though they consider it to be reworked for team play, just does not seem like the best solution. \n\nHaving said that, if you play more games of ranked in a season, chances are you will eventually climb. Remember that merely by playing ranked and thinking about what happened in your games, is slow improvement. It just may not be feasible for those players that have other interests in life and cannot devote a lot of time to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RollinNaybkhood","date":"2017-10-08T15:22:16.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, if you earned like a small amount like +5 or lost that same amount for doing a lot of damage to enemies/towers/objectives or getting a lot of kills/CS, it wouldn't be completely demoralising.

The fact is, there's a lot of factors to consider when talking about how to win in LoL (and similar games). I think it's fair to say that most of them make you reliant on other players. The main factors that are solely within the control of the individual, however, are attitude, ability and knowledge. It doesn't matter if someone else is a toxic piece of sh!t if you're able to control your attitude and come out positive (or at least neutral). It doesn't matter if someone else has terrible mechanics if your mechanics are good. It doesn't matter if someone else has no idea what they're doing if you know what to do and when. All that applies, so long as you think in terms of the individual and not the team. That might seem contradictory to the basis of a team game, but there are certain aspects that require you to think of yourself (the individual) rather than the team, in my opinion. The way you, as an individual, play and communicate can make a lot of difference, even be the difference between a win and a loss in some cases.\n\nI'm going to finish this response by asking you to reflect on your place in the game and the teams you get matched with, not in a sense of \"what could you be doing better\" or \"what is keeping you from solo carrying\" but rather, \"what are you contributing to your teams\", \"can you objectively recognise what others are contributing to teams\" and probably most importantly \"when a toxic situation surfaces, how are you responding to that\" (are you fuelling the situation, trying to prevent/disarm it, or doing nothing either way). You might find your presence, as an individual, can be more impactful than you currently believe.\n\n######PS: Again, that's not to say there aren't a lot of factors that involve the team as a whole, but this is the kind of stuff you alone *can* control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shazrobot","date":"2017-10-08T09:36:59.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree you said that 'DotA 2's MMR system, it actually bases your skill with MMR' cause most people do realistically think that \"**you need skill to climb ratings**\" or even to \"**improve your attitude**\".
