I remember when you would reach late game as an ADC you would do around 40k damage if not more, nowadays I'm only doing 27k-30k and this is from me actually being fed with a 50% or more kill participation. \r\n\r\nLet's say a Xerath and a Vayne are on the same team and were to do evenly. Late game for some reason the Xerath would probably do 20k+ more damage than the Vayne even though it seemed to the Vayne that she did way more damage. Not only that for some reason a 0/3 mid laner could probably destroy a  8/1 ADC if they don't have heal/flash. Don't take this thread as me crying or bashing on any role, if anything I'm more concerned about the state of ADC and if its still viable to play ADC.\r\n\r\nI just wanna discuss why this is the case when in previous seasons a mid laner wouldn't even come close to doing the same amount of damage as an ADC late game unless playing some hyper carry or being stupidly ahead. Its really sad that an ADC has to position themselves{{champion:119}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:96}} , use all their abilities{{champion:236}}{{champion:202}}   and kite while at the same time worry about tanks running at them{{champion:67}}  {{champion:222}}{{champion:145}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:15}}  whereas a mid laner can just press 1 button and delete an ADC. {{champion:134}} {{champion:30}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:131}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:101}} Its so demoralising how useful these champs can still be even when behind and the best part is building defence will do absolutely nothing as an ADC, their kits have that much damage that even building MR wouldn't make a difference. Its annoying to hear someone say build MR when even if I do I'll just be wasting time cause Annie can press R, Q, W and ignite me which kills me in about 2 seconds, regardless if I have QSS or not I'll still die.","replies":[{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T09:49:00.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh also if ur melee adc make tiamats and if ranged make runaans thats why they are there, aoe dmg in a multiple opponenet lane\nif ur hybrid adc make shiv\nif ur apc echoes\n\n\"tank carrys(sups)\" make bamis &amp; abysal mask to scale and synergize with ap hybrid or pure dmg sources in lane\n\"bruiser carrys(sups)\" make bc and combo best with hybrid or ad dmg output sources in lane\n\nu share the shred\n\nalso for grevious wounds if u need multiple its best on the ad dmg source as its only 800 gold for ad compared to fully completed morelanomicon for ap, and tanks run ignite\n\nan adc investing 800g early into executioners calling for the lane is fucking massive especially if ur supports a tank/hook/rushing bc or other specialty item/ap\n\nbad adcs are one dimensional\nbad players in general\nbut especially adcs its probably the worse for it\nu see the heads**t meme for sups but it really is truely for adcs. at least sups seem to be marginally taught to roam mid with mobi boots. adcs are taught to spam pings uselessly the second something is even slightly off variance, like, go fly a kite.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-14T08:44:28.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats becuase the multiplicative increase based on teams with funnelling mentalities as well as positioninal skill in teamfights and orientating macro multiple macro moves ahead (generally led by the team opener who is also team captain) taking proactive steps which are dynamic and unfolding with each game plan. tldr quality of player over time has decreased so that is why you are seeing this after affect.\n\ntldr get good\n\nur also probably not building runes items summoners right.\n\nalso lane rotation after season 7 dissapeared and out of anything else id point to that as the reason for the \"elo\"(no such thing, apples and oranges, dumb unironic unintentional bad \"meme\") inflation.\n\n\npara 2\n\nyes adcs are meant to get big\nbut so are mids\nbecause a mid lane rotates\nand the headsl*t mentality of botlaners doesnt adapt or have any idea how to respond to this, they think its a coin flip binary 1-0 on how to play a stagnating custom scenario static map which is now a decade and a half old.","replies":[]}]}
