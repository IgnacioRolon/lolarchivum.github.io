High-five for getting through that wall of text and another if you try to help me :)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-22T04:02:00.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\n>My MacBook and family computer which is a Windows computer can not connect to the Log In, Create Discussion and Support functions of this website\n\nDo you receive an error when attempting to load these pages?\nCould you try switching to a public DNS for me, let me know if the issue persists (Both issues, steps outlined below)\n\n**WINDOWS 8**\n\n* Hit the Windows Key\n* Type **\"Control Panel\"**\n* Select **\"Network and Internet\"**\n* Select **\"Network and Sharing Center\"**\n* Select **\"Change Adapter Settings\"** on the navigation bar on the left\n* Right click on your network adapter and select **\"Properties\"**\n* Select **\"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\"** and open **\"Properties\"**\n* Go to the bottom of the menu and change **\"Obtain DNS server address automatically,\"** to **\"Use the following DNS server addresses:\"**\n* Put in the following public DNS servers, one in each empty field:\n\n  * **8.8.8.8 **\n  * **8.8.4.4**\n\n* Save your changes by selecting **\"Ok\"**\n* Close all open web browsers and applications\n* Hit the Windows Key\n* Right click anywhere\n* Click on **\"All Apps\"**\n* Right click **\"Command Prompt\"** and run as administrator\n* Type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press Enter.\n* Restart your computer\n\n**WINDOWS 7**\n\n* Open the Start Menu\n* Open Control Panel\n* Select **\"Network and Internet\"**\n* Select **\"Network and Sharing Center\"**\n* Select **\"Change Adapter Settings\"** on the navigation bar on the left\n* Right click on your network adapter and select **\"Properties\"**\n* Select **\"Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)\"** and open Properties\n* Go to the bottom of the menu and change **'Obtain DNS server address automatically,'** to **'Use the following DNS server addresses:'**\n* Put in the following public DNS servers, one in each empty field:\n\n  * **8.8.8.8 **\n  * **8.8.4.4**\n\n* Save your changes by selecting **\"Ok\"**\n* Close all open web browsers and applications\n* Press the Windows Key\n* In the Search bar type command prompt\n* Right click on the result and select **Run as Administrator**\n* In the command prompt type **ipconfig /flushdns** and press Enter.\n* Restart your computer\n\n**MacOS**\n\n* Open **System Preferences**\n* Open the **Network preference** pane\n* Select the active connection on the left, and click the \"**Advanced...**\" button in the lower right hand corner\n* Click \"**DNS**\" from the selection bar.\n* Remove any current DNS entries, and input the following public DNS servers:\n\n  * **8.8.8.8 **\n  * **8.8.4.4**\n\n* Save your changes by selecting \"**OK**\"\n* Apply the changes by clicking \"**Apply**\" in the lower right hand corner","replies":[{"poster":"OriginalName123","date":"2016-10-22T07:19:30.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Sephiroth my LoL has been fixed, there was a problem with my modem and my dad has fixed it somehow, thanks a lot for replying though.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-22T23:58:44.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would still recommend you to switch to a public DNS on all your machines.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
