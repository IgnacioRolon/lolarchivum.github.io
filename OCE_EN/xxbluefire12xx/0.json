I have never gotten banned or warned in ages, months and most likely years, i have only gotten chat banned once in my 6-10 years or less of playing this game, don&#039;t get me wrong. I absolutely &quot;LOVE&quot; LOL, it&#039;s my go to game everyday and have spent a lot of money on this game.. This goes on to leading me to think that these are mistaken bans, i have checked my E-Mail and the message was VERY vague, i do not know what i&#039;ve done wrong. If i have known what i have done wrong, i would might have thought that i have deserved it, but so far i do NOT know what we have wrong. This has led me astray, sad, worried, scared. I may have been warned once but that was so long ago i don&#039;t even remember, i&#039;m 100% &quot;SURE&quot; that that warning was at least MONTHS ago, i do not remember getting warnings over the past months and (or) weeks. Everyone and my friends have witnessed me and has no trouble at all at my toxicity levels, which quite frankly aren&#039;t even high, they have witnessed that i was never toxic throughout the whole time that we were friends. This ban has left us shocked and very saddened, i have been on this account for my whole life and has never been Quote on Quote &quot;F***ed over&quot; in about 10 years or less. I have gotten 1 chat ban, and 1 warning, that is all i remember in these years, we debate if my friend deserved that ban but we are sure that i did not deserve this un-righteous ban. We also debate if our ban is linked and we would like Riot to fix this problem, if i deserve the ban, please tell me why.\n\nSorry if my post text is bad i&#039;m not very good at writing sadly, but i&#039;m still learning! I have much more to say im sure but this is all i can muster out right now after these tragic events, i feel so bad.. Scared, worried, &quot;betrayed&quot;, left astray and not knowing what to do, what if this happens again? I dont get it, im very confused and i have major mixed feelings, i don&#039;t know if this is Riot games fault, or my friends fault that i just met, but i know that it should not be me. - A League Of Legends fan and veteran","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-09-15T02:55:57.400+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was a manual ban applied to your account.

We don't want to frighten you, but rather hope that you can take the time to reflect on what it is that triggers your unsportsmanlike behaviour and try to change how you react to frustration in your games.\nLoL is an intensely competitive game and it's obvious you care deeply about it, but how we handle that intensity and frustration is something we're all responsible for. There's no shame in being a reformed player and I hope you can turn it around before it becomes a more serious problem for yourself and your teammates.","replies":[{"poster":"xXBlueFire12Xx","date":"2016-09-16T06:26:13.189+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, but i wasn't the only one being toxic as they went on and encouraged me to continue and do so. I am a protective person and tend to defend myself, unless they keep going on, making me have to reply to get things straight. I normally do forgive, unless they keep going on of course, i know what i've done wrong and have had a few bad games before, i do realize that i have been a bit harsh on players but this normally is a rare occurrence. I have not been banned before and banned this late before at a weird coincidental time so that lead me onto thinking that it was a bit weird, i've been on each end of the spectrum and know how it feels. I take full responsibility but sometimes people get on my nerves and quite easily, i have had issues with anger before but it has currently been improving over the past few years and will hopefully continue to do so, like i said. This is a very rare occurrence and that i'm very sorry for my behavior and that this is my first ban (a late ban at that), i'm normally quite the opposite of that and will continue to improve on my actions, that's what i'm to say right now and i might come back to this to add some more.

The instant feedback system is strict in regards to what it bans as it needs to maintain an extremely high level of certainty.\n\nYour assumption regarding how a player's reputation within the system is tracked is also incorrect. If a player is unsportsmanlike enough to receive a chat restriction automatically, they've probably been reported quite a lot of times or have been extremely abusive to their fellow summoners. However, if they play enough games while showing improvement in their behaviour then they will NOT be automatically bumped up to a time ban or permaban the next time they fly off the handle.\nIf a player with a chat restriction continues to show unsportsmanlike behaviour then of course they are likely to receive harsher punishments rather quickly.\nThis system in OCE is the same as in other regions.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-09-18T13:37:27.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is a guy mute every 1 ? and play game but he did bad in game and his tea mates report him for intentional feeding? but he didn't then ? how much chances of his account getting ban from instant feedback system ? 80 90% 100% ? need to know bcoz I am curious","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-09-19T14:06:35.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system is designed to ensure it does not ban players for just having a bad game.
