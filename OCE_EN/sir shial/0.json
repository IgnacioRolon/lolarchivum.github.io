I am single person who works on it and trying (now) to release new version each month. Upcoming one will include match details, simplification for tracking summoners and few smaller things. However I would like you to **like** community board and app on **Facebook** so more people will know about it. Please also leave a **comment** there. **Thanks in advance.** \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \r\nFeel free to add comments and suggestions with new functionality which you would like to have.
