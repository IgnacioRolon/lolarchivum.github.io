Some games I cannot even reconnect back to the game after I get disconnected. Some games do not even start at all and I get leavers. Like me, some other players do not reconnect too and they afk the game from the start because they failed to reconnect.\n\nAs Riot pointed it is Flips fault, so I am changing the internet service provider in 3 days, just waiting for technician. Then I can surely know if it is at Riots end. Since this game lags on Telstra clear internet too. It lags on well equipped Internet Cafes(on both internet cafes i visit frequently) after the patch 5.2. \n\nEvery other game, like Destiny plays flawlessly. I can see LOL consuming my bandwidth crazy more than any other high demanding game I play and still lag or disconnect.\n\nHopefully you guys can resolve the issues. Counting on you guys. Damage is already done, just try to fix it so we can start playing again.\n\ncheers for looking into it.","replies":[{"poster":"SG Booby","date":"2015-02-11T02:21:49.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play useing telstra and i very rarely if ever dc maybe something is wrong with you internet/computer?

On help and support there is a top stickied called \"Lags and disconnections.\" Did you even take the time to read those stickies before making an unthoughtful post? \n\nWhat you are saying is in your last game 10 games most of the players intentionally left right? And they must be all trolls conspiring you to loose? So they must all be banned. Oceania already has less players, lol. \n\nRead my 25+ posts that I have made on the help and support board about the recent server issues in Oceania. Even well equipped Internet Cafes are experiencing lags and disconnections due to Riot's ongoing server issues. They have fiber optic speed, and still lag and now think about that for a second. \n\nIf you are one of those lucky few who never had any disconnections ever in your gaming life, then you must be quite lucky. In an ideal world you can come across 2 percent of the population afk. At this moment, me and my friends are all having lag issues and we got Fibre connection too. So easily expect 10 percent or more people could be going afk in the least until the server issues are resolved.\n\nDon't play ranked at the moment on Solo queue unless you are playing ranked team 5vs5 or 3vs3 and you know everyone in your team never had lag issues in their life and then you can climb elo. \n\nPlease take time to read the stickied posts next time, Friend.\n\nHave fun and Good Luck in the field of justice. :)","replies":[{"poster":"SG Booby","date":"2015-02-09T02:09:40.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.
