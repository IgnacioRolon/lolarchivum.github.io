Team fights, wrong positioning, tunnel vision, 3v5 engage 4v5 engage.\r\nObvious of low silver knowledge and skill level, just 1 of them can bring other 4 honest player to certain lose, and 5 other player to won the game but not challenged, basically changes nothing but only one factor, ALL player&#039;s total number of games to reach their MMR.\r\n  \r\nknowing there is not much way to determine a player is boosting or not unless they admit it, RIOT should focus resource on pinning down the boosting service, need to spend lots time and resource pursuing well hidden web domain and boosters using vpn claiming its safe from RIOT&#039;s banning but, this is the one and only thing individual or even a community of players can not do, because we do not own the game, we can not file complains to those website&#039;s service provider, as to the responsibility to maintain the match making balance is this game&#039;s owner, RIOT.","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-09T23:13:56.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remove the pictures dude","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-09T21:33:42.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-08-09T08:35:45.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're giving them free advertising by doing this, wont be surprised if this thread gets removed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-08-09T05:19:56.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are banning players who eloboost, and people who get eloboosted.\n\nPosting this does nothing but advertise for that boosting company.","replies":[]}]}
