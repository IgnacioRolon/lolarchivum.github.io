They have post in champion selection of Links to their account, the OP.GG links which is very useful to check player statistics,  and I think they are telling the truth looking at the stats.\r\n\r\nWHY? They had 80%~100% win rate, with over 13~20KDA, literally have 10 times then average player&#039;s KDA, which is a big deal looking at it,(We all know the average player stay in same tier/division will have around 2kda, and above 3~5+ in average will take them to next division very soon), so by having around 6~10 times more of  the average KDA, I believe they are real Higher tier players being smurf, at least higher than high Gold to Low Plat as our match up.\r\n\r\nNow Smurf playing in lower division wasn&#039;t new and not a big deal, they stream and have good value in their channel and I respect those work.\r\nBut this matter is pointing to Selling/Buying Boosted accounts, which the whole community will have issue in long term.\r\n-------------------------------\r\nWhat Issue?\r\nLower skilled player thinks\"I get out of elo hell then I will do fine, cash a higher elo account wont hurt\", nope it will hurt, the ELO and gameplay is 100% numbers and statistic as the fact, you pay respect and have more knowledge of the game thus playing better than others in same tier/division, the KDA and win rate will naturally go up.  \r\nIf you buy boosted High elo tier account just  to look flashy to your friends, I get it and no biggy, but if you click RANKED game, the obvious lower skilled will have deadly KDA to the team and most certainly a lose game of 4v6, and the bought account&#039;s elo drop back to the tier where it belong, literally no point of buying it except to make matches messed up.(seen it many many times where all player have steady average 2.5 kda or 3+ climbing or in placement, and then the special someone is at 1kda or lower, especially when the school is on holiday, the bought boosted accounts leashed with the main owner, around 20% to 40% highest peak of them in one game of 10 players)\r\n\r\nIn shorts of effects;\r\nWe are playing a game at our tier with average 3 KDA, a 15KDA player came and stomp the game.\r\nWe are playing a game at our tier with average 3 KDA, a 0.5KDA player came and rekt the game.\r\nthe above two balanced out and create no effect in long-term to individual&#039;s ELO, other than questions in our head and traumatized for a while.\r\n==but then I believe some player&#039;s action to this matter will be a loop-hole towards unethical gamer codes, such as\"I see smurfs, boosted accounts, I feel careless and helpless, decide to rage at everyone and cash for boosted accounts.\r\n\r\nA personal thought, to me, there is no elo hell, I have good kda, carrying and climbing now, still not sure where I will land because the kda and win rate is still higher than average  with the players I&#039;m matched with.\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nNOW BACK TO  THE  MAIN SUBJECT:\r\n\r\nBeginning of the game when they are asked, why are they here? what is their purpose of being  in this Tier?(High golds and low Plats)\r\n\r\nthe player \"Chi Chi 7\"(Gold 5) then said that, he owns 3 accounts boosting now, 1 account just sold \"Chi Chi 3\"(challenger 1).\r\n\r\nNow, the \"iRiven\" player did  not say anything in open chat  but still a suspect to the matter when they have DUOed 80% of their total game.\r\nHowever the \"Chi Chi 7\" player openly said how many boosting accounts he owns and have trading activities with the boosted account.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not just here to report, I will write a simple solution.\r\npin point \"Chi Chi 7\"&#039;s IP address, which is easy for RIOT, find out how many accounts coming from this IP, rest is up to RIOT to decide, PEMA BAN most likely.\r\nBecause this player already gave too much evidence in open game chat of boosting and selling accounts, even if the main account is never caught, \"Chi Chi 7\" and \"Chi Chi 3\" is already under suspect list or result of ban.\r\n\r\nThese 2 players has been playing for a while that one of random player ingame already knew they are smurfing, this issue is already a long term case.\r\n-----------------------------\r\nUnfortunately my screen capture software got all back screen out of in-game chats evidence I captured, so this is up to RIOT to trace back to this game&#039;s chat log.  \r\nNow I will attach a picture of the game result at scoreboard, with enough player ID for RIOTers to trace back to which game it was, it&#039;s also reported as \"Spamming\" on both of them at scoreboard so RIOT should have one more copy of game ID from reported issue.\r\n\r\nThe players I exposed ID with, Im sorry but this has to be done for them to trace the game, and don&#039;t feel shame of  scores, we are in a unfair match up from the beginning thanks to either RIOT does not care, or we didn&#039;t care enough and lodge millions of reports as we should be so RIOT would care.\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nTread carefully RIOT, this matter&#039;s result will mean the whole picture of  RIOT&#039;s regulatory & authority towards trading accounts with cash.\r\n\r\nLast thing, remember people, this game is great, respect it by keeping the community clean, report, feed back, raise moral decency.","replies":[{"poster":"ian0426915","date":"2015-06-16T06:01:08.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You didn't say how much they were selling the account for!

You're really committed to improving the community of OCE, and I can see that you'd just be a really good team-mate to have in-game (communication-wise). Unfortunately, reports are not permitted on the board. Specifically, this just encourages witch-hunts and further divides the community, as well as you putting your own account at risk (possibly from the people whom you're reporting, because this is usually confidential).\n\nYou can use the reporting system in-game to submit reports. If you want to submit a report as eloquent and detailed as this, you are best off [making a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nRiot are aware of the unhealthiness that smurfs, account boosters and account buyers bring, thus why it's against the EULA to trade accounts and/or play on one which you don't own. They're usually perma-banned when Riot do a ban wave, which is unfortunately not often enough.\n\nYou can keep the post and your points here, but I suggest removing all instances of their names from your post and the image. They are quite good.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
