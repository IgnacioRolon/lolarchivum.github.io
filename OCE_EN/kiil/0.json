Today i tried to log onto my League account that i have had for 3 or 4 years now and have put god knows how much money and time into. And it has come up with an error saying &quot;Your account is in the process of transferring&quot;. So i have come onto this website and tried to log in to see what has happened and it says that my username and password combination is incorrect. So confused i try to recover it by getting an email sent and changing my password. So i get the email and successfully change the password and it tells me so and then when i try to log onto my account with my new password it still says that my username and password combination is incorrect, and i am still getting the same error on the client. I then submitted a ticket with as much information as i can remember from the creation of one of my 3 accounts and send it off for some help and all i got back was: \r\n&quot;I understand your frustration, however we cannot proceed further, as the information provided is not enough for me in order to verify you as the original creator of the account. We are very much concerned with the safety of our player&#039;s accounts and details, which is why we must ensure that you are the creator, before we can make any changes.&quot;\r\nSo with no explanation whatsoever, and with all the relevant information that i can give them this is all i got and my account is gone forever.\r\n\r\nThis is terrible and i know that i am not the only one this has happened to. Pick up your game riot for gods sake.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:26:19.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't need to answer all the questions that Riot gives you, though the more the better. Lacking enough info to recover your account doesn't bode well for you being the original owner, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt here and assume you are.\n\nThe questions that Riot give to prove ownership are a guide really. Any information that is unique to but not visible on the account is useful.\n\nNOT useful would be a list of every skin you own, since an intruder can see that in the client.\n\nUSEFUL would be dates you bought skins (don't have to be exact, if you know you bought a skin when it released then that is hella useful since it's info that Riot can easily confirm and is easy for you to remember).\nUSEFUL would be how you acquired skins, i.e did you get x skin as a mystery gift/self mystery gift/gift from a friend (bonus if you know which friend)/from hextech crafting etc etc.\nUSEFUL would be prepaid card or skin codes that you've used in the past. (Not 100% sure on the skin codes, but I know prepaid cards are helpful)","replies":[]}]}
