Now I don&#039;t mind smurfs, however this guy has spent over $2k buying elo-boost for his other accounts which have already been permanently banned (excluding the couple hundred he has spent buying skins like Championship Riven etc.) I&#039;m sure that many of you have played against a smurf and sometimes possibly losing the entire game because of them. Having believed him for climbing himself, I realised that it was all a lie when yesterday I solo-qued.... and got matched up against a challenger smurf playing on his account. The purpose of this submission was to make him realise he is wasting his money like this and could clearly benefit off other purchases or by finally playing League Of Legends legitimately.\r\n\r\nSo I just wanted to ask Riot if there was any punishment available and applicable to this &#039;mate&#039;. \r\n\r\nHe has also been paying somebody to duo with him from Masters division.\r\n\r\nP.S = His current account QuadCarry was bought off somebody else.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, be alert for Elo boosters and keep our Rift clean!\r\n\r\nMuch love &lt;3\r\nHaiku","replies":[{"poster":"Draven Bot","date":"2015-09-03T09:07:10.701+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I would like to have this guy banned as well...\noh all those times i'm trying to climb and i get crushed.","replies":[{"poster":"Bungi","date":"2015-09-03T09:08:56.747+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think we all do lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"lyD","date":"2015-09-04T10:37:01.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It looks like he's duoing; not getting boosted... lol.\nSeems like you're simply salty that you lost to your 'mate' in a solo queue game?\n\nGold's really not a hard elo to play in, it doesn't take a challenger to completely destroy a gold player. You only need to know how to play your champion really well, be on a champion that has room for outplay and know the basics of wave control and zoning in order to deny CS.\n\nI can tell you now, if it was a challenger on his account he would have much better stats and winrates across the board. I personally consider myself around mid-high plat and I can quite easily achieve 80%+ winrate in gold elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Mott","date":"2015-09-07T12:40:34.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well his previous account was Bronze.
