I&#039;m at a constant 630+ ping now, and im dying. Thing is, my internet is fine - this happens purely whenever I play a game of league. I&#039;m tempted to say its not on my end, because literally everything else loads quick. Netflix, porn, you name it and it will load in no time.\r\n\r\nI haven&#039;t really been paying attention but I&#039;m fairly certain it started stuffing up when I downloaded the most recent patch. Has anybody else run into this problem? And if so, have you found a fix? I&#039;m on the verge of repairing it through the start up screen, but I&#039;d rather not wait hours for it to do its thing because im fairly sure that there&#039;s no damaged/missing/corrupted/edited/etc files.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve found a fix, pls help a brother out.\r\n\r\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"lThatFallenAngel","date":"2016-03-24T15:18:07.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"me n my friends, playing from asia, r experiencing the same. lemme know if you find a fix T______T","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-21T00:31:49.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you please download [WinMTR](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/winmtr/WinMTR-v092.zip) and run a traceroute to the following IP address (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export the results as text and reply back with them (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this.)\n\n>103.240.227.5\n\nCould I also get you to run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results page.","replies":[{"poster":"IbbySquared","date":"2016-03-21T01:26:15.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WinMTR Results : http://pastebin.com/RKmp95aQ\n\nICSI Netalyzr results : http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/restore/id=43ca253f-2062-d0d8d93a-6165-418e-98b0/rd","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-21T02:28:04.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you, there's a lot of things to go over here so this post will be long. \n\n* First off, and most importantly you're listed on the Spamhaus blocklist (CBL) with an infection last detected at 2016-03-18 23:00 GMT.\n  *   Do you currently run an antivirus? if so, which one?\n  *  If you do not currently run an antivirus I suggest you download and run a full scan with one immediately ( I recommend [malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/)) as it is possible you are infected with the ZeroAccess botnet, also known as Sirefef)\n\n\n* The DNS server your system is currently configured to use doesn't seem to be functioning correctly, could you please [switch to a public DNS server](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5).\n\n* There appears to be high packet buffering on your network, please see [this knowledgebase article](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7) about packet buffering which includes a video on reducing packet buffering and a list of applications which may increase the buffering rate.\n\n* Your system clock appears to be out of sync, [here](http://www.guidingtech.com/3119/windows-clock-sync/) is a nice guide on how to sync your clock to an internet time server.\n\nOnce you've done all that please test to see if you're still experiencing issues in a custom game and if you are, let me know so we can explore further issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
