Additionally, lesser spirits follow Bard and aid in his attacks - collecting chimes causes these meeps to gain power over the course of the game.\nBasically, his passive is similar to a Nasus Q or a Veigar Q, except you don&#039;t kill things, you collect things. Every 5 chimes gives a bonus.\n\n**DATA!**\n**Exp needed to lvl up:**\n1 -> 2: 280exp\n2 -> 3: 380exp\n3 -> 4: 480exp\n4 -> 5: 580exp\n....\nIn summary, to find out how much experience you need to reach the next level either:\n- hover your mouse over your experience bar and read the number there\n- **E = 100L + 180**; with E being experience needed to level up and L being your current level\n\n**Chime bonuses:** _Sidenote: Bard&#039;s passive scales with 30% AP _\n0 chimes: 30 magic dmg, meeps respawn every 10 seconds, max of 1 meep\n5 chimes: meeps apply 1 second 25% slow\n10 chimes: +25 dmg (55 base dmg)\n15 chimes: +1 meep (total of 2 meeps)\n20 chimes: +25 dmg (80 base dmg)\n25 chimes: meeps strike through target\n30 chimes: +30 dmg (110 base dmg)\n35 chimes: meeps respawn 1 sec faster (9 sec respawn)\n40 chimes: +30 dmg (140 base dmg)\n45 chimes: 45% slow\n50 chimes: +35 dmg (175 base dmg)\n55 chimes: +1 meep (total of 3 meeps)\n60 chimes: +35 dmg (210 base dmg)\n65 chimes: strike through cone increases in size.............................................**MAX**\n70 chimes: +35 dmg (245 base dmg)\n75 chimes: meeps respawn 1 sec faster (8 sec respawn)\n80 chimes: +35 dmg (280 base dmg)\n85 chimes: 60% slow\n90 chimes: +30 dmg (310 base dmg)\n95 chimes: +1 meep (total of 4)........................................................................**MAX**\n100 chimes: +30 dmg (340 base dmg)\n105 chimes: meeps respawn 1 sec faster (7 sec respawn)\n110 chimes: +30 dmg (370 base dmg)\n115 chimes: 70% slow\n120 chimes: +25 dmg (395 base dmg)\n125 chimes:  meeps respawn 1 sec faster (6 sec respawn).............................**MAX**\n130 chimes: +25 dmg (420 base dmg)\n135 chimes: 75% slow\n140 chimes: +20 dmg (440 base dmg)\n145 chimes: 80% slow.......................................................................................**MAX** \n150 chimes: +20 dmg (460 base dmg)\n155 chimes: +20 dmg (480 base dmg)\n..........\nAfter 150 chimes every 5 chimes gives you +20 dmg. You could theoretically stack infinitely.\nTo find out how much base dmg your passive would do (150 chimes and above), the formula should be                  **D = 4C - 140**; with D being the damage and C being the number of chimes, for    C ≥ 150 and a multiple of 5.\n\n**Chime respawn rate:**\n2 chimes spawn every 50 seconds, except for the 2nd and 3rd spawn that only spawns 1.\nso 0:50 -> 2 chimes\n1:40 -> 3 chimes\n2:30 -> 4 chimes\n3:20 -> 6 chimes\n4:10 -> 8 chimes\n.......\nSo, to find out how many chimes have spawned by a certain amount of time, the formula should be** C = 2t/50 - 2** \nwhere C stands for the number of chimes and t stands for the time in seconds that the game has progressed for and t ≥ 150s (2:30). Since the 2nd and 3rd time only spawns 1 chime.\n\n**Experience per chime:**\n0 -> 5 mins: 20exp per chime\n5 mins: 21exp per chime\n6 mins: 22exp per chime\n7 mins: 23exp per chime\n....\nIn summary, from 0 minutes till 5 minutes in the game, you will get 20exp per chime. At 5 minutes, you will get 21exp per chime. For each minute passed after 5 mins, you will get 1 more exp per chime. So the formula is **E = 16 + t**; with E being experience and t being time in minutes.\n\n**Random data:**\nIf you do not interfere with minions at all, red won vs blue in 29:47 minutes. (This is just 1 game, so it won&#039;t always be like this)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n_Note to self: gotta try Bard mid one day -> probs a bad idea._ <- but if you're playing Bard in a real game, collect chimes every 9 minutes in the game, since that's when the chimes will give you the most amount of experience and will ensure you collect them all before they disappear.\nIf you stack AP on Bard, you can hit around about 850 AP with full build and blue pot, that gives you about 255 bonus dmg on your passive, and since the base damage scales into late game, you should be able to 2 shot a squishy about an hour into the game. If you play for about 4 hours, you could one shot a squishy. And by 8 hours probably one shot a tank with your auto attack. Since you have pass through dmg, it&#039;s possible to 1 shot an entire team... hmm.\n\n**Here's the actual maths of the conclusion. **\nGenerally to 1 shot a squishy, you need about 2k dmg, my build gave me 255 bonus magic dmg on my passive due to the 30% AP ratio on it. So I'll assume I need a base dmg of 2000 to kill an adc/assassin.\nto get 2000 base dmg, you need\n2000 = 4C - 140\nC = 535\nSince you get 2 chimes spawning at once, you will reach 536 chimes, which can be acquired by\n536 = 2t/50 - 2\nt = 13450s\n  = 3 hours 44 minutes and 10 seconds\n\nTanks have up to 4k hp (we'll assume 4k, even though people rarely build that tanky these days), and again, bonus magic dmg from AP ratio should ensure that the auto attack hits for 4k. (Stacking MR could give about 250 I'd say, which would basically allow the aa to hit for 4k, you could buy void staff.. but I digress)\n4000 base dmg:\n4000 = 4C - 140\nC = 1035 chimes\nwhich is 1036 chimes, acquired by\n1036 = 2t/50 - 2\nt = 25950s\n  = 7 hours 12 minutes and 30 seconds\n\nSo, 8 hours to 1 shot an entire team to get a penta. Good luck!\n\n**Many thanks to:**\n> [{quoted}](name=Ostarion,realm=NA,application-id=mNBeEEkI,discussion-id=g8JAPbML,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-01T10:55:11.523+0000)\n>\n> Chimes are two every 50 seconds, except for the second (and third iirc) spawn having one.\n\nAnd a special thanks to Auir for playing endless hours of custom with me.\n\nrandom thought: the maths was so easy for this data collecting that I want to do more.. maybe I'll figure out the new mana and health maths.. those sound difficult =D","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-07T09:10:00.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I reckon someone wasted their time writing an essay about the mathematics behind Bard's passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Tearsong","date":"2015-06-11T09:48:51.184+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes, yes I did. =D but it was interesting imo.

And that would cause you to gain your chimes at a rate of C = 2t/40 - 2. And to get to max slow you would need 116 chimes, if you need 4 to rank up passive. If you need 3 to rank up passive, then you'd only need 87. \n\nRight now it takes you a minimum of 146 = 2t/50 - 2, t = 3700s, which is 1 hour 1 minute and 40 seconds to get to max slow, and 440 dmg on your passive, it's not the best, but it's ok for late game, the utility and damage for poke is quite nice provided you can get close enough.\n\nBut if your suggested changes are implemented, then for 4 chimes per passive stack\n116 = 2t/40 - 2 \nt = 2360s\nt = 39 minutes and 20 seconds\nAnd before most games are finished bard would be fully stacked with a tonne of damage, he'd become a late game monster, and that's not even 3 chimes per passive rank up.\n\nI'd say Bard's ok where he is for a support, supports generally don't do much damage, although I do think he's slightly underpowered since his passive which is so good is pretty much useless unless your games drag out for a long time, considering the fact that you can't actually collect all of your chimes since half of them are in the enemy jungle. But if you tweak anything, people will start abusing him mid and jungle.
