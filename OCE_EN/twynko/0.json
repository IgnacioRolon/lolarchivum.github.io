The GPU is terrible, but upgrading to 16GB isn't a bad idea since 8GB will eventually be considered \"not enough\" and by that time, 8GB sticks will be obsolete and you will have to purchase 16GB again, instead of just upgrading 8GB.\n\nBut there isn't a lot of point doing it with this PC, the CPU is really good, the ram is fine, the hard drive is average, but the GPU is god awful. Like, that GPU is literally not even better than integrated graphics. There is no point at all having 16GB of ram, and then having a GPU that would hardly run LoL on high and get 60 FPS.\n\ntl;dr avoid this PC at any cost, them putting \"Alienware\" on it, adds $200 to the total build cost instantly.\n\nIf there was something in it for me, I would pick out some good parts for you.","replies":[{"poster":"22 5 19 20 1","date":"2015-01-17T11:27:31.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by the time games require more than 8g of ram you'll be able to buy 16g ddr4 for $20\n\n\na $300 gpu can run most games out today on high with 60 fps\n\n\nedit: you should probably look into overclocking if you want the most out of your equipment too","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-17T11:54:38.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=22 5 19 20 1,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=sdjW7YE4,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-01-17T11:27:31.139+0000)\n>\n> by the time games require more than 8g of ram you'll be able to buy 16g ddr4 for $20\n> \n> \n> a $300 gpu can run most games out today on high with 60 fps\n> \n> \n> edit: you should probably look into overclocking if you want the most out of your equipment too\n\nTrue, I still cannot emphasize enough about how trash that gpu is. What is Dell thinking making a gaming PC with such a bad gpu?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
