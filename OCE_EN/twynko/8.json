You need to bring more to the table than that or people won't bother watching you over people from better regions (let's face it, the highest Elos in OCE don't really compare to the highest Elos in the larger regions).\n\nSo if you don't have a gimmicky champ to show off, try adding more flavour using other methods. Strong play accompanied with dubstep is boring and overdone. Try strong play accompanied with goofy commentary or something - even that's overdone, but at least it's a little more interesting. You're a smart fella, I'm sure you can think of even better ways to add flavour to your videos.","replies":[{"poster":"Twynko","date":"2015-07-29T09:08:54.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers mate","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"420 Weed Bloke","date":"2015-08-01T08:58:13.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh hai","replies":[]}]}
