I want to reassure everybody we aren't going to sell the victorious skin. We may or may not do chromas for tiers, that's still TBD. \n\nThis is a good opportunity to talk about why we run surveys like this. Pretty much everybody at Riot is an active league player. There are players of all skill levels and types (casuals, hardcore, etc). Sometimes, features or changes we should make are obvious. Sometimes there are issues we disagree about or feel are contentious enough that we should ask players about directly. Rather than building the wrong stuff, we just ask you guys directly. Surveys like this help ensure we're making the right changes and moving the game in the right direction. Keep in mind that just because you see a survey doesn't mean we're going to take that course, even if sentiment is good around a change. \n\nThis aside, we've got some cool stuff lined up for the preseason that we can't wait to share with you guys. Good luck in your ranked matches until then. \n\nps. It's a marksman.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on who the next Victorious skin could be? What marksman champ would you pick?
