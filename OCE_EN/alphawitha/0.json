One of the changes to scuttle are:\r\n- After both scuttles have been taken, It will randomly select either of the rivers and spawn only one scuttle in that one river.\r\n\r\nThis change could affect Kindreds scaling in the game due to the marks spawning at certain locations (Mainly scuttle).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this was not intentional by Riot, then please consider making Kindred not lose that unique scaling that they always have.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-17T10:30:37.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just realised... changing the jg items so you cant get a support item...\n\nIncreased cooldown on trinkets....\n\nthese are even more Lee Sin nerfs... wow","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-17T12:26:50.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"About damn time, I say!\n\nHe's been in the spotlight since when, season 2?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-16T10:19:05.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea this was my first thought too.\n\nUnfortunately, Kindred's marks are just a bait anyway. They're a neat little mini-game mechanic, but they lead to you getting behind more often than giving you power. If the enemy has even the slightest idea how to play league, it is physically impossible for kindred to reach most of her marks before them, and if they meet in the jungle, kindred loses 90% of the matchups early. Not to mention the CS you miss traipsing all the way across the map to find that its already gone.\n\nKindred is my main jungler, and I used to be religious about getting her marks, but since her update, her marks just feel awful, so I don't bother anymore unless I know 100% that I can get it safely.\n\nIt's sad :( \nthematically she's is by far my favourite champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-16T09:16:01.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that happened this patch.","replies":[]}]}
