I don&#039;t know who I should buy, so I thought I would ask the boards!\r\nI like playing mid, top, and supp but im probably looking for a top/supp champ. I main Irelia and i love her but i want more champs under my belt. Im more into that glass canon build then tank, i dont mind taking some time to learn a harder champ and i have 10000 ip. also wondering which sup you would recommend?

Just straight damage output skimping on the lifeline of armor/mr etc. I love Garen because he is easy, and tanks well which is what i usually do with him. But a cut throat damage dealer works well on him if you position yourself right in the fights etc.\n\nAlso {{champion:41}} is a lot of fun to play top","replies":[{"poster":"VeganCrossfitter","date":"2016-08-31T04:07:03.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thresh is worth the time to master, you can carry the worst of adcs and spoonfeed them till late, he is bae","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-31T07:19:59.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe you there, i've even seen a Thresh ADC carry a game lol.
