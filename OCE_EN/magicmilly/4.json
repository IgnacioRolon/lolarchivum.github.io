Riot wants to make extra sure the accounts are actually botted\n2. 3rd party software bans go out in waves and each ban wave so many bot accounts _are_ banned but many more accounts will pop up in their places because...\n3. The market for level 30 accounts isn't going away, its probably pretty steady. People are going to keep doing it as long as they are getting money\n4. People are constantly evolving their bots to avoid detection, and Riot has to upgrade their systems to deal with this. \n5. Keep reporting the accounts so that they do get banned. \n","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-08T21:35:34.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't there be like a simple captcha type system, before/after game. And if not completed, you gain zero ip/xp for that match?\nThis would make it harder for most people to get around who use bots. Might not get rid of them all, because as we all know in the computer world, there is always someone who can outsmart the last guy.

I mean I know newer players can be bad but even new players will accidentally get an assist once in a while in botgames whilst among most of the bot leveling programs they usually just feed like mad. This would do two things, reduce the number of bots and make it less effective to farm with them postlvl10 or inspire stronger leveling bots which would at least make the problem less noticable than a 18-0 intermediate annie/swain/karthus bot at 7min in which would reduce complaints about the issue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-09-08T03:03:09.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue a few days ago. The unfortunate thing is if you leave you can't report the bots. All you can do is sit on the fountain and wait for it to be over.\n\nMy advice is; if you just want to test out a champ you might be better playing a custom game. If you play bot games for the First Win of the Day bonus, like I do, play  hard carry champ that can 1v5 and push down turrets.\n\nBut, most importantly, REPORT THOSE BOTS!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-08T11:47:31.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're low level and trying to level up; unless you have an experienced buddy who's been playing for a while and can easily outplay bots and wants to duo and teach you, that fed 22-0 yasou/annie/mundo/karthus/swain at 10min is going to be hard to deal with for a lvl10 beginner who doesn't even know how to cancel tp.\n\nHeck I've played this game a while (like 8 months) and if you stick me in a game with 4 of those feeder bots against the wrong 5 intermediate bots and I haven't picked a super hard carry champ, then gg 100% chance of losing. It can be frustrating and I have a friend who doesn't want to pvp prelvl30 and runes since they don't want a bad record but they're thinking about giving up on this game because they're getting whooped in bot games because these feederautolevel bots. They're extremely good at the champions they play considering how long they've been playing for and that's something but they're also considering quitting altogether. Looking at their match history, especially for low level players, 40% of the teammates are simple build 6 troll items and just run down lane bots, 20% are combat bots that don't do well and don't play together but they don't feed much either so I guess that's something, and then there is 30% actual low level players and then 10% smurf who are leveling up a second account and you can tell because if they go an ap mid and build a mejais and full ap and have perfect farm and usually win with ridiculous scores like 46-0-11 by 35min.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-08T11:49:05.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"also that vsing 5 intermediate bots with 4 feeder bots on my team is with my current masteries and runes that I have since I'm lvl30. I can't imagine how people manage without it.
