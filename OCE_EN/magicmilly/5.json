He's a bit more difficult to learn, but learning to play him will improve your game overall, due to his squishyness, learning how to position yourself in a lane to full effect and learning timings of skills and what your damage output should look like.\n\nThat, and he is great fun too, 100% crit chance is nothing to sneeze at. Makes for great montages.","replies":[]}]}
