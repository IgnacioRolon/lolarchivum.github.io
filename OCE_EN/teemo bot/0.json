(range 500)\r\nonly thing possible is throwing mushrooms from afar, which straight up gets destroyed either before it sets or by a red trink.\r\nand shit\r\nlate game\r\neven when he goes full full ap\r\nhis mushrooms do absolutely no damage\r\ngod dammit\r\n\r\nah actually i got it lmao ill just give it a rest on teemo, pick up some other main until teemo gets something to get back into meta\r\ni really wish riot to give some love to teemo","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-12-09T00:21:21.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played a bit of Teemo recently, and honestly, I don't have as many problems with playing him. The stay top and farm style doesn't work. Put simply. It might just be because I'm low ELO, but Teemo is all about surprising your foe in ambushes and well placed traps; They will use sweeping lens if they expect you somewhere. So don't be where you're expected. Use the sweeping lens yourself to check for wards. His teamfighting potential is pretty horrendous which is fair enough, though it's hard for the enemy to keep track of their team, your team, and your shrooms all at once allowing you to lob them in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-08T12:14:33.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He is very very weak, not due to how he is built, his kit or anything, he was built when? Back at the same time as Master Yi and Co., that's right, at the very start of the game.\n\nChampions have evolved since than and only a handful from back in the day have made it through, and those are generally the type that can build either damage or tank and have some sort of something to make them useful against the new breed.\n\nTeemo has nothing, he has a few tricks up his sleeve that are easily countered and only fairs well against some champion types. he is rather useless now.\n\nBack in the good old days I would go top with him against ANYONE, because back in the days anyone would be tanky type melee, there would be nothing else up in top lane and build the old BoRK would make sense since it didn't hit current health %, it hit MAX health %, so when the old Sion would go full tank mode, every inch of health he got mean Teemo would do that little bit more damage.\n\nYou had a straight counter to all the champions who went up there. Your shrooms saved your life if you planted them like a minefield, your blind you stop any of them from hitting you whilst you just melted their health. Even going AP/AS mid, or fill AP mid would be great.\n\nBut now, nothing. You try go Teemo Vs. Ekko, what a joke, base health of 516, only 1050 gold for Ekko to get Sheen, than 2 hits and you're dead. It's the same for most, you just can't take Teemo into any fight and expect anything useful out of him anymore.\n\nThe last Teemo I seen sat in the top lane farming for 43 minutes. All he done was farm and die until he had enough gold for his full kit, even than he was sub par and didn't really do much. It took him 43 minutes to get his full kit. I used to rampage top lane, 15 minutes get the second tower. Now I can't even stop losing the first tower within 10 minutes in some games.\n\nAs bad as he is, I still had 63% win in Ranked Silver lover 19 games late in the season, as good as I am with him and with as much games over the last 4 years played, even with all the hate, no support, the non stop ganks, I still manage to play well and yet still say, he is shit against the new breed of champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Bot","date":"2015-12-11T04:08:40.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"god damn you took the words out of my mouth and touched my heart\na fellow teemo play i couldnt find\n\nsince top isnt much of a safe place for teemo im just running teemo jungle now ;D","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-13T09:36:38.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The news champions have made not even the jungle a safe place for Teemo any more.\n\nHe needs more than anything, an escape.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-12-08T11:51:33.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man since like 5.20 I havent seen him in almost 100 games","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-12-08T11:48:59.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah he's weak as piss.

The Auto attack portion of the damage is negated but the EFFECT isnt. Happens with most on-hit skills when blinded by teemo.

For me, the whole point of Teemo was insane trap setting and baiting, turning him into a real ambush jester. When his traps got reset, well it ruined that, and now he's really a 1v1 duellist, that gets trounced if he loses the element of surprise or is versing more than one enemy. His traps barely protect him in lane from ganks, but after that, with their shorter cool down, they are next to useless, as you'll be traversing the map and hardly have time to set up those glorious mushroom farms as you once did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2015-12-09T09:05:07.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol he actually very strong. He is weak against trundle renek, iffy against Illioa and kennen can be tough. Apart from those, he can rek top really hard actually. \n\nYou need to knwo how to build him early tho and what to build into and when. A lot of people just stack pure AP on him, I find torment with rylias the way to go. Get them after a Rod of Ages, if against an Illioa, get a nasher first instead into torment. Once you get rylias its almost gg for the enemy team, if they hit a shroom, they basically die to you or the slow creating a play.","replies":[{"poster":"Teemo Bot","date":"2015-12-11T04:04:07.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well if you have read the post, or im just assuming you didnt get everything but ive played teemo from the very start of this game, well just about, since season 1 and from that point teemo was my main, and i went through all the seasons with him\ni remember the days when teemo was actually adc lmao\nanyway\n\nIts true that pure AP teemo is much more viable both when youre behind and when youre snowballing, but that shit doesnt even work now\nyeah somtimes i get bad enemy top and win the lane but usually thats not the case\n\nah well speaking from experience, teemo is strong early against trundle and falls.
