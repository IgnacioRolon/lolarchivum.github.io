Why is Nidalee now even worse then before the changes?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ok So I thought the changes to nidalee way back were good. I was tired of being speared as an ADC and loosing half to three quarters of my health.  The problem is that it's back to that again.  Why has she come back to being a range assassin that can now jump on you even easier then before.  \r\nThe fact this champ is being picked up in pro games as a jungler makes it clear this is a little unbalanced.\r\n\r\nSo my question is what can we do about it? What champs go well against an nidalee? Because honestly just dodging spears just isn't a valid answer, their range and damage are still way to high when compared to almost any other long range skill shot and they are on a very low cooldown.\r\n\r\nAre there any Rioters out there that may be able to explain what's going on here? I assume she is being looked at but how did she end up becoming an even worse and more annoying version of what she was changed to get rid of? Was bruiser nidalee that bad? Considering how many champs are low tier would it have been that bad to leave her a little under powered given how long she was a monster in this game?\r\n\r\nIs there anything we can do in game to fight against this? Short of banning Nidalee that is? I play mostly normals so banning isn't really an option and it's getting to the point I don't enjoy playing because of this champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-17T00:47:53.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They kept the superpoke mage, they just made it harder to do with skiny spears that are easy to *dodge*. Instead most of the power in her kit is the synergy with her cat form, instead of a long range poke assassin you get a short range run my %%%%% into your face assassin. Playing Nid like everyone used to is unreliable because even in bronze people don't have a lot of trouble *dodging* them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TribalMind","date":"2015-02-13T22:46:11.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But that said why do her spears do so much damage again?
