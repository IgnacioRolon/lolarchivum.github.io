Please follow up on this as this is no reason for an account to be permanently banned, if players can&#039;t argue for 1 lost game then I don&#039;t know what to say.","replies":[{"poster":"Amphetameme","date":"2017-10-18T05:49:02.792+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly regardless of what he said you deserve the ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-23T09:45:26.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Context is a hard measure for rationalization, and regardless, one person's toxicity shouldn't excuse another person's. Having been given multiple reform opportunities, presumably a 10-game chat restriction, a 25-game chat restriction, and a 14-day suspension, this outcome shouldn't come as much of a surprise. You've been told that your behaviour isn't acceptable within the community, yet you continued to berate other players by calling them \"retards\" and whatsuch. I understand that players have frustrating experiences from time to time, but toxicity isn't something that improves anyone's experience by any metric. \n\nFor more information on the Instant Feedback Reform System, check out this Riot Support article:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-\n\nIf you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephithDarknesse","date":"2017-10-19T15:48:05.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even without their context, this chat log clearly shows you abusing your teammates rather consistently through the game. They may deserve the same treatment, but thats completely irrelevant to your own case. Pointing out a dude is failing is one thing, but you seem to constantly attack him for no reason.\n\nAnd to deserve a perma ban, i can imagine you've consistently done this kind of thing in a high percentage of your games.","replies":[]}]}
