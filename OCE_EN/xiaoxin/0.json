I didn&#039;t curse. I didn&#039;t flame.\nI especially didn&#039;t VERBALLY ABUSE or HATE SPEECH them. \n\nBut I did defend myself when they made fun of my K/D etc and pinged me all game because it upsets me a little. Anyway, towards the end of the game they went in all chat and started acting like good samaritans saying &quot;xiaoxin told us to kill ourselves, please report him&quot; and &quot;xiaoxin called us %%%%s&quot;. This is so stupid. I never said this, I was targetted by them for harrassment and well, it worked.\n\nI got a chat restriction and lost my end of season rewards 6 hours before the end of the season. I worked bloody hard all season for my rank, skin, and honor level. I never engage in arguments and my honor level showed that. I had a tough week and all I did was defend myself. I completely understand that the instant feedback system snagged me because I was typing a lot. But there is no rule against typing, and I am honest that everyone in the game was typing this much. I don't even want to get started on the fact that they were incredibly toxic but probably didn't get reported for it.\n\nWhat I want to know, can riot investigate the messages and what happened in this match, and return my honor level/end of season rewards eligibility. I am not even going to lie, I am livid and so upset that I got trolled by this trio. Like many of you on here this game is a big part of my life and I am so upset that I lost what I made this season in a way that isn&#039;t fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T14:15:51.754+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok let me try to break this down in order.\n\n1. It doesn't matter how many reports you get against you if they aren't valid. You could be reported 100 times but if you haven't done anything those reports are effectively thrown out.\n2. If you want people to believe you, post evidence. Your chat logs are what you are being judged/punished for, so if you believe that judgement to be false, posting your chat logs is the easiest way to get community feedback.\n3. There is a distinction between defending yourself (fine) and retaliation (not fine). You seem to be aware of this, though.\n4. Sounds like you were targeted, and yeah, that sucks. Without your logs I'm not going to say anything for sure, all I can really say is that problematic behaviour will be addressed regardless of who 'started it'.\n5. You wouldn't be hit with a punishment just for typing a lot, especially in a normal. While it isn't exactly ideal, there would have been something beyond that to trigger the system.\n6. Did you report them for it? Only one valid report is necessary to trigger a review of the game, so if you reported them, that's enough, just don't count on getting any feedback on their punishment status, it's kept intentionally vague for various reasons, and the one notification that exists, is extremely limited. Hearing nothing, doesn't mean nothing happened.\n7. Yes Riot can investigate. You can appeal your punishment through player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new If the punishment was made in error (which while very rare, isn't impossible) then the punishment will be revoked and rewards restored.","replies":[{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-11-17T13:47:09.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"actually you can be banned for typing alot in all game modes i have been banned for just have a full 20+ minute conversation and the support ticket did nothing they said it comes under spam and that's toxicity that account is now permi banned because that ban was a streight 25 chat for legit no reason just a normal conversation all game my then a 14day fand permi for actual toxic behavior but that would never have been 14 day ner permi if i didn't get chat banned the 1st time \n\nriots punishment system is the most flawed thing in league and it will never get changed because the company is not managed correctly","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2018-11-15T02:23:22.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can back this up nowadays.\n\nxiaoxin you have defended yourself and said the wrong thing and now you lose.\n\ndefending yourself with aggression is not acceptable and sadly enough you accepted that when you created your new account and accepted the terms and conditions","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chocolate Cake","date":"2018-11-17T12:51:38.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"chat logs will rrove you wrong or right not sure why people done copy past them here","replies":[]},{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2018-11-13T10:13:16.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rampant oce toxicity. prevalent everywhere. including the pro scene.
