No other way to put it.\r\n\r\nI'm really thankful that we have TT ranked now, so I really hope it stays, but the way ranked works is fucked.\r\n\r\nI've been platinum or gold since season 2, but playing Twisted Treeline and doing my placements got me placed in Iron 1, sometimes climbing 13 LP a time in placements.\r\n\r\n1. I've only really played 100-200ish games of Twisted Treeline over the past 2 years and one of the biggest problems is the ranked difference. Since everyone starts at a hard reset rank, you'll probably get placed around Iron or Bronze or Silver if you do really well (I have not seen anyone above Bronze this season so far personally). Now you have to climb out of Iron or Bronze with a_ REALLY _  low LP gain per win\r\n\r\n2. Since the ranking hard resets everyone, you consistently will get teams of people who have never played TT before and have no idea about altars or bruiser playstyle/funnel playstrats etc. I think OCE would really benefit if we had Ranked TT and Normal TT open at the same time, or at least test this. A lot of people I have met don't care about 3v3 rank so they will play their first game ever of TT as a ranked game.\r\n\r\n3. Similar to the same problem above, since the ranked is reset and seperate to 5v5, you will be climbing out of Iron vsed against Iron players... who are also Diamond+ on 5v5 twisted treeline. High ELO players in Iron games winning such low LP per game that it takes weeks to climb. \r\n\r\n4. OCE is too small for flex, it should be solo/duo. Because no one wants to play twisted treeline. So you ask friends to join you but no one wants to or knows how to play it. But some people who are challenger lvl enjoy to play with a team of 3 for fun and stomp everyone, yet they're still in Iron or Bronze ELO.\r\n5. At this current time I am one of two players ranked in Iron 1 because this game mode is dead but the 10 minute queues are good for a break and it is always fun playing with regular players who play every friday/saturday/sunday, and getting 3/4 games in a row with the same or similar group of players. \r\n\r\nTL;DR I love twisted treeline please don't remove it, but it does need some work on how ranked works, because at this stage the game has been open for regularly for over a year now and the playerbase isn't growing. IMO 3v3 is way funner than ARAM or URF so I really hope they work on this fun, but more relaxed Ranked experience.\r\n\r\n{{champion:427}}","replies":[]}
