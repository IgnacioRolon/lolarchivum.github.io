Not that anyone cares since most people hate smurfs anyway. As for your other complaint about having to fork out cash for a champ u want. The old system was even worse for new accounts since u had to by champs and runes","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-08T09:56:09.608+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"And most people just didn't bother with runes until level 21+ anyway, because runes weren't all unlocked early on.\n\nAnd since when do most people hate smurfs?","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-11-08T10:00:14.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=s9eraWB5,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-11-08T09:56:09.608+0000)\n>\n> And most people just didn&#x27;t bother with runes until level 21+ anyway, because runes weren&#x27;t all unlocked early on.\n> \n> And since when do most people hate smurfs?\n\nAnd? Your still not spending the 7000lp to build a single rune page. And when haven’t people hated smurfs? Since u know getting a smurf ruins ranked integrity and is pretty much a instawin for the team that has them.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-08T10:05:49.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean, same with boosters.\n\nBut fact is, there are 2 types of smurfs anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-11-08T10:32:29.892+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=s9eraWB5,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-08T10:05:49.647+0000)\n>\n> I mean, same with boosters.\n> \n> But fact is, there are 2 types of smurfs anyway.\n\nPoint still stand smurfs aren’t healthy for the game and no one likes them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
