They seemed pretty good at first and we generally got ahead early, but when it came time to close out the game they squandered our lead a bit, nothing too stupid but the oppostion({{champion:98}}{{champion:54}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:67}} {{champion:267}}  ) had a better team fight than us ({{champion:48}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:201}} ) I was in the process of directing us how we were going to finish When the surrender vote came up, obviously I said &#039;no&#039; as we were going to win and assumed it was called up by someone out of frustration but then the game ended. I had been overruled, because I was not in the group, I was ganged up upon. Riot I am not happy, I&#039;m sure this is rare, however it just happened, and I am left dumbfounded. I don&#039;t want to ask for my loss to be removed, I don&#039;t want them reported(although i wouldn&#039;t argue if they were) what I want if mesures in place so this can&#039;t happen again, I am not sure how, but this cannot be allowed to repeat itself.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-28T12:59:39.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as it sucks unfortunately they were the majority, that said Solo queue is in the process of being made (Though they have said it will be a while) so that would stop this from being able to happen.","replies":[]}]}
