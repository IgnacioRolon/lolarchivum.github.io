You say you're not smart enough to do the math, looks like you weren't smart enough to read the fact that it does have percentage health damage anyway which increases depending on whether the Spirit Blade goes through an enemy or not.\n\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LH Hutchy,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=zBTMRjMX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-02T05:09:24.377+0000)\n> Another idea I have for the above is perhaps his q could steal life on each of the 3 hits, but only if they&amp;#039;re used on champions. Bring back some of his sustain. Or maybe just the third hit steals life from whatever it hits, and automatically executes minions? That would be nice.\n\n2 - His passive is what gives him pseudo-sustain. Plus the autoattacks do proc lifesteal. If you want to introduce lifesteal as a part of his Q, why would you? He's a tank and should be building tank, along with his passive he gets a ton of free 'health', unless you can't play around his passive.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LH Hutchy,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=zBTMRjMX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-02T05:09:24.377+0000)\n> Another point of annoyance is his w.

Shen is meant to be a selfless tank and thus positioning for him is everything especially when it comes to his W. If it were to block EVERYTHING then he'd have the old Jax syndrome of becoming far too OP, and if it was only him why the hell would it need to be AoE? The point of his W is to help others (and him) to dodge autos, otherwise it'd be far too overpowered.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=LH Hutchy,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=zBTMRjMX,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-06-02T05:09:24.377+0000)\n>\n> OK so we all know the Shen rework didn&amp;#039;t quite hit the mark Riot was aiming for, but I have some suggestions as to how they could fix it.\n> I&amp;#039;m just a Shen enthusiast and I don&amp;#039;t want to see him stay as dead as he currently is.\n\n4 - You really don't seem like one, you don't know so much about him. And no, the rework did hit it bang on, he's no overpowered but he's also not weak either unless in the wrong hands which seems to be you.\n\nIf Riot reads this, the biggest problem we need to address is quoting errors in the Boards, since apostrophes are quoted incorrectly and I haven't been bothered to change them.\n\nSo OP, get your shit sorted.\n\n{{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:98}}","replies":[]}]}
