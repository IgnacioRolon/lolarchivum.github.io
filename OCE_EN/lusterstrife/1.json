There are a few things you can do to check it out.\n\n* Examine your game logs using something like [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com) to see what conditions the league client is seeing.\n* Run a traceroute to 103.240.227.1 and see what path packets take from you to the league servers.\n* Try out out the suggestions on the [troubleshooting connection issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support page. If you're using Wifi, definitely try using a cable to connect to your router.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
