Im confident I can play well but when I get put into uncomfortable roles with new champions, I tend to not do too well. But don't worry too much about that because i'll let you guys know if I cant play a certain champ or role very well.. and the only role i have problems with is jg/supp.\n\nI'll add you. Grouping up during the weekend will net some pretty awesome IP gains","replies":[]}]}
