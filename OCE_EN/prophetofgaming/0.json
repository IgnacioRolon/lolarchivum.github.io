To put it very simply, doran&#039;s shield is far too strong for ranged champions.\r\n\r\n**Issue:**\r\n\r\n1 example of this is I am playing Caitlyn {{champion:51}}  into Twitch {{champion:29}}.  Now this should have been an easy matchup as Caitlyn is supposed to dumpster Twitch early game as you have far better range and your q poke.  But surprise surprise, he started a doran&#039;s shield.  I couldn&#039;t push him out of lane, in fact, I was taking more damage from minion aggro than I was actually doing to him.  Because he started a doran&#039;s shield {{item:1054}} he immune to all my poke, which is just dumb.\r\n\r\nI feel like Caitlyn {{champion:51}} and Ezreal {{champion:81}} are basically useless right now as all any Hypercarry Attack Damage Carry ({{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:145}}) has to do is start a doran&#039;s shield and you can&#039;t kill them in lane and because of the fact that any poke is just getting negated and they will outscale you and become far better than you late game.  This needs to stop.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\nThe current stats for Doran&#039;s shield are as follows:\r\n\r\n80 health\r\n6 health regeneration per 5 seconds\r\nBasic attacks deal an additional 5 physical damage to minions on hit.\r\nRestores 20 health over 10 seconds after taking damage from an enemy champion.\r\n\r\nThe flat 80 health is fine in my opinion and doesn&#039;t need any altering, but the passive flat health regeneration and the passive of restoring 20 health over 10 seconds after taking damage from a champion in my opinion needs to be nerfed (just for ranged champions though).  In my opinion, these 2 passives should at least be halved when a ranged champion is using them.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:**\r\n\r\nAs someone who plays tanks, I understand completely why doran&#039;s shield is why it is, but currently, it is far too effective on ranged champions, making Caitlyn and Ezreal (in particular) relatively useless\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this point, please share this post so us Caitlyn and Ezreal players can actually play League again and hopefully something will change about this (preferably before the next Worlds).\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nTPOG","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-25T12:04:30.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending on supports, and how people play the lane, Cait should still do well into a Doran's shield Twitch. Perhaps you focus on harassing too much if you are taking a lot of minion aggro. You could try a Doran's shield yourself to negate the minion aggro, if that is your playstyle :)","replies":[{"poster":"ProphetOfGaming","date":"2018-03-29T04:53:24.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the thing, I was dropping into the bush after every shot to make sure I took as little minion damage as possible and he wasn't even auto'ing me and I was still losing trades (he didn't even have a heal supp he had a morgana{{champion:25}} )  Oh and one more thing, he had press the attack (not even fleet footwork, which I had)","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-03-31T07:05:08.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well now you know to take Doran's Shield instead :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-25T06:11:25.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so nerf doranss shield and then anyone who counterpicks your champ just wins the game. Nice thinking. If I was given no defensive options and I got poked out of lane everytime i went to cs i would legit just afk at my second turret and wait for it to push.","replies":[{"poster":"ProphetOfGaming","date":"2018-03-29T04:58:18.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cait is supposed to win this matchup in the early game because you will never be able to out-damage him late game (same with Tristana{{champion:18}}).  The only way you can really beat them is if they get hard crowd-controlled to the ground.  You just can't beat a hyper-carry who starts a doran's shield and I would like that to be changed (I just want to be able to bully hyper-carries early without having to pick a morg and have to perma-cc them).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ProphetOfGaming","date":"2018-03-24T03:29:44.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to say if you think doran's shield should be changed for ranged champs in any other fasion!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-03-24T02:21:32.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But then those champs become broken again zzz","replies":[{"poster":"ProphetOfGaming","date":"2018-03-24T03:04:47.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only in the laning phase, any hypercarry will completely dumpster you in the late game, no matter how behind they get since doran's has been nerfed.","replies":[]}]}]}
