The first hop (mygateway.gateway) looks like it is varying a bit.   \n\n1 12 ms 5 ms 1 ms mygateway.gateway [10.0.0.138]\n--and--\n1 25 ms 17 ms 16 ms mygateway.gateway [10.0.0.138]\n\n12ms might not seem like a lot, but in home networking terms I'd consider that quite high.  What is key there is that it varies a lot, which means something isn't playing nice between your PC and your router, or within your router.  You have the most control over the stuff within your home network - if it were me I'd be trying to figure out how to get it right down to be stable at a constant ~1ms, and then move on to other aspects (such as with my ISP) from there.\n\nI'm guessing you're using Wifi?   Does your stability change if you're using an ethernet cable?\n\n\nAlso - We've got a relatively new site up now called [Lag Report,](https://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com/) which might give a bit of insight and help you identify the source of your issues.  I'd recommend you check it out, and also check out some of the things in the \"What can I do?\" heading.\n\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"JERONIMO","date":"2018-01-12T04:57:34.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response, I'll have a fiddle with things and see if I can figure out why it's varying.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-11T08:19:45.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where are you running the tracert to?\n\n>Try a tracert to 103.240.227.5, which is in the range for OCE game servers.\n\n>Bear in mind the server itself won't respond to pings, but you will be able to tell from the final hop which should be one of our peers...\n\n>Cheers!\nMindstar\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/tjYnaU0c-riot-plz-check-your-server?comment=0000","replies":[{"poster":"JERONIMO","date":"2018-01-11T08:52:34.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE Server:\n(tracert 103.240.227.5)\nor \n(tracert 103.240.227.25)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-11T09:07:19.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's as far as my knowledge goes.
