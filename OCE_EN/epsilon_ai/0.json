The amazing lores, character designs and gameplay changes always keep me coming back to your game. The only complaint I have is the sexualisation of women. To be exact, I have nothing wrong with it, I just want more it for the men!\r\nI know that league strives for diversity and appealing to a mass audience, and I suggest that with this plan you can attract a larger female demographic. 50% of the world are women, not all of them are straight, but that&rsquo;s a big demographic regardless. And there are gay men!\r\nI&rsquo;ll give some suggestions for skins that&rsquo;ll definitely improve your sales:\r\n&bull;\tBattle Bunny Talon (A skin I have been waiting 5 years for, please, I will spend any amount of money for this skin)\r\nEzreal\r\nShen\r\nZilean \t\r\n&bull;\tUnmasked [Masked male champion]\r\nJhin\r\nNautilus\r\nShen + Zed (A skin line)\r\n&bull;\tPool Party [Male champion] (+Illaoi. I know she isn&rsquo;t a man but I love her)\r\nThese specific ones would be great:\r\nGaren\r\nRakan (+Xayah)\r\nEzreal\r\nEkko (I&rsquo;m not sure if he&rsquo;s legal, don&rsquo;t put him there if he isn&rsquo;t)\r\n&bull;\tSomething cool that appeals to gay males that includes Varus and his lore (Suggested by a gay friend)\r\n&bull;\tDebonair Jayce but he&rsquo;s shirtess :)\r\nThank you very much for listening to my suggestions. Of course, as a big fan of yours, these ideas are free of charge. \r\nLove, A very dedicated player.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-02-07T09:20:19.852+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the OP really mean is; Please release more pretty boy type, skins.
