It is impossible for me to update with my Mobile phone internet. It is really annoying and was wondering if there is a way around it instead of deleting my lol_air folder every time there is an update. It is a waste of downloads and time and it really grinds my gears. Riot really needs to fix this.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-10T08:51:34.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean that you can't update on your internet connection, so you're using your mobile internet connection to update, but for some reason you have to download the entirety of League again?","replies":[]}]}
