However, with this new LeaverBuster system, even if you do leave a game and rejoin it not much later, you get the same punishment. After the last game I played and leaving, but rejoining merely approximately 3 minutes later, I found that just after I cleared my old leaverbuster, I got a new one! With work overloading my playtime, I can&#039;t find enough time to slot in a game to remove my leaver buster. Even with Bots, which takes around 25 minutes for me, it is now 45 minutes, which I don&#039;t have enough time on a schedule. Would you be able to change it into something different? Even have the max time a little lower, except playing more games would be better!\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this!","replies":[]}
