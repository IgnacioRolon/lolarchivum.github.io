(1)He has INCREDIBLE burst damage! (2) He carries a serious amount of crowed control! (3) His ability to heal is out of control in most cases. I see this fella heal like 30%+ of his hit points moments before hes going to die. Ive seen him turn 3v1 fights with ease.. The game is suppose to be balanced. If a champion can have as much as Sylas brings to the table then other champions should be able to bring a similar amount of power. I didnt even mention the fact that this champion can steal ULTIMATES before level 6!!! How ignorant is that.... I personally believe Riot is trying to make players kill themselves.. Why else would this type of thing happen so frequently ! \n\nI love it when the community tells Riot that champs are too strong.. Meanwhile folks are wracking up wins with those said champions... Then eventually Riot listens and does EXACTLY WHAT THE COMMUNITY EXPECTED.. Do those players who used the OP champion lose wins? Do i get my loses removed? NO. Even though Riot clearly left a champion OP for too long. Then by nerfing that champion theyre essentially admiting fault. BUT THEN THE GAME CONTINUES FORWARD.. WITH NO CONSEQUENCE. Sion + Akali are recent champion who carried WAY TOO MUCH POWER for WAY TOO LONG. Sylas is now part of this crew. \n\nIts pretty simple.. Should tanks deal epic damage? Certainly not. Should burst champions have insane heals? Certainly not. Should a champion be able to remain invisible under a turret? Even though turrets have TRUE SIGHT or whatever you want to call it. LOL CERTAINLY NOT! But akali had that ability for how many patches???? DId those players suffer repercussion from using a downright HACK of a champion? Nope all moves along.. Those players will move to the next OVERPOWERED champion, ala, sylas. And the game continues to frustrate and annoying its core group of hardcore players! THank you Riot for constantly, what seems like, attempting to frustrate your community! You are some sicks fucks lol.. But i love you ;) good day!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2019-02-17T10:41:37.906+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought he was weak. lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2019-02-17T08:01:48.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]}]}
