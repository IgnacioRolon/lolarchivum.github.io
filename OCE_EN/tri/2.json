The enemy can invade very easily, oftentimes picking up a kill because team wasn't there.\r\n\r\nI've had games where people don't even come in until 3-5mins due to smoking, lane is lost, game is usually lost because of it.\r\n\r\nPlease smokers, have some respect for your team mates and smoke at your desk, if you're not allowed to then don't smoke at all, or get an E-cig.\r\n\r\nDon't punish team mates because you can't control your cravings.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-12T13:07:15.258+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">The enemy can invade very easily, oftentimes picking up a kill because team wasn't there.\n\nSomeone %%%%%es in all chat when there is an afk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-01-12T23:50:58.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"but i need my daily darts bruh","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-13T02:19:00.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank You for Smoking (film).\n\nOh yeah!","replies":[]}]}
