This fizz was tilting hard in game lobby and threatened to afk. They didn't, so that was cool, didn't guard jungle, enemy proceeded the invade through where fizz would have guarded. Our jungler dies. Fizz loses to Lulu, Vi doens't do much better against Singed, and bot isn't going to well either. Pretty much all lanes either went evenish or lost. I'm not saying that bot and top lost due Fizz, but Fizz was raging hard at all team members. \r\n\r\nAfter losing early game, fizz decides to, instead of afk'ing because that's not worth it anymore, intentionally feeds. walks around enemy jungle no wards, dies, you get the idea. Could we have won if Fizz didn't rage? Based on our team probably not, but we could have also stood a chance, we can now never know. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion wouldn't be to forgive people's losses, or reduce or increase points gained, due to people like this, but people who rage, feed, are negative, etc. should be pushed down the ranked ladder, or have their own system put in place for this behaviour. To get out of said system one would have to play X amount of games without any behaviour that landed you there in the first place.\r\n\r\nTo get into this system you would need to have been reported for various offences, reports submitted by the opposing team carry double weight. So let's say you need to get 20 reporting points against your name, and each report by your team mate's is worth 1 point and by the opposing side 2 points. Reach 20 points you can't ranked until you prove your reformed behaviour.\r\n\r\nOr at the end of each game, each player has to vote on their team mate's behaviour, if they've behaved then give them a point, if not then take a point away, and this system is mandatory, you have to vote on your team mates before leaving end game lobby. You need a total of X points to get back into normal ranked queue. Yes, for players voting every single time is annoying, but hey you've landed yourself in the \"other ranked ladder\", this should serve to deter ragers.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think, would love to hear from Riot. I would be happy to discuss this with the community, but please keep it at discussion level, no heated arguments or personal attacks, it's just an idea to try and improve how people play and people's attitudes whilst playing, at the end of the day, this is a game and we should just have fun.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-26T12:55:21.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">should be pushed down the ranked ladder\n\nFeeders do get pushed down the ladder, I don't think you understand how this game works.\n\nFact is the more negative you are, the more games you lose simply because of how you act.","replies":[{"poster":"Tri","date":"2015-01-26T14:28:08.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"See that's the thing they get pushed down the ladder so lower ranked people who abide by the summoner's code have to deal with them, I'm suggesting that we put them into a whole different queue, \n\n\"To get into this system you would need to have been reported for various offences, reports submitted by the opposing team carry double weight.
