If someone DC's or AFK's then that team they're on should not lose LP at all, how frustrating is it when someone DC's or AFK's, it doesn't matter if you're winning, losing or even, usually there's no fun left in the game, especially if the DC is early, all you can do is sit back, try, but eventually lose anyway. You can't even surrender. If you're on the other team with 5, there's still no enjoyment at all, you're just rushing to finish as soon as possible. The DC lane opponent can just keep pushing all day for free. How is this even fair? Please, leaver buster helps with the leavers, but what about the people who stay?\r\n\r\nRiot you're just leaving us behind in the game to lose and not have fun, this is not what I signed up for.","replies":[{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-03T16:05:41.519+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Damn were losing hard!

Just because someone leaves on your team and you don't lose LP, doesn't mean you'll climb, you can still lose LP by the normal way, losing the game.

Say I have a friend in Diamond or KR Bronze. He makes a smurf, gets it to level 30 and we duo queue. Every time I think we're about to lose the game, he DCs himself \"accidendently\". So I (on my main account) don't lose LP. He takes the bullet on his smurf. My LP is safe.\n\nClimbing ranks will be easy if you don't lose LP. Losing LP is the very thing that makes people drop and it balances their standing out. Exploiting this means you cannot drop!","replies":[{"poster":"Tri","date":"2014-12-10T03:12:51.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I see what you're saying here, but the time it takes to get a level 30 is worth a few games? \n\nWhat I mean is, if you are about to lose a game and your duo queue friend leaves a few times then leaver buster will take him out right? \n\nMaybe leaver buster won't allow that smurf account to duo queue, or ban the account from playing ranked games. The account would be moved into leaver only queues, I think there's such a thing lol. Eventually the account would be banned altogether if there are enough leaves.","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-10T03:22:19.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why someone could farm up a lot of smurf accounts, some people go on tilt and start losing a bunch of games for some reason, exploiting your system would stop that. At that rate, getting into Silver or Gold would be extremely easy. Would take a bit more effort exploiting for Plat and Diamond. This just makes it very easy for elo boosters.","replies":[{"poster":"Tri","date":"2014-12-15T11:09:06.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Farm up just to get into gold or silver?

You can already illegally buy smurf accounts. People smurf anyway. Just an even easier way to abuse this. You could even buy the champs and XP boosts, making account levelling really easy, also making it near impossible to find if you exploited your way up the ladder. There's some lazy people, you can already elo boost using your mum's credit card, this just makes it even simpler.","replies":[{"poster":"Tri","date":"2014-12-18T14:53:33.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't there be an IP ban on offenders?","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-20T05:39:46.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Proxies.\n\nProxies everywhere.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-12-19T08:29:33.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You stole my name lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-03T15:00:16.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And also, have the AFKs still lose LP so it can't be exploited.","replies":[{"poster":"The Omega","date":"2014-12-03T15:06:00.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People will just duo on smurf accounts and spare their friends from losing lp....
