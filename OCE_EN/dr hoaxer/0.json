We will practice most nights and be entering tournaments. You will need to have ranked 5&#039;s experience, including map awareness, good communication, decent champ pool (at least current meta champs for your lane) and the ability to provide and receive constructive criticism. \r\n\r\nI am aware that a lot of players after reset can get stuck in gold or plat and it may not be a good determination of your skill level, but a minimum level ensures at least a baseline skill level. However, your skill will be judged in game and not solely on your rank (I have played with many bad diamonds and some really good golds).\r\n\r\nYou will also need to main the lane your wanting to play, i.e. play that role most of the time in solo q or ranked 5&#039;s. Have Skype and a good mic. \r\n\r\nIf your interested add me in game for a trial.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Fraggin","date":"2015-04-09T15:52:30.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ho4x3r,\n\nI'm interested in trying out as a mid laner for your ranked 5s team.\n\n - Champion pool: {{champion:101}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:4}} \n - Plat V in Soloq\n - Plat I in Ranked 5s\n - Available most nights\n\nI also have a mate who mains ADC who I've teamed with before.
