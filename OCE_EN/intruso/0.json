FACT. Either you’re not telling the full truth in order to look like you’re not in wrong OR you account shared and someone else used bots on your account.... so easy to lie on forums so without proof it’s your word against riots.. riot doesn’t care that much to just ban you for no reason so you must have botted . case closed!","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-13T01:55:42.028+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine unironically believing this.\nFalse positives have been on the rise, the forums prove this. \n\nSo either; this is bait, or an attempt to be edgy af.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-13T02:19:36.780+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems there was an error with the current wave of bot bans that caught a bunch of innocent players as well. I don't know the details but it looks like quite a few were reversed without even a ticket to player support (i.e with no action needed from the player affected). It's not great, but it's obviously been caught and is being handled.\n\nThat said, apparent configuration errors aside, 3rd party detection is still the most accurate and least likely to result in a false positive. This is an entirely different beast than the one that detects behavioural offences.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IntruSo","date":"2019-03-12T23:08:39.748+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got it back. they said it was a false positive.\n\nYou were wrong, but thanks for your time tho.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-14T15:11:17.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">The only thing different on my account from a few days ago is the amount of games done per day, obviously, and a different pc/internet provider.\n\nYour account was locked in case of account selling.
