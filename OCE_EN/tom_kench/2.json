If you don't know what Sketch League is, its simply a game of pictionary. Where the website gives you a champion, item, abilities, quotes and you have to draw it and your friends guess it (Highly recommend you play this game with friends, it's really enjoyable especially if you and your friends suck at drawing with a mouse just search up sketchleague). The game basically asked me to draw Cassiopeia which I did and this was the result. I had no intention of copying anyone, you can even check my history, I've even posted an Urgot one, a couple weeks ago. \n\nAlso if you have found this so called \"Original Post\" please link it, because I'm pretty sure I made this wonderful drawing of Cassiopeia; like it's not that hard to draw, just look at it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
