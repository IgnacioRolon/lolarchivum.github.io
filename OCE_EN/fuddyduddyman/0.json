Yet leaving this Champ select still hits you with a strike, not the toxic player. Essentially you are being punished for another players toxicity, with no oppertunity to report the offending player or to be pardoned for leaving.\r\nI think, and im sure many of you also will, that this is a weak link in a system that is ment to prevent this sort of behaviour. Adding this sort of functionality would probably not be difficult, and it would make these instances far less likely to occur and ruin the game for friendly players.\r\nthis just happened in a champ select of mine and so I thought I would share my idea while it was fresh =)\r\n\r\nFeel free to share your thoughts, hopefully this idea will get some notice!","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-25T00:55:51.625+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Simply introduce the reporting or chat monitoring side of things into the champ select and post game lobby. People abuse one another now freely in champ select etc because they know there are little to no repercussions. Introducing something to deter most people would surely help and for those who continue to abuse others will still cop a chat restriction or perma ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HumanbeastOM","date":"2017-01-25T00:23:28.277+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would never tell someone to kill themselves..yet the amount of people that turn around and say that shit to me makes me so fucking depressed..people are sociopathic and have no compassion for other players,not everyone but there is a bunch of people going around telling people to kys simply over a death,or a ingame mistake..riot needs to punish those people before someone clearly does kill themselves because they were triggered..i suggest a high punishment for those telling others to kill themselves...its messed up if you get angry and react to someone who keeps telling to to kill yourself and you get banned...rediculous..thanks riots for being on the side of the oppressors.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-24T07:03:01.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't see why not with the idea, in general anyway.\n\nWhat is going to be hard isn't adding a report function in Champ Select, because even if it's open to abuses, it'd be just like end-game reports, where invalid reports would still stay invalid for the very most part; what's real hard is defining the how that allows the players to leave without having Leavebuster on their asses and re-queue, for when a toxic player is indeed present and spouting shit in the Champ Select already.\n\nReports need time to be processed. And we can't just rely on the number of reports in Champ Select to allow players to leave without consequences either because that obviously opens up for abuse. So how?\n\nThat's what I don't really know. But other than that, I think conceptual wise, I think the general idea is indeed neat and rather needed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Armitige","date":"2017-01-25T14:25:22.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This should also extend to bots. I just played 2 games in a row with the same bot summoner on my team, and then queued for another game, only to find the same bot summoner in my team for a third time. There was no way I was going to play another unwinnable game with this POS, so all I could do was dodge. Meaning I effectively get punished because someone is taking advantage of Riot's inability to prevent cheaters. If I report someone, I don't expect to be put in the same team as them a 2nd time, let alone 3rd time. I expect to not see them in a game again.\n\nPerhaps that's how Riot should be handling this sort of thing. If someone reports a player, they should never be allowed on that person's team again. That way eventually the toxic/cheating players will wind up being unable to find games at all because they've ostracized themselves from enough of the community with their poor behaviour.","replies":[]}]}
