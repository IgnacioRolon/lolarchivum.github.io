BUT, the major issue of not being able to block a player is still there. this is super basic stuff and frankly I cant see any real reason why this is yet to be done, the development would take almost no time, the block list is already there, the player search functionality is already there, the only thing to do is add a single button that adds the selected player to the block list. This is beyond simple stuff and riot needs to have this brought to their attention. In it&#039;s current form the only way to block a player is to first add them to your friends list, this is not meant to work like this, it is simply a quirk of there being a block button on the friends list and not anywhere else. As I say, this would require no effort of Riot&#039;s part and be a huge benefit to the community!\r\n\r\nI hope this can be sorted with no delay, and not simply pushed down the list as it has clearly been for the last few months\r\nwhat are your thoughts, can any rioters pitch in on whether or not this is coming soon?\r\n\r\nThanks guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-19T06:18:05.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you mean 'blocking' a player as in they cant message you, or block them as in the system wont put you in the same games together?\n\nIf it is the latter, as nice as that would be to get away from trolls and bullies, it could potentially cause problems higher up the elo ladder.\n\nTo take an extreme example, pretend you are challenger, and you're also very sensitive or insecure.\nYou often end up 'blocking' players because they offended you somehow. There isn't actually that many challenger players out there, so you could end up restricting the number of people to play with so much that it affects match-making balance.\n\nThis could also be used in other ways to give yourself an advantage, for example:\nYou just played a game and this Yi on your team carried your ass because he was such a good player. You then play the next game and the Yi player gets placed on the enemy team and this time he plays against you and you lose. (this has happened to all of us) and you could easily 'block' him to stop that happening, even though he wasn't abusive.\n\nYou could also block every single bad player you come across so that you never have to have them on your team. Not only could this pose problems in terms of match-making, but it is also unfair to everyone else who wants to play by the rules.\n\nAlso if you were just a bad players _(kind hearted but just bad at league)_ and you got blocked by everyone you go into game with, just because they don't want to play with you again. You could end up with hundreds of players the system is blocked from pairing you with, and this could give you much longer queue times, or even have to bump you up or down (elo wise) into games where you don't belong, because there is a shortage of people willing to play with you.\n\nI cant speak for riot, but this is a reason that occurred to me as to why it hasn't been implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"fuddyduddyman","date":"2017-04-26T06:40:02.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea those are good points, i'm not entirely convinced by the idea of it being used to help you by blocking good players, I mean you also stop the good player from being of your team by blocking them, and stop the bad player from being on the other team by blocking them. it will not give you an advantage or a disadvantage it will just make sure that you wont play with them. I don't think that any player who is consistently bad will stay at an elo with those who block them either, because if you really are worse you will lose elo, and if not you won't do poorly every game.\nalso in terms of higher elo, the toxic players will be the ones who end up with the limited team pool, because a high proportion of people will block the toxic player, unless the proportion of those who block the toxic player is the same as the proportion who the 'over-blocker' blocks then then will not be a problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-04-20T11:06:16.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Typical 1 minded riot thinking!\n\nOh look, there is a problem so lets not use our brain a little and figure a way around it?\n\nSimple solution to your problem is to implement say 5 or 10 limit on player block!\n\nor allow only in bronze/silver/gold elo where all the trolls and kids are!\n\nSimple solution if you just use your head a little!\n\nBut then again the simpletons at Riot don't care about anything except their paychecks and share price!","replies":[]}]}]}
