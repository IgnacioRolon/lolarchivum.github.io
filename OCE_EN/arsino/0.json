I played a few games not doing overly well I might add, at this point I just thought I&#039;d wing it and give ranked a crack. Big mistake. I don&#039;t think that I&#039;ve ever seen more toxic people in all my gaming life as to what I witnessed today. Our lucian had some internet issues, big woop everyone gets it, to which our annie proceeded to tell the lucian to go kill himself. Like at what point does anyone think thats ok? Ive been playing this game since season 2 and have probably spent in the thousands on this game just to try help support it but if this sort of shit continues I&#039;ll regrettably have to hang the boots up on this game.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-30T14:16:47.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its in every game these days this is what happen wen little 12 year olds get to go on the internet there so though behind a screen in real life there just that loner that has no friends I kinda feel bad for them you can play 1 game these days with out having some toxic kid in game and riot ses they care wen rely as long as they get money from the littlie shits riot don't give two shits","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-08-30T20:31:36.140+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not little kids..

You stated that no one over the age of 20 plays lol.... \nYou lack common sense even in your response and lack of ability to understand even what you say yourself. \nI'm actually 25 but yeah ill go along with being 12 it doesn't phase me in the slightest...\nYour toxic to a very large amount of people on these forums.
