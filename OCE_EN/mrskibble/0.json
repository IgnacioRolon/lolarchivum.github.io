No doubt once enough time has passed they'll realise he's a bit of a dead champ and will try to rework him back into the game then lol.\n\nI think you'll generally find that it's \"only\" the people who care about/are attached to things that get frustrated by them when they change for the worse. So I'm glad it's an acceptable change for you to casually play him here and there, but it's different for those who play him as a main, but no longer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-01-24T22:03:22.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MrSkibble,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=TKIGpG2w,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-24T10:46:36.220+0000)\n\n> Old Malz could farm, lane pressure/push, melt any hero quite well. \n\nThis was probably why they changed him?\nNo one likes a champion with no counterplay, and old Malz fitted better than most into that category. \nThey wouldn't have just randomly updated a champ for no reason. \n\nNew Malz is certainly more interesting, and arguably harder, which is a good thing. \n\nMy beef with the new Malz though is that his voidlings intercept skillshots (and still live afterwards), so while Malz is getting damage off on you because his voidlings are swarming all around you, you cant get any off on him because his voidling's hitboxes soak up all the abilities you throw.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSkibble","date":"2017-01-24T22:13:29.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=TKIGpG2w,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-01-24T22:03:22.406+0000)\n>\n> This was probably why they changed him?\n> No one likes a champion with no counterplay. \n> \n> My beef with the new Malz is that his voidlings intercept skillshots (and still live afterwards), so while Malz is getting damage off on you because his voidlings are swarming all around you, you cant get any off on him because his voidling&#x27;s hitboxes soak up all the abilities you throw.\n\n\nWell his ability to melt people from his old W was only strong late game with 4+ items (or If he got fed early). By that point people will have their own defensive items such as QSS or banshees to weaken his combo.\n\nMalz needs his old ability lineup back as it was his strength/defence if he was dived by e.g. the overplayed Kat, Yasuo these days. But now once he's dived, he cannot deal enough damage to them to scare them off so they'll just go all in on him.\n\nIf he was such a problem hero, everyone would play him as they do Kat - but they don't, so I wouldn't think the reason for his change lies in how strong he was/wasn't.\n\n\nNot having a go at you personally btw ^ :P Just frustrated by the change.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MrSkibble","date":"2017-01-24T21:58:31.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Riot if you are reading this: Please change Malzahar back to the way he was. I can't imagine he's played more now because of this change, and probably less enjoyed by anyone who played Malz seriously.\n\nCan't think of a reason to try and 'fix' what isn't broken. Some champions will always be played more than others - that doesn't mean that the ones less played are broken. If your reasoning was to recreate him into something 'new and fresh' well.. That's failed on both counts. He isn't fun as it's just about having your fingers crossed that the enemy will be dumb enough to ignore his Voidlings in a fight (or simply not have AoE damage). He's no different to Heim in that sense, and he's just as vulnerable without his turrets.\n\n\nHe's boring and a considerably weaker now.\n- His passive is useful until he's poked once, basically no different to Malphite's passive.\n- His old W and R have just been merged into one R at the same damage.\n- He relies on his voidlings to do most of the damage in a fight - and they're just fragile things, so once they're killed like any other minion, Malz is vulnerable.\n\nMalzahar was better before because he didn't rely on a single, wildcard ability as his defence and he was much more effective in picking up kills **on his own** the old way.\n\n \nCould quite happily show you Riot, that the old Malz was better in every way - if you set up a match where I could fight this new Malz while playing as the old.\n\nWould be interested to hear the reasoning behind the change and can debate why it didn't work out lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrSkibble","date":"2017-01-24T21:17:33.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah good, it's not just me then.\n\nYea justice a lot of his items I still build the same, RoA, Lia, Rylais etc. But he just isn't as much of a threat now. If I'm waiting in a bush to gank whomever, there's a good chance they'll survive after I've spammed all my abilities on them so the voidlings do their damage - where as old Malz I could easily kill people in a few seconds.\n\nI've found that he's more of a, slowly poke the enemy down on health til they have like 20% left, then make a play to kill them. In teamfights he's just basically, ult a person while your team does the real damage to kill them.\n\nI played Malz non stop for a year, so probably had similar XP on him to Eon's friend - It really does feel like they've removed his power and ability to be a threat as a solo champion. I do see him played more now as a support which is disappointing - and I don't understand how that works effectively as his E needs to bounce off minion kills to keep his mana levels somewhat high..\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eonexus","date":"2017-01-24T12:12:13.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe im just bad, but i mentioned the same thing to a friend of mine the other day, as a guy who has like 30k champ exp on malzahar on another account, i can quite safely say that hes considerably weaker when it matters.

Since damage from standard build is from rylai/liandry, he's still good. + his new passive that gets less cooldown at higher champ level means hes more safe.
