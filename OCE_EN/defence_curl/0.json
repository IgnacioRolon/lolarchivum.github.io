There is a high chance that the Orianna that was being toxic also received a ban for their actions and comments, but what the Rioter said was 100% true, you did indeed do all those things and only made the situation worse for yourself, rather than just muting or ignoring the Orianna and continuing on with the game. Muting a toxic team member can help so much, by the time you get back into the game you forget you muted them in the first place and start to enjoy yourself again, so its overall just a good idea. I know you were 'defending yourself' but sadly that is not an exception in the [Summoners code](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/summoners-code).","replies":[]}]}
