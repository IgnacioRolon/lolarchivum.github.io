There are specific rules for this 1v5 though.\r\n\r\n- Summoners Rift 1v5\r\n- Recalls allowed\r\n- Once dead, the player cannot return to lane.\r\nIf the one dies, the five win. If the five all die at least once, the one wins.\r\n- Turret and minion kills don&#039;t matter\r\n- Mid lane only; no smite\r\n\r\nThanks, Ehrny.","replies":[{"poster":"420 Afgooey","date":"2016-11-16T06:59:45.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id say morg if theyre worse skill, long range mage if same skill","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2016-11-22T00:35:46.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally, anivia wouldnt be the worst, good quick burst with a revive ability and a way to trap them under tower if they get cocky, as well as a good slow and a stun","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Josh The Locke","date":"2016-11-18T10:09:35.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"champions with high AoE damage abilities would probably be the best, champs such as {{champion:92}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:268}} would one of the best.

It would be so unbalanced and highly broken. Sure there are champs better at fighting groups due to crowd control and things but there isn't a specific champ that will be best at 1v5ing IMO. if i were to have a crack at it, i'd say darius is your best bet.","replies":[]}]}
