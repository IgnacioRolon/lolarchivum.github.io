If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\n>Moderators will be looking for the following:\n\n>* Posts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\n* Posts accusing others of malicious activity\n* Posts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\n* Posts accusing others of trolling in the boards (thereâ€™s a report button for that)\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules\n___\nLast we heard lobby and post game chat is now also recognised by the IFS (it was always used in manual reviews).\n\n> We've been working on a system that involves looking through champ select and post-game chats looking for instances of verbal abuse or unsportsmanlike behaviour.\n\n>this is a relatively new system that is being trialed\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/RHaLh1FE-suspension-without-cause?comment=0006\n___\n\nIf you dodged the lobby or otherwise couldn't report in post game, you can submit a ticket to Player Support instead: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nPlease bear in mind though that Support can't give out any info regarding someone else's account or the actions taken against it, so you'll just get a generic, \"thanks for your report\" type reply.\n\n___\n\nWhile it doesn't excuse the behaviour, I also wouldn't recommend broadcasting things like your family being aboriginal. You knew he was being a bigoted ass and proceeded to paint a nice bright target on your back. The only one who gains from that is the one being toxic.","replies":[]}]}
