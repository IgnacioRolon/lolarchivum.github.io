Simple as that, when you boil it down to basics.\n\nThing is, the vast majority of online games use very similar tactics to address things like harassment and abuse, especially those that are aimed at an audience as young as 13 years of age (like LoL is). It's very rare for these kinds of systems to \"differentiate\" between un-provoked and provoked toxicity, because the bottom line is that it's the wrong thing to do, regardless of what the individual(s) in question may (or may not) have done.\n\nConsider it if you were on the receiving end of such behaviour, I seriously doubt you'd think the person(s) acting in such a manner should be \"allowed\" to get off free (much like your opinion on punishments [or lack thereof] for gameplay offences in LoL). To put it simply \"treat others as you would wish to be treated\".\n\n> Implement equal punishment for people who send in false reports of such conduct\n\nOk, I mean no offence here but you'll probably interpret what I say next as such so I'm just going to say it; that is probably the single worst idea I've seen on the boards to date. Riot are always encouraging players to report any behaviour they think is punishment worthy, and ultimately the system only works (rather, *can* only work) if that feedback is being provided. If such a system were to be implemented, no one would risk reporting, for fear that they themselves would be banned for nothing more than reporting behaviour they don't agree with. Long term, it would just make *everything* worse, since the *only* way most of the punishment systems in-game *can* work is by receiving the feedback that reports provide. Such a concept is completely contradictory of the existence of a report feature, and I can guarantee no developer would ever implement such a system if they cared, *even if only in the slightest*, about the community.\n\n> if I could voice chat and talk reasonably with the tilting kids who decide they want to REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE over a accident ks. Every. Single. Game. and intentionally feed, i'm sure I could talk them down.\n\nIn very specific situations, I'm sure you might be capable of that, *however*, in general, that's more than likely not a possibility. Most of the people who act out in such a way will only be \"encouraged\" by such a response, and simply \"amplify\" their behaviours when given that response. All they're really looking for is attention, and the only way to \"win\" against such people is not to \"play\" their game.\n\nI'm not going to say that you're wrong to say that the community is sh!t and that Riot is responsible for that, because I'd agree that there is *some* truth to such a statement, *however* it's not *all* on Riot. The community itself plays a big roles in how the community (and, as a result, the game) turn out. We can't go about denying our \"contribution\", as a whole, to the toxicity that exists now.\n\nIf you feel that things have become so bad that there is no longer any point in trying to enjoy the game, and that you choose not to click that \"I understand\" button as a result, then I say good for you. Go find a game (and developer) that's worth you time effort and even money. I would just like to ask that you avoid contributing to the destruction of any other communities you might become a part of, as it seems you *may* have done with LoL. Instead of consistently focusing on the shortcomings of others, focus on your own shortcomings and work to reduce their impact on the people around you.\n\nI would like to leave you with this one bit of wisdom, and ask that you consider it's meaning and how it's applicable to you:\n> The only thing we *can* control is whether we a good or evil","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2018-04-20T15:07:53.474+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> When it comes down to it, you&#x27;re being held accountable for *your own* actions, just as you would be in real life.

To put it simply &quot;treat others as you would wish to be treated&quot;.\n\nI have a thicker skin for words, work around tradies and such. Not saying everyone should get a back bone or have the same life experience, obviously a lot of kids in this game's demographic, but they're doing no favours to themselves or the development of these kids' minds by pussy footing around them. I certainly think the punishment system is far disconnected. Chat restrictions? fine, hell restrict people who lose their shit in chat longer and longer until they are near-permanently chat restricted if need be, but a ban for typing words is like putting someone in jail for life, for swearing in public.\n \n>probably the single worst idea \n\nI personally think it's the best idea. Punishing near-innocent people for losing their minds over the sheer trolling of the game community is what seems to utterly foreign to me. \n\n> *however*, in general, that&#x27;s more than likely not a possibility. Most of the people who act out in such a way will only be &quot;encouraged&quot; by such a response, \n\nMy personal experience is FAR to the contrary. Most games over the past 20 years where i've run into this type of situation where voice chat is available, I see people talked down from their platform more often than not. We can agree to disagree here I guess, it's usually the case when I make this argument, especially to the 'allergic to voice chat' portion of the LoL community.\n\n> I&#x27;m not going to say that you&#x27;re wrong to say that the community is sh!t and that Riot is responsible for that, because I&#x27;d agree that there is *some* truth to such a statement, *however* it&#x27;s not *all* on Riot. The community itself plays a big roles in how the community (and, as a result, the game) turn out. We can&#x27;t go about denying our &quot;contribution&quot;, as a whole, to the toxicity that exists now.\n\nMost people are followers, they see an action, a pattern, they tend to copy it. It's almost ingrained as a part of human psychology, even if you are not a follower type, you will often just pick up and adopt the habits of those around you. That's why governing laws exist, separate from the pure will of the apparent masses. ie. even if the majority of people today wanted to say... kill all black people, the governing bodies of the world with it's current morality would deem that wrong and despite a more democratic society \"logically\" making the decision that \"well, 70% believe we should kill blacks\", the smarter, less crowd following, law decreeing minority would likely prevail and keep it as illegal.\nMy point is; Riot has more responsibility than they implement when it comes to this system, as it stands the balance is way off. They can't just have an automated system that flags things and punishes. They need more manual oversight, and to make that possible, as I mentioned before, they need to be more firm on false reporting.\nThere have been plenty of examples in the past of popular players being banned by sheer report volume, for literally no reason. Their current system is simply a modified version of that system. You can put sprinkles on dogshit, it's still dogshit.\n\n> If you feel that things have become so bad that there is no longer any point in trying to enjoy the game\n\nI'll try my best if I am still able to play without clicking \"I understand\" as said. When I can voice chat, whenever that (hopefully) comes, i'll certainly be less rage-induced when it comes to non-communicative players and similar. The ones that do decide to respond to team calls and strategy, as well as being enjoyable to talk to, should make for a far more enjoyable experience (the main reason I would want voice, to off-set the current impersonal environment, which I think contributes heavily to the negativity in this community).\n>I would just like to ask that you avoid contributing to the destruction of any other communities you might become a part of, as it seems you *may* have done with LoL. \n\nGetting a bit ahead of yourself, I mean you even know what you just said is bullshit with your backpeddled \"*may* have done\" copout. I am far from the worst in this community, nor have I contributed to anything but a few trolls getting madder, losing my temper a few times in chat is far from trolling, inting, griefing, throwing games on purpose, tilting others players on purpose or anything like that. And that's where my issue lies, I never see bans for these people.\n\n>Instead of consistently focusing on the shortcomings of others, focus on your own shortcomings and work to reduce their impact on the people around you.\n\nThat's about the only thing i'll admit to, I often get far too mad when people make mistakes, but I usually reserve that for things like afking in jg and getting killed by a (fully visible) invade, or being fully aware of a gank coming and staying in lane, or not engaging when your jungler comes to gank, or whatever. Game destroying mistakes that were fully avoidable.\nMy biggest fault and what I need to work on the most. But it is incredibly hard to ignore such things for me, as I don't understand why people even play a ranked game unless they are actually trying.\n\n> I would like to leave you with this one bit of wisdom,\n\nGood or Evil ey?

The specific behaviours I'm referring to are the ones you have admitted to, in that you will \"retaliate\" to toxic individuals when provoked. At least, that is certainly the inference I get from your post.

I believe Riot doesnt take a stand against these toxic players as much as they ~~could~~, nearly 50% of OCE's league population are under silver 4 (that is an accurate statistic) where most toxic people are.

I think League's punishments should be different for different types of offenses, they clearly do not work and they just piss off players even more encouraging them to return to their toxic ways.. Demoting a player to honor 0 for exploding at a 12 year old feeder who wastes 30 minutes of their lives and making them having to spend countless hours reaching honor 2 again is just stupid.

When working at an establishment are you fired on the spot? No. You get three warnings before you are let go. \nThe chat log that came back and said I was banned for this reason was utterly stupid and as far as I know of that is the reason I’m banned as no other chat logs have been produced so far. So I take it from that game where I said nothing offensive I was banned for. I know I was reported a few other times but again that was not a bannable offence- this is player behaviour where I didn’t feed, I didn’t say anything, just that I was reported and bam I’m banned for 14 days, where’s the fairness in that? Do I get a some sort of trial to defend myself? Do people that investigate actually investigate the whole thing or just see that I was reported 7 times over 2 weeks and I’m banned.
