Chat Restrictions that scale with each consecutive/escalation/severity increase of toxicity until maybe even a eventual permanent chat restriction/mute, but bans are just not all that logical.\r\n\r\nIf the chat restrictions were scaling from weeks and eventually months at a time, it would FORCE those players who lose their shit to eventually learn to talk minimally or not at all. ie. most of the time I find, it&#039;s people who have no issue typing or reading that tend to get landed with restrictions, as opposed to people who throw out a couple of lines a game, they get flagged less. Essentially I see neither as any different other than the person who types more having more the flagging system can source for punishments.\r\n\r\nEven a 25 game restriction can be blasted through in 1-2 days by someone who wants to play a lot, and being restricted over that time can probably lead to even more bitterness and anger by the time they are unrestricted, because they&#039;ve spent 10-20 hours not being able to communicate critical information they wanted to communicate, leading to likely more &#039;shit being lost&#039; in chat immediately after.\r\n\r\nA 14 day ban? I can only imagine that would anger someone more (as it has I) than a chat restriction. Even if you have the time to level an alt account, you won&#039;t have all the champions you might want to play, rune pages and etc..\r\n\r\nI get that Riot wants to punish people for negative behaviour. And I don&#039;t see how words being spoken should lead to an account ban. Punishment that suits the crime, right? Talk too much negativity? well you lose your ability to speak, makes sense. Scale that punishment, don&#039;t escalate it to a ban.\r\nBans should be reserved for people who negative impact the actual game, trolls, griefers, scripters, etc.. Those people tangibly without question effect gameplay outcomes. People who talk a lot of shit and get mad, they may effect the mental state of a player on their team, or all 4, who knows, but that&#039;s the point, it will vary person to person. \r\nThere are plenty of option there;\r\nUser side: Mute that player\r\nServer side: Chat Restrict that player\r\nFuture implementation: Voice chat might create more positivity in the community and reduce impersonal nature of games as they are now. (debate all you want, good comes with whatever bad you might want to theorise)\r\n\r\nTo fully lock someone from playing your game PURELY on the merit of angry chat, seems a little overboard. And I think will leave to a far more angry community as plenty of people will keep coming back despite this. And when those people come back there are multiple outcomes;\r\n- They have lost their account and all the content on it (champs, skins, progress over the seasons on their profiles (not to mention from a few dollars to thousands if they are spenders).\r\n- They feel unjustly punished for the level of toxicity they exhibited, which will just lead to likely more spiteful mentality toward the system.\r\n- They will have no issue being like say... Tyler1 of the past, creating new accounts over and over and unthrottling any negativity they ever might have withheld before (I personally think this is the case for the community as it stands already, heaps of trolls I run into are people who have been banned and they just do not care anymore, they come in, they troll, they abuse, and they proudly boast &quot;lol been banned before, come at me&quot;)\r\n\r\nAnyway, i&#039;ll leave it at that.\r\nPlease, give your opinions.","replies":[{"poster":"amorphim","date":"2018-04-27T19:19:32.064+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"or you could just not be toxic at your teammates??? it's really not that hard to do. just say nothing, protip if you type /muteall at the start of a match then its much less toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2018-04-28T00:46:50.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=amorphim,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=m3EtkTAa,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2018-04-27T19:19:32.064+0000)\n>\n> or you could just not be toxic at your teammates??? it&#x27;s really not that hard to do. just say nothing, protip if you type /muteall at the start of a match then its much less toxic.\n\nActually, I find it incredibly hard not to be, it seems. as 15* (over estimated lol) chat restrictions over the past 2 years have proven. But recently I got a 14 day ban for a particularly bad bout in 1 game, (like literally, the 2nd game quoted I swore twice). So the topic still stands.\n\nAnd /muteall rule applies to the fairies who get offended by the slightest bit of comment or criticism too. You know\n**\"hey dude, try not to push since you're behind, i'll gank in a minute\"** \n_gets read as_ \n**\"STOP BEING A FUCKING DICKHEAD AND SIT UNDER TURRET %%%%, I'LL CARRY YOU KID\"**\nand then they start abusing because their little egos are hurt.\n\nI'm sorry, but if i'm forced to mute myself in order for kids to not have their egos hurt, I don't really see the point in a chat system at all, and Riot should just remove it from the game, completely, and have pings only. (NOT THE WORST IDEA ACTUALLY, RIOT PAY ATTENTION)\n\nIn that I mean, if Riot is going to cater for the lowest common denominator, why not them too?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-26T10:51:21.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Mmhmmmmm yup ok mmmmmm :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-26T11:33:34.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I've said this before man. Riot are self righteous nuts that believe people who flame have no place in a game. Their chat system is trash, it doesn't incentivise you to get less toxic because you will be punished for being *negative* which every player cant help. Oh someone is trolling on your team, better not tell them to stop \"inting\" because that \"negative\" and Riot don't want that in their games. And guess what, that troller won't get punished however because you have been punished before, so your on Riots shit list and anything, however small it is, even if its only slightly negative, it's gonna get another big fkn red flag on your name and your gonna get punished further. I also agree with you that the idea that you can get banned from a game for something that has no effect on actual game play is absolutely ridiculous. There is even a countermeasure put in for people who are toxic, the mute button. However there isn't a countermeasure put in for people who troll because weighted reports have been taken away, so now if you actually get a 9x report (mind you that's a bannable offense to say it in game, what a joke) on someone it only counts as one report, absolute joke that league has turned into and i am definatly sure this is contributing to the \"league is dying xD\" joke that is circulating because its bloody true","replies":[]}]}
