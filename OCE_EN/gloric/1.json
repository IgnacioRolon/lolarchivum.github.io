But when I say this, I mean it in all sincerity;\r\n\r\nShyv is now useless without Sated Devourer.\r\nShe has and never will be a tank, she can get &#039;tanky&#039; sure, but a tank without any type of control skills, no stuns, no slows, no knockback (ult doesn&#039;t count, mid fight knockback aint worth crap, especially if it screws your team&#039;s positioning, or misses despite a seemingly direct hit, easy to dodge as well), no silence (I mean even Garen has that) or anything else you could consider CC.\r\n\r\nI mean, don&#039;t get me wrong, you can still do things, get a few kills, wittle people down when you run/ult into lane for your teammates. But in terms of mid/late game, where she&#039;s meant to shine, she now doesn&#039;t even have the burst associated with sated+THydra (and even Trinity Force if you want to pretty much 1 shot squishies).\r\n\r\nI mean even if you switch it up, go Cinderhulk and try to replace Devourer with Witt&#039;s End, BorK or otherwise, it&#039;s a 2nd rate Shyv, she just doesn&#039;t do anything close to what she used to.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the loss of the boot enchant makes it harder to stay on top of the enemy team quite often (not immensely harder, but it&#039;s still a nerf to her core mechanic/strengths, like pretty much everything this patch, it seems =P)\r\n\r\nOverall I think Shyv has no power spike and no role to fill anymore. Despite being a mid/late game champ, she&#039;s mostly good early game, and drops off mid to late without devourer as she has almost nothing to bring to a fight but running around hitting things (ie. like Garen, who is also useless in any real match).","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2016-05-04T06:09:42.298+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"so you realise the new devo does 3% max hp on hit shyv her q is an aa reset that does 2 aas so 9% within 1 sec yeah","replies":[{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-05-04T11:18:10.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mar3thyu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ATPlLgXr,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-04T06:09:42.298+0000)\n>\n> so you realise the new devo does 3% max hp on hit shyv her q is an aa reset that does 2 aas so 9% within 1 sec yeah\n\nWhat they actually want is an item that can help u snowball even tho u did shit early game.

Shyv has no CC avoidance/counters.\n\nYes, if you go BorK and have your E applies, you could potentially hit, purely with % based damage, as much as 22.5% of someone's hp, from an auto and Q instantly, add some AD into that and yes, you could hit for maybe 40% of someone's hp in a single hit.\n\nBut as i've detailed, the tank and mage meta as it is has Shyv constantly slowed, stunnned, thrown around, whatever. So sure, she hits 1 person, then just walks slowly after them. If she's reduced to a 1 hit wonder, that 1 hit better mean a hell of a lot.\n\nAs I said though, in the original post I'M AWARE SHE CAN STILL BE EFFECTIVE. But she's been nerfed pretty hard by this, while every single other champion in the game is getting buffs, the mage update is giving many champions for more utility than they had before, the juggernaut update made all the tanks more effective, more and more CC is being implemented into the game every rework/patch/whatever.\n\nOverall, I am mostly commenting on the fact that Shyv has lost her (rather cheap, i'll admit) strength of being able to 1 hit people if left un-CC'd, to being as people say, a tank harasser.\n\nShe has lost a bit of her mobility with the removal of boot enchants as well, which makes it harder for her to push through slows in order to catch people to hit with that % based damage.\n\nThis was, both on paper and in-game, a nerf for Shyv, and she's going to be very much less effective and I belive will die, not because of the loss of her 1-hit ability, but because she's going to fall behind every other choice in game (note; every jungler can go this new devourer, and they can do a better jobn with it, such as Jax or Xin, weith their CC and short(er) cooldown closer skills/stuns/knockups.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-05-04T05:40:07.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shyvana was a great jungler before sated dev, she will be a great one after it.\n\nThe new item wont require a shyvana to spend 25 mins of the game farming the jungle.\nInstead, now she has that 3% DMG making her extremely good pick against other tank junglers or a tank comp (Kinda like the tank meta right now)\nAll of her abilities goes well to with shredding tanks. (Now she can do it faster)\n\nAnd shyvana has always been tanky, she even gets more tanky when's she's a dragon.\n\n---------\n\nI'm not sure what you read but she's fine, maybe even better.

Clearly you don't play Shyv (enough).\n\nBut you know what, i'm going to reply anyway.\n\n1. No jungler worth a damn thing spends 25 minutes farming jg, especially Shyv. Shyv can and does routinely get sated in 16-18 minutes WHILE ganking lanes (sometimes BECAUSE of ganking lanes). Is this a legitimate reason it was removed? because bronze players afk in jg for 20 minutes? so Riot designing game around bad players?\n2. 3%, woohoo, so shyv's now reduced to a tank harassing role? that'll be fun, chasing Garen and such around the map like a toolbox.\nLet's do the math here. 3% per hit, if you go Bork, that's 2% per hit, and with your E applied that's 2.5% per hit. Let's say you engage with your Q, you'll hit the enemy for 15% of their hp, not including standard AD and similar. Sounds good on paper, but without the triple hit proc, she's going to shrink into obscurity.\n3. And there are many options to handle tanks. Despite this patch making it more of a mage meta as far as we can tell so far.\n4. Never debated that, but it's still a crappy role to to be designed for. Few champs that Shyv can properly harass, tanks like braum slow her and run away, ditto with Leona. Tanks like Darius life steal, get 5 stacks and ult you to oblivion. Garen just runs away due to no CC.\n5. I said, I know she is tanky, but she's not a tank in the traditional sense of being a control factor, she's more of a bruiser, with her kit.\n\nDidn't read a thing, experienced it in game over a few games so far, doesn't look brilliant.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-05-04T06:26:01.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play Shy enough, I have been meaning to get back into her.\nBut I do jungle enough.\n\nI Just threw those numbers together, the fastest I have ever gotten sated was 10 mins.\nEven still those were on really good games, at latest it takes me 15 mins. If a REALLY bad game, 20.\n\nNow those numbers do look really good, she can provide decent dmg while still maintaining her role as a \"Fighter/Tank\"\nShes not suppose to do dmg, even tho she does anyway.\nAlso if you chase tank across the map, maybe its not the items fault at play here.\n\nAnd if your getting CC'ed there are ways to fix this, Banshies veil is a good item, HP/MR/HP regen and a bubble every 30 secs.\nMaw has been recently buffed. Merc treds are a good buy on any tank.\nAnd even tho its nerfed QSS can still be used. \n\nIf you are getting CC'ed away maybe start buying items that help counter that.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2016-05-04T06:37:26.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can drop the basic gameplay tips. \n\nThe problem here is they've turned Shyv from a fairly boring to play tank, in the past, into the powerhouse she's been for a year and a half, and now they're turning her back into a boring tank. All with a single item change. Is this a problem with the champion itself? maybe so.\n\nIt's a pretty mean thing to do, it would be like them soon turning Sion back into his less-than-thrilling pre-rework state. Or for a more recent example, backflipping on Taric or Poppy's rework and making them the boring old things they were before.\n\nI understand that a jungle item is not a champion, but it's what made Shyv fun and pretty much viable to play for quite awhile. The item alone gave her many build paths because it gave flexibility to offset her overall lacking input in any given match/situation. She could go a bit tankier and absorb turrets and etc.. to help push, while still having enough damage to make a difference in a fight, or she could go a little more damage oriented, a little less tanky, and have that \"carry\" potential if needed.\nInstead, she's been reduced to a turret shot absorbing % melee hitter. \nI don't think there's a single other champion in game that has their kit entirely based around standing there and AAing. It would be a crappy kit design and Riot would know this. But that's exactly what Shyv , was, stopped being with Devourer and is again now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"IgutUlikeAfisH","date":"2016-05-25T04:28:22.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have 400.000 pionts in shyvana . gloric is 100% correct. and also-fuck you riot bright back shyvana","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-04T17:57:34.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you wanna play a jungler but dont wanna gank, play another role, play another champion. junglers need to impact the map more than any other role. realistically though, here in oce, if you're not challenger or master, anything is possible.  but you can just look at what the pros are playing, not even professionally, just in solo queue, all the jungler mains, would be playing the meta picks like nidalee, elise, reksai, kindred, lee sin, graves, gragas. in all of the regions, at least 4 out of 5 jungler mains will have 5 of those 7 champs as their most played. those are the strongest junglers right now and have been for quite a while. nobody high ranked in solo queue will be playing shyvana. if you're looking to climb ranks you play whats strong, whats effective. if you're happy with diamond you can instalock shyvana and 1v9 at 30 minutes every game\n\ncinderhulk shyvana? might aswell afk at the fountain m8","replies":[]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-05-04T05:47:53.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO.
