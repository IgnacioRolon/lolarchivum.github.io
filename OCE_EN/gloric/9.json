Is this just unintended and will it just count down and not decay, or has decay not been turned off yet? OR do I have to play 1 ranked game during pre-season to sort of &quot;refresh&quot; the status of my account?\r\n\r\nBorders and similar, when do they roll out? I am just curious, not worried.","replies":[]}
