But i&#039;d appreciate if this is a know issue and being worked on. I never dodge or afk or otherwise from games and don&#039;t want those marks against my account... nor do I want to lose LP/promo matches because of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-08-06T06:02:11.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Freezing in champ select then returning the home page is usually a result of a failure to establish a stable connection to the servers.
