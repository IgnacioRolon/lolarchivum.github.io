But after a month the que times for that went to over 20mins too and that was then taken away.\n\nFacing facts, OCE isn't big enough to support 2 normal game ques, and you can't have only draft since the \"OP\" champions would then NEVER be played and it would pose a bit of a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-05-11T06:11:46.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't sell skins for reworked/released broken op champ because banned so leaving blind normals means people can play their broken champs and roflstomp until rito nerf.\nMeanwhile community sick to death of not being able to ban and important items being nerfed so broken OP champs can roflstomp harder.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-05-10T00:37:12.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Our community has an overwhelming issue with salty attitudes and \"conformity\" that if you use a bit of logic, its not logical why they do it, and why they get so angry. I refer to the \"type your role in char select chat and rage if anyone tries to ask if you may go there instead\" and if you refuse to be stuck in a role you are not confident or good in, its all your fault... \n\nThis is most common with people who have really quick loadins, me, im always one of the last... but if everyone zergs roles and tries to force me to supp, i either refuse or get creative and try something new, both of which gets rage. \n\nI'm happy to supp, im not happy being forced into doing it and basing my game around making someone else look good. I am a team player, i try with any setup, i can see how it may work, i think outside the box. \n\nMy current love is Xin Zhao; i do NOT in any way play him as a jungler, i'd take any lane role instead, top obviously being the prefered. But as nobody wants to sup, im currently forced to play in Supp... Turns out it's a strong \"supp\" as in s+ ranked twice in a row and still end up snowballing, i just don't get my early game dominance and im aware. I get a relic to get \"some farm\" and help \"supp\" and build into my usual damage with creative (if needed, it hasn't been so far) defensive items. Xin using supp role.... Not as strong early, yes i admit.... but you end up having a strong mid/late game anyways, roam often, realize you're probably as strong or stronger than the jungler and go for a counter roam / roam into mid, you'll pick up something usually. \n\nIt is not his best role, but i refuse to be forced to play in ways i dont enjoy in normals.\n\n\nHonestly, i do understand draft pick.... But i also think it's time dynamic ques moved into normal, not just ranked play. It would avoid this argument which is mostly with younger players who cannot be mature, chat with team and find a middle ground everyone is happy with. \n\nOCE is all about \"Me\" \"Im the best, support me, i'll carry, ill be the god\" and nobody wants to do anything else. Try and say you're not their slave/bi*ch... raaaage, toxicity, threats of reports, afk's the works. Especially when people can't see a stronger option being offered and more viable in the role, but no... rarely any compromise. \n\nATM i enjoy breaking metamoulds in normal till i find some people for ranked who i enjoy their attitude and skills, don't care if you're a challenger, if your attitude sucks. I don't want to be in your game. I'd rather play against you and do my best to shut you down and mock your attitude in the end. (those players generally rage at teammates for not basing their games around making sure that champ is as awesome looking as possible)","replies":[]}]}
