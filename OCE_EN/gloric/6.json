A majority of players have no real interest in becoming proficient at more than one thing in this game.

Ruining the game potentially for 4 other people.\n\nEarnest players will learn all they can, more casual league players who (oddly) decide to play ranked games, are the issue here, in low elo, since this is the only elo it matters, and is the only elo in this regard where it hinders progression/climbing.

It's one of those things that sounds great in theory but doesn't work out in practice.\n\nIt's less a matter of knowing all 5 roles and more a matter of knowing at least your two main roles and support. Top and Mid are the two most sought after roles atm (though it changes a bit from season to season) so someone queuing as top/mid can expected to see autofill a lot, because there is a high saturation of top/mid players and a low saturation of jng and very low of support.\n\nAutofill is still preferable to the old system of first come first serve with pick order, where you were far less likely to get a role you wanted than you are now.","replies":[{"poster":"Saiqa","date":"2016-12-24T14:05:07.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-24T15:24:25.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is this 75% number coming from? A 30 minute queue is a massive barrier of entry for a significant number of people (i.e anyone with work, school, or general significantly time consuming life related obligations), which is why Riot has decided not to accept such a long queue time in exchange.\n\nIf you're basing that on what you see here, then it's worth remembering that most people come to boards because they have a perceived problem, so those who are content with how things work are rarely seen here. \n\nEven if you put that aside, for every person saying they would take a 30 min queue to get a role they want, there is someone else complaining about the length of queues and how it is preventing them from playing ranked, and that is with the current system.\n\nIt varies from person to person, I would much rather play ADC, my weakest role but one that I still have a champ I am semi comfortable with (MF or Jinx) than wait an hour in queue to get my main role. And I say an hour because both LAN and LAS have higher populations that OCE, and both were seeing 30+ min queues (when there was only ONE ranked queue) with that option active, so you can imagine how this would be worse on OCE.\n\nWe couldn't have supported such an option with only one ranked queue, and now we have to support two there is just no way it's going to happen.\n\nSupport isn't a bad role, but the community perception has perpetually pushed it out of favour, and I doubt you'd find many people who would agree with say, removing the role, so clearly it has some value to them.","replies":[{"poster":"Saiqa","date":"2016-12-25T05:24:57.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-25T07:25:06.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're not wrong, but it isn't something where we can just flip a magic switch.

The impact it had on queue stability was just too high.\n\nThat said, we will likely see the integration of NCS (New Champion Select) into blind pick sometime in the future, meaning we will be able to pick roles. Of course there are no guarantees of this, but given the direction they seem to be moving, I feel it is more a matter of 'when' than it is 'if'.\n\nBlind pick is not autofill enabled draft. Draft pick involves bans, pick order, and seeing what champions the enemy picks (and takes so very much longer to get through). Blind pick is none of those things.\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again, OCE does not get shafted because we are smaller. If anything we get MORE attention. Us not having the population to support a queue like permanent Twisted Treeline does not mean Riot hates us, it means there are not physically enough people playing on our server to support that queue.\n\nWe get patches first, we have the same main queues (flex, solo/duo, normals, ARAM) as every other server, we get all the same RGMs, we have our own yearly event that over the last two years has given us an artificial reef and the beginnings of a wall of summoner names which no other server gets.","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2017-01-04T03:59:39.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't say Blind pick was auto fill draft, I said Draft with Auto Fill is basically blind pick. In the sense that someone will always get shafted into something they don't want to play, however, with blind pick it's worse, it's potentially 4 people will get thrown into roles they do not want to play, sure that's worst case scenario, but it's a possible scenario.\n\nYes, Draft has bans and a wait time, but half the time I sit through dodges in blind picks which amount to 4-5 entire draft pick durations. So I don't really see the issue/difference in the end (outside of people having their picks banned by trolls).\n\nYes it might be hyperbole that we get ignored, but I don't think i've seen any real responses to OCE posters about these issues.\n\n\nSo basically, they are implementing draft autofill but without the ban phase? (ie. this NCS you speak of, never heard anything about it)\n\nIn the end, I still don't understand how autofill now being on 24 hours a day, is acceptable, it's gotten worse as the season has progressed a little and most of the early season rankers have teetered off a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-04T04:16:34.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suppose there's a lot of factors that go into it like level/time/mode/premade status of play but I rarely see dodges in Blind pick. Even in ARAM I'll only see maybe 1 dodge out of 6-7~ games unless I'm having a really unlucky day.\n___\nAs for no official Riot responses, there aren't very many OCE Rioters who have boards in their job description, and even fewer who's jobs involve actually posting (talking low single digits here) and they all have other things to do as well. The OCE Riot team is incredibly small and incredibly busy, which is why we started a volunteer program here, to address those concerns which the Rioters cannot. \n\nAutofill is something which they have addressed in the past, and have addressed in official global statements, so it's not something they can afford to spend too much time on. \n\nThis: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/F6a4bMs5-autofill-in-ranked-solo-q-for-lower-rank?comment=0003 is essentially the official statement on Autofill on OCE.\n___\nNCS is the new method of champion selection that was introduced with Dynamic queue last year (i.e role selection, the evolution of Team Builder). Like I said, no guarantees and no set timeline, but it's likely yes.\n___\nAutofill is on essentially whenever there is a small enough population of one role to create queue instability (in this case usually in the form of 40+ min queue times), which on a server as small as OCE, with now two queues to support, is pretty much always, Far too few people are willing to pick up support, and this is the end result.\n\nYeah autofill has it's problems, and yeah it sucks if you get filled into a role you can't play, but ultimately it's a problem that us as players created. We created this stigma that supports are useless, or only good for warding (despite the evidence otherwise), and get stuck in our \"this is what this game is for and therefore the only way it should be played\" meaning that support gets pushed aside since it doesn't fit that mold.\n\nAutofill is a necessary evil until Riot can find a way to make support more appealing to the everyone else while still keeping the core values and not completely screwing over the support mains.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FerrousOxide","date":"2016-12-24T04:55:32.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Autofill initally annoyed me aslo.
