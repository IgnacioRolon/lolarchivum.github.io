Something akin to The Terminator from the famous movies.\n\nImagine if you will, a T800 brandishing some sort of stylized axe in place of a firearm. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/9dlif8T.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YHleoYH.jpg\n\n**Passive**\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jkn3Tbz.jpg\n\nHis R could be signaled with some type of mechanoid sound effect (akin to that we hear in almost every sci-fi movie with mecha like elements in it, from District 9, Transformers, or whatever) with a similar 'boom' effect. Or just be left as is. The animation could be a haze of... \"energy/electricity\" effect, just for something different, or also be left the same. \nHe could even be stylized to have a layer of skin which he loses as he fights/takes damage (which doesn't recover until dying and respawning) if you want to get all super referential.\nObviously it couldn't be exactly like the T800 or anything. that would be an obvious breach of copyright, but adding in stylizing with the big jaw element, glowing belly (power source?) and etc.. would work well to separate it.\n\nThe differences between a normal skin and legendary or even ultimate skin could be debated, obviously.\n\nI just think the overall theme would suit Sion. \"The Undead Juggernaut\" or \"The Mechanoid Terminator\"\nNote, I do understand Sion isn't super popular and thus this is very unlikely to get picked up. But considering there are already a fair few mecha themes skins, I thought it worth suggesting since Sion really needs another decent skin other than default. Something that isn't just default with some armour patches added to his model lol","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-03-16T00:00:08.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's rare that I find myself agreeing with player ideas like this.\n\nBut yes, a mecha-ish skin of sorts would be very suiting to Sion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-16T22:04:26.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"hextech sion? that's a great idea. oh I see you changed the name, my bad","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-03-16T07:08:07.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"isn't that hextech sion ?","replies":[{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2015-03-16T09:25:36.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never played old Sion (only started playing October, so never had the chance for AP Sion lulz).
