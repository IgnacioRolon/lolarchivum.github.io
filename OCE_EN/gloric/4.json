Not talking about skill playing the game or otherwise (though one could argue, taking advice without thinking it's an insult to your existence, could be considered a skill that helps you not tilt and etc..). OCE just seems to have a massively higher proportion of players with insanely over the top tamper tantrums.\r\n\r\nThe slightest bit of anything they can construed as negative is taken as a very insult to their existence and they fly off the handle, feeding and insulting for the entire length of games. \r\nEven as little things as \"i'm going for red, wait and we will kill him\" is taken as \"you are trash, wait for a gank\" or something, which just sets them off.\r\n\r\nEvery single ranked game i've played for the past 4 weeks has been littered with these people, on my team at that, no clue about the enemy team. But it almost always results in a loss.\r\n\r\nAnother example might be that, no one ever, EVER gives honours for friendly, teamwork or helpful. Something I experienced almost every game on the NA server. If anything, stuff that would constitute a +Helpful seems to as I said before, tilt people, like trying to help someone understand a champion they're having trouble against on something they (for argument's sake) should counter.\r\n\r\nA few of the people I play with seem to concur with this, people from NA, SEA and etc.. who have seen the differences.\r\n\r\nAnyway, i'll leave it at that if anyone feels like discussing this issue. Because it is an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-02-10T11:54:22.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I understand where the OP is coming from.

We tried our best, and sure we didn't win, but the only frustration was with our bad plays (which we can learn from to get better) and not at some asshat who decided to abuse us.\n\nThe games before that we did well, and we won, and still everyone was positive. There was only one game out of 20~ recently where we encountered any toxicity. Yeah we got a little lucky with that, but it isn't nearly as prevalent as people make it out to be. In large it's negativity bias, but it's also herd mentality. \"Everyone in x scenario says the game is toxic, so therefore I am much more inclined to believe it\". It makes you notice teh negativity more, and the positivity less. Especially since the positive behaviour reaches the extreme heights far more rarely than negative behaviour does, since negativity breeds more negativity, but positivity is often shut down or at least not interacted with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CapKebab","date":"2017-02-13T14:22:15.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Main Line,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1EzshLBN,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2017-02-10T11:54:22.033+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, I understand where the OP is coming from.
