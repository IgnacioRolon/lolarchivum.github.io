Before I go into detail about the positions and such, we are looking for dedicated and serious members - people with the same passion as me to go to OCS, or even opL if we&#039;re really good. You need to be able and willing to participate in weekend training sessions, team chats, and creation of League plays. Basically, you need to have tons of time on the weekend (just a couple of hours in the early stages) to be willing to do some team training. You should also be able to play pro picks. \r\n\r\nUpdate to this: We are now multiple weeks in and are established. Saiclone, an awesome coach has prepared multiple drills and we have spreadsheets of team training to help us continue growing. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, you will need to have:\r\n\r\nSkype\r\nAt least Level 30 (for the ranked team)\r\nWillingness to train and improve\r\nYOU MUST BE WILLING TO PLAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY GAMES AND MEET ON TIME.
