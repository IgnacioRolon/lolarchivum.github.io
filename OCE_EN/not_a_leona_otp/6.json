I was Platinum V 100LP in preseason, and Gold 1 in the main season and painfully close to Platinum, and now I&#039;m looking to get with an ADC so I don&#039;t have to continue solo queueing and to also have a person I can have fun banter with while still playing seriously to win.\n\nI have experience in shotcalling after playing in a semi-professional team for a year (I do have the sexy triumphant ryze), and consider myself to have a high game knowledge. I have acted as a coach and analyst of multiple teams, but that is not relevant as I am just looking for an ADC :)\n\nAm willing to play duo with any people ranging from S2--&gt;P5, would love to get high platinum&#039;s but none of them want me :( I am looking for a non-toxic ADC who is competitive but still plays the game wanting fun and can also make good high quality banter. This is not to say that feedback is not wanted - I obviously want feedback to improve my game but if it is presented in a rude or toxic way then I will deem you as toxic and kick you out of my voice comms, which would be TS (I have a server), Skype or Discord :) I am also willing to use my knowledge to help you improve as an ADC as well, and I do not get mad if you have a bad game - we all do. Learning and banter is what I&#039;m looking to have in my ADC partner.\n\nMy pool is Leona, Braum, Alistar and Tahm Kench, but I in knowledge know how to play Thresh, Blitzcrank and Janna as well. \n\nSorry for the long blurb. Add me if you&#039;re interested!","replies":[]}
