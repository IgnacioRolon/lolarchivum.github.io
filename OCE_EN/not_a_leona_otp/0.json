I am the manager and coach of a semi-professional team The Knights, a team that has claimed victory in multiple tournaments, earning hundreds of dollars and skin prizes in the process. Formerly coaching a professional, now dissolved organisation, I am now using my abilities to choose FIVE BRONZE MEMBERS (NOT SILVER OR HIGHER) and provide them with the professional pampering that proper organisations get (This is an opportunity, pretty much). We understand that Bronze is a difficult place to get out, but in reality, anyone who truly didn&#039;t deserve to be in that position would get out, and I am here to offer you the ability to get out.\n\nWhat can The Peasants do FOR YOU?\n\n- Provide a TeamSpeak 3 Server for Sessions.\n- Pay for ALL tournament fee entries.\n- Provide ALL players with team coaching staff, including a professional coach and analyst to ensure continual improvement.\n- Provide a friendly and fun environment to improve, while maintaining a competitive atmosphere in gaming.\n- Give all the rostered members the professional pamperment (Being part of an established organisation) that only Platinums/Diamonds+ get to see!\n\nWhat do I expect from you?\n\n- Let&#039;s face it, you guys are quite darn bad. Players must get into the game knowing this, and look for the opportunity to continue improving their play. If you are stubborn and believe you are stuck because you went &quot;2/3/1&quot; while your team fed, you will obviously not be selected. I am looking for the distinct, non-toxic BRONZE players.\n- This is an amazing opportunity, and only players who express their excitement and have a deep passion for the scene will be selected for a position.\n- Must come to all selected training sessions.\n\nAll Roles Are Currently Open, these being:\n\nTop: \nJungle:\nMid:\nADC:\nSupport:\n\nSo, write down in the comments this short application (All random friend requests will be declined, you MUST put a blurb here)\n\nName: \nAge:\nAvailability:\nRole (The one you are applying for):\nDo you have a TeamSpeak?:\nWhy you are in Bronze:\nWhat opportunity do you see in this:\n\nI look forward to meeting you all, and turning you guys from Bronzes to a much, much higher rank!","replies":[{"poster":"Skrab","date":"2016-02-29T09:47:19.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name : Shyt\nAge : 22\nAvailability : ~5 PM - 10 PM everyday (depend on school work but i allocate that time just for gaming)\nRole : Support or Jungle (I'm more comfortable playing tank)\nDo you have TeamSpeak? : Yes, but i have no idea how to use it\nWhy are you in Bronze : \nSeveral reason listed below (I just did my 10 placement game and i realize this)\n- Lack of map awareness\n- Always forget to buy pink ward\n- My warding skill can be considered bad\n- I can't play carry role champions\n- I can't shot call\n- Sometimes hungry for kills or securing one\n- I'm very bad at last hitting\nWhat opportunity do you see in this : At least I wish to learn the game better, able to coordinate any team with any player and last overcome my weakness listed above.

Would be great to improve enough to carry a team!\nWhat opportunity do you see in this: Improve a lot, and meet some new players in the scene, have a cool team of players on the same page and maybe improve to a level to play games with the pros in OCE (would love to face off against Swiffer one day ^_^).

I can't find the balance and would love to develop and work on this skill so that i can help benefit myself and my team in the future. If i roam too much, i lose lane and if i don't roam enough, i fell bad for no helping my team mates if they are struggling in lane.\nI would also like to learn how to \"recover\" lane. This is when I fall behind from a gank, out play etc. and am not sure how to combat this. \nOne of my key focuses in future games is to ward as often as possible. This may not include warding for our team and providing vision, but for also (when roaming) destroying any ward placed by the enemy team. \nI also need help during team fights, i mainly play a very aggressive mid, like LB, Zed or Ekko etc and in team fights, the only one with a little bit of utility is Ekko but apart from Zeds slow and LB's root, i am not really sure how to help my team in as many was as possible if we need CC for a tank and our support is dead etc.\nTo be honest, i'm not the worst CS in the world if the lane if  pretty fair match up, i wont loss much in CS, a little bit here and there but i still want to work on it.\nI also need help when i fall behind. If i'm a very snowball heavy champ and i don't start to snowball, then i'm kind of stuck. I would like develop the skill and knowledge of when and when not too split push.\nI Would like develop the skills to use my actives as soon as a team fights starts, but in reality by the time the fight begins, i don't use it because i worried if i use and there is no fight, i get flamed for wasting the active.\nLast but not least, I know i am bad, that is why i am in bronze 3.\nWhat opportunity do you see in this: I don't want to get Challenger (although if i was good enough then yes) But i just want to develop my skills and learn more and let my skill and knowledge place me in whatever rank i deserve. If at the end of this i get to bronze 2, then i would be happy, That is still an increase in rank and an increase in sill and would be very grateful of opportunity to be coached by someone who is a provisional coach and has the ability to teach other people. \nThank you for taking my application in association.","replies":[]},{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-03-06T08:02:05.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow this seems like a once in a lifetime opportunity and im going to try for it!\n\nName: xSynx\n\nAge: 24\n\nAvailability: Anytime, currently not working.\n\nRole (The one you are applying for): Id love to learn to be a Jungle or Mid main\n\nDo you have a TeamSpeak?: Yes I sure do!\n\nWhy you are in Bronze: I believe the worst part of my game is letting me down, which is positioning myself in different phases of the game, and also my knowledge on building the right items at the right time. I also have a bad habit of being tilted by toxic players. I watch a lot of youtube videos by Foxdrop which have helped a lot recently in that regard, but the toxicity still gets to me sometimes.\n\nWhat opportunity do you see in this: I see this as a once in a lifetime opportunity to reach a goal ive set upon myself which is to become a better LoL player and reach diamond!
