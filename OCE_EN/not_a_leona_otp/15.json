I am looking for a good ADC who is serious and active who we can climb to a higher division together. If you are not willing to learn and just think you&#039;re stuck with bad teams, I cannot accept you as my duo partner. For most of my games, I play Support and nothing else. I believe I have played 400+ games out of my history of 500 as a support.\r\n\r\nAs for my experience as a support, I have played over 100 ranked games as a support - I rarely play any other role unless forced to. My mains are Leona, Blitzcrank and Soraka. Leona is my most active champion - I mostly play games with her. Again, I only play Support, so if any ADC needs a support - I&#039;m right here!\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Stan","date":"2015-07-17T00:07:27.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AnonymousDiamond,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=TX5jLZng,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-07-16T07:50:19.365+0000)\n>\n> Hey everyone, my account name is AnonymousDiamond and I am a Silver 4 player for the Oceanic Server.

This account is only G5 so they're not far off)\nThat account is currently SIlver 3 and I enjoy carrying games through the ADC role.\nThe ADC's I mainly play are Draven, Vayne and Graves. But I can be very flexible with my picks.\nI would love to have a game with you and see how it works out. :D\nI never rage and always deduct my games and see how I can improve and I can skype or just communicate through pings. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Poon","date":"2015-07-16T09:20:08.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm silver IV too, keep going in and out of silver III.
