However, to the actual casting of the game, I&#039;ve had a few tries just watching some replays and casting over them and they generally go well, but I still am a new caster and need to get some more experience.\r\n\r\nPlease add me in game if you have a small tournament you would trust me to cast and I will gladly cast it for you if it is in an appropriate time. My computer itself is quite slow in running so I won&#039;t be able to stream - in addition I have no idea how to so I would also like someone to be streaming for me as I cast.","replies":[{"poster":"Patyfatycake","date":"2016-03-26T22:15:23.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should post some vods of casting you have done.","replies":[]}]}
