It is ran by me, the manager, who has had experience coaching high ranked players and managing multiple teams aside from The Knights. Again, previously, other teams have had some complications in running, but we believe we can finally make a difference coming into this third team. This is a team to try to radically change the Oceanic League Of Legends scene, and to give back to the community that has assisted us so much into the first and second teams.\r\n\r\nWhat are we looking for?\r\n\r\nOur top laner has unfortunately decided to step down from the top lane and move to Support and ADC substitute, as he feels that he is not mechanically skilled enough to play the top lane and is better acquainted with the bottom lane. Consequently, we are in the search for a Top Laner of Diamond 5+ Rank (consideration will be given to Plat 1&#039;s with experience). Again, we are looking for a top laner who can play in the Oceanic Open Ladder over the next 8 weeks.\r\n\r\nThe ideal top laner candidate will have the responsibility and characteristics: \r\n\r\n- Playing the main top lane role for The Knights eSports.\r\n- Be of a Diamond 5+ Rank.\r\n- Attend all scrimmages and training sessions, and have an open schedule to facilitate such responsibilities.\r\n- Compete in the OOL taking place every Saturday.\r\n- Keeping a calm and collected mind under the heat of battle and be highly vocal in communication yet mature.\r\n- Being of 15 years above in age.\r\n\r\nWhat has The Knights achieved in the League of Legends Scene?\r\n\r\n1st in NZ LoL\r\n1st in OCE Parlor Tournament\r\n1st in Crescendo Gaming Tournament\r\n2nd in Skyous Gaming Tournament\r\n3th in CyberGamer Open Ladder\r\n4th in Vertex Gaming NZ Tournament\r\n\r\nWhat can The Knights do for you?\r\n\r\n- Provide coaching and analyst staff at no cost to assist in improvement and coordination.\r\n- Pay for all tournament entry costs.\r\n- Provide a TS Server for communication purposes.\r\n- Provide a strong playing and learning environment for rostered players.\r\n- Set up scrimmages with high profile LoL teams to further the purpose of improvement.\r\n\r\nPlease add &quot;Support Leona&quot; on League Of Legends if you are interested, and fill out the form in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"Not A Leona OTP","date":"2016-06-09T10:18:54.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://goo.gl/forms/JHPYiaxhO6","replies":[]}]}
