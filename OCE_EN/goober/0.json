Our team of 3 bronze and  2 silver just played against diamond, gold, 2 silver and bronze. Of course, we got smashed. Gold and diamond most kills, least deaths. We asked how diamond was in with bronze and silver and he said he queued with his silver friend. And this was just one example of a way higher player playing in a lower rank. As far as I'm concerned, if you decide to queue with a much lower ranked friend, they should go up to your rank, you shouldn't be brought down to theirs.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-04T11:30:35.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I queue with my friend who is unranked at like 60 wins all the time and that doesn't mean I just get put against scrubs all the time. In fact, there are games I will feed because I am matched against someone with much more skill than me.\nOn being matched with higher ranks though: some people barely every play normals and just play heaps of ranked, which may explain why their normal MMR is much lower than their MMR for ranked play, as their normal MMR is increasing at a slower rate to their ranked MMR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-04T10:06:18.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The diamond may have said it was because he queued with his silver friend but that still doesn't explain why it's such a difference between ranks. Fact is the diamond guys normals MMR must have been pretty sh!t, or you teams normals MMR pretty good (or some combination of the two) in order for that match up to happen. If this is confusing to you all you need to know is that ranked MMR has no effect whatsoever on normals MMR.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KonigSeppy","date":"2015-01-04T09:53:06.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've gotten used to this to be honest. I'll play normals most of the time, and I try to always learn from the higher ranked players to better myself.\n\nAs a result, recently when I returned to ranked play I had quite a bit of success. \n\nTLDR; it is always better to verse those more skilled than you :)","replies":[]}]}
