The main thing it removes is the friction caused in team select.

Yes they would get their preferred role, but so does everyone else so their opponent would be better as well. Also I really don't think we shouldn't try to improve the champion selection process just because it may or may not make it easier for a small subsection of our player base.\n\n2: If people had the choice *maybe* right now there would be less supports meaning longer queue times.

Your main point is that toxic players are at fault and not the current champion select process. (i.e. toxic players are the cause). I would love to discuss with you about that point and hopefully change your mind.\n\nTL;DR **Most** of the toxicity our players experience is from other players just like them (neutral/positive). The only difference is due to various reasons they are frustrated before even jumping into the game. (losing streak, bad day at work/school, high stress etc). If we remove friction inflection points (e.g. fighting over roles/champions) then we will lower a lot more negative behaviour then just banning actual toxic players.\n\nI can see this is a topic that you are quite passionate about, I would love to hear you opinions on these two videos.\n\nThis talks about why **most** of the toxicity players experience is actually from the 90+% normally neutral/positive players that have are having a bad day.

There are two things I would like to bring up.\n\nThe first thing I would like to highlight is :\n> The change from negative to positive is a load of crap, what this actually means, is less people are reporting because of 1 of 2 reasons.\n\nThe first set of information regarding negative and positive chat was not based off of reports. It was based off of the actual language used.

I agree that less people may have seen all chat (10/10 players before and potentially less than 10/10 players after).\n\nI'm glad you agree this may not be a bad thing. Personally I have All chat turned on to say GG WP. But to be honest, all chat isn't really useful at all in game. So having it off by default and shielding players from negative language and verbal abuse in this way makes sense for me. If players don't want all chat they should have a choice. Happy to hear if you disagree with me on this point.\n\n> 2) There was a shift in player consideration of All chat that it was expected to be more toxic and less of an offense (this is a terrible reason)\n\nI'm not sure where you got the \"shift in player consideration\" part from.

If someone picks a champion the rest of the team doesn't like or is higher in pick order with a certain role, it's pretty easy for everyone else to vote-kick him or her.

I'd also be willing to be that toxic players are far more likely to mute others, not just more likely to be muted.  This could pollute the result, potentially.\n\nWhat use do you feel a system like this would accomplish?  In theory, the reporting system should be quickly and accurately handling offenses without needing to utilize a highly volatile variable like mutes.\n\n>Duo Q team mates reports should only count as 1.\n>^ Meaning this way you don't have a duo of assholes reporting that 1 guy they don't like.\nand having it count as 2.\n\nIf a duo reports someone that doesn't deserve to be punished, the reports will likely not be considered.  Amalgamating all premade into 1 shouldn't necessarily change any outcomes, but it may actually make it harder to pinpoint egregious offenders.  Imagine if you're a 4-person premade and your random is intentionally feeding/being a jerk.  Personally, I feel like all four people should be able to add their report weight to that person to hopefully result in swifter action.\n\n>Ive read this somewhere before can't remember right now, but someone aid they wished to have an option of NEVER to playing with certain people EVER again.\n\nTheoretically, with how large the community is, this shouldn't be happening a ton.  The main problem with a system like this, in my mind, is that in high levels of play there are very few potential skill matchups. \n\nA player could very easily block everyone better than him or her at that level and never have to play with anyone better.  For most people this isn't a factor, but it's a question of whether it's sufficiently scalable at high levels of play and still useful for lower level players.\n\n> There needs to be a way of giving more power to those who are not toxic\n\nHow would you propose Riot go about accomplishing this?\n\nPersonally, I think that a volunteer group could have huge impact if implemented really well.
