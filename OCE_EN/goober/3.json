I couldn't ever dual him, and at any stage where someone else would help, he would wipe them out in three attacks then ult, then also attack me and ult. He was so tanky he couldn't be hurt, plus was also dealing crazy amounts of damage. I'm not saying he's overpowered, I just have no idea how to beat him. Even if you shut him down for half the game, he's still a total powerhouse. You basically need to kill him before you're at half health, or you're dead.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-27T07:44:55.202+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my experience, Renekton beats Darius pretty easily. Can get a bit scary, but you just gotta just use your fury properly and you can win. Whether its using it on the stun for longer duration or the Q for more damage/lifesteal depends on the situation.\n\nLooking at your build you had biscuits... so yeah... you obviously had bad masteries.\nYou went 0-21-9 on Renekton... not a good choice imo. You also didn't at least get the Perseverance+Second Wind mastery which helps with Renektons self healing. If you want to go tank renkton 9-21-0 is better\nYour runes are fine.\n\n*What I would do vs a Darius. 21-9-0 masteries.  Cloth+5 start. Build chainvest - brutuliser  and see how the lane is going. if im winning, build tiamat, if not, finish sunfire.*\n\nWhat happened:\nDarius went 21-9 masteries so he had more damage then you early on.\nYou went Sunfire first and he went Randuins. So he had more armour and health than you after the first item.\nYou had brutuliser to his vamp scepter.\n\nbascially at all stages of the game, you were either even or Darius had better (more efficient) items.","replies":[{"poster":"Goober","date":"2015-01-27T07:55:55.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thanks for actually constructive feedback :) I'll go check out and fix my masteries and I'll try and keep it in mind for next time.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2015-01-29T02:24:41.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lord Darius is the one and only skin I've ever refunded.

Although, most of the time I'm just waiting it out and then farming under tower. I always try to not show much fear against a Darius and not letting him think I'm letting him push because I'm scared but purely for positioning. It's much safer under tower then under his. I try to get poke and harass off using e, w, q, e, combos fast enough that by the time I've used the second e I'm out of range of his hook. \n\nPeeling. Your ADC should be able to kill Darius in about 3-5 seconds. So keep the ADC alive. Don't over extend where it's not necessary. Wards. Don't be caught off guard about enemy positioning. Bait out the hook. Once his hook is gone. Take the CD time and kill him during it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-27T11:47:05.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunkrius excels at prolonged fights, but if it is ranked you may try and counterpick him as any ranged top laner pretty much **** him over throughout the game. He is also very weak sustain wise and is very weak to harass, as long as you don't get grabbed by his e. When harrassing him, save your mobilities for his e, or if you bait out his e, harass him to death. I agree he is a complete a**hole and the sole reason why I avoid Wukong top, but as long as you play safe or harrass him tons, you'll be fine, just make sure don't do some of either, with Dunkrius you either go ham or you wait it out, as he is very weak when behind.\nHope this helped :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-27T11:23:05.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is completely, utterly useless in team fights.\n\nJust play safe during lane and ward a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Squirtle","date":"2015-01-27T10:47:12.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:17}} {{summoner:14}} {{summoner:3}} {{item:3151}} {{item:3157}} {{champion:17}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-27T10:14:14.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you cc him and peel for your adc, then let them wittle him down","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-27T07:33:10.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kites","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warrikon","date":"2015-01-27T09:18:47.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"My pro tip as i main darius with 30 games so far and still a 70%+ win rate.... you dont ;)","replies":[]}]}
