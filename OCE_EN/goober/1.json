I hit a Teemo mushroom, okay, that's fine, I get it, they are around, and then walking through the jungle to get from mid to river, I hit another one, well, that's just bad luck. I get over the river, and hit a third mushroom. Well. I have no health now, the enemy Jinx was up, and rocketted me from the base. Mind you, that's a particularly easy shot when the slow is so powerful that I'm barely moving, and she has full vision of me. I took 1300 damage from the shrooms, and 680 from Liandry's. They are invisible, slow, grant vision and do insane damage. Surely they only need to do two of those things? Invis and damage, damage and vision, slow and damage. One of those options. All four is just way too powerful. They can't be avoided unless you happen to know where one is, they seem to have a rather large blast radius as everyone walks in to them all the time. Either give back oracle's, or fix the shrooms.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-23T13:13:52.078+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"After the second shroom I would have based.\nWhy? Large volume of mushrooms would seem evident in my opinion.\nAlso, low health.\nAnyway though, to add to what SEKAI says: people will often go and say \"I don't get a sweeper, I am not support and I don't get Sightstone.\" However, you will notice that LCS players buy heaps and heaps of wards and often get sweepers no matter where they are, often upgraded too. Vision control helps a lot, for wards and Teemos.\nSweepers are important, especially against a Teemo.\n\nDoesn't matter if you are ADC and your support has Sightstone. BUY WARDS. Vision wards too, baby. You know how much power well-placed vision wards give you against anyone? If you do, multiply that by 10000000 when against Teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-24T10:36:53.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets talk about the rest of teemos kit.\n\nIts %%%%.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-23T13:09:21.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get sweeper and pink wards.\n\nIf Teemo put that many shrooms into your jungle without any of you realising, he was either super fed or your team's jungle presence was simply non-existent.
