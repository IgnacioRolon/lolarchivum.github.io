They were basically constant all game, and then reported me at the end of the game. I also reported all of them, but we all know that means nothing. I have screenshots of the entire chat, but I feel like it will make no difference. Will posting it here actually have someone from riot read it and take action?","replies":[{"poster":"Slycandicem","date":"2015-04-17T04:29:06.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are chat restrictions a good thing? Chat is still a valuable communication tool and if someone cant chat that  make sit harder to communicate. I think it would be better if there werent chat restrictions for this reason. Someone that uses bad or abusive language should have a real penalty like temporary ban and for the repeat offenders a permaban.\n\nSometimes i think it would be nice if there was a symbol on loading screen to show people that are on a chat restriction so the rest of the team know that person(s) cant write anything. Then we dont get annoyed because they wont respond to questions etc. It would save a bit of agro.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-17T11:42:58.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-04-17T18:46:09.395+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Before you go around calling people names you should try and at least learn the difference between \"your\" and \"you're\", you just end up looking like an illiterate asshole yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-17T18:48:42.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Vapid","date":"2015-04-17T18:55:15.915+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grammar*","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-19T03:38:40.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you shouldn't tell people how to enjoy their video games?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-04-17T00:57:05.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hefty Gentleman,\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through that experience. Reporting players definitely does feed into our punishment systems. You can read more about our player behaviour systems here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq\n\nI have quoted a few relevant sections below\n\n> **What happens when you report someone?**\n> \n> When a player is reported, the full report is recorded and stored for analysis by our behavior systems, including information about the reporter and the game.\n> \n> Depending on the type of report, different systems will review the report and if there is negative behaviour over multiple games, it will hand out a penalty. As an example Verbal Abuse reports will be evaluated by the chat restriction system while Unskilled Player reports are only used for matchmaking analysis and wonâ€™t result in a penalty on your account.\n> \n> **Chat Restriction System**\n> \n> **What is a chat restriction?**\n> \n> Chat Restrictions are an upgrade to standard bans we designed with the goal of improving and reforming the behavior of players who create negative experiences in League.\n> \n> **What does a chat restriction do?**\n> \n> A chat restriction applies a temporary chat limitation to your account for a set number of games. This means players who are chat restricted will only be able to interact with their teams through gameplay, pings, and very limited messaging opportunities.\n> \n> **How does the system work?**\n> \n> Chat restrictions take multiple reports over a series of games into account. Players with normal behaviour will never be affected, and there are a number of protections in place that sort out false reports, premade abuse, and other potential issues.\n> \n> If a player is continuously displaying negative behaviour they will then receive chat restrictions on that account.\n> \n> You can find more information about Chat Restrictions in the knowledge base article: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752984-Restricted-Chat-Mode","replies":[]},{"poster":"GhostlyHell","date":"2015-04-16T13:53:28.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us","replies":[]}]}
