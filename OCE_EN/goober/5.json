The timer actually reset back to 00:00 after hitting 59:59. So I figured there was a bug, reset my computer, and tried again. I've tried a queue for normal, ranked and aram, and I'm having the same issues. For some reason it's not finding a game for me. Any idea what might be going on and how to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"Goober","date":"2015-02-16T02:32:30.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I have an update. I got a warning saying that I have declined too many games in a row. So I reset my computer again, and tried, and I got told that I'm temporarily unable to join queues. I didn't get any messages saying that a match was found. And even after I closed that message, I was still \"in queue\" and the timer was still going up.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-16T08:38:11.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is absurd, to say the least. It's like a crucial piece of data is missing from somewhere, or which there could be two possibilities. One is that the trigger for telling your client that a match has been found is missing, which could be remedied by redownloading the client. The second is that the bit of data telling your client a match has been found is failing to download from the server. If that's the case, we'll have to go much deeper than this.\n\nSo try repairing your client and get back to me on what's happening.","replies":[]}]}]}
