Which is what the most important thing is.\n\nYou do realize when they create a brand new \"mechanic\" it takes loads of testing to make sure it doesn't bug, loads of maths to see how it scales with other champs abillities etc, how much to scale its abilities with AD/AP items etc. Frankly having a cowardly mount which can break your champ in fun ways... Is a brilliant idea...\n\nSorry its not a new assassin or mage like Yasuo, or a rework on old classics like Brand/Malz to make them more OP than before. \n\nNo easy champ for you to buy to feel good about i'm afraid. \n\nGotta learn the mechanics like everyone else...\n\nEG... Bard... GREAT GAME PLAY CHAMP, few people can use that gameplay well\n\ninsert Kled in the group of champs like Bard/Tham etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrinceVegeta01","date":"2016-07-26T01:42:04.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"interesting {{champion:59}}","replies":[]}]}
