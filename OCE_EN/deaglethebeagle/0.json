This is happening to me too. The matchmaking system needs to be tweaked and its been doing this to me since 4.2 patch. This isnt in ranked games because at the moment im just playing normals.\n\nLook at this matchmaking. It was a duo of myself and my friend who is level 16\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oJzLKun.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-27T02:06:01.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does, it just presumes the best out of all of you.\n\nIt's kinda like when you first played ranked. I don't personally know what happened to you, but when I got into ranked, I was placed far higher than my actual skill level (Placed near Silver, dropped to Bronze 3). I fed in most of my games after placements and was really disheartened, though eventually I was playing with people of my skill level and really got back into the game.\n\nBasically, my point is, MMR for new players is adjusted slightly higher than usual. The same applies to a new team. There's probably some reasoning behind it, but for the moment, you can just try your best to beat players who are better than you. After all, what's the point of playing if your victory is always secured?","replies":[]}]}
