Better still make a single lane mode where people can pick their champions.

It's random. That's it's very nature. Because it's random it's unpredictable. You want to know something interesting? You could jump on Google right now, search for a random number generator, pick any of the ones that come up, input a range of 1-1000 with 1000 outcomes and it would be entirely possible for all 1000 outcomes to be, for arguments sake, 57. That, however, doesn't make it any less random.\n\nNot to mention, your match history tells a completely different story. I did a tally of every champion you've used (there were 34 total) in every ARAM game over the past 2 months, you know what I found? You haven't use a single champion more than 6 times (and that was Galio) in 59 games.

I doubt you even realise what the word fatally means in the context you've used it. the website might have made a mistake, but as he/she said, they've checked several sites and all have told a similar story.\n\nhe/she just destroyed you and this thread yet you continue to fixate on this one small issue because it's all you've got. just accept you're wrong a move on.","replies":[{"poster":"GeTTiN SmaSHeD","date":"2015-09-30T15:43:28.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry but statistics need to be accurate to make a point.

However then it devalues the champions and so would rightly annoy those who brought champions just so they could play them in ARAM.\n\nPerhaps something could be done with the reroll mechanics to allow the reroll to choose from the whole pool of champions in order to mix things up a bit.\n\nOf course, that would also turn ARAM into a \"try before you buy\" format in some ways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gummyjacob","date":"2015-10-01T12:23:50.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're Gettin Smashed in the comments...
