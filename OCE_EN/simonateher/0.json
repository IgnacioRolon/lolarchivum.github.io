I rarely have people afk or troll, but when it counts it happens. \n\nEnough of my bitching - why isn&#039;t there some form of system implemented to forgive losses in these circumstances? Strictly for solo queue - potential for abuse if it works with duo.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-12-01T20:55:31.307+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"People usually ragequit when they're losing. Sure you might've had a chance to win, but giving loss forgiven because someone afk'd in a game you were gunna lose 80% of the time or something is a terrible idea. It would also encourage people to flame people and try to make their teammates afk, and would reward you for doing so poorly that a teammate gives up and afks. You gain just as much from enemies afking as you lose from teammates afking, so it would be just as valid to suggest people also get promo wins disqualified if an enemy afks so as not to promote people who dont deserve it.","replies":[{"poster":"Simonateher","date":"2015-12-03T13:37:49.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good points, completely turned my opinion around haha. thanks :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-12-01T14:10:49.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because then people will try to pressure others into afking when they are behind, through the use of toxic language, promising free skins, etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2015-12-01T15:19:29.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot has put in the system where if you lose promos and get back into the same promos you will start that series 1-0.
