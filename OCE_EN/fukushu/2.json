So I&#039;ve been bored lately and decided why not help low elo players improve their knowledge,  champion pool, elo, gameplay etc.  It&#039;s my first time doing this so please do bear with me ;-; \r\n\r\nAbout me:\r\nI&#039;ve been playing league roughly 2-3 years now. I&#039;m plat 5 (technically 3 because of my other account) and I mostly main/play support,adc and mid, I can fill but preferably/mostly play the 3 roles mentioned above.  My knowledge/understandings about league in my opinion is significantly high, I do know what to buy in terms of items, peeling, comps, laning phase, shot calling etc.\r\n\r\nRequirements: \r\nSo since I&#039;m giving free lessons and spending my time potentially with you, I want people who are committed or determined to learning and improving in league, yes we can have some fun lessons and just screw around :D but I won&#039;t accept people who are extremely toxic or unable to take criticism. Preferably bronze-gold.\r\n\r\nJust add me: Fukushu and we can start straight away if you like.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-06T09:32:27.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i'm a top lane.
