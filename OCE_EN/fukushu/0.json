For example you can clearly see that someone is elo boosting an account and you have evidence.You report it to riot and all you get back is just them saying something about investigating the problem and in the end they pretty much not do anything about it, which leads to the problem of the people or person getting away with elo boosting. You sit there thinking {{champion:103}} you kidding me? I just feel like they dont really consider elo boosting as a serious matter when they kind of clearly state that serious punishment/consequences will occur if u do such a thing. I honestly just get sort of pissed off just hearing or knowing that someone just bought an account or just got elo boosted to a certain tier and brag how they got it and kind of bring an atmosphere saying they&#039;re so good and all (also saying they deserve it).\r\nSooooo yeah :3 what do u guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-05-18T09:03:23.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people don't get boosted in the way that can get you banned anymore what happens is a high elo player just buys a disposable auto leveled 30 account for pennies then duos with whoever wants to climb the ladder so the boostee can't get banned and the booster doesn't care if they lose one of their boosting accounts because they make back much more than they end up spending on them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jamieyoo","date":"2016-05-18T08:59:26.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i posted a photo of a challenger spamming a public chat that riot also use asking for money for boosting a screenshot it and posted it on one of these boards with in the hour it was deleted","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-17T15:47:57.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Biggest waste of money paying someone to boost you, never understood it, you'll just get rekt and flamed coz you're not at that level","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-05-17T15:32:33.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"couldn't agree anymore, its as if you took the words right out of my mouth :D","replies":[]}]}
