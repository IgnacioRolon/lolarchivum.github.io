Please comment down below and tell me what you think :D\nWord count: 841\n________________________________________________\n\nThe luminous waterfall slowly cascaded down a series of rocks, emitting a tinkle sound with every drop that splattered into the pool of water below. The water glimmered in the sunlight as it flowed down. The breeze drifted in the area causing the blossoming trees to sway majestically, its shadows moving like dancing silhouettes.Lee sin would sit here every day on a smooth rock and meditate. He would listen to the birds that chirped beautiful melodies in the distance and embraced the warmth of the sun that had spread around his muscular body. Despite being blind for years, he had questioned himself whether losing his sense of sight was worth the burden. He had forgotten the feeling of seeing something beautiful with his own eyes, he had forgotten what everyone and everything looked like. Including himself. Lee Sin sniffed the air, the aroma of rich soil and the lush trees that surrounded him had calmed him down after a fierce battle in Summoner&#039;s Rift\n\nThe wind began to pick up speed as the man slowly approached the monk. The tree branches rustled with every swing as the leaves crackled under every footstep. &quot;I never thought a monk like you could find such a peaceful place,&quot; the man smiled as he slowly followed the peaceful stream. His long chestnut hair was tied up as his honey tanned skin glowed in the piercing sunlight.\n&quot;The Unforgiven has finally stopped wandering?&quot; Lee Sin smiled.\n&quot;For now&quot;\nYasuo settled himself down on a  rock that was at least two metres away from the calm monk, &quot;This blade never gets any lighter.&quot; He chuckled as he placed his sheathed sword and flute in front of him.\n&quot;It never will&quot;\n\nYasuo exhaled and watched the stream silently flow down, crashing into any rocks that were in its way. The scenery was a paradise to his eyes, he had forgotten the beauty of nature due to his endless days of wandering. Seeking the assassin that had murdered the Elder. He watched several leaves float above him, swirling and twirling before falling to the cold ground. &quot;Is a leaf&#039;s only purpose to fall?&quot; he whispered to himself as he picked up his flute. Yasuo closed his eyes and puckered his dry lips, he began to blow into the instrument. Soothing rhythms flowed out of the flute&#039;s end, enchanting the ears around that had listened in. The wind began to circulate around Yasuo, gradually picking up strength with every note he played. Eventually the wind had become a small shield like tornado around the wanderer.\n\nAs the last single note faded into the atmosphere, he lowered his instrument and slowly opened his eyes. He allowed a tear to roll down, &quot;I will not forget who I am............ **_brother_**,&quot; he whispered in a hurtful tone.\n&quot;A man&#039;s tears can tell many stories&quot; said Lee Sin.\n&quot;The day before I accepted the task of protecting the Elder. My brother gave me a small gift, a reminder of an important lesson that I had learned when I was younger. But I ignored it, I was such...... an impetuous fool. I had abandoned the one person I swore to protect. I couldn&#039;t live with the guilt so I turned myself in, but in the end I was accused for a sin that I didn&#039;t commit. I couldn&#039;t end my life there knowing the murderer could live and roam freely.\n For years I&#039;ve pursued the murderer&#039;s trail as they sent thousands to capture me.One by one I killed_ innocent_ men. The one day that I had feared was upon me, my own brother had finally tracked me. There we stood, circling. In a blink of an eye it was over. I had killed a man, a leader that had guided me through every step, a friend who stood by my side, my **_own brother_**.&quot;\n\nLee Sin sat there, he knew the wanderer had carried a heavy burden for too long.\n&quot;Everyone makes mistakes,&quot; Lee sin spoke as Yasuo clenched his hands. &quot;I was a young, determined student hoping to become a summoner. I excelled at magic and surpassed every student. But my impatient emotions gradually took over. I thought if I could summon a beast from the Plague Jungles I could graduate in an instant. Instead I summoned a child, his lifeless eyes showed no emotion as he fell to the ground. If only I had listened, If i was just a little bit more patient.&quot;\n\nYasuo gathered his belongings and stood up. He began to walk towards the blind monk and extended his hand, holding the only item that reminded him of his brother. Lee Sin looked up, lifting his hand to meet his and grabbed the tiny soft item. &quot;What is it?&quot; Lee Sin questioned.\n&quot;A maple seed. The gift that my brother hoped I would remember&quot; He replied back as he placed his hand on the monk&#039;s shoulder. \n&quot;Nurture it with all your love and beauty within will surely show itself. Until then, you will have truly learn the meaning of patience&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"smooth69e","date":"2016-07-19T16:48:01.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"sticky bean","date":"2016-07-09T13:49:49.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice work","replies":[]},{"poster":"EAT A BIG DlCK","date":"2016-07-09T13:48:52.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXRockaXx","date":"2016-07-09T13:48:11.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"XerathOP","date":"2016-07-09T13:47:34.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-07-09T13:41:41.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Auras1","date":"2016-07-09T13:31:43.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
