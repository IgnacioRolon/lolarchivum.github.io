They have expressed there frustrations and concerns with this as they don&#039;t particularly enjoy losing LP for connection issues and as such. What I&#039;m curious about is whether there is a bug still within the client that made it through the testing or something is going wrong in terms of their connections @Agent Mindstar might be able to help with this. They say their connections are stable and there isn&#039;t anything wrong hardware wise either so yeah.","replies":[]}
