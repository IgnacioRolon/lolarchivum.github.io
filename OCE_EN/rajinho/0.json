Its something fun and gives summoners a chance to have a bit of fun with some friends. As some people already know you can play hide and seek on the Crystal Scar but the map just isn&#039;t big enough and doesn&#039;t have enough hiding spots for a real fun and tense game of hide and seek.\r\n\r\nI love to see that Riot are still trying to make new game modes like the new &ldquo;Black Market Brawlers&rdquo; which is soon to hit the PBE so keep up the good work Riot &lt;3.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day, Happy Meming. ٩(͡๏̯͡๏)۶","replies":[{"poster":"x WOLPERTINGER x","date":"2015-07-07T22:38:14.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree i played my 1st one two days ago its just a good, stress free way to chill out and have fun.","replies":[]}]}
