After which The Lantern persisted and provided vision of that Brush. \n\nThe reason that we know that the Lantern was giving vision was when running from an Akali, she was able to Shadow Dash onto me in the brush seconds after i had swept it and was backing. The sweeper did not show any wards in the brush prior.\n\nToo confirm i will check the replay now and provide screenshots if possible...\n\nDue to Riots shoddy game, the Screenshots i had taken with the in-game screenshot taker have not appeared in the screenshot folder. This also may be due to a game crashing scenario when Alt-tabbing back into LoL, which happen this game and the game prior. The Screenshots not being saved has also happened before hand earlier in patch 4.21.\n\nI will get the screenshots (if Possible) from the replay shortly.\n\nEDIT: Replay programme wasnt recording that game... and no op.gg either.\n\nStore Purchases fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-22T15:48:31.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) That's kinda awesome\nB) it ends up being a case of, you found it, point it out, it sucks, move on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-22T15:33:16.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry Boys, i closed the Poole.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RevolvingElk","date":"2015-01-22T14:39:37.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As the Syndra in the game in question, I can confirm that this occurred.
