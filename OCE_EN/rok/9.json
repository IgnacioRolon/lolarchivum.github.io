I Just got force repatched yesterday?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the other day, people were complaining that mid-game they had been kicked out of the game and ended up having to patch their clients. A lot of people were frustrated when they were stuck with 33% or Scanning for X files. \n\nAt the time i was offline at the time so i wasnt effected game wise but i did end up having to go through the Scanning for X files things. I knew that this wasnt a problem so i just waited it out. Once it had got to the downloading of the 'new' files it was a bit slow, i noticed that i had it scanning for files while i was downloading steam updates, so when the download commenced for the LoL Patcher, i was already downloading something else. Cause my net is shitty, (150kbs Max DL) both downloads took ages, alternating between 140-20 kbs download rates.\n\nNow ive just attempted to launch LoL this morning and im met with a window, \"Possible Data Corruption Detected\", \"Sorry we detected some possible data corruption in your installation...\". \n\nI Have the option to say yes or no to \"Repairing the effected files\". My problem is, shouldnt they have been 'good' files if i just downloaded yesterday? i Didnt even play a game after it had downloaded the latest patch.\n\nShould i repair and have to go through all the down loading again? or should i be right to leave em as is?","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-14T04:10:41.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a PC, %%%% happens, just repair it or face the the possibility of not being able to play LoL, common sense dude.","replies":[]}]}
