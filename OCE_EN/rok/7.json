Anyone know a fix?\r\n\r\nIve Redownloaded and reinstalled it several times to no avail. Bet you any money its a Win 8.1 thing.\r\n\r\nThe Replay im trying to replay is of today and therefore isnt an old replay and should work. All i get is black screen for about 20 seconds and then a 'bing' when the exception comes up. After that, nothing.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-30T23:45:09.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Termite (Y)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dr Inkduff","date":"2014-12-30T08:14:03.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It worked for me for one game last night, but I don't think its working very well otherwise...\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg does game recording as well, maybe try that out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xicious","date":"2014-12-30T07:47:41.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ever since patch 4.19 LoLReplay has been working appallingly.
