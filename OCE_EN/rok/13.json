There is post i made in the 5.2 Patch Bug Mega thread that describes it in more detail.\n\nI Get past the LoL Patcher no problems, i get past the Log In Process no problems, i can get into the LoL Client no problem but as soon as i go to Summoner Info, it crashes. This is having a detrimental effect on my experience as i cannot change runes, masteries, check my stats, edit build sets, check champions, etc.\n\nI notice in Task manager that a \"LoL Patcher\" process is still running even after i pass the LoL Patcher. Is this intentional or could this be a/the problem? Ending the \"LoL Patcher\" process triggers a Maestro Error IN-CLIENT which forces me to relog. I thought Riot had ditched Maestro Ages ago?\n\nIve also noticed i can bypass the LoL Patcher by initialising the LoL Client Application itself from the RADS>Projects>lol_air_client>release's 0.0.1.127 Deploy Folder, Such that i do not need to trigger the patching process... It also means i can run multiple (+3>) LoL Client Processes simultaneously, Such that despite one already running in Task Managers' processes, i can still go through the login process. This seems like it could be exploited to have the same account logged in simultaneously... \n\nEDIT: If i have one of those processes open with my Main online and then log into my Smurf, my Main appears online.\n\nEDIT2:If i close all instances of LoLClient (which one is booted through the Patcher), i cannot open through the Deploy folder. Should i try to open the \"LoL Client\" from Deploy without the \"LoL Patcher\" process started from a Patcher Launch, i get the Maestro Error befor i can even Login (I think this is intended). However, i can start one process of the \"LoL Patcher\" thought the Patch Launcher and that Process stays, allowing me to launch straight to the Client from the Deploy folder numerous times (Which is what i think could be exploitable). HACKERONE\n\nNow if i didnt have AbborttNetâ„¢ i would be able to upload a video to youtube to show you...\n\nAnyway, i would like to hear from Riot support about this issue, obviously you have my email and should you have anything to tell me you can do so by email or by forum post.","replies":[{"poster":"TurtleSmiter","date":"2015-03-17T06:41:58.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just unpin Lol from the taskbar and it should go back to normal","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-02-05T12:15:19.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, people make mistakes and im not one to hold grudges when they admit they made mistakes, much like i did about Pando and Maestro.\n\nYeah im still having the problem but i figured out im not the only one having it. Albeit very rare, i found some guy from EUW also having the problem [in this thread.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/7ZZ6AAh4-client-bug-client-disappears-from-screendesktop-after-clicking-summoner-profile-button) Anyway, i still refuse to play if in case it leads to a crash of client during champ select or something, better to not take the risk and get one of these bull%%%% low priority queues.\n\nAs for how to fix this problem i dont know, but i did actually solve a friends problem where he has to restart his computer after the first time he logs in. The process of bypassing the Patcher and just opening the client straight up makes it so he can play without restarting. \n\nAlso, im not one to be knowledgeable about fallacies, i was just lucky to have looked it up the day before after one of my Psych buddies was explaining it.\nAnd next time please dont outright insult someone, im a 3rd Year Comp Sci student and if i wanted to be a \"hacker\" im sure i would be fine :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:37:10.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">I thought Riot had ditched Maestro Ages ago?\n\nWhat makes you think that? It was Pando Media Booster they ditched, and they 'claimed' to have stopped using Adobe Air, although I find it suspicious that the game files still constantly refer to \"air\".\n\nAnd I find it cute that you think you're a hacker when you're just using some UIs that came with Windows, which are accessible to the end-user.

You're right in correcting me on Pando Media when i mentioned Maestro, Pando was what i was referring to.\n\nI never thought i was a hacker lol, if you did some research, you would know that www.hackerone.com/riot is where you can report bugs, and due to how my client has been crashing as of late, that bug allows for the multilogging exploit, which im fairly sure isnt intended. \n\nAnd no, i havnt even needed to use an \"UI's that came with windows\", this is all running on a basic system without any additional admin privileges or interfaces the only UI im using is Explorer. To my knowledge you arnt able to bypass the LoL Patcher without the specific bug happening which allows me to open up a new LoL Client based on a previous LoL Patcher PID, thus rendering the Maestro check from LoL Client to Riot Servers irrelevant. \nI can be simultaneously logged in two different profiles on the same computer, regardless if Windows only allows focus on one window. THAT in itself should not be possible because you have to log out and close the first instance of LoL Client in order to open another one, as trying to open LoL again while your first instance is open just redirects back to the First instance, it doesnt open another instance with a different PID. The bug allows me to open up 2 simultaneous instances of the LoL Client, with two unique PIDs, which under normal circumstances should not be possible.\n\nNice attempt at Strawmanning the argument tho, you almost had me believe i had actually called Riot my \"butlers\" /sarcasm . You made one mistake though, strawmanning only works on the ill-informed, and i never believed Riot to be my \"butlers\" so your strawman fails.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T06:27:12.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad about the hackerone thing.

I was frustrated by how I've had to go through so much bs in the past with Riot staff to end up with a result of nothing (where I had to do all the technical footwork, including making the ticket itself) and then you're just like \"You've got my deets, call me when you're ready!\"\n\nI'll stop quoting what you didn't say. \"... obviously you have my email and should you have anything to tell me...\"\n\nAnyway, this is the Help and Support board, so I think we should be focusing more on that aspect, and I'd like to help you with this, ultimately.
