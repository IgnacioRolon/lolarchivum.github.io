I have visited NA Boards b4 but not EUW. Get your Thrash Together.\n\n\nAlso, since this an @Riot thread and hopefully a Red reads this, my other thread was about your Live Maintainance.\ntl;dr was that you are doing Live maintenance while you have left Ranked up. Last time we lost LP Gain and Loss and you said you would be more strict about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-11-21T23:50:48.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use FireFox(Pretty sure its the most up to date version)\nWindows 8.1 (unfortunately, due to forced 8.1 update)\n\nI simply was trying to create a Thread in the Miscellaneous discussion board and upon submitting it would send me to NA Boards index page. I tried to Navigate back but it would automatically redirect back to NA. not allowing me to copy paste my essay. So i had to go back to OCE boards and do it again. This time upon submitting a tldr (note i had forum links to old OCE GD and a png File in each attempt), it did the same thing but sent me to EUW Boards, a board i had not visited already. When i submitted this one, i didnt link the old OCE GD thread now give an attachment as i cbf doing it if i wasnt going to go through to OCE, which seemed to work. It was only after i submitted just text and got through to OCE did i link and attach the files with the post.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bear Hat Alice","date":"2014-11-21T19:40:53.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am sorry to hear you are having problems. Can you walk me through the steps you go through when you are being redirected? Does it happen every time? Also, what browser and operating system were you seeing this on?","replies":[]}]}
