I have tried on multiple accounts to access match history but nothing seems to load, just the basic border interface. Its not my net taking ages to load either.\n\nIt seems that only the basic HTML/CSS info is being sent from the server. Perhaps a script is broken?\n\nIts been like this for a week now.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-18T23:44:12.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n\nThanks for the reports on this.
