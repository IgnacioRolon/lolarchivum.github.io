Not even Name or Shame thats just what he was called.)\n\n...and then when i was typing something after, i was going to say something that contained \"shit\" in the sentence, then i proactively thought, no, if i do that someone is going to report me because its beginner bots and everyone here has yet to experience the real LoL Community, so i didnt say anything.\n And before anyone says, \"Oh but u must of said something offensive and your just not telling us\", no, i proactively avoided that potential outcome with the specific purpose of not getting reported\n\nLow and Behold, reporting is broken.

(the ashe gave you honor because you were atleast slightly helpful with saying to use Q to chase.)","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-02T22:18:40.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"*Cringe*","replies":[]}]}]}
