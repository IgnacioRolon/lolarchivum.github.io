[BUG]","subforum":"Client Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found myself playing a jungle Teemo game after the client reverted my change from Teemo to Gragas.\r\nIt was only until the champ select lock out had finished when i realised that my portrait was not that of Gragas but of Teemo.\r\nNow i know what you may think, &quot;could you have just forgotten to choose gragas?&quot;\r\nNo. I changed my Runes and Masteries only AFTER i lock in my champ. I also switched my summon spells too. I had my Gragas runes on when i noticed Teemo was locked in, i had to quickly revert back to my Teemo runes/masteries. \r\n\r\nThis also seemed to happen to my Summoner Spells.\r\nI Run Flash on F and Ghost on D for Teemo, when I switched to Gragas i changed Flash to D and Smite to F. When I looked back at my SSs after i noticed the revert, i had Flash on D and Ghost on F which makes no sense because i never changed back to Ghost, and Flash is normally on F and not D.\r\n\r\nAnyone else having this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-21T15:29:23.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not quite sure about reversion of changes but i find that locking in of champions/changing of champions take longer in the PBE than the Legacy client and sometimes the change you make doesn't even register and stays in the champion you selected last.\n\nSo in a way I guess the champion selection and changing of summoner spells is a little more sticky and could probably be problematic when making last second changes (It's probably the selection animations but I'm not sure)","replies":[]}]}
