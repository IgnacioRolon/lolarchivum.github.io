Is it fair for them to look down upon people of a lower rank and use that as an insult, despite the lower Elo performing better in game? \r\n\r\nIs it fair to for the lower Ranked player to call out certain mistakes and try to salvage a game using their game knowledge, compared to being told they dont know anything because of their rank? \r\n\r\nIf the lower ranked person is performing better than the higher ranked person, why should the lower ranked person cop \"abuse\" (READ: Harsh words. Noob, scrub, dont know any better) for calling out problems in the way the team is playing and not being listened too?\r\n\r\nIve found out recently that its not lower elos that are 'toxic', sure they BM and swear like sailors and generally have appalling social skills, but thats nothing compared to the disrespect (not talking about trick2g wannabees here) and sense of entitlement (gee im sounding like Joe Hockey) that i see in 'higher' elos. Im looking especially at those in Platinum, it seems these types of players congregate around that rank, and the type of disrespectful behavior does too. I suppose it must be the thinking that, \"Im not some Low elo Bronze-Gold Scrub anymore, im king shit now, i know more than them.\" thats very similar to  all Year 7's when they go to highschool.\r\n\r\nIn closing, F**K You Plats. :^)\r\n\r\nWhat Plats think they are.\r\n\r\nWhat Plats actually are.","replies":[{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-01-14T02:31:15.220+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, if you're gonna call people \"Thick\"...\n\nMake sure you're using the right \"Your/you're\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-14T01:46:15.192+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being higher rank is always meaning that he has a better chance to know more than the lower ranked guys, while being evidently mechanically superior. But true it also means that they aren't always right.\n\nAlso you know how some people like to state their status/age/social group/educational level/their thing's size (huehue) during an argument in attempt to shut it down even though they were so passionate about the debate before that point? Yer sometimes things like that can also happen.\n\nBut mostly people just use means to push their knowledge whether true or not onto you or make their opinions sound superior by attaching something at the back, in this case, rank.\n\nRemember the first paragraph I wrote above, being higher rank do also mean they most likely know better than you in this game, and undeniably plays better.","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-01-15T06:24:20.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just because they are a higher elo **does not** mean they are better. If someone gets to Gold with Urgot support by making all the right decisions and getting their adc fed, controlling dragon, warning everyone where the jungler is, he is a better player than someone who gets to plat with whatever the fotm OP champion is.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-15T07:20:17.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Being higher rank is always meaning that he has a better chance to know more than the lower ranked guys, while being evidently mechanically superior.\"\n\nThis maybe isn't 100% I would say it's at least 95% right.\n\nBut yes, many high elo players get their place by playing fotm champs, it's a problem with League for quite some time.","replies":[{"poster":"Charon","date":"2015-01-15T07:39:23.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-01-14T02:28:36.607+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Less type, more enemy team wipe=GG","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-15T09:50:03.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My favourite thing is when I play on my gold smurf and get matched with plats who talk down to me after they play like morons.\n\nI played with a plat 5 0 LP Thresh who claimed I would never get to the level he is at.
