A large champion pool would be a nice little bonus too. \r\n\r\nMust have mics and be available for at least 2 games a day up til the first clash, after that, we&#039;ll see what we need to do. Planning to keep the same five together so we can grow and improve together.\r\n\r\nMy highest is G4 this season but currently S5 thanks to playing with not-so-great friends.
