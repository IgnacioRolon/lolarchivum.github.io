It's a problem with no easy fix.\n\nAs Sekai mentioned quite aptly, it's a free-to-play game centred on competitive PvP and random matchmaking. The tribunal was a decent idea but turned out to be ultimately ineffective. It can't just be about punishment - especially in a FtP model, this does not work.\n\nThey need to give proper incentives to reward positive gameplay. If a player is always noted as being a great team member or very friendly rather than being reported by his opponents or allies, there should be a significant reward for that behaviour. IP boosts, random runes, or perhaps if someone gets an incredible amount of positive feedback from their fellow gamers, who knows - 10% off vouchers for 1 skin, free champions, fancy borders or other profile-oriented changes.... At the same time you increase the punishments for severe negative player feedback. Bans, strip them of any ranked accolades, or shame them with a very visible icon for other summoners to see.","replies":[]}]}
