You just got outplayed.\n\nI don't think he is worried about the numerical status of the opposition team. Although their _ranks_ seem to match up, I think he is trying to infer that he wishes to be paired with players of his _skill level and understanding in his own team_. Looks like he was paired with\n\n1) a support troll that hadn't played ranked in a month\n2) a bronze level jungler (that's right, BRONZE - go check)\n3) a top laner that barely made it out of BRONZE, and has no champion mastered that has a KDA over 3 in ranked\n4) a noob adc that also barely made it out of BRONZE. Why noob? You only have to see the summoner spells, we won't even mention the skill level of their champions or the fact that they have bronze level csing in their games.\n\nPerhaps the OP has been on tilt in the preseason, since reaching PLATINUM, but to be paired with guys who are in reality, a bunch of bronzes, is a bit much for an _AT LEAST GOLD_ level player.\n\nWelcome to OCE, where the playerbase numbers are still very low compared to other regions, and so bad matchmaking occurs.\n\nI was talking to an American player today who is in Australia at the moment, and he was saying that at lower elos, the toxicity on OCE is much higher, and the skill level much lower. Makes sense. Have to brush this game off and expect these sorts of games, not much you can do about it.","replies":[]}]}]}
