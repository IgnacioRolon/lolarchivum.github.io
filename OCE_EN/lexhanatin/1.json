If you want to start learning yas in a less stressful environment, feel free to.\r\n\r\nI hover around gold to give an indication of my skill.\r\nI don't mind if you're higher ranked either. Means more for me to practice.\r\nIf you're lower ranked, and feel less skilled than me, think of it as an opportunity to learn how to play against someone better than you.\r\n\r\n(not like i'm any good).\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the 1v1s.","replies":[]}
