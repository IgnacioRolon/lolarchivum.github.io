Ed \"SapMagic\" Altorfer, the lead for Ranked, back again. Earlier this year, we detailed a broad set of updates to Ranked aimed at making your games more fair, your rank more accurate, and the grind less, well, grindy.","url":"https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/2018/08/dev-position-ranks-in-2019/","image":"https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/LOL_CMS_224_Social_1200_xwzd8h6aks1fe7fhqylg.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So Riot is doing Riot things and that involves &quot;listening to the community&quot; on upcoming changes to how ranked will work.\n\nAccording to the development team they reckon, &quot;_ We saw pretty much the same feedback from every region: You told us you felt good about most of the changes, like tiers, splits, rewards, and placements._&quot; But is this true?\n\nAs I&#039;ve been following along with the various development team posts on ranked changes I don&#039;t remember particularly liking much of what&#039;s been proposed so far and I&#039;ve seen a lot of - mostly - negative feedback that seems to suggest these changes aren&#039;t too popular with the community. So is this a negative vocal minority speaking up or is Riot ignoring the wider community?\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-03T09:39:12.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like they've worked so long on this new system that they are more than willing to force it through to \"testing\".\n\nI thought Role Ranked was the dumbest thing i'd ever heard. After a few months to think about it, I still don't like it, seeing how autofilled people will 100% not try and troll if the game goes bad. I'm willing to try, but I can guarantee that people will troll or at least not care when on their off roles.\n\nThe other things like 2 new ranks and new way that Placements will work sounded cool. The other things about splits/new rewards (emotes and icons) i couldn't give 2 shits about.","replies":[]}]}
