I just posted a thread regarding the same bullshit. Promo's are a JOKE! You can cruise through your ranked games, hit promo's only to be paired with THE biggest POS toxic players ever. I'm sorry, but seriously Riot are fkn trolling people and intently pairing you with the lowest of low from the next elo. It can't be a case of just bad luck when it happens over and over and over to people.","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2017-01-25T08:12:10.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The reason promos are often harder than usual games are for a number of reasons.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons is people find it too pressuring and play worse however promos are generally intentionally harder to win due to how win/loss streaks in ranked work. If you go well above 50% win rate, the match making attempts to make you lose to bring you more in line with 50%. Promos are generally reached by going on win streaks, by then the match making is trying to make you lose.","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-01-27T04:54:31.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By \"trying to make you lose\" you just mean the differential between rank and MMR right?\n\nBecause in what you described - a win streak into promos - I think you're suggesting that in a scenario where you streak through from Gold 3 to Gold 2 promos you're more than likely facing a lot of Plat players, which would make it more challenging to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2017-01-27T06:05:05.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much, in simple terms yeah. The game isn't making you lose, it's giving you harder games the more you win, in order to avoid your rank from sky rocketing through lucky games. Unless you belong well above where you are, you won't win these games. But people often get into promos due to win streaks because often you need a minimum of 2 wins in a row to get there.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-09-01T02:57:18.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump.\n\nI'm in Plat promos now. It's no different. Plat IV promo games:\n\nGame 1: Mid laner dies 3 times in 5 minutes and rage quits. 4v5. Loss. 0-1 series.\n\nGame 2: Everyone stays. Nothing goes wrong. We win! 1-1.\n\nGame 3: Bot lane collectively goes 1-21-9. 21 deaths, I mean what can you do. Loss. 1-2 series.\n\nSo in my opinion the first game should be a loss forgiven, no question. Just because it doesn't quite meet the standards of a remake doesn't mean that it's in any way a fair or even game. It's not testing my mettle or skill for a promo series, yet hands me an automatic disadvantage.\n\nIt's frustrating to no end.\n\nAnd of course game 3 is icing on the cake. I mean I guess we could say bot lane were having an INTeresting game. Can't really report for bad players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-01-31T04:18:53.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thought I'd bump this thread to highlight my last two losses in promos for Gold 1.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/WsgNy","replies":[{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-01-31T05:00:30.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've made a couple of tickets regarding extremely toxic players to Rito in the last few weeks.\n\nI swear their response - besides the copy/paste job - is to activate an algorithm so I get queued with players who have been suspended for negative behaviour at least once in their summoner history.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-27T05:07:47.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you're assuming i'm finding that promo games harder than my regular games which I'm not.\n\nWhat I'm saying and what thew OP has shown is that promo's are 90% of the time filled with toxic people and trolls, not good players. There is ALWAYS someone in at least one game that will either AFK, get the shits and rage quit, intentionally feed or sit in a side lane and refuse to help the team because of some excuse. It's not about one team being better than the other, it's exactly as shown in the OP's picture.\n\nMaybe it's just in the lower elos this happens. But I actually dread getting into promos because I know at least 1 of my games (and usually it's more) I'm going to get some asswipe who's going to ruin the game intently for others.\n\nI've even lost a a promo game before because one person looked up the player stats, noticed I was in promo's and intently fed. Apparently that was amusing to him seeing me fail in my promo series.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2017-01-25T06:02:54.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't even do past 1 game of my provisionals yet (outside of flex, where i give no fucks) because i'm waiting for holidays to end for at least some semblance of brains to come back.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-25T08:19:13.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Making you lose in what way, by pairing you with the biggest noobs ever or the worst of the worst?
