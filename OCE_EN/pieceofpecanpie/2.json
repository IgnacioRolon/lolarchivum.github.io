Unfortunately we lost it but I did win my lane and solidly stomp a Darius. Unfortunately Darius decided to shittalk in all chat once his team started to carry. His contribution to the game was acting like a 5 year old, but whatever, gg I guess and chalk another loss up and send a report in on the badmouthed Darius.\n\nNext queue pops and... **the same Darius is now on my team**. Sees me, starts talking shit, locks in a champ to steal my role and says &quot;im gunna feed idgaf&quot; etc. Teammates are trying to be conciliatory, saying stuff like &quot;you can have whatever role you want just please don&#039;t feed, we&#039;ll win&quot;. Of course the 5 year old is all &quot;im feeding, you can&#039;t win when I&#039;m feeding&quot; etc.\n\nSo for the sake of everyone I dodge.\n\nAnd oh, I didn&#039;t lock in that champ accidentally the other day so now it&#039;s a 30min lock out not a 5min one. I get a 30min time out for some other arsehats behaviour. This isn&#039;t the first time it&#039;s happened either. \n\n**So tell me, why on earth is there a chance to get queued again with a summoner who you just reported?** And why isn&#039;t there an algorithm that automatically takes these people out of the picture for your next game at the very least?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-12-13T14:34:22.735+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tis an age old problem indeed. Beyond waiting it out (which isn't foolproof as they too might be waiting it out) there's not much you can do. \n\nBlizzard actually tried out an \"Avoid this Player\" feature in Overwatch. Long story short, people were abusing it to avoid players who were too good at the game, that was a problem and they got rid of it. \n\nIf you're interested in knowing more, the following is from the game director Jeff Kaplan:\n\n>For example, we recently realized that “Avoid this player” was wreaking havoc on matchmaking. One of the best Widowmaker players in the world complained to us about long queue times. We looked into it and found that hundreds of other players had avoided him (he’s a nice guy—they avoided him because they did not want to play against him, not because of misbehavior). The end result was that it took him an extremely long time to find a match.\n\n>The worst part was, by the time he finally got a match, he had been waiting so long that the system had “opened up” to lower skill players. Now one of the best Widowmaker players was facing off against players at a lower skill level. As a result, we’ve disabled the Avoid system (the UI will go away in an upcoming patch). The system was designed with the best intent. But the results were pretty disastrous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-12T22:32:27.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey my man, first off im really sorry that this happened to you, but let me address it as best i can (I dont have all the info as i dont work for Riot, as well as my own personal opinions of it).  First off I hope that you print screened his comments and then shipped it off to [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (Find the best suited category and file it under that, unfortunately Riot support themselves have said theyd rather people use the end game reporting method, and they havent got obvious categories to group it under to make it easier on their players).\n\nIll be honest though my friend, YES hes made the game miserable for you, but could have just been being a 5 year old and lashing out, with no intention to actually intentionally feed, and due to the fact you dodged in champ select theres no actual evidence he HAD or WAS going to intentionally feed. Check this wikipedia link on [intent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention_(criminal_law)). Let me hash it for you and use an extreme example: Just because you WANT someone dead and wish ill on them, is completely different to murdering them. Feel free to read my post on [Why League of legends is failing as a game](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/PX5VHney-why-league-of-legends-is-failing-as-a-game). Hopefully might address a few of your concerns, as well as offer some insight for you from another gamers perspective.\n\nNow addressing your issue of why blacklisting people doesnt remove them from your games entirely. Im all for this: unfortunately, like xmas, we dont always get what we want. The ugly truth is that Riot COULD perform a bit of coding to do achieve this, but queue times would go up exponentially, so from that angle its impractical. I do think your idea needs a bit of expanding on though, its a good idea. Ive spoken to Riot employees who have said to me \"the chances of you ever seeing this person again are very slim (albeit not impossible). I think it shouldnt be too hard for coding to allow you to avoid someone youve reported for 10 games by shuffling them into the enemy team and swapping laners once the systems deduced you and them dont get on. \n\nNow let me explain the way dodging works. The reason people punish people with -3lp and a wait timer is to discourage people from doing it every game that someone has a pick they dont agree with, and to encourage people to give others a chance, even if something looks a little weird. The other side to look at is the wait timer generally allows you to avoid ending up in game with this person again (on average 2 min wait timers). \n\nIn closing, Riot do need to do a better job of detecting erroneous behaviour. Anyway, have a +1 from me pal, i know your frustration, believe me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-13T04:15:15.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play the game and report him at the end again.\n\nThe more reports someone gets the more likely they will take punishment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-13T07:22:51.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"RIot's report system works in a way that if a player is reported more than an average player does than they will investigate, if not, they're just gonna leave it, and it's how many games the player gets reported for, not how many people, someone can 9x report someone in 1 game but it will only count as 1 report because they calculate it by games and not players. Unless the player has been reported more than usual per game, neither the system nor the Riot support group will have any interest. I find this system incredibly stupid to me as a player can full out feed 2 games a week and will never get banned because of the Report per game ratio. If you ever meet a troll player like this, the one thing i've learn is, the more they talk in game, the more likely they're going to trigger the systems word check. So if you ever meet any trolls/feeders/shit talker, make sure you make them talk as much and as vaguer as possible without using any yourself, that'll definitely have an impact if they get reported consistently . Hope this helps","replies":[]}]}
