Will edit if did not work, so if I dont I'm too busy playing :') \n\nIt will work, contact me with any question","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-11T00:10:45.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dat wallpaper\n\nAnyway, people on the Mac client are experiencing similar issues. May be related to the connection, may be related to the actual program. I'd wait this out a bit to see if it's fixed, but if you really want to try something then you can try reinstalling the patcher.\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to redownload the entirety of League. If you'd like to know how to do this, then just ask.\n\nP.S. Before uninstalling anything make sure that you can download the installer from the website, people on Mac have been unable to do so. Make sure before you delete anything.","replies":[]}]}
