I have a very very strange issue which I&#039;m unable to resolve even through the ticket system because it revolves around my email address.\r\n\r\nI have an account I used a fair while ago that stopped being used and now I&#039;ve forgotten both the password associated with the account and the email address which I believe was one made solely for the signing up of the LoL account. This means I can&#039;t reset the password and I can&#039;t send a support ticket because they require correspondence by email. I have spent a fair amount of money on the account and would like to be able to use it again.\r\n\r\nInformation I DO have access to is the Username of the account, credit card details for payments made for RP and origination answers including location of sign up, etc.\r\n\r\nIs there any chance I can get back access to my account? I&#039;d HATE to start a new account and have to rebuy champions and skins. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-14T01:47:01.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, have you tried recovering the password for the e-mail account associated with the League account? Or do you mean that you've completely and utterly forgotten all details pertaining to the e-mail account as well, including any extra security features (such as phone recovery) that you may have employed on it?\n\nTry opening up a support ticket on the account which you *do* have access to and correspond with the bot there. Look over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694) for instructions on how to do so. The bot will ask you for proof of your account, such as items purchased, recent transactions, friends list, screenshots, etc.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}
