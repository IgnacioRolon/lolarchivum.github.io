Our team tried to put a FF request at twenty minutes and me and someone else voted no. The Rengar only BM'd the whole game so i was pumped up. I told our Sona to get a support item.

CS means you have a better chance at winning games\n2. No matter what junglers do, they are still not going to carry the team\n3. Lich Bane on Kayle is stupid\n4. Dont build Armour against an AP Lane opponent, specially if your versing triple AP\n5. Build a support item if your not getting cs, lest you have close to no money\n6. Kills dont win you games, Tower pushes do\n7. Dont /ff@20 even if your going 4/24","replies":[]}]}
