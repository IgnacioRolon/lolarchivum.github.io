What do you do here to actually come back and win? It&#039;s way too early so you don&#039;t even have items enough to make any difference. You can&#039;t go and try to fight with your teammates because you just get rolled by the fact we have no items and the other team has items. I&#039;m in gold and there&#039;s a hell of a lot of games that are like this that happen where it&#039;s decided in the first 10-20 minutes and the rest of the game is a pointless bore where if you try anything you will just get destroyed by the people who have a lot more items (Is this really what gold is? Is there a huge jump in skill to plat?). Oh and for some reason people never surrender when these games happen, 0 towers taken vs 2 inhibs gone in 25 minutes? Nah guys we can totally make a come back.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T09:38:55.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why have you not roamed by 10 minutes as a mid laner?","replies":[{"poster":"s3 Clover s3","date":"2015-08-30T09:42:14.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=wP7olU1i,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-08-30T09:38:55.505+0000)\n>\n> Why have you not roamed by 10 minutes as a mid laner?\n\nAnd put myself behind by missing cs?

My mindset is that is it even worth it to roam, usually roaming early like that means missing cs and often not getting kills out of it as well as tower damage and losing the tier 1 tower makes a big impact on what part of the map is and can be controlled. The way I usually win my lane is taking advantage of situations like the enemy roaming or their jungler showing and pushing it hard when they do to make them miss that cs & xp and getting the tower damage or end up in a winning fight, ofc taking the match up into account, doing this leaves me stronger than them and them less safe leading to solo kills (sometimes solo kills happen before when they make mistakes or don't know the match up well or aren't aware of our jungler and is playing too far up which leads to snowballing as I can then deny them the cs or kill them and they're then in the same situation I am tackling here - how do you win games where the other team get really early leads)\n\nAfter things go like this I will usually pressure lanes to free up the rest of the map and then back off accordingly and these things tend to lead to outrotations or favoured fights (this sort of thing also depends on my role/champion, I tend to have a 60%+ kill participation assuming things are going fine, if they're going really well this can drop as I can just push one lane, kill whoever comes solo and take a tower while my team destroy them in a 4v4, 4v5 or 3v4) by this stage (10-20 minutes, depending on the game) the game has been decided and even if I stay grouped or split push it's futile verse people who have an item or two advantage on you, especially when people default to being scared to making any sort of play on someone out of position when they're behind. Be it win or lose, many games are decided early like this and I want to know how to lower losses that are like this.\n\nBasically; is playing super risky really a higher win % than playing smart? If so, solo q really does not capture this game correctly.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-30T14:51:41.016+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greater risk = Greater reward.\n\nPlaying smart is good and all, but honestly, you need to deserve to win, not just not deserve to lose, and yes they sound like the same thing, but they aren't, so many people bitch about not deserving to lose, but don't want to actually earn their win's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-31T12:37:19.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Roaming isn't the risky choice. It's the safe choice. It's like saying the jungler shouldn't gank at all because they'd miss out of camps. Trust me when I say this, if you push your lane correctly and destroy all the enemy minions, you can go gank without missing too much CS and you'll get more EXP from leeching off top lane's minions and that kill you're meant to get than farming in lane.\n\nOn the other hand, you can deal with the enemy mid who's probably out roaming and therefore leaving you to farm a bit, only to come back and gank you because your lane is naturally pushing forward as your last hitting unbalances the lane. Keep in mind that mid lane usually has more levels than the other lanes and especially jungle so a gank from mid is much more scary than a gank from the jungler.\n\nFinally, your mindset of \"I'm risking CS and therefore I'll lose more games\" is extremely selfish even for solo queue. You are MEANT to gank, it's like saying the support shouldn't buy sightstone and risk being behind. What's really going on is \"I'm helping the other lanes and therefore I'll win more games\".\n\n\n\nI'll be honest here, CS doesn't matter AT ALL if you lose the game. Not only is staying in a lane and last hitting unfun, but it's also detrimental to the team. A kill is worth a minion wave, an assist is worth half, nothing is worth a few minions. We're the greedy and overlevelled mid laner. It's actually very hard to get nothing from roaming.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
