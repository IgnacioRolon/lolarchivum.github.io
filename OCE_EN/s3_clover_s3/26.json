I mean, this games fun right? When every single game has someone trash talking at least one person on the team and when most seem to have stupids(how many people get boosted?)/genuine trolls/afks? It&#039;s getting more and more frequent... send help I&#039;m trapped in an oven and about to be that which i hate.\n\nBut seriously, I played a year of this game with this type of thing being insanely common and after this seasons start I'm real sick of it so I sent in a support ticket asking what Riot are actually doing about this and they gave some half assed reply with no real answer and told me to report people which tells me they're doing nothing? Also by now my reports are meaningless since I have reported at least one person in most games for some sort of sh*tty behavior for a few months now.. so here's a forum post, you know... Riot get aware.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-04T21:15:39.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much like all the IP, mastery point and upcoming loot incentives, dynamic que was implemented to try and get players to play with their friends. When playing with friends, people are generally less toxic, are more likely to use comms and also tend to have more fun.\nBasically, there are two options for  your issue:\n\n* Go to the [team recruitment board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) and join/create a dynamic que team (or find some irl friends).\n\n* Don't play ranked until true solo q is released (may or may not be less of a toxic environment)\n\nHonestly, I lost 8/10 of my promos, with a combination of me being bad as well as a decent handful of rage quitters and people who are \"so done\" after first blood has been given. I know its super frustrating, but the solutions are quite easy.","replies":[]}]}
