It doesn't look like it should land, from where Annie is in regards to Lucian and then Tibbers to Lucian as well. (Very long instant stun range and the hit box being way bigger than the Tibbers avatar)\n Not a serious complaint, but maybe I want Riot to resize Tibbers and lower the range a little if the hit box is that big. To back up my comment of it not being a serious complaint, to show Annie isn't game breaking or overpowered and to subtly brag (hehe), this game was a win where I did the most damage to champions, had a 10 KDA and the most CS.","replies":[]}]}]}
