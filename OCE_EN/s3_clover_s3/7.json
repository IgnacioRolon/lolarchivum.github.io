Both are competitive games.\n\nThe way to have fun in a competitive game is to either learn, analyse and progress or to have back and forth games that are close, but I feel as if league has lost this almost entirely. People have more fun stomping their opponent and when this isn&#039;t happening all sorts of things can happen:\n\nThey stop trying. \nThey blame and harass. \nThey AFK or leave. \nThey stop playing properly.\n\nI am sure most players are guilty of these things, I know I am and if you ever watch the pro level streams they get players that are that way too which suggests skill level doesn&#039;t play as big a part as many people think. Let&#039;s call this the &#039;stomp or be stomped&#039; mentality where if a game isn&#039;t going good people will work towards it going even worse, this is what rules Solo/Duo Queue and has leaked into normal and ARAM games.\n\nIssue 1: Social aspect.\nVery rarely do I come across people who are willing to follow a leader, more often than not if someone says anything that employs teamwork they will take it as being harassed. I don&#039;t know what it is about League but I never ran across this issue in Warcraft 3. Sure there were those who harassed and played unfairly but we created communities within the outside of game chat, which let us find large groups of people who weren&#039;t like this. This is something I think a lot of games fail at, even Blizzard&#039;s next big RTS after Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2 had a poor social system. Currently, it is too hard to find a group who are going to stick together for ranked 5&#039;s in league because most people you come across are in the mentality of stomp or be stomped, even if they are good people.\n\nIssue 2: Quality of players.\nVery commonly do I come across people who are willing to throw a game just to have a chance to make themselves feel better in that current moment; if you are stronger than your lane opponent that doesn&#039;t give you a free pass to forsake strategy and thus forsake 4 other people and try to start a disadvantaged team fight or skirmish. **being in a bad position is a way to start a disadvantaged fight**. I very rarely see people who are actually thinking strategically for example; giving blue over to a poke or wave clear champion rather than a mid laner who is fine mana/cdr-wise. That mid laner will most likely act self entitled and end up in the stomp or be stomped mentality. There is a huge lack of respect and a feeling of self entitlement when it comes to League players and we as humans are impressionable, the mentality has spread to most players so don&#039;t pretend to be innocent because that is not the way to changing how you and others act. When you can&#039;t ping or tell someone to do something because they will ignore it or start harassing you and when someone is having a bad lane or misplayed in a fight and they get harassed there is something wrong with the quality of players. Do not try to give people criticism or advice when playing either because analysis is for after the game, when stress, focus and concentration aren&#039;t a thing and also, harassing is not analysis.\n\nIssue 3: Matchmaking.\nWhat are you thinking Riot? In gold and plat you still find people who have very little knowledge on how to play which fuels the stomp or be stomped mentality, shouldn&#039;t players in these leagues not make basic mistakes? When I win 5 games in a row, I expect all 9 players to be better than the players 5 games ago, but they can be worse and this goes for both teams not just my own. I feel as if there is little difference in player skill between plat 4 and silver 4 because the match making is so erratic, anyone who is noticeably better I would say is someone who belongs above plat 3, there are plenty of low silver players who are better than people I have been matched with in high gold. A good way to approach this for players is to start believing that the group of players between low plat and low silver is someone you could get matched with and to care a little less about your division and league in this ELO. A loss streak can completely ruin your MMR, it is very easy to go down 1-2 divisions compared to working your way up through them because the majority of people are in the stomp or be stomped mentality, it takes no effort to ruin a game on purpose compared to winning games with people who are trying to ruin it.\n\nIssue 4: Punishment and encouragement.\nHonestly, at this point I feel like chat should be disabled entirely in Solo/Duo Queue. Once one person is in the stomp or be stomped mentality it is very easy for the rest of their team to join it. I have been a horrible person on this game because of this mentality and here I am without any sort of chat mute or ban and I have even had a teamwork ribbon for months, which makes me think is anyone even being punished or encouraged to act like a decent person and to actually play and learn this game properly if you&#039;re at a disadvantage in the early game? I think there being little-no consequence is the leading reason that the stomp or be stomped mentality is now in every single game I play. People need to be told that some champions and items are weaker/stronger early and play accordingly to that, please implement more and clearer tips that aren&#039;t just during the load screen and change these tips accordingly for the meta, genuine tips on the game to get people to think about it. For those people who don&#039;t want to play competitively, stay out of the ranked queues and the same goes for those treat the other game modes seriously, stay out of those queues because both parties will get more enjoyment that way.\n\nI&#039;m at the point where I&#039;m thinking about taking a long break from this game, except for the first time it&#039;s not because my attention went to another game but because this game is becoming less and less fun to play. Thinking &quot;Am I going to get unlucky with teammates?&quot; for the most part doesn&#039;t talk about their skill but about their mentality, I don&#039;t actually think skill has much impact on this mentality. I think this, my friends think this, you and your friends probably think this but the reality of it is; others are unlucky to have me on their team, I am of the same mentality and I need to make a change. I&#039;m sure with Riot making much needed improvements &amp; players being mindful this horrible mentality we all have can change and most games will be fun again. Feedback is key, give any and all ideas and riot will follow. **Please nothing about game balance, just adapt to the game**\n\nI would like to see players handpicked by riot to be there to mute people in game and encourage everyone to keep playing properly, they don&#039;t need to have any sort of riot symbol to point them out, keeping them hidden would probably be best and I would like to see players following this example.\nI would like to see a better implemented social system, that way people will be more friendly. This will get players to teach other players, the basics will be told by someone they&#039;re friendly with instead of someone random and they will be more inclined to listen and try. To go with this I would like to see better game tips and encouragement to help.\nI would like to see there being more divisions in the lower ELO&#039;s to truly have players placed in similar skill games as apposed to a wide range in a small bracket, which would make games less erratic and give less feeling of relying on lucky teammates/opponents.\nI would like to see if there is a DC/leaver at the start and they don&#039;t reconnect within 5 minutes the game is not recorded and everyone else is allowed to leave without punishment.\nEdit: I would like to see better work on bug fixes. Examples: Flashing out of range of something and it still going through, autos and abilities alike. The various client/champ select bugs (if two people try to trade champs at the same time it locks one of them out of trading)","replies":[{"poster":"Scimitary","date":"2015-09-26T11:05:14.535+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump \nSo true\nThe community needs to improve.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-26T14:03:44.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in to upvote, \n\nriot pls fix oce","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-09-26T22:02:26.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's on every server, a game can be frustrating and this can cause people to not want to play till they get over it. \n\nThink of dead or alive for example, doing the end boss on the fat motorbike guy was so hard because fat and slow, I ragequit but then on a later date I came back and continued to try. \n\nThe ragequitting is not just league of legends, it's everything.

People (kids?) these days have a defeatism and instant gratification attitude (blame the parents?). If they don't get things NOW then many just give up.\nLeague is a TEAM game. You gotta do the best for your TEAM if you wanna win. No point being 20-0 if you team are losing their lanes, and then blaming them because you died trying to be a hero 1v5 :) (Just an example).\nHaving said that I would leave chat on (point 4). If someone can't handle constructive criticism then it's their problem. They can always mute. But chat is important for those that do LISTEN AND LEARN, or at least take into consideration what is being said. A lot of people these days have lost the skill of listening. As soon as something is said, or is being said, they have their reply ready instantly without listening properly. Fast paced world, dumber world.\nIf Riot COULD implement a better social system, they could sell it to Governments alike :) What I'd like to see is parents being more careful which how much internet time their children are alloted, and to what means they are alloted to, and having their children not lose out on life skills (e.g. running around outside, sports groups, cooking, music).

I started playing again today after not playing for awhile and I lost bout 3 matches because people just gave up and couldn't be bothered trying and kept trying to surrender the second it reached the 20min mark even though we had lost the same amount of towers as the other team!! It was so annoying because a couple times we were able to push the other team back a bit but then as soon as we got pushed a little everyone was wanting to throw in the towel and give up. It's so annoying and frustrating because I have seen come from behind wins before and I have been a part of them. Hell I had one match where it was literally only me and two other people with the other 2 afk, the other team had a ful team and then a 4 man team from an afk, and we almost won! we fought so hard and pushed back as hard as we could and what should have been something that was over quickly ended up dragging out into an hour long match. We did lose but we weren't bothered by it because we were like \"We almost won with just the 3 of us\". If that kind of attitude could be put into 5v5 matches with everyone playing it would make for some really exciting fun awesome games where even if you lose you went down fighting and still had fun. Now I admit there are times to surrender but the matches I have had it just seems it takes the slighest thing to go wrong and someone is ready to quit which makes everyone else want to quit rather than actually put some effort into the game. It's the domino effect of one player gives up and then the next and the next and so on and so forth, and the other team see this and know this so they just go on the full on offensive because it's easy pickings now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-09-26T13:32:02.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's defeatism. \n\nThe best/worst part is when someone gives up so they can get to their next game, everyone instantly re-queues and the exact scenario repeats but even worse.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-09-27T10:59:25.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have experienced this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-26T14:03:20.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/101747575/200561549?tab=overview\n\nEven this, the guy was allowed to continue play another 10 games and lost 9 of them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IgutUlikeAfisH","date":"2015-09-26T22:57:10.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spam email this to riot","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-26T16:03:05.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow looky here yet another great long thread of how league can be greatly improved, let me just remember riot are going to ignore this completely and never implement any variety of these suggestions so long as any of us live","replies":[]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-09-26T11:22:43.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guilty of this.

Essentially, (if you know what you're doing) be the leader. Remember though, you have to earn respect. Either win lane, or be that guy always helping other get ahead and people will listen.
