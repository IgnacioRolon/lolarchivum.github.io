Riven&#039;s dashes compared to Nidalee&#039;s dashes.\r\nRiven&#039;s goes where she is facing (Unless mouse is hovered over an enemy) VS Nidalee&#039;s going where mouse is.\r\n\r\n2. Poppy&#039;s dash vs Alistar&#039;s dash.\r\nWith any gap creator you can dodge Alistar&#039;s dash but with Poppy&#039;s if her dash goes off it will snap (warp, teleport, whatever you want to call it) you back into place to be hit. (This happens WITHOUT her cancel dash ability and without hitting someone into a wall as well)\r\n\r\nWhy are these things different, it makes no sense to me and is a little bit frustrating considering how similar these abilities are, Poppy&#039;s teleport feature is a pain to go against (It feels like it&#039;s a bug) and Riven is a pain to play after playing Nidalee and vice versa.","replies":[{"poster":"Nibz","date":"2016-03-31T03:42:29.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's just give every champion the exact same abilities","replies":[{"poster":"s3 Clover s3","date":"2016-03-31T05:45:41.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The abilities are different, it's the interactions that should be the same considering the base for the abilities are the same.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-31T03:35:46.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 1st one is because thats how the champions were made. They were made to be different and so require different micros in order to utilise their abilities properly. Nidalee (pre-rework) used to always dash in the direction she was walking.\n\nThe 2nd one I agree is total horse crap. Poppy's dash cancels all other abilties and just wins. Don't know why, she just does. Its the same if she uses her E as a Naut hooks her, she gets priority (it seems).","replies":[]}]}
