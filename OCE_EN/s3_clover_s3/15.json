Using curse.\n\nWhat we are looking for in the player:\nA friend. Someone who isn&#039;t going to get frustrated and tear the team apart from poor attitude. Be able to laugh.\nWilling to learn from losses, wins and each other alike.\nHaving good ideas on how to play the game already. Everything can and will be improved on.\nDo not ignore or say no to someones calls. If it&#039;s the wrong call it will be said and discussed about after the game and the outcome will be noted for future games.\n\nThings to note:\nWe want to have fun playing the game and improving at it in the way that it is meant to be played, not solo queue yolo crap.\nThe first games are mostly going to be us getting comfortable with each other and getting some set game plans down.\nWe will continue to realise our mistakes and be mindful of them in future games in order to improve. Do not take any criticism in a bad way, feel free to discuss your point of view on something if you disagree.\nInput is welcome from all members and if there are any issues you can come to me, even if I am the issue.\n\nWrite below, make it convincing if you want and I&#039;ll add whoever I pick in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Wonga Luscious","date":"2015-10-10T23:45:26.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo i would join , im gold 5 and play both top and jg\nIgn- Wonga Luscious","replies":[]},{"poster":"retrolives","date":"2015-10-10T15:04:55.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, i would gladly join, even though im silver 5, i have a good understanding of the game and i want to improve in becoming better.\n\nfyi i will play lulu, renekton, jax and.. riven. :) {{champion:92}}\n\nedit-\ni main mid, but i do play top from time to time, u can leave me as your last option, but i am motivated if u invite me and ill try not let u guys down.","replies":[]}]}
