It's gonna take FOREVER. I say 6 months for all accounts from 1 - 29 and then 30 is 12 months. Like if you ain't even going to try to get to level 30 in 6 months then you obviously ain't going to play LoL for that long.\nLike my cousin took one of my summoner names, she got to level 15 and stopped playing. Now I have to wait a year and a few months... Only 6 months have passed and I cbf'd waiting so I just got another name.\n\nSince some of us players are so dedicated, I think Riot should give us an easier time like, really? I got to level 30 before the level 5 and you get extra RP was even born... like girl you should give mumma some of that goodie gum drops.\n\n(P.S : Things got sassy.)","replies":[{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-23T14:44:26.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send support ticket they wil lhapily give you 400 RP if it hasnt been added already.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
