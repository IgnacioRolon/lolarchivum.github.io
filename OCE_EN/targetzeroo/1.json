I&#039;m in Silver 4 at the moment and I&#039;m not exactly in the current position to call myself &quot;good&quot; but i don&#039;t like being queued with some people that simply don&#039;t know what they are doing.\r\nThanks for reading this. \r\nHave a good one guys.\r\n{{summoner:14}}  Targetzeroo {{summoner:14}}","replies":[]}
