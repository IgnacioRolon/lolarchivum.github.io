PLEASE HELP BOIS","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the most frustrating problem I&#039;ve encountered. In game my computer will run the game perfectly for 5-10 minutes. However, my computer will suddenly freeze during the game, I can&#039;t use my keyboard or my mouse, all I see is essentially a screenshot of the moment that this event occurs. The only way to get out of the situation is by holding down the power button to force shut down my computer. But what&#039;s strange is that this only happens when I play League, every other game, application, or service on my computer doesn&#039;t do it either. What the hell is wrong? And how do I fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-30T08:16:46.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre your video drivers up to date?\nIs Windows up to date?\n\nIt's possible your GPU may be overheating, please download [SpeedFan](http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php) (Or a similar tool of your choosing) and monitor your temps the next time you play a game of league (Preferably custom or training, so you don't receive any punishment should you be forced to leave).\n\n* What temperature does your GPU idle at when not in-game?\n* What temperatures are you receiving a few minutes into gameplay?","replies":[]}]}
