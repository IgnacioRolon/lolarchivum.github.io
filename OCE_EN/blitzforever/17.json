So yes, they were selected from the same pool of players as you, that is precisely how matchmaking works. \n\nYou will get teams on the better end of the spectrum and the worse, but ultimately they share your average MMR and thus the good and the bad will balance out. If you belong at a higher rank you will climb as the odds swing in your favour (your MMR + skill above your MMR = more wins) and if you belong where you are you will stay where you are until you improve. Such is the purpose of MMR and matchmaking.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-11T08:55:13.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also, this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-10-11T08:55:17.448+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"See the thing is, you can't do anything about Corzey's gameplay or jodflap's for that matter. There is NOTHING you can do, you will probably never ever see them or play with them again. So there is literally no point at all in blaming your team mates for your losses, sure it may be their fault sometimes but you can't improve them as players. What you CAN do is improve your OWN gameplay, and that's about all you can do.
