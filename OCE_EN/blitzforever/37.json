But the main problem I am always facing / facing right now is feeders and completely trash players. I just cant seem to win what ever I do. No matter how hard i try or how well i (attempt) to communicate or stay positive they still feed. I know many players arnt good and i fully understand this, but my team legit doesn&#039;t even have a brain. They feed everygame no matter what. The image above is a classic game with my team, the picture was taken at 7 or 9 minutes into the game and shows exactly why i can never win a game. It would be great if Riot could perhaps move these feeders who clearly cant play and put them with others who just want to feed, this would save many players sanity and losses.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-24T08:11:48.719+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you take a fucking picture with your phone lmao?\n\nalso git gud","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-09-24T08:19:58.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"already done that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A1 Lee","date":"2015-09-24T08:07:21.945+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dafaq who builds berserker's greeves first with homeguard before getting any damage items as an adc??? is this some sort of bronze elo?{{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3031}}","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-24T08:20:52.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upgraded boots first item is op bronze meta m9.
