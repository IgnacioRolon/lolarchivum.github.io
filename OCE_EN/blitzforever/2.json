I checked out your match history and it doesn't look like you were supporting, rather just using the lane as a buffer to play Singed. Of course, anything can work in bronze, but try him in the top lane. You'll scale up much faster because you'll get farm. And not annoy players that are trying to play the current meta of ADC + Support in the bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"OceDropBear","date":"2016-05-08T14:33:28.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd ban him too if you did that.

It's for the good of the team, the only time its worthwhile is if they are higher up on the pick chain, and if they have really good past yasuo score, they are better off going a safe picker over an all in no reward pick. Yasuo is easy to stuff up on and die, hard to fight with unless ahead or with good mechanics, and much much more, 99% of the time they feed and lose, just not worth losing lp because he wanted to play a champ he would otherwise feed with.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lady","date":"2016-05-14T10:16:50.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you were gonna play singed support and he was the asshole?\nhahahahhaahhahahhahahah","replies":[]}]}
