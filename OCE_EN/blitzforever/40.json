For example I excel at tanky champs or sustain mages.  Udyr (102 wins), Mundo, Jax, Trundle, Brand etc. That's because I have an urge to be in the fight for a decent period of time.  If you play top lane, focus on cs, a small amount of kiting and immediately building to counter your opponent for an early lead. \n\nExample: \nMundo vs Malphite\nGet health and 2 pots (health will give you a lead into your warmogs while pots gives you sustain)\nMundo vs Garen\nGet cloth and 4 pots (cloth gives you a lead into sun fire as well as countering damage + pots for sustain)\n\nI also highly recommend getting some runes/masteries set up for a decent number of champs\n\nTake a look at mine and make some decision on there (I'm no pro but I do a fair amount of reading when board)\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/542133#masteries\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/542133#runes\nJust a thought\n\nVery luck.

I've also noticed if you've had a huge amount of wins in norms (around 10 in a row) then win in ranked I got ~35LP per ranked win. which gives you an even higher chance of jumping tiers. (I'm well aware that they are not mutually exclusive, IT'S JUST A FUCKING OBSERVATION)\n\nI got fed up at one point of being in promos for silver then going all the way back to b3 that I just played norms with my mates, at one point getting 15 wins in a row that when the preseason started I was getting between 30 and 36 points per ranked win. Got all the way though to S3 in a month using mundo xin and jax mostly (before they got perma banned)\n\nBTW while oce.op.gg is a good site for information I like to compare to lolking.net and lol-mmr.com as well. lolking gives you a trend of champion win rates and stats, while lol-mmr gives you a projection of your MMR and a you vs other MMR stats. It also has a nice tool that shows you a run down of previous games\n\nAlso I'm talking mmr as LP because MMR is set at a \"hidden value\" the only visible value we can use is LP unless you go to OCE.GG or LOLKING or any of the other sites that none of them actually agree on a specified value.

If you are consistently \n* It also slightly adjusts for when you go on tilt (even if you have more wins than losses overall, if you tilt your MMR & LP gains go into losses>wins), and vice versa for when you are on a winning streak. \n\nIf you are consistently winning games and have an overall greater number of wins than losses, your MMR may inflate above your current ranked standing. If it sits 2-3 divisions above where you are and manages to stay that way for a while, you will skip divisions once having successfully completed a series _(it is still a pretty rare occurrence and only happens below plat)_.\n> \n> I've also noticed if you've had a huge amount of wins in norms (around 10 in a row) then win in ranked you get ~35LP per ranked win. which gives you an even higher chance of jumping tiers.\n\n[Normal wins have absolutely nothing to do with ranked and any LP gains or ranked MMR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1iydwv/clarification_on_normal_games_effect_on_placement/)","replies":[{"poster":"Gh0sty","date":"2015-12-14T01:57:52.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mate I know the difference between MMR and LP thank you kindly.\nI was using it as a point of reference (as in something you can actually see, as MMR is invisible).
