Eg Zed, mid, alot of people play that so its the average score or what not of all those players is used to calculate your overall champion grade. Anyway I played Singed (which no one plays), mid and went 3/0/2 and partially carried, and outplayed the Zed at every turn. Now you would think maybe an S-? since no one plays that champ let alone playing him mid and getting a really good score. Nope! B+ like wtf, ive seen people legit feed and get better scores.\r\n\r\nRiot please fix your champion grades :/","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-09-30T03:56:09.908+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"ummm, im not 100% accurate and im not a textbook but, its easier to get higher grades on more popular champions because there is an incredibly higher ratio of shit players playign zed, while on the other hand the low population of singed mains who will solo stomp every game due to perfect CS and KDA make the singed ( from what im guessing) S% ratio extremmely hard to acheive. Not to burst your bubble but if u want high mastery champs, either play a popular champ and stand out from the crowd of shitters, or u will have to become the same as the top10% of singed mains that destroy shit with ease.  The grading system is working as intended meaning you have to be in the top 10% of the (inser champion) playerbase to acheive these MASTERY TOKENS, if you havnt MASTERED the champion compared to everyone else who is playign why do u deserve and S\n\nIF YOU ARE A HIPSTER AND PLAY UN-POPULAR CHAMPS its going to be very hard to reach that higher skill that is required for that champ since the 1-tricks and mains have set it so high","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kappa Dechu","date":"2016-09-30T15:05:27.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well doubt you can get very high with 3/0/2 that seems like a very short game or little kill participation","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-29T23:13:18.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was your farm shit?","replies":[{"poster":"Puumbaa","date":"2016-09-30T01:56:31.005+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% would have been shit","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2016-09-30T03:17:00.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nope","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-30T03:31:25.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BlitzForever,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=hKxXojdl,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-30T03:17:00.065+0000)\n>\n> nope\n\nWhat was your farm and how long was the game?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
