What I think they shouldn't of done was not even warn us about the masteries being reset completely. I went into my first game not knowing my masteries were changed.\n\nSomething else they shouldn't of done was remove mana potions. So many champions require mana potions to sustain and without them, it's quite difficult. If I recall correctly, Crystalline Flask was also removed? If it wasn't, fair enough, but seriously, at least make the Mana Potions 50 gold because it's a vital part for some champions when they start.","replies":[]}]}
