It&#039;s recently been annoceunced that many low pick rate champs (ones who no one plays) poppy, taric and Shen are all getting gameplay reworks. Singed on the other hand is one of the lowest pick rate champs and hasn&#039;t received any kind of gameplay rework as side from a few minor minor buffs / fixes in 5 years. Riot are even trying to rework urgot, seems they are reworking all the very low pick rate champs aside from him","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-29T04:48:58.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Singed doesn't need a gameplay update tho, he isn't clunky, he is one of the more powerful champs, he recently got a VU so he doesn't look bad either. plus singed having a Q poison trail is one of the most cemented facts of lol, and is other skills compliment his Q already pretty perfectly, what more can you give him?","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-09-29T06:28:54.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If Singed was powerful more people would play him :), and he wouldn't be the 4th least played champ in lol. As for the remake well......it seems riot can do anything with remakes (skarner), but if he did get one i dunno maybe make his W do damage?. I guess one day hopefully riot will make him good so more people will play him :D {{champion:27}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-29T09:19:13.438+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Karthus is an underplayed champ, and god forbid anyone saying that he is weak.\nsinged is very powerful, but like karthus (and most other underplayed champs) he is hard to use properly. Thats the main reason for them being underplayed, not because they are shit champs but because they require more effort to learn than garen, look at poppy for example, she is a monster, but no one plays her because... well.. look at her...\n\nlook at all the really really popular champions, they are almost all really easy to play, Yi, darius, garen, Riven, Diana, Vayne. \nthats not a coincidence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-09-29T08:43:59.129+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-09-29T10:40:21.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Must be me then :p","replies":[{"poster":"Reaper8512","date":"2015-11-22T22:07:11.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can agree with singed being scary\nhard to kite, if you get caught you dead, builds mana with tear and roa and gets tons of tankiness as well as lots of damage, and god forbid that singed builds ludens. and while he is hard to kite, his kiting abilities make kalista look like a scrub. his entire kit is around kiting","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
