There was no plat/master/challenger, and bronze was the correspondant of current high silver/low gold so lots of people don't have it). Playing is S1 also gave everyone a special Kayle skin.\n\nThe icon he's talking about is a special Rito gave to certain customers for changing the terms of some exclusive skins (Kitty Kat Katarina, Definitely Not Blitzcrank, and such), together with custom loading screens and full price refund.\nCan't really complain, i guess. I like my icon.","replies":[]}]}]}
