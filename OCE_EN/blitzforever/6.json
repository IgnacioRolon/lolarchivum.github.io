If you read the patch notes, they explain in the paragraph above the change.\n\nThe old system, you need to play 350+ games to reach level 30. Thats like over 100 hours of playing just to get level 30.\n\nI do agree it will mainly just lead to more smurfs, but i really don't care. Don't see a problem with smurfs. Smurf doesn't mean \"troll account\".\n\nIt will also probably mean more Bronze. Most seasons before this one, there were more SIlver than Bronze players on most servers. Now the rankings seem to more like a Pyramid (with Bronze being the majority worldwide). Interesting to keep tabs on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-03-19T03:12:57.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You filthy casuals take a month to get to 30?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-19T04:24:46.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kylar Alice,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XHQnfWKO,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2016-03-19T03:12:57.226+0000)\n>\n> You filthy casuals take a month to get to 30?\n\nMore like 3 for me :-)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-14T07:32:00.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fact it took at least 1-2 months to get to lv30 was simply just too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-14T05:25:35.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Link official source.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-14T05:30:08.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not read the patch notes like everyone else?\n\nOP is over reacting though.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-03-14T05:32:22.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XHQnfWKO,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-03-14T05:30:08.500+0000)\n>\n> Why not read the patch notes like everyone else?\n> \n> OP is over reacting though.\n\nI do.
