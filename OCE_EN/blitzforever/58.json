Its also great that 90% of the games i&#039;m put into are with toxic trash talking kids who just ruin whatever there is left of the team in the pre game lobby, and then go ahead and feed themselves and blame it on the rest of the team.

Yes i am in Bronze and i understand why i will usually get feeders, but the people are I play with are always always (no offense) brain damaged. They go 2v1 when they have like 100 hp pick a champ they have never played before or the worst one is when you get people who haven't played in months, its like and endless cycle of feed i cant escape from. I don't even try ranked as that's 10x worse and I only ever go down which gets me paired with more bad players :(. And not to forgot 90% turn super sayian toxic as soon as you do a tiny thing wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-23T08:59:14.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thought you meant you were absent from League for '6 months'.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
