So how does the system know when to drop you down a division / how does it work","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-01-03T19:48:03.403+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your MMR has to drop to the 5th division on the tier below you.\n\nSo if you are Silver V your MMR has to be Bronze V to drop down. So basically, A LOT of losses. I'd guess roughly 20 or so.\n\nI personally had lost something like 12 in a row on 0 LP towards the end of last season and didn't drop down a tier.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-04T13:31:19.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'd guess roughly 20 or so\n\nIt's a lot more than 20, unless you're duoing with someone in bronze 5 and losing them all with that person.\n\nYou'll know when you're at risk of demotion when you start vsing Bronze 4/5 players","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-03T21:15:00.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah pretty much impossible to go from silver V to Bronze I","replies":[]}]}
