A little message from Riot support should pop up saying &quot;Hey!, need some help?. Looks like you have recently fed (*number of games) with that champ now and fkd them up for your team aswell. We have now blocked {{champion:133}} for (*number of days / hours) so you can get to try a new champ and try find one that will work for you :)&quot;\n\nP.s.......this is only a few of her {{champion:133}} games, the rest is too much","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-25T10:43:12.853+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree they shouldn't be learning a champion in ranked, you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how learning works.\n\n> playing the same champion over and over doesn't make you better at them......\n\nThat's exactly how you get better at a champion.
