Although it will always be there. This update is also just great accross the board IMO. It doesn't create any new problems, and solves a whole bunch of the old ones.\n\nHere's a few of those big improvements:\n\n+ They've accounted for premades spamming honours according to [**Riot Simurgh**](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/vXWH79WM-fight-with-honor-on-pbe?comment=00050000).\n\n\n\n+  Honouring now happens before the end game lobby. This means you can't use the end-game lobby for _\"honour 4 honour plz\"_. The only way to organise honour trades is using in-game chat, which makes it significantly harder and more clumsy than before. \n\n\n+ Honours are not directly tied to keys. You need to have at honour level 3 to get access to all the rewards, but apart from that the amount of honour you receive is irrelevant.\n\n So once you're elidgable there's no incentive to 'cash out' on honours and receive lots of rewards.\n  \n\n+ You also don't need honour to level up. You just level a bit slower without it. \t\n\n So if you're looking to just level your account to level 3 and get rewards. It's probably going to be easier to just play normally and not be toxic, than to try and organise honour trades before the nexus explodes.\n\n\n+ Honour trades are really limited now that each person has only one honour. \n\n We know from economics that as a good becomes more scarce it's value goes up. If someone goes _\"honour me pls\"_ but you know he doesn't really deserve it, you're FAR less inclined to honour them with only one honour compared to when you have many honours.\n\n It also means that the 3 honours flair will always be a meaningful reward, since you can't trade honour for honour to get it. You have to earn it.\n\n_Will there still be abuse?_ \n\nLess than before, but yes definitely. \n\nIt's more closely tried with the Instant Feedback system now though. So if you're getting one honour per game, but reported frequently you'll be loosing honour levels very quickly. I don't think we'll be seeing many toxic players with high honour.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-06-04T05:39:11.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tele covered it pretty well, but I do have a few things to say from my perspective.\n\nFirst and foremost, the changes Riot have made look spectacular. As it stands now, honours have practically no value and don't provide any incentive for being well behaved and respectful in-game. With the changes, honour levels have heaps of value by providing perks and whatnot (thus providing incentive), and should definitely be a more accurate representation of a players behaviour and attitude.\n\nAsking for undeserved honours and honour trades are definitely a lot harder with the changes, as well as pre-made honouring. As Tele mentioned, honour trades would have to be organised during the game itself which presents a challenge for anyone looking to do so. A lot of people would probably find it's more effort than they'd like to put into it for just 1 honour, which may reduce the occurrence of it. \n\nPlayers asking for undeserved honours is fairly easy to deal with, just don't give them an honour. Just because the system is there doesn't mean you're obliged to honour someone, so if you don't think anyone is deserving that's your opinion (there *is* a skip button, after all). I'm not sure whether asking for honours in-game would be a report-able offence, but if anyone is interested I can find out and get back to you (I wouldn't get your hopes up, though). Then of course, pre-made honouring is weighted less to prevent that kind of abuse, which is nice.\n\nProbably one of the only downsides of the new system is that the more toxic players will likely speak out against Riot for losing honour ranks and being locked out of honour rewards, so we'll probably get a fair number of threads on the boards when it does come out. That said, those threads will certainly show that the system is working as intended, so we've got to take the good with the bad.\n\nAs for when it will come out, I'm putting $50 on ~2-2.5 weeks, about halfway through patch 7.12. It's on the PBE now, so it's extremely unlikely we'll see it this patch (which ends Wednesday/Thursday next week) and I doubt Riot will release it as patch 7.12 goes live. As long as all goes well on the PBE, it shouldn't be too much of an issue for it to go live next patch.","replies":[]}]}
