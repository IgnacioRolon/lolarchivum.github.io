They may push a skin back if the champ ha recently had a skin, or they may make a certain champ a priority if they haven't yet received their second skin, and they may wait to follow through on a concept to allow for reworks etc as well. Past that, it's just first come first serve from the concepts.\n\nAlso, what makes you think Sona/Garen/Vi/Zed are getting skins? The teasers do not indicate anything about skins, they are all shown in their classic, and this is a champion teaser not a skin teaser. All this teaser means is that Jhin will have lore interactions with Sona/Garen/Vi/Zed. It may become a skin theme if Riot wishes to make it one (like the Shurima skins that followed Azir's release and the Shurima event) but that hardly means they will. This teaser does not, in any way, imply that these champions will be getting skins. I'm not too sure how you drew that conclusion in the first place...\n\nTL;DR All this means is the new champ, presumably named JHIN and titled DEADEYE or THE DEADEYE will have lore interactions with these champions...nothing to do with skins...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-02T23:54:17.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Skins aren't simply released in order of who hasn't received one in the longest. It may be a factor, but if there's a theme they want to do they are more likely to do the theme for all the appropriate champions they want than just add something random simply because it hasn't had a skin in a while. They also have to consider champion updates, because they don't want to make a skin just to have it redone later that year.","replies":[]}]}
