If not, here's a very designer-y summary: with so much changing with gold flow in League, it's hard to assess individual itemchanges in a vacuum. The short of it is you'll probably be hitting your gold power spikes at different times than before, so it's better to understand the following changes in relation to gold efficiency rather than game flow. For the large part, these changes are simple gold adjustments with some smaller power changes where necessary.\n> \n> Up front: our intention isn't just a wholesale nerfing of mages. We ran a full-scale audit of all items in League of Legends to understand what their cost to power ratio was, then compared them to each other to ensure their efficiencies were on similar spectrums. This allows us to fully understand our item ecosystem and how champions interact with it. We also gain a better understanding of the innate strength of a champion in relation to others, rather than having to guess if their core items were just incredibly efficient.\n> \n> Following our sweep, we came to the conclusion that ability power was just far more efficient as a stat purchase for mages in relation to their AD brethren (although this has a lot of nuance, like the fact there are no AD-based control mages), so we made adjustments. We are more than willing to readjust if necessary, especially if we see an ecosystem that is significantly skewed toward AD champions and AD assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2015-11-12T03:21:43.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Prsvp9Yj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-11-10T23:20:21.938+0000)\n>\n> Hey dude,\n> \n> So please make sure you read the full patch notes.

It's like if I go to the doctor, my eye is melting, and he says \"Did you even Google it? Look here, have a band-aid and get informed mkay?\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Beauner","date":"2015-11-12T03:39:54.666+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uhh... every one of the issues brought up was adressed (other than merc treads), all the problems are either related to gold or mana, which Maraudaur covered \n\ndude","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2015-11-12T07:04:40.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Beauner,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Prsvp9Yj,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-11-12T03:39:54.666+0000)\n>\n> Uhh... every one of the issues brought up was adressed (other than merc treads), all the problems are either related to gold or mana, which Maraudaur covered \n> \n> dude\n\nIn regards to general mages, sure but singed isn't. The questions brought up are specific to him and the changes in relation to him. The quote itself even points this out \"it's hard to assess individual itemchanges in a vacuum\" and here someone on the boards is trying to point out potential problems with this one champion who could have been overlooked. The quote also states \"We are more than willing to readjust if necessary\" which tells me that there could be(And are) problems with the update, hence these specific questions from the playerbase should be treated as such, not as sweeping ignorance. Though I would admit that is a general problem with the community in regards to things such as punishment for toxicity and whatnot.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-12T08:08:21.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Get a load of this guy^","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2015-11-12T08:31:02.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"IKR.
