Fact is there's no way for the system (or Riot) to differentiate between intentional and unintentional DCs, *however* it does take that into consideration. That's why it takes multiple leaves to initiate an LPQ *but* that doesn't mean someone with a consistently interrupted connection wont be treated any differently from a chronic leaver, as it should be.\n\nYou can debate this all you want but until you can get a Rioter to confirm you weren't supposed to get an LPQ, you'll only find people in similar situations agreeing with you (and even then they'd just be making excuses, same as you).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-18T09:35:08.455+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You shouldn't be rewarded for your team carrying your dc'd ass.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-18T12:11:37.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what internet provider are you with? telstra?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-18T16:45:26.946+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EOFxZI1W,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-18T12:11:37.900+0000)\n>\n> what internet provider are you with? telstra?\n\nSony Xplod's/Firestones.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-18T16:48:27.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ill know not to get that modem then lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}
