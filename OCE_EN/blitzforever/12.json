Today had 2 games where people would not hold back with the  extremely detailed Death Threats, one got &quot;punished to the tribunal&quot; and the other got away free since Riot doesn&#039;t give a sh*t if only 1 person reports them. I believe any death threats like &quot;take a knife and slit you throat&quot; should be a permanent ban of their account.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-12-18T06:38:06.796+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can't divulge what we do with this player, I can say telling others to kill themselves is among the worst behaviour we do punish for.\n\nNot every case can be caught automatically, as the language used can be difficult to accurately determine as ban worthy. But I encourage you and every other player to continue to report for behaviours like this as this is the best way for the Instant Feedback system to learn and improve.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-18T07:51:27.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to ask this, because your post seems kinda vague on this, are you actually saying that the system is supposed to learn what is a death threat and what isn't?\n\nBecause i feel like this isn't actually something that should be done by an automated system and should rather be done manually (because this is a subject that could lead to false bans)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Machismo","date":"2015-12-21T15:20:39.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Damn that's heavy man!
