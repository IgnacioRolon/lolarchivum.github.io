I mean you highlight the champion you want to play and then that gives the troller the upper hand getting you under their control and ruining your game. Why?,because then they know which champion you want to play so they will make sure to ban it &quot;if&quot; they have the chance. Sure I know you could always highlight a different champ and then lock-in the one you want, but that can screw up the team if your building around strengths and weaknesses. Something needs to be done about this...","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-23T02:41:49.058+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"play hots, havent found a single troll yet, no toxicity and games are more engaging and fun","replies":[{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2016-01-23T02:46:04.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Might as well, League not that good anymore.....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2016-01-23T02:15:40.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about the trollers that pick the lanes they cant play?\nSo far ive had 1 jungler today out of 3 jungler primaries.
