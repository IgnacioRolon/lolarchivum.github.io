Broken and annoying (Please Fix Riot) :)","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since patch 5.14 Singed&#039;s gas has been displaying false damage stats and the stats that it displays get higher and higher every second your gas is damaging any enemy champion, minion, large monster etc etc. For example if Darius was chasing me though my gas the damage it would normally show would be 28, 28, 28, etc but what it shows now its shows for example is 28, 56, 112, 224, 448, 896, 1792 and goes on infertility like this until they are no longer in your gas. I find this mainly annoying because the number can get into the 10,000s sometimes and when you are damaging multiple minions at once those numbers start to take up a lot of the screen and become very distracting. It also makes it hard to tell how much &quot;actual&quot; damage you are doing to them. It seems nobody plays Singed anymore and that&#039;s probably the main reason you haven&#039;t noticed it :). Also will Singed ever get a re-work? {{champion:27}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} since its been 5 years and he hasn&#039;t had any &quot;major&quot; changes and i guess there&#039;s a reason why no one plays him anymore. Hope you read this riot and i hope you fix the bug :D.","replies":[]}
