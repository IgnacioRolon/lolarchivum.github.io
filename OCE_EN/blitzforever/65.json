He pretty much fits perfectly into the roll of being a Arcade boss of some kind\r\n\r\nThings I would want changed with the skin\r\n\r\nQ: His gas should be tons of small HD coins coming out of the game machine on his back or a rainbow trail (fits in with the bright arcade theme)\r\n\r\nW: The whole pool could be pixelated ( like the edges) or the pool should stay the same but instead be made up of many many small HD pixels (higher quality)\r\n\r\nE: When Singed flips and enemy it should have a rainbow trail, e.g when Singed flips and enemy he flips them in an 180 degree arc. So when he flips a rainbow should appear from his arm and then follow his arm all the way back 180 degrees making a rainbow (quite hard to explain)\r\n\r\nR: When ever Singed uses his ult the old ult sounds will be replaced by loud sounds of game machines working (ding, clang, wooooop etc). The screen on the back of the arcade machine should also start flashing so you know he is using ult, and just to make it look even more awesome :p. Also Singed could say in Singed&#039;s manly voice &quot;Gotta Go Fast&quot; or &quot;Gotta Go Faster&quot; if they first quote is already copyrighted by Sonic.\r\n\r\nTP Home *Animation* : Singed takes the arcade machine off his back and throws it on the ground facing upright. He then kicks it over so it falls on its back, does a twirl and then jumps into the screen and disappears. (re appears back at base)\r\n\r\nDeath *Animation* : Singed shrinks down to microscopic size, like Mario when he gets hit (you can only just see him) and his massive arcade machine falls over on to him.\r\n\r\nBONUS / Easter egg: If for an Easter egg of some sort the game machine on Singed&#039;s back could be the Blitzcranks Poro roundup arcade machine. \r\n\r\nOther: Any other animations like on hit animations etc can be added as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://media-titanium.cursecdn.com/loldiffs/AirClientDiff_8_10_2015_4_37_PM/media/Riven_Splash_6.jpg\r\n\r\n^^ If you look at the picture it is clear Riot is trying to make all the roles for each team (Top, Mid, Adc, Sup ,Jng) for Arcade and Bosses\r\n\r\nArcade Team (Good)\r\n\r\nTop: Arcade {{champion:92}} \r\n\r\nMid ???????\r\n\r\nAdc: Arcade {{champion:21}} \r\n\r\nSup: Arcade {{champion:37}} \r\n\r\nJng: Arcade {{champion:120}} \r\n|\r\n|\r\nBoss Team, Battle Boss etc (Bad)\r\n|\r\n|\r\nTop: Miniboss {{champion:27}}  (or whatever)  NEW \r\n\r\nMid: Final Boss {{champion:45}}\r\n\r\nAdc ????????\r\n\r\nSup: Battle Boss{{champion:53}}\r\n\r\nJng ?????????\r\n\r\nTell me what you think :)","replies":[]}
