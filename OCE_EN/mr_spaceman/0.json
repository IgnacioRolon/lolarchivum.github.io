Ive leveled it up from 1 - 30 all by my self. Spent around 1000 dollars on the game since its easily my favorite game and would love some help in being able to change the email from **[Email Redacted]** to my current email I have used for the last couple of years which for some reason didn&#039;t work at the time which is **[Email Redacted]**. This would help me a lot if someone from Riot could help me immediately cause I really need it. Thanks. I&#039;m willing to give details to a Riot employee to show i&#039;m not scamming.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-04T01:12:05.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nFirst off, please remove any personal details from your post as this could pose a security risk to your account.\n\n* Your email addresses\n* Real names\n\nSecond, you'll have to [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=72416) to Player Support as they're the only ones who can deal with account-related issues.","replies":[]}]}
