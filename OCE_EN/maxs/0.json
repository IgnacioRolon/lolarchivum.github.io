Looking for some information.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So since August I&#039;ve had a 30 ping increase, it isn&#039;t unstable, it&#039;s just a plain increase in ping, I haven&#039;t moved houses or anything silly. I made a quick [.txt file](http://puu.sh/jAYlN/a9b24977db.txt) that compares pre-August ping to my current ping. \r\n\r\nI live in Broken Hill, NSW. (We&#039;re super close to SA). I&#039;ve spoke with James Wyld on twitter [(link)](https://twitter.com/jameswyld/status/632036625363505156). The tl;dr of that conversation was that there is some more connection routing that wasn&#039;t stated anywhere. \r\n\r\nMy aim out of this isn&#039;t to get my lower ping back(though it would be nice!), but to gain an insight on what&#039;s happening.  \r\n\r\nIf I was able to get the server ip address, we could probably do a traceroute to find where it&#039;s getting the 30 ping increase from.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-17T04:59:00.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Maxs\n\nTry running your trace route to 103.240.226.249 - that should give you the info you need on the hops between you and the OCE game servers.  FYI that IP won't respond to ping itself, but you should be able to see everything leading up to it.\n\nLet me know how you go!\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Maxs","date":"2015-08-17T07:11:14.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Agent Mindstar,\n\nFirstly, thanks for responding!\n\n\nSecondly I used tracert on that address with a maximum of 15 hops to cut off the 20 or so request timeouts on a previous 30 hops test.\n\nHere are the [results](http://puu.sh/jElrt/33a63139ae.txt) of the 15 hop test from my address. \n\nFrom memory request timeouts are just ways of blocking routes so based on that the information I have here shows that the Sydney bundle/tunnel/whatever it is is what's increasing my ping.. I guess, it's been awhile since I did a networking course and my mind is pretty hazzey on this stuff. \n\nThough based on that tracert I shouldn't be getting 86+ ping.\n\nUnless of course the games i'm playing are ran on the Sydney servers, in which case I would get 80+ ping, whereas I used to play in the Adelaide servers, could explain why I sometimes had the higher ping then went back down to the lower ping. \n\nThanks,\nMaxs","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-08-17T08:12:13.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info... Here's my take:\n\nFrom that traceroute, to get from Broken Hill to Sydney (where the League servers are), you're going through Adelaide, then Melbourne and then up to Sydney.  I'm not sure of how the physical networks run to/from Broken Hill, but the path from Broken Hill to Sydney does seem to take the long way round. \n\nBased on this, there are 2 things that I'd look into:\n\n* Between your router and the first hop, you hit 60ms latency.  It looks like that is somewhere between you and Adelaide.  I'm wondering if something has changed on your router or within the local ISP network to cause this.  Have you restarted your router lately?\n* It's hard to verify retroactively, but if the traffic previously went direct from Broken Hill to Sydney, that could also explain a ~30ms difference on a longer path.\n\nCheers!\nJames","replies":[{"poster":"Maxs","date":"2015-08-20T06:59:42.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey James.\n\nIf you're still interested, just then while I was in a game the server switching or whatever was going on stopped for at least a bit and I'm back on 71 ping from 86. \n\nI find it interesting that it happened while my connection was still active, though it happened when I was about to pass off a blue buff to the mid laner and the spike accidently made me steal it ~_~.\n\nWhat I didn't include in the original post is that 71 ping is a common occurrence while the 86 was not (hence why I made the thread). I did another tracert here: [Results](http://puu.sh/jHRSb/6a0054cc06)\n\nGood to see my ISP is being nicer to us again haha :). Alternatively if this was due to something you guys did. Thanks!

As for the local ISP, Telstra does like to screw us around as there isn't much demand for an internet connection in our old mining town so that could be it. \n\nThanks anyway!
