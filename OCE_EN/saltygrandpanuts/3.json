Need feedback on this passive","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive - Stealth\r\nChampion passively gains 100 stealth. Champion gains +1.5 movement speed for every 5 stealth champion currently has. Champion uses 10 stealth for each ability (thinking about it being 10) . Stealth does not regenerate until it hits 0. There is then a 2 second delay and then stealth regenerates at 5 per second. All abilitys are free during the regeneration process. \r\n\r\nThe champ I'm thinking about starts off with 340 movement speed giving him 370 movement speed with full stealth.\r\n\r\nThoughts???","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-01-31T02:01:47.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Question, what does actually using the stealth actually do?  You mentioned that it costs 10 stealth per ability. Does it put your champ in stealth for a few seconds similar to Vayne's tumble during ult? If you could clarify that I might be able to actually contribute more to the conversation.","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2015-01-31T07:20:37.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i could update this stealth so that when stealth is at 100 the next ability used will turn this champ invisible for 3-4 seconds? otherwise with full stealth this champ will gain +30 MS","replies":[{"poster":"SpectralWraithX","date":"2015-01-31T07:49:41.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea, although it's still a little impractical. They'd have to use 10 abilities in order to get their stealth to start regening to full for movement speed boost and the invisibility. I'm not trying to diss your idea, it just seems a little unrealistic to have to use 10 abilities before they can get the bonus speed and invisibility unless their cooldowns are ridiculously short. What kind of champion are we talking about also? Support? jungler? Mid lane? Adc? top? And how would stealth tie in with their abilities? Maybe consider also giving bonus effects to the other abilities based on the stealth spent? Have the abilities cost stealth instead of mana maybe? Just throwing out some more ideas for ya. Although the abilities being free while stealth is regening has some merit. I forgot to comment on that.....  Sorry if I seem to be nit picking.....

You might also have to make the stealth regen a bit higher because at your current regen it'll give you 20 seconds of free spells. If your abilities are like 3 second cool downs then this will be really op and would probably have to be nerfed like straight away. So the whole idea is to make a really mobile jungler basically?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2015-02-01T02:09:22.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and I'm trying for a jungler","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Avignis","date":"2015-01-30T10:21:19.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel as one of those champions who get a lot of movement speed, it may have to be a 325 or a 330 kind of thing ({{champion:21}} has 325 and gainst 70 when she hasn't taken damage, {{champion:17}} has 330 and so does {{champion:103}} with her move speed on orb and ultimate.)
