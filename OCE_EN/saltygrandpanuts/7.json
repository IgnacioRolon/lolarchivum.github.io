I was made to be some sort of weapon, ha some weapon I am I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly. Ok but get this. Being a man made of slime, or whatever I am is fun, as in really fun. Being able to suck in air and blow my self up like a balloon! Then floating down, down, down sometimes off of buildings because since I&rsquo;m slime I don&rsquo;t really feel pain. Anyways there was this time when dad, ah that&rsquo;s the guy that made me, had to lock me away to keep me from beating up the neighbourhood Monster. No, no I&rsquo;m just kidding it was this kid that kept bullying me. Getting along with the story haha it&rsquo;s funny actually I just slipped through the cracks of my bedroom door and gave my friend a little visit. So I guess I could hurt a fly but I bet you don&rsquo;t really care about any of that. I was meant to be scary, you know look intimidating! But I came out like this a green putty monster with a cute little antennae or whatever it is sticking out of my head. So that&rsquo;s me, oh yea dad called me Zac by the way to add to the scare factor, it&rsquo;s supposed to mean something I&rsquo;m pretty sure but nobody really cares to much about that. So yea that&rsquo;s me on an average day, doing stupid things nothing special. I could preach about some more of my day to day life but I&rsquo;m just too busy waiting for dad to make me look better.","replies":[]}
