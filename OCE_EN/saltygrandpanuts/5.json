Raymon&#039;s next auto attack then flips to a target within a 500 radius only after the first 3 basic attacks have been struck. Raymon&#039;s then has 7 seconds to use this flip attack. Costs 70 energy. 12/10/9/8/7 second cool down. Raymon can flip onto wards at a decreased range of 400.\n\nW &ndash; Shred\nRaymon throws a spike that pierces through all enemies hit dealing 40/50/80/110/150 AD (+30% attack Damage) but stops at the first champion hit or 2/3/4/5/5 minions hit. The flip range increases by 150 when targeting a champion that has been hit by the spike, if Raymon flips on a pierced champion he will deal 10% of his attack damage as additional magic damage. Cooldown (15/14/12/11/10).

During this time Raymon can attack friendly &quot;MINIONS&quot; and every 5 hits on a single target (attacking another target will cancel stacks on current target) will proc Raymons passive. Lasts 10/12/15/15/15. While in lone warrior Raymon is immune to all slows.\n\nwould appreciate feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-02-11T08:36:25.722+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest, not trying to be mean or anything, it's worded pretty badly...\n\nIf you touched up spelling and grammar, and set the whole thing out a bit more, I'm sure this would get some more comments.\n\nAlso, some things are questionable about his kit.","replies":[]}]}
