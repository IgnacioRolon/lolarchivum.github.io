This stacks up to a cap of 30. Cerva Has 5 seconds to kill the next minion to keep up his stack or the stacks are reset.\n\nQ – Destroy\nCerva’s next 3 basic attacks are struck 40/50/60/70/75% faster (+10% attack damage). Cerva can reactivate the ability to flip in target direction only after the first 3 basic attacks have been struck. Costs 75 energy. 12/10/9/8/7 second cool down\n\nW –  Thrive from Power\nToggled: Cerva gains +10 movement speed and gains +10/20/25/30/40 armour. While this is toggled on … receives 10% more damage as well as silences and slows lasting 0.5 seconds longer. Consumes 10/9/8/7/6 energy per second.\n\nE – No one Escapes\nCerva’s next basic attack will slow enemy by 10/20/30/40/50% for 2 seconds. … gains + 5/10/15/20/25 extra attack damage for the next 2 hits. Costs 75 energy.\n\nR – Earthquake\nCerva slams his fist into the ground causing the earth to erupt dealing 100/200/350 damage (+30% attack damage) in a cone in front of him. Damaged enemies are knocked up for 1/1.5/2 seconds.\n\nThis champ is a completely an auto attack based melee assassin/fighter, the only thing im not sure about is will his auto’s get to strong?

Lets say he has 100.......\n\nHis Passive: Useless in team fights. But will have a huge impact early game. The following is just a suggestion, I didn't think hard about it but will make you more of a late game champion than early game bully.\n\nPassive: For each 3 minions killed permanently gain +1.2 Armor and Magic Resist (80 at 200 cs). For every champion kill permanently gain +10 attack damage and +5 for assist. This will solve that auto attack problem you had. And will make it he doesn't get stunned and melted by the AP lategame.\n\nBut the passive doesn't take the other abilities into account.\n\nHis Q:\n\nWay too energy greedy, can lower it a bit. Maybe 20-30.\n\nHis W: (Would change it to this)\n\nToggle on: You gain +10/20/25/30/40 armor. Plus a initial speed boost of 125% decaying  over 5 seconds to 100% then stopping the speed boots.\nToggle off: Ability goes on cooldown for 5 seconds \n\nGood energy rate.\n\nE: Cost too high as well. Give the poor guy some slack.\n\nR: Either remove the knockup and make it a slow or tune the damage down a bit.\n\nHope this is what you were looking for, soz if too mean","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-02-01T15:34:48.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like twitch and malhite","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-02-01T05:45:42.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like Warwick and Zyra had a baby","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-02-01T13:54:40.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW, Zyra *and* Malphite","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HairyWookie","date":"2015-02-01T10:28:35.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol its spike from crash of the titans :)","replies":[{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2015-02-01T10:38:51.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ye thats what i based the champ off","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SaltyGrandpaNuts","date":"2015-01-31T07:22:35.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BTW i seriously couldn't think of a name this name mightn't be permanent","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-31T04:25:50.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love this concept except its kinda like Tristana 2.0 (Which is my fave adc).
