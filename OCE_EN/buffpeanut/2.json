I get very offended sometimes and I feel like my reports mean nothing. \r\n\r\nEver since the new system came in, I haven&#039;t been given a single notification that someone I reported was punished. I&#039;m close to quitting NOT because I can&#039;t play without being abused, but because I can&#039;t do anything about it.\r\nDo I perhaps report too many people? I always feel like my reports are justified however.","replies":[{"poster":"FISTFACE","date":"2015-09-08T13:16:31.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what I usually do. Stay silent unless communication is really needed, even if they are feeding I just try to encourage them unless they are actually trolling or and purposely feeding. Usually we lose the match and I leave all my rage at the end and report them, then I realise reporting does nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omega","date":"2015-09-03T07:41:41.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends, might be justified in your head but not everyone elses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"One the K","date":"2015-09-02T06:17:28.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same here.... last week i remember i report over 10 people in a day.......some of them is the same user coz they play bot in ARAM games and make us lose coz they feed really hard......but after hours/ days I saw them playing again same.....wondering did they got punished. or is the punishment to light?","replies":[]}]}
