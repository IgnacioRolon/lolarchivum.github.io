I&#039;ve been playing league for roughly 4 years, Vayne was the first champion I remember being released (I&#039;m awful at vayne T_T), and in terms of MOBA&#039;s I had a small amount of experience in the original DotA before transferring to League.  I think I peaked 50 elo off diamond when we had to play on the NA server (lame) and I transferred to the OCE server a couple of weeks after its release.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been a part of a few teams, namely Mindfreak/Avant Garde: Ascension/Legacy and now most recently the Chiefs.  I&#039;ve competed in a number of online competitions, the Autumn/Winter and Pax Finals Regional events, the International Wildcard Competition in Cologne 2014, OPL Split 1 and we&#039;re now into week 2 of the second OPL split.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to ask about the support role, anything OPL, oce as a competitive region, myself as a player, stuff about my team/former teams, opinions on other teams/players, my recent move to the Chiefs, why I seem to enjoy pulverizing the ground more than my opponents nowadays :( or anything else you can think of!\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nYou can follow me and my team on twitter for more updates on the continuing OPL split!\r\n[@EGymLoL](http://twitter.com/EGymLoL)\r\n[@ChiefsESC](http://twitter.com/ChiefsESC)\r\n\r\nand remember to give the Chiefs [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/chiefsesc) page a sneaky like (^:","replies":[{"poster":"IMCJAY","date":"2015-05-29T11:31:15.055+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Chief EGym Thoughts on the 0ce pr0 Rich Homie Dre?","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2015-05-29T11:39:37.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to see the whole of RG gone tbh.\n\nTheir whole team is exactly what's wrong with OCE.

There's been a bunch of small things but the biggest thing I take away is just the entire experience.  When I went to my first event at the Autumn Regionals, playing in front of a crowd was something I'd never done before and was a really scary and exciting experience.  Also going from playing league in my room for a bit of fun and suddenly sitting in front of a queue of people wanting my signature on a poster was INCREDIBLY weird, but it's insanely cool to meet all the people that come to the events to watch us play and support us.\n\nLost: Time I guess?  We have to spend a lot of time scrimming/practicing in order to stay good and that eats into time you have to spend in other areas of your life pretty significantly.\n\n2) In some weird way playing pro league has made me become a lot more comfortable with myself.  Being able to see myself do really awkward interviews on stage with Sjokz, having makeup put on you before you go on stage at wildcards (LOL) and all those sorts of things, basically just being in front of a camera has made me a lot more confident in myself.  Also just being able to meet a huge range of people I would have never met otherwise has had some pretty huge changes on my life and I'm really grateful for.\n\n3) My drive to win.  I get pretty emotionally invested into our games (probably too much) and I just try my absolute best to play to the best of my ability seeing as I have my 4 teammates relying on me in every one of our games.  In one of my very first interviews I was asked about how I go into games, and I always said that if you don't think you can win you're simply not going to.  So I go into every game confident that I can completely stomp my counterpart and propel my team to victory.  In saying that, midway through last split I had some reaaaaaally poor games in the OPL and I had this really weird feeling of like, just watching myself make countless mechanical mistakes without being able to stop myself from doing it.  It was incredibly frustrating.\n\n4) In terms of league, definitely LGC Carbon.  I was closest to him more than anyone else on the long time i spent with Legacy (MF/Av:A) and it was an incredibly hard decision to leave the team.  He like many others plays with his heart on his sleeve, and there's been countless highlight videos from events where he's been SO HYPE and banging his hands on the table, doing pushups, hugging people, all that stuff.  He's incredibly passionate about the game and his team and I think he's like that with everything he does.  I'm so grateful that I could spend as much time as I did with him (along with everyone else on legacy) and I wish him/them the best in everything.  \n\nHe definitely inspired me to become the player I am today, even though when we first met I was a dirty thresh 1 trick pony and he would always camp me in soloq.\n\nIn terms of out of the game, definitely @Fasffy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"blisskr","date":"2015-05-29T08:35:51.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, do you remember me? :^)\n\nCould you inform us on your power ranking of OPL supports?\n\nAre there any OCE players that are currently team-less that you have been impressed/had an impression of?\n\n^~^","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2015-05-29T09:00:34.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We played yesterday in SoloQ right?

I have very conflicting things going on in my mind I am able to analyse others, my own game play and even go through in my head what and why the pros did what they did and sort of guess what they will do next but, my \"skill\" as a player is not like my mindset and values, but I guess my question is how do I get better overall I have a very team orientated mind set but the games I get into and the people I get paired with MOSTLY are not like this, they are very nasty bitter annoying people, so that's question one now for question two.\n\n2. I love playing Mid, I wish to main it then jungle as a secondary choice, but then I have certain champs I like to play in different lanes should I play them also or not, as In just forget about it or surge on? I'm so lost as you can see hahaha, for my last question.\n\n3. I wan't to push my Solo/Duo Queue rating up now I have friends who are Diamond and things but they're getting sick of the game at the moment a bit what should I do just do normal's a lot more then go into ranked again after 100 games or so? What would your take out on all these questions be now I mean please just try the best you possibly can to honestly answer them I know it's probably hard but yeah, lol\n\nAlso congrats on getting into the Chiefs I hope you really do succeed. I will be watching the teams progress for sure, I hope you're the team to bring Oceanic esports alive. That would be a great trophy not just for you but the whole team as I'm assuming you guys absolutely work yourselves to the bone to practice whenever possible.\n\nRegards\n\nExistz","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2015-05-30T16:43:06.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo!\n\n1) SoloQ isn't the best environment to improve at the game as it \"should\" be played, because teamwork takes up such a large portion of how the game works.  But given that, it's really the only option for the majority of the playerbase.  You're never going to be able to control your teams, and there's going to be a lot of unwinnable games just based on the nature of the system.  However you're the only common denominator in all of your games so you have to try and focus on improving yourself as a player (as hard as that may be) and not dwell on whatever nonsense your team is doing.  It also sounds like your game knowledge outweighs your mechanics so you can look at this two ways:\n\nA) If your goal is to gain elo, play less mechanically intensive champions and focus on using game knowledge to win games with smarter decisions rather than mechanical outplays.  AKA (i don't know your role) no thresh/zed/vayne, stick to strong and basic champs like nautilus/lucian/maokai.\n\nB) If your goal is to improve as a player, do literally the opposite of what I just said.  Practice is the best way to improve and if your game knowledge outweighs your mechanics then the best way to improve them is by forcing yourself into mechanically intensive environments.  DISCLAIMER: this will tank your elo, so you could do this in normals if you care about it that much (I personally hate normals).\n\n2) As a SoloQ player you *should* be able to play every role up to a minimum level, at least well enough to let yourself get carried.  A lot of people suggest that you be able to play 2-3 champions in each respective role and I agree that that's probably a healthy amount.  It's pretty ironic seeing as if any other high elo players read this they'll know I only pretty much exclusively play bot lane, I'm reaaaaaally bad when it comes to other roles; but in saying that it's a lot easier to get your desired role when I consistently play with people I know in the higher elos.  \n\nSo I would suggest just calling mid/jungle in champ select, but if you're lower in the pick order just think of it as an opportunity to practice other roles.  Often times playing roles you don't normally play allows you to see things from different perspectives and makes you a better player in your main role.\n\nPS.  You're incredibly lucky because jungle and mid are probably the easiest roles to carry on in this meta, WOO!\n\n3)  Your goal shouldn't be to gain elo, your goal should be to improve as a player.  As you improve the elo will come (or lp rather) but it's important to disconnect yourself from winning/losing and just focus on improving your own gameplay.  SoloQ is definitely the best place to improve as an individual if you don't have 4 other players of equal skill to play ranked 5's with, and I'd definitely advise against going into normals because often people just pick troll shit and the games are taken less seriously.  Most of all just focus on your own play, and if you're really keen keep a record or something in a google doc (I do this for scrims/pro matches) and make notes on things you can improve on.\n\nThanks for the support!","replies":[{"poster":"Existz","date":"2015-06-03T16:35:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Bryce\n\nThank you so much for your in depth knowledge of answers and catering to all my questions man 10/10. Everything you said/told me to do as a player I am already aware and trying my hardest to work on that, so I definitely am in the right mindset but for the gaining elo stuff that would be my biggest problem as a player. I should, like you said just stick to Normals for a while, get better at my main and secondary role and then after a lot of Normals like you say call your first or second role if not I just take it as an opportunity and take that as a learning curve, i already knew this but it's just annoying because the people are so rude and all, plus most of the time you take that risk of are they good or not but I just let it go I don't fight it lol, also I forgot to say my main role also because you said you didn't know what role I want to main Mid and Secondary as a Jungle sadly my favourite champions are the mechanic involved ones...Zed is my favourite dammit lol!\n\nAlso no problem for the support, you guys definitely deserve it, I will be watching on\n\nRegards\n\nExistz","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-30T04:39:53.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Bryce, do you have a contact email?

Almost every new champion gets released with at least one mobility tool and that's unlikely to change.  Just by the nature of immobile champs too, they're generally more reactive than their mobile counterparts and as league grows it becomes a quicker and more aggressive game; the meta will always lean towards the more aggressive option\n\nIn all honesty I don't really care.

Nice that I could hold my own decently and all (doubt I could anymore), but not worth it at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Chief EGym","date":"2015-05-29T10:12:51.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I can definitely understand it.\n\nJust think of it as good practice I guess :(  IDK!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OJ191","date":"2015-05-29T10:04:44.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chief EGym,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=6BbQuONN,comment-id=000a0000,timestamp=2015-05-29T09:45:59.561+0000)\n>\n> HAHA YESSSS\n> \n> Is that.. the.. the lux god?\n> \n> EDIT:  you changed your question on me wtf?!\n> \n> But no, I think mobility creep has come to a pretty irreversible stage in league at this point.  Almost every new champion gets released with at least one mobility tool and that's unlikely to change.  Just by the nature of immobile champs too, they're generally more reactive than their mobile counterparts and as league grows it becomes a quicker and more aggressive game; the meta will always lean towards the more aggressive option\n> \n> In all honesty I don't really care.
