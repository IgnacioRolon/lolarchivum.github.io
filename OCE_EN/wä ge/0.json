How many bugs are around and you guys think it&#039;s funny because there&#039;s youtube videos showcasing your bugs in action and people laughing at them saying wtf. Here&#039;s a headsup, they&#039;re not just laughing at the bugs. I can&#039;t even log in because of your stupid UI update in your piece of shit launcher is bugging out and I can&#039;t even play the game. Here&#039;s another bug that you guys still haven&#039;t fixed even though it&#039;s been around for fucking ages: Tryndamere dying through press the attack, here&#039;s another one: Thresh hooks sometimes go through minions, A LOT OF THEM. WE DON&#039;T WANT NEW SHIT RIOT. WE WANT A NON SHIT GAME. WE WANT A GAME WITH LESS BUGS THAN AN INDIE GAME IN ALPHA. WE WANT LESS BUGS THAN A BETHESDA GAME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND RIOT?
