However, when I tried to buy her, an error popped up:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fRSVkcC.png\r\nIt told me to keep trying and even after many attempts, I kept getting the same error. \r\n\r\nI thought there was maybe some error with the shop so I bought Heartseeker Ashe (Cheapest) to see if I could buy it or not. I was able to buy Heartseeker Ashe so I was a bit confused.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aNO9Cvh.jpg\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tied restarting the client, still no fix.\r\nSummoner name (If this helps): ecicow","replies":[{"poster":"NattyShenronBaek","date":"2015-12-19T12:50:24.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This same thing happened to me.

The Snowdown Shop is a different event, I don't think they would make the same mistake of allowing Challenger Ahri to be pulled again :/\n\nEDIT: Looks like Challenger Ahri is a skin that is meant to be on sale on special occasions and is going on sale on January so you are probably right, however, if we can't get Challenger Ahri, wouldn't that be a waste of 1 discount slot?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
