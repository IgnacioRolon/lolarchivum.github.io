The animations and UI are all so smooth and convenient. There is an issue that is persisting, however, every time I log in. The client lets me know, animations and all, that **&quot;You have earned a key fragment!&quot;**, but when I go and check my loot, there is no change. This must have happened about 4 times now. I just need to know if this is a bug, or am I missing out on some key fragments.\n\n-Shimkun","replies":[{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-10-28T03:32:18.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me too.
