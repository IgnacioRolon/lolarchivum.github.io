A few weeks later she had it looked at and her doctor told her it was probably just a torn muscle. Over the next couple months it grew bigger and became more painful. In November, her doctor decided they should do an ultrasound.","url":"http://www.gofundme.com/jjhq2c","image":"/api/embedly/1/image/resize?url=https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2924745_1420761164.0341.jpg&key=a45e967db0914c7fb472fd4381e6c85b&width=425"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello comrades.\nI really enjoy the videos at Jumpinthepack on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/user/Jumpinthepack/videos\nTop Fails have always made me feel better about myself. So the guy who runs the whole channel, his wife has cancer in her arm. \nIf you don't make youtube content for a while, which this guy can't as he is looking after her, your channel quickly becomes de-monetised. This guy has done so much for the community, I think we should help him out in his time of need.\nHave included link to his gofundme page where he explains what's wrong with her and where money goes.\nHave a good day","replies":[{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2015-01-15T08:33:41.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good to see the people posting stuff like this","replies":[{"poster":"ColdBlood","date":"2015-01-15T08:59:03.911+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"too bad the majority of people care more about a burst item being removed and a video game character getting upgraded.","replies":[{"poster":"Tiz Arrior","date":"2015-01-16T06:25:05.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah how dare people not give a damn about some stranger, I mean I spend all day crying about every person who ever died, no joke just crying rivers. \n\nSome of us don't give a damn because it's irrelevant to us, doesn't mean we don't hope for the best but expending energy on someone we know nothing about, when we can do absolutely nothing to help them is stupid.
