He said Stalker's Blade (whichever that one is) is the best choice. As for enchantment, personally I'd go with Warrior as that worked well last season (with spirit of the elder lizard). Cyanide has a guide on Noc for season 5 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1-SCvI872s) which can help deciding how to play in this new season.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-24T12:31:50.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lizard isnt warrior....warrior is just an extra brut item. so anyone who used brut as a rush after liz will want warrior. you cant replace what liz was with warrior...","replies":[{"poster":"Novyx","date":"2014-12-25T02:49:50.362+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"I go with the enchantment that is the most similar to Elder Lizard, which is what I saw was most used last season. I know they are not the same, but they both do give some amount of AD and 10% CDR as well as a bit of extra damage to armoured targets (true damage burn and armour pen).

He doesn't really need the AOE smite since his passive and Q help him farm really fast anyway. Slowing someone who you have the fear tethers on really helps. Skirmishers can be ok too if you want the 20% damage reduction if you think the enemy is more likely to try and fight you instead of run.\nI don't like building poachers on anyone really.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-24T12:49:20.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion the AOE stun would be the best for nocturne.\nNocturne doesn't necessarily need the Chilling smite buff to take down oppositions, he has his Q for Movespeed, his Ult for an engage swell as his E for a fear.\nI think the only two build paths worth considering are the true damage and the AOE clear.\nAOE clear significantly helps with farming, you take less damage, meaning you have to B less. But, if the enemy team has hyper carries like a riven, yasuo or akali - you definitely want to pick up with buff that deals true damage/reduced damage.\n\nIn regards to what buffs to get. Depends on the enemy team.\nIt really isn't hard to figure out what buff is relevant in a game - All you need to do is take into account whether the team has cc, high damage output, whether they're soft champs or tanks. Take into account what you'll be doing for the most part of the game, if lanes are going to be pushed and you have the enemy team turtling their lanes and building tanky, then you'll want to go with the *feral* build path so you can deal with their tankiness later in the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ColdBlood","date":"2014-12-24T12:11:52.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"anyone else?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-24T09:48:53.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"probably death cap tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-24T12:30:35.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"In addition, 3 of the 4 enchantments are all viable on him:\n20% CDR and awesome AP for his....AP scaling ability (the fear?)\nhow is all 4 no viable? ive seen 3 nocts with the AP one and they rekt.","replies":[]}]}
