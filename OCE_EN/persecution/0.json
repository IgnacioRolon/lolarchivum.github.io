I was wondering if The Sydney Riot team did any work experience for school students? hopefully the answer is yes, If so could you please inform me on how i could apply for a role at riot for a week and also if i could learn about game developing design and also even getting to know marketing. also if they was a way to apply could i be informed on what the id need to do like a application or sending the friendly staff an email.\r\n\r\nThanks Greatly, Ben.\r\nRiot Games.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-04T00:07:08.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nUnfortunately Riot Games does not currently offer work experience positions, however you could check out the following links for information regarding careers with Riot Games and their Internship Program for when you're a little older :)\n\n* [Riot Games Careers](http://www.riotgames.com/careers)\n* [Riot Games Internship Program](http://www.riotgames.com/internship-program)","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-03-04T06:01:00.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"lvl 29 wrench guy.
