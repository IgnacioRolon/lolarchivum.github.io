I have tried full repairs, running as admin, using both clients, and nothing seems to fucking work.\r\n\r\nSomeone please help me, because if issues like that on the most popular game in the world will happen, the devs are being really lackluster.\r\n\r\nSorry if im being a bit rude, im just extremely mad over this whole thing.","replies":[]}
