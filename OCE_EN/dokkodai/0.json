Use E or on a minion or a creep, or enemy champion\r\n\r\n2. Try to attack with right click, or Player Attack Move click, or just let Yasuo Auto Attack himself. (after checking Auto Attack box in option menu)\r\n\r\n*This happens after his Ult too.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have missed so many kill chances because of this... and in team fights, it has been very frustrating because I couldn't move nor AA to finish off enemies, thus failed to do my job properly as a damage dealer. \r\nFirst, I thought I was misclicking or I was CC'd by enemies but I have tested over so many games and I am sure that I wasn't.\r\n\r\n\r\nReasons that I think this is a 100% bug are:\r\n\r\n1. I have checked [Auto Attack} box in option menu ( which means, after using E or Ult on enemy, Yasuo should AA without clicking enemy manually.)\r\n\r\n2. I have tested in bot games and enemy bot champions didn't have any CC.( I could relax and check carefully without worrying about getting CC'd.) \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease fix this Riot, I will get DJ Sona so please do fix it. Please.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T22:28:33.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[You're in the wrong section.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report)","replies":[]}]}
