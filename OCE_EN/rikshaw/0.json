As in, regardless of his current power level, he is no fun to play.\n\nPart of this is because of the lowered ult AP ratio. Part of this is because of the lack of gratification on his stun (it never feels like your skill that has prevailed, only the enemies stupidity that landed the stun)\n\nBut the part that I believe is actually addressable is his now boring skillshot. Let's have a look at skillshots:\n\n* Ezreal Mystic Shot: A nice chinking sound when you hit, followed by a CDR of your abilities\n* Caitlyn Piltover Peacemaker: Enemies generate a particle effect on hit, proving that you hit them\n* Karma Inner Flame (Q): A resounding explosion sound and the AOE Effect rewarding you for landing it.\n* Veigar's Baleful Strike: The spell whizzes past 2 targets and fizzles.\n\nOne of these things is not like the other.\n\nYou can only tell that you landed the spell via the damage dealt and you can't tell that you killed the minion and recieved AP for it. Its just lame overall. What do you guys think? Besides power level, how underwhelming is landing this skill at the moment?","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-02-28T12:21:33.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you watch closely, Vieger emits a dark green and black sort of Aura when he gains AP from his Q. It flashes and spins around him. This is his classic skin btw, I don't know if it is the same for his other skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-28T08:16:19.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a problem that needs addressing though.

But it lacks the ability to do that in its current form which is odd compared to other skillshots.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-02-28T08:14:07.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play FB veigar. gives +1 when u kill cs","replies":[]}]}
