It hurts but it's most her damage. I'd imagine the damage would be quite similar, the thing is we haven't seen full ap nidalee mid in a while, so we've forgotten what it feels like.\n\nZoe: 40 / 70 / 100 / 130 / 160 (+ 66% AP) (*0-250% based on distance 800-2550)\nMaximum: 100 / 175 / 250 / 325 / 400 (+ 165% AP)\nNidalee: 70 / 85 / 100 / 115 / 130 (+ 40% AP) (*0-200% based on distance 525-1300)\nMaximum: 210 / 255 / 300 / 345 / 390 (+ 120% AP)\n\nwhilst yes the ap scaling is higher, nidalee has better base damage for the first 4 ranks and a lower cooldown on the ability, and it's got less windup than zoe, since zoe needs to place her q behind her first, making nidalee spears harder to dodge. \n\nAlso whilst nidalee spears may be limited by a range of 1500, they only need to travel 1300 units to get this maximum damage. Zoe's basic q ult q combo gets a range of 2175, for 100% of the base damage, giving 1.33 scaling and lower base damage at all ranks (93/ 163 / 233 / 303 / 373). Such that the damage is similar at most reasonable levels of AP (nightblue sets an unrealistic standard for what reasonable AP is, 180-360 AP is around average for an AP mid nearing lategame).\n\nZoe's highest damage natural combo puts her in a large degree of danger and is even further broadcast since both the end point, trajectory and her positioning are broadcast whilst she's locked in both casts of her ult in a forward position, which will achieve a windup range of 2750, satisfying her 2550 range req for maximum paddle damage, but it's very risky if the enemy team has any engage, cc or burst, since she's basically locked in one spot and if the enemy team pushes forward, she'll likely find herself with a darius on top of her.\n\nZoe is a tad stronger in the long range single ability 1shot wars, and will eventually get tuned back, but the ability is comparable. It takes more focus to land than a nidalee spear, has a longer cooldown, is weaker early on, and if you try to use the ability in such a way, you put zoe at a great deal of risk of hulking bruisers and vicious assassins, jumping on top of her.\n\nZoe's primary damage is her paddle star, nidalee relies on her spear, but her primary damage comes from pounce and takedown.\n\nImo the real problem is Zoe's sleepy trouble bubble and her passive. Sleep trouble bubble's cc lasts way too long and the extra damage makes her q seem ludicrous, and her passive does way too much damage, especially at early levels where she can get 2 passive sparkles from 1q, as compared to a similar lichbane passive like lux.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-27T12:23:46.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has a restricted range that she can throw forward, so when she tries to throw it behind her and redirect it towards you just walk back a bit and it will fall short.
