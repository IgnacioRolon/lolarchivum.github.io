He call top but top had already been called, goes jungle but jungle had already been called. SO IN THE END, i had to go support fiddlesticks. He then goes to my bot lane, feeds 7 times in 8 minutes. I want people like this banned as they ruin the fun experience of League BUT it seems like our reports on troll players seem to have no effect whatsoever. So please, take the time to consider you banning systems and make League a fun environment that is anti-salt and no trolling. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-09T07:05:20.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bud they can ban some one and guess what they are just gona go here to the lol home page click on the make a account page and log in with that one or they already have a account and can just log in to that one you cant get rid of these guys as they can just make a new account but if you have a idea on how to stop then go right ahead and tell riot if not shut up the only resone these players troll are because you go and say shit  like omfg wtf man stop it so on its that reaction that gets them off","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-09T06:44:10.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe he was just bad","replies":[]}]}
