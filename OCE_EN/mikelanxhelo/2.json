I have looked at your op.gg (did not watch any games as I do not have the time for thaty and you better pay me for coaching if I did) and I have a few comments for you. I will address them later as I want to address your post beforehand.\n\n> I was on a winning streak in bronze and then all of a sudden I've started to play really badly and have been on a losing, (partially I know cuz im bad) and i actually got demoted from B3 to B4.\n\nWin streaks often enough end up into a massive loss streak because, in all sense, you jump massively ahead in MMR. However, instead of looking at it negatively, you need to look at the positive: you had a killer win streak going.\n\nThere are a few things that you can do to offset the losing streak, each of them differs for each person and may not be for you.\n\n1) You can go and unwind on another game\n2) You can play another game, hoping for a win\n3) You can go and play some normal games\n4) You can call it a night\n\nI do not recommend playing ranked if you have lost three or more games in a row.\n\n> I never tilt in games or anything but I don't really think that helps if (but still I never tilt, its never gonna help to tilt XD)\n\nCute, but you do get tilted. Everyone tilts.\n\n> I main usually jungle, ADC and top\n\nWow, a low elo player that can play more than one role. Nice. However, I suggest picking one and ‘maining’ it and using the others as backups. Remember, you could always just play an AP mage as a support and carry that way, if you so desire.\n\n> I want to learn things like how to properly farm and CS\n\nOkay. I want you to make a custom game and pick any champ from any role, one you want to improve on (not a support) and get into a game with no one but you. Do not add bots. I then want you to go to your lane and practice last hitting. Your bare minimum goal is 60 CS before 10 minutes. There is no excuse for being any lower than that. I want you to do this until you can hit 80 CS with ease.\n\nWhen you achieve this, exit and re-do this, but with a beginner bot added. If you are playing a top champion, add a bot you would see in top lane, et cetera. Try and keep the ranges fair, so no ranged into melee. Now, I want you to hit 80cs while trading with this bot. Do not go for kills, just poke him out of lane while farming.\n\nWhen you can hit 80 CS like this, up the bot to intermediate.\n\nAlso, watch this video: https://youtu.be/zd0boZQkyuo\n\nAlso, quit playing Sona. She is a subpar support that has zero carry potential. In bronze, you can only rely on yourself to win games. Hitting that five-man stun means nothing if your team has no idea what they are doing.\n\nI suggest buying Annie and using her until you reach gold. She has easy farming, great zone and trading, and an all-in that beats most other midlaners. She can also go top and be played support.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-18T02:41:45.643+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there is much wrong with sona as a support. With the right build and playstyle she can carry the crap out of most games, but I do think despite appearing 'easy', she's higher skill base than other options like Leona, Soraka or Karma, since management of her passive, spellthiefs and auto procs as poke is critical to making her work in laning phase, and so alot of knowledge on minion wave control, trading and positioning is needed to make best use of her.\n\nAnnie support is actually alot worse than it sounds, since her base damages have been peeling back over seasons, she's quite squishy, and her target access is bad, so if her tanks aren't willing to engage (or there is a sheer lack of them on her team) she has trouble pressing a lead. So as supports go, she is very reliant on getting a lead in lane.\n\nSomething I'd suggest instead is Fiddlesticks support, with aftershock, max q into e, it's alot easier to play, your role is primarily disengage and poke, but thanks to aftershock resistances it's alot more forgiving if you get caught out. Fiddlesticks support with aftershock has been nerfed, and your lategame is inferior compared to other AP support options. However your ability to carry teamfights and make plays with a lead is significantly higher, and the earlygame is still extremely strong. Earlygame it's about getting some magic pen, so finish your support item, then getting sorc boots and oblivion orb, finish your Morrellos, pick up stopwatch, get a rylias for catch potential earlymidgame, build zhonias for survival in latemidgameand then liandries if you haven't managed to end already for a bit more teamfight impact in the lategame.\n\nFiddlesticks support is extremely good in low elo at ending games pre-40min. Just remember to go aftershock and not try taking him into another role because Riot has screwed fiddle up so bad, he is now very bad outside of the support role.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-18T04:15:14.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I don't think there is much wrong with sona as a support.\n\nI agree, but I was remarking about OP, not the champion in general. Sona is quite strong in the game right now and has the ability to beat most other supports. She is outclassed by Blitzcrank right now, purely due to the fact that if he lands a pull, she is dead. However, Nami, Brand, Morgana, Lux, and Zyra are all far better choices.\n\n> she's higher skill base than other options like Leona, Soraka or Karma, since management of her passive, spellthiefs and auto procs as poke is critical to making her work in laning phase, and so alot of knowledge on minion wave control, trading and positioning is needed to make best use of her.\n\nNo. All of that applies to other champions, too. Sona is legit spam spells until her passive is up then poke an enemy with her Q + auto.\n\nOP can barely play Sona and you want him to play Fiddle? Jesus man.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-18T08:00:35.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sona needs to auto attack to get decent poke and her only hard cc is her ult (which she should basically only be using as peel), whereas fiddles uses e bounces for range, and if things get hairy, he can use q to disengage the enemy adc or jungler, and can retreat back, he doesn't need to auto attack, and if he decides to, he can e-auto-q-auto-auto-retreat, and get a decent amount of poke off. FIddle jungle is complicated, fiddle support is much easier. Also soraka often needs to build situationally, and move alot in a teamfight, fiddle just needs to get a nice disruptive start to the fight, zhonias and wait for it to boil over.\n\nMy favourite suggestion for a low elo support though is definitely e-max offtank soraka. Take q lvl1, e lvl2, w lvl3. You use q to zone the enemy out of cs, and when it looks like they're going to move up to engage, throw out e and retreat. Don't spam w, only use it to try to equalise your HP with your adc if they look like they're getting a bit low, and you have hp to spare.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2019-03-19T02:14:34.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brokenscripts covered some pretty good points. Looking at your match history, it would look as though jungle is going to be your best role to learn. \n\n[This series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeGtVfZD9LVttCJzjIJLY1g) is a little old but still has all the basics that so many people lack in lower elo.

Use lockscreen, because this is a guide of getting out of bronze, not getting out of gold.\n\nIf you want to climb past gold, learning to rapidly unlock/relock your screen, by flicking between f2, f3, f4, f5 to centre the screen on your teamates is 99999% more valuable than struggling to quickly fix your window in the middle of a teamfight and thinking that you've mastered map awareness, when in actual fact you're still only focusing on your champion.\n\nFlicking your screen to a teammate with these keys takes less than a tenth of a second, strafing your screen to another lane takes about 2s, this method is easier and faster. If you watch high elo Korean/Chinese players, they don't use unlocked screen, they use the f1-5 keys and 'toggle lock' their screens and click the minimap in the very few cases when they have to look at something that doesn't involve a teammate.\n\nBut once again, there are more important things to work on in Bronze. Correct itemisation, basics of minion waves and positioning, basic shotcalling, not dying 10+ times.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"What The Seph","date":"2019-03-18T05:03:00.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just going to say it as it is, it's going to be harsh.\n- Over the past month of games you've bought a pink ward in only one of your matches, and you've switched your trinket in two of your matches despite playing support/ADC and jungle\n- You consistently have one of if not the lowest amount of wards placed on your team, this is especially unacceptable when you're playing **support**\n- Your runes don't match the champions you're playing. For example, you've run electrocute on Xayah which doesn't make a lot of sense. Glacial Augment on Sona isn't the best thing you need on her, you also don't need Second Wind as much as you need Bone Plating when you're trading, which shows a stylistic error in game play if you're finding Second Wind being more effective than Bone Plating. Look up on OPGG for top players on champions or probuilds.net for cookie cutter builds, they will almost always be better than whatever you can come up with on your own\n- You die way too much. Fewer than 5 of your games you've got a total death count that's less than half your kills. By dying repeatedly you give the enemy a ton of gold which makes the rest of your team's job harder, even if you get +300g. It's much better to be 3/0 instead of 13/10\n- Lastly you play way too many roles and champions. You won't get better if you keep hopping between them. Stick to a solo lane and build your mechancis because that's the foundation to everything else. Learning big brain rotations, role responsibilities and general map awareness comes with time but these are picked up faster than mechanical ability. Stick to top/mid on one champion. It'll be a bit boring but if you want to improve that's where it's at. Grind out Annie mid.\n\nGood luck out there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-03-17T10:01:44.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"focus on not dying, and doing 2 things right per game at most.\n\nTop? don't die, have more cs than opponent, perma push (footnote1).\nMid? don't die, cs and shove to visit bot when you have ult/flash.\nJG? don't die, learn your standard camp rotation (footnote2) and ignore/mute chat.\nADC? don't die, cs (footnote3) and attack whoever is closest to you whilst staying out of melee/spells.\nSUP? pick only obviously good engages and get your adc to stay mid with you lategame.\n\nfootnote1: if you start losing 1v1s post 15min in toplane, just group.\n\nfootnote2: the standard rotation is infallible below high gold/low plat, learn to kite your camps, do standard ganks, the standard rotation is your bible, and is still viable at high elo.\n\nfootnote3: Csing is a hell of alot easier if you build the ad part of your build before the atkspeed part.
