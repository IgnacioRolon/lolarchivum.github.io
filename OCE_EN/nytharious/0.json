Riot should have finished the new client and THEN released it instead of making them both rubbish.\n\nThe old client didn't become this optimised as we know it overnight, patches used to be able to crash servers and destroy clients, which massive incidences alone had happened like twice back in those days if I remember correctly, and server used to go down on scheduled weekly (or fortnightly, forgot) maintenance as well and release small patches for clients afterwards. It was due to continuous work over a very long period of time to finally get the Legacy Client running smooth even on toasters, being able to update on-live, and having all sorts of features that wasn't there originally, as well as being mostly bug-free.\n\nIt takes time and resources, I don't see them releasing beta client being anything wrong. In fact, it's wrong to release full product without any extended public testing first, because that never works well.","replies":[{"poster":"Xenoblade","date":"2016-12-19T20:04:55.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can release the new client for testing WITHOUT neglecting the old one.
