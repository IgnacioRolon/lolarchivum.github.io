League of Legends players are so precious, and by the end of it i&#039;m sure most people had gotten used to it (that were complaining about dynamic queue before). All it does is divide the playerbase into two types of people - people that play with their friends and people that want to &quot;solo&quot; carry. I dont understand the need for a solo queue at all, seeing as this is a team game and pretty much every team orientated game apart from league has a queue where you can queue up any amount of people. Encouraging solo queues encourage a solo mentality. What is a solo mentality? I think it may be the reason that the community has the reputation for being (for want of a better word) toxic. It&#039;s this whole mentality that in solo queue, its you and exclusively you and your skills that determine what rank you are. While this may be true to some extent, your impact on the game overall is how well you will use your skills to gel with your team and bring together a team effort. You might get fed, but how is your team going to use the advantage you give to your team to win? And if you&#039;re on the other team, they have to work together to work around a strong opponent. Its the whole concept of solo queuing and solo &quot;climbing&quot; that breeds self-centredness and a feeling of superiority over other players. It could possibly be why people rage so hard and blame their jungler for not camping their lane, blaming their team for not helping them. Sound familiar to you? It&#039;s because the game encourages it. It encourages them to have a solo mentality. At it&#039;s core a team-based game should be about working together as a team. And I love this game when that&#039;s what it&#039;s about, and thats what dynamic queue allowed us to have. Not just ranked 5&#039;s , but any amount of people where you can bring a certain amount of cohesiveness and camaraderie to the team that is at times infectious towards a team, where you feel connected to the people you play with and that encourages people to recognise that another player represents a person that is part of the team that you are playing in. I&#039;m ranting, but these are my thoughts on what solo mentality breeds.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-25T09:25:28.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Riot has the right idea with dynamic/flex queue, however their execution wasn't the best. Their matchmaking mess up at the beginning of preseason isn't really helping their cause either, with many players feeling betrayed and confused. \n\n**In terms of the competitive environment, Lord Sesshomaru has it summed up pretty well:**\n\n > Look at the pro teams like SKT, they don't just pick the 5 best players and shove them all on a team and tell them to bring home the cup.\n\nExactly this. I know a lot of players in the top rankings of challenger that are LFT but will likely never get picked up. All because they can't work in a team + lack the ability to communicate. They may be some of the best players on the server mechanically, and have multiple accounts in chall, but if you can't work as a team, you are basically screwed. \n\nIf you automatically are able to/have worked on being able to work as a team, you are able to start playing at a competitive level a whole world above what \"soloq elitists\" are. You will know your teammates well enough to be able to accentuate their strengths and negate their weaknesses. You can plan team comps and look strategically at bans instead of the typical \"well if the enemy gets vayne its gg so lets ban\". \n\nI love being able to rely on my team to know how I play. Like Lord Sess, I play with people that I know well enough to predict their movements, their aggro and when they will back off, making it easier to plan around this. They know how I play, and won't flame me if something doesn't go their way. It's quite comforting actually, and as a result I naturally perform better. \n\nOne other thing that I have noticed from flex queue (now that we have weeded out the soloq elitists) is that people that play in dynamic groups tend to be a lot more positive and open with communication. It seems to me that even though some (like myself) lack mechanics, they have better game knowledge (or at least communicate it better with their team), making things a lot smoother and more fun. I have found this while playing 5man, as well as playing flex as a duo being placed in a team with a 3man. Even last night in norms, I was constantly put as the odd-one out in 4man teams and they were (generally) all pretty encouraging and nice even though I was doing pretty badly. _Of course, this is just a generalisation and may not be the norm for all levels of play._\n\n**What I don't get is people saying things like:**\n\n> But Ranked is suppose to gauge how good you are at the game and therefore many people like and want solo queue as it shows your rank not the rank you got by 4 man queueing the whole season. I much prefer solo queue as I will play normals if i want to muck around with friends.\n\nLike everybody is stating, League is a 5man team game. When entering the Rift, you are going to be placed with 4 other people regardless of if you know them or don't.\nIs it not better to set your goal (e.g mine is diamond 3 by end of next season) and control all variables that might get in your way? To rid your game of the int feeders/rage quitters/baddies? \n\nHow is it different winning as a 5man with your 4 buddies or winning as a 5man with soloq players? In either queue, it is possible for you to stick back and be carried up the ranks.\n\nFlex and solo q are both meant to be ranked competitive environments, to show off your skills and improve. Your rank in both queues is a reflection of your skill. Some of it raw mechanics and game knowledge, but the biggest hunk of it is being able to work in a team. For ages, Riot has been transitioning the game to be more objective oriented (hello RH, different dragons and first tower gold) so that you have to work in a team to get ahead. It's way harder now than it was back in season 4 to solo carry a game. Something that results in players with the soloq mentality to fall into the \"blame game\".\n\n\n\n##TL;DR the[ solo queue mentality needs to die](http://splitpush.net/articles/lol/opinion/one-man-army-solo-queue-needs-die/) in order to breed better players.\n\nOne last thing, Lord Sess is also right about the number of \"QQ matchmaking\" posts. \n\nMajority of these are coming from soloq players that are in games with people that are having bad games **or** don't fit the meta (had someone complain about a malph support main) **or** have different ideas how to win a game.\n In almost all of the cases I look into _(apart from the ones that are like 4am mixed af matchmaking on our tiny server)_ the matchmaking is fine. Its mainly just that people are so uppity about meta and are stuck in their own ways that they can't co-operate. That they get so frustrated when someone doesn't play who or how they want them to or that they lack the skills to be able to co-ordinate a team to play from behind in the case of someone having a bad game. \n\n Players are so stuck in their own ways and so against dynamic/flex queues on the pretense that \"if you climb that way you are a boosted animal and don't deserve your rank\" that they just keep complaining over and over again while getting lapped by those taking things into their own hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-24T23:15:32.552+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, i think Dynamic Queue was a far better option than having both Solo Queue and Flex Queue.\n\nRanked is a joke now, they change the way you advance every year (sometimes even halfway through the year) \nand now its gotten to the point where it means absolutely nothing.\n\nPeople who get gold in solo Queue, have no idea weather they got better or worse than last year when they played dynamic queue, and no one even knows wtf Flex Queue is.
