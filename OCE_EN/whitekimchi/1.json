Even shit like gg spamming when we are ahead. I know there is mute but not everyone will do it and whole team ends up getting tilted.\r\n\r\nShit like that makes me wanna stop playing just wanna know if there is anything else to do.\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-01-13T12:37:31.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, a single report is enough to trigger a review. The validity of that report (or reports, if there are multiple) is then determined and punishment(s) dished out accordingly. As long as you are reporting these kinds of players that you encounter, the system should be able to work on those individuals.\n\nAlthough, if you feel like your report in the post-game isn't enough you do have the option of submitting a ticket to [support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) with any evidence (screenshots/videos, for example) you may have.","replies":[]}]}
