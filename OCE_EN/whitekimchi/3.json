In game they had the right stats but in champ select it only showed about half the rune bonuses and still had the old page name.\r\nSomeone dodged the first game so I checked it was all saved properly and it was but still happened again in the next lobby (and still hasn&#039;t updated now in the next game).","replies":[]}
