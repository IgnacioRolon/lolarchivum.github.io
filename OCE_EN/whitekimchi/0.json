Will 3 epic shards produce a better result (or increased chance) or does it make no difference?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-07T01:17:11.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"as of now, no they don't. The Gems shown on the shards are just to inform you that these are \"rare\" skins.\n\nthe only thing that happens if you reroll a \"good\" skin and get crap is: \"Essence will also be awarded if the resulting content is worth less than what was used to reroll.\"","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2016-04-07T01:42:45.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, thanks for clearing that up","replies":[]}]}]}
