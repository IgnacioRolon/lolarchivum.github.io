I main Zed and also thinking of playing Kayn as well. My friends call me &#039;trash&#039; and &#039;hard stuck silver noob&#039; and it gets pretty annoying. I want to show them I can climb but it&#039;s not working is it?\r\n\r\nAny tips?

By killing people yeah, and they're good at it too, but if you're real behind, you're not gonna be doing much to help the team, which means any game you do bad, you're putting your team at a disadvantage as well.\n\nConsider a champion like Zyra or Lux for example. They both still have high kill potential, but what if you're behind and have no damage? Zyra has an AoE knockup, a. AoE snare and a continuous slow. Lux has a two person snare, an AoE slow and an AoE shield.\n\nMaybe mage mids aren't really your pace, but consider your value to the team in all scenarios. If you can offer something significant to your team even when you're stupid behind, you're going to have a huge advantage over the person that can't. Zed has a slow, and that's it, so if you're playing Zed, you'd want to be pretty damn sure you'll go at least even in the matchup. Kayn has some decent CC, but mostly if you go Darkin rather than SA.\n\nBasically, if you find you aren't climbing with Zed and Kayn, whether it's because you've hit your skill cap with them for now or because you're too unreliable with them, then consider expanding your champ roster. If nothing else, playing other champions in some depth gives you a much better idea of how to verse them and would improve your knowledge overall, even if you don't find a champ you like. I smashed Vel in supp when he came out, and when everyone else was still struggling to play against him, I knew where he was going to be and what he was going to be doing. This is especially true in Silver and below because complete champion knowledge is lacking on a lot of players there (higher pop of new(er) players).\n\nAlso all of what Heff said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hounorsboy","date":"2018-01-13T01:28:57.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play annie{{champion:1}} {{champion:1}} {{champion:1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maoi","date":"2018-01-12T13:33:49.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would advise against playing assassins in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Heff","date":"2018-01-12T12:26:16.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"play champs u enjoy playing, think before you do, don't try to 1v9  carry the game, work with your team, if you lose think about what you did wrong and how you can fix it, don't flame your team mates they will just play worse and flame you back, try not to get as frustrated while playing, if you are losing like 3-5 games in a row take a break, look at your minimap between farming so like every couple seconds or so, try to cs/farm better, be confident when playing know how you are going to get that kill or take that dragon before you do it, try ward more to keep track of their jungler so you know when u can play aggressive and when to play safe, look up builds and runes, be friendly, try to improve after every game, look at the replays of your games so you can see what you did wrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you have anymore questions add me IGN: Heff","replies":[]}]}
