There no way to \"quantify\" Honour level progress, probably because of all the crazy algorithms used to determine when a player levels up, and you don't even need to be Honoured to gain progress. As for a given number of matches, it's probably more about consistency, with a certain number of matches in a given day/week putting in progress.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-08-01T06:52:30.635+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=vnw5re5V,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2017-07-30T08:57:43.269+0000)\n>\n> This is fairly accurate.

I don't get honors every game I play and have only been honored by multiple players on a few occasions. \n\nI have been playing the game for quite a while over 1500 normal matches and only need 14 more champions to complete the set. , I don't play ranked anymore as I'm stuck in low elo and not good enough to carry games. \n\nI do however watch the OPL and other pro games and get tips from there, which I will happily pass on to team mates. I never insult people for bad play and will try to give positive feedback if I see something that could be done better. \n\nI just try to do all the right things in the game, ward, not over extend, watch the mini map, ping areas of the map to warn players of potential danger or for help with an objective, try to cs as best I can, and wait for an advantage before going in for the kill and focus more on objectives than getting kills. \n\nI also write on these boards regularly, have liked the AMA thread as I get to ask teams questions about the game. At one stage I was running my own 1v1 tournament. I go in the tipping competition.\n\nI also play with random players, not with a group of friends to boost my honor rating (I think this is important and gives more value when you do get honored from a game and is why I made it to level 3)","replies":[{"poster":"Montagê","date":"2017-07-30T01:16:39.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, \n\nThanks for replying me. My English is poor but i will try my best:) Your info are very valuable to me. Most of the time i play with my friends and i realize now i have to play with random players too and be a good team player for them.\n\nBut, i'm not clear on the fact of getting key fragments. They say players can get key fragments even they not get honored every match. But, i'm not getting any even if i got honored.  \n\nThanks again for the comments which is very valuable to me. I really appreciate it mate :)","replies":[]}]}]}
