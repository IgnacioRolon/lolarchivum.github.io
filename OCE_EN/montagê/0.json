As you have instructed, I have done these\n\n1. Switched to a public DNS (Google)\n2. Run winMTR to the above ip you mentioned for 10 minutes.(results are attached below)\n\nBut I couldn't Run the ICSI netalyzr, because It asks to update and enable java on firefox and I don't know how to do that. Right now, as a temporary remedy i'm using WTFast software as a vpn. And it reduces that high ping (500-550) into around 200-250.\n\nthe link is below.\nhttp://pastebin.com/X0VNBYEW","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-15T02:49:36.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWas WTFast running at the time of your WinMTR test? could you please disable that and rerun the test for me.\n\nIf WTFast was not running, then there are some serious issues with your connection.\n\n* What ISP are you with?\n* Are you connecting via a wired or wireless connection type?\n* How far is your system from your router?\n* Have you contacted your ISP regarding these issues?","replies":[{"poster":"Montagê","date":"2017-01-17T00:02:06.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nWTFast was not running at the time of WinMTR test. I'm using Sri Lanka Telecom Broadband connection. I'm connecting via Wifi connection. The router is in like 10 feet away from my room. I haven't contacted my ISP about this matter but I've heard that other users on Oceania server who use Sri Lanka Telecom connection,  are facing the same issue at the moment. \n\nThere is a fact that I didn't mention above. This issue is only happening in Oceania server. I have another profile on EUW server, and there the ping is around 170-180 and it is really good. I was playing on that ping in Oceania server earlier before the new 7.1 update released. With the new update, this issue began.\n\nI would be very grateful if you could recommend me some Software like WTFast, because sometimes WTFast does not work properly. Sometimes Even though it shows lower ping,  there is some lagging in game.\n\nAnd thank you for replying me again, I really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-17T09:15:41.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there dude,\n\nJudging from that MTR i had you run, there seems to be massive packet loss all the way along the route your computer is taking to the league server, I would recommend contacting your ISP about this issue.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
