I was just in a game where two players admitted they were going to int prior to the game starting, and then proceeded to do so within the game. How tf is it possible for toxic players like this to be allowed to continue playing the game, its ridiculous. If anyone can inform on how I can more effectively submit a report for these ***** it would be appreciated. I have screenshots showing they were going to int, and surely the gameplay would provide adequate evidence to them feeding intentionally. Thanks, and **** those *****","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-20T04:26:00.814+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's biggest flaw is that it's slow. For obvious intentional feeders (running it down mid) it's quite quick, usually banning within a few games, but for anything sneakier it's much more cautious. It's tuned way down to avoid banning people for just being bad basically, though I think we can all agree it should be much faster than it is.\n\nAs for the particular players in question, you can submit your report in a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new BUT, be aware that support cannot and will not give you any information about another player's account, for privacy reasons and a whole host of others.\n\nYou will more than likely get a generic \"thanks for reporting this behaviour, continue to use post game reporting wherever possible\" type response, but support will manually audit the case.","replies":[{"poster":"MyLittIePwny","date":"2018-10-20T05:39:37.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was extremely helpful, thank you very much :)","replies":[]}]}]}
