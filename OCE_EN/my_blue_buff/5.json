Everyone who is experiencing the problem that I know of is playing on an Apple computer. Thought I could bring this to the attention of someone if it has not already been done.\r\n\r\nThis is not due to our system specs, as before patch 6.5 everything was fine and worked smoothly. Are there many other people finding this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Sasataf","date":"2016-04-11T16:48:12.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens to me as well.
