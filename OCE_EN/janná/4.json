The awful bloodshed was completely and utterly over. Janna could still hear her summoner muttering through voice communication; could feel that elevated sensation of being freed from another night of games. She&rsquo;d always hated the fact she&rsquo;d participated in killing people she knew, over and over again for the sake of entertainment. It was tough work, and seeing the depressing blood-red sign that signaled another moment of her life wasted didn&rsquo;t help. But hey, she&rsquo;d signed up to right the wrong in this world, and even if the Field of Justice had shifted from a tiny community of Summoners to millions, Janna knew she was in the right place. The competition fueled her to keep her affinity with wind, allowing her to hone in on aspects of the element she never knew was even there. The place had grown on her, just as Runterra in general, had. After all, being born an orphan in The Slums of Zaun, she was as appreciative of the attention she received in League as any other, if not more. It was home after all. \r\nAs her summoner exited the game, Janna let the darkness fall over her, allowing the silence to wash her away until she was perched lightly on her bed, feet grazing the ground. From the corner of her eye, she saw her Match History board glitter and glow, before the receding burst of light revealed the disappointing result of her match.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Damn it. Zero deaths and more wards placed than the entire enemy team combined and we *still* lose. *Ugh*.&rdquo; She bit down to prevent herself from expressing further &ldquo;salt&rdquo; as the summoner&rsquo;s always seemed to say as she stepped away from her bed and towards her table, where a bouquet of Japanese Windflowers lay, their petals gently fluttering as she picked them up, placing them in her arms as she read the slim card that accompanied them.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I alone decide my fate, and my fate tonight is you. Love, Yasuo.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nWhite and poppy-like, they&rsquo;d both likened to the perennial after their first date, and quickly became accustomed to each other repeatedly sending them as signs of love. These flowers only meant one thing&mdash;that Yasuo was going to be there tonight, after disappearing for a month during his brother&rsquo;s death&rsquo;s anniversary. He&#039;d been so distraught when he&#039;d left, and Janna could do nothing but watch. He&#039;d seemed...so lost. \r\n\r\n&#039;It&#039;s fine,&#039; she thought, &#039;he&#039;ll be here tonight.&#039; Although she had known that it was Server maintenance tonight, and that the annual Pool Party was being held, she&rsquo;d been somewhat unsure of whether or not to go, but this confirmed it. Beaming, Janna placed them down and prepared to leave.\r\n\r\nOnly, as she stood in front of her wardrobe following a quick shower, she couldn&rsquo;t decide what to wear. \r\nThough she received daily compliments on her slightly mystical, almost elven like figure, she couldn&rsquo;t help but be self-conscious of her body. Her hair never seemed to lie flat, and her ears always pointed upwards. It&rsquo;s also not like she didn&rsquo;t have anything to wear&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t like she was Annie either, with her plethora of adorable, little costumes. Janna grimaced, grabbed her Tempest skin and decided to just run with it, allowing her pony tail to fly loose and adjusted the bright blue headdress until she felt like it framed her face well and, taking a deep breath, floated downstairs and faced the music. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Miss Crownguard? What drink shall I serve you today?&rdquo; Taric&rsquo;s teasing voice reached her first, and she gratefully stepped towards him, gradually relaxing at the sight of her good friends as they bathed in the warmth of the sun, near the pool where the Yordles played. As they splashed one another, innocent giggles filled the air and sticky, ice-cream covered fingers reached for each another. In the distance, she heard the birds chirp, and the soft sea waves that rolled to and fro. The tangy breeze swirled around her and she softened at its familiarity. After months of the same, mundane view of Summoner&rsquo;s Rift, it was days like this that she lived for.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey, Taric! Didn&rsquo;t know you had Pool Party wear? Them abs though, how ridiculously *fancy*!&rdquo; She grinned, taking her seat next to Lux, who quickly placed a tall glass of freshly-squeezed juice in her hand. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Neither did I, my dear. And I know right? I mean, damn, did the Riot do a truly outrageous job on this!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well! I think you looks simply *dashing*! Get it? Dashing? Hah!&rdquo; Ezreal&rsquo;s mock English accent made his mischievous tone even better, and Janna lent back, taking in the view of Taric and Ezreal teasing each other before they dissolved into laughter. They adamantly refused that anything was going on, but both Lux and Janna knew better&mdash;those two were so utterly in love with each other, but neither of them cared to admit it even though one was sitting in the other&rsquo;s lap and quite suggestively leading the other on. \r\n\r\nWith a silent groan, Lux leaned her head on Janna&rsquo;s shoulder, subconsciously trying to hide herself behind her in what was a usually friendly gesture. Only in this instance, Lux&rsquo;s body was tight with worry and concern, and she appeared to be burrowing herself into the girl next to her, somewhat akin to Rek Sai and her burrows. Lux had chosen to wear her Star Guardian skin, and with its fluoro pinks and purples and, in addition to just her natural glow, it was hard not to attract some sort of negative attention. Just like this time, Janna noticed just as she&rsquo;d turned towards Lux, because she saw Fiora sauntering their way. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well well well. Naw, lil&rsquo; baby Lux doesn&rsquo;t have anything to wear to a pool party?&rdquo; Fiora tutted as she glared condescendingly down at the pair of them, her grin mockingly arched. Janna desperately looked around for either Ezreal or Taric for assistance, only to be dismayed at the sight of their backs as they returned to their rooms, leaving a trail of squealing fangirls. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fiora, get out of here. It&rsquo;s not like your swimwear does you any good, with *your* figure. Besides, lots of people don&rsquo;t have things to wear to party&rsquo;s like these.&rdquo; Janna shifted angrily, placing a protective hand over Lux, who had somehow managed to shrivel up even further. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Naw, little lux needs a friend to stand up for her? Care to see who deserves to insult the other like that on the Field? I&rsquo;d run you so far deep into the ground that you&rsquo;d never see the light of day again, Janna.&rdquo; There was a dangerous glint to her eyes as she challenged her, for after all, she was the Grand Duellist.\r\n\r\nThey both leaned shakily away, suddenly unsure on what to say next. Although Janna had confidence in herself, she knew better than to straight out duel Fiora, and was about to mumble an apology when faint harmonica music prickled her ears, and a breath of friendly wind trickled around them all.  It empowered Janna whilst simultaneously striking a sliver of fear into Fiora&rsquo;s heart. She knew instantly that it wasn&rsquo;t Riven nor Janna&mdash;and that would only leave one possibility.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now, my dears, there&rsquo;s no need to have an argument over an innocent girly now is there? It&rsquo;s the Annual Pool Party, please, sit down and have a drink. Fiora, sweetcheeks, please step away from my girlfriend. She gets a little, well let&rsquo;s call it *aggravated* when you&rsquo;re around.&rdquo; Yasuo peered out from behind the Lifeguard&rsquo;s Chair, nonchalantly sipping a large jar of what appeared to be alcohol. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wait&hellip;.wait, *y-you&rsquo;re* the one dating Janna? Yasuo? Riven&rsquo;s told me all about you&hellip;I&hellip;&rdquo; Fiora swallowed dryly, abruptly aware of the attention she&rsquo;d drawn to herself through her challenge, for a large gathering had now collected. She could already read the disapproval on her peer&rsquo;s faces and she reluctantly drew away, blushing as she pushed away into the crowd. \r\n\r\nLux let out an appreciative sigh as she pushed her friend towards Yasuo, urging her to go whilst she sat back down. She might be the Lady of Luminosity, but she&rsquo;d never seen light as bright as theirs when they were together, and it was always a pleasant sight.\r\n\r\nJanna let out a short laugh, before settling into the arms of Yasuo, feeling the wind bless them as they hugged, pressing her face to his rough neck as they embraced for the first time in what had seemed in like an eternity.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Just another ordinary day here in Runterra, aint it lass?&rdquo; Yasuo softly whispered, fingers gently caressing her cheeks. He&rsquo;d missed her so dearly, for she made him forget the pain of losing himself, of losing Yone, his brother. He felt whole again around her, and it was something he never wanted to lose&mdash;for he&rsquo;d been wandering and looking for something. And he&rsquo;d finally found it in her.\r\n\r\n_Home._","replies":[]}
