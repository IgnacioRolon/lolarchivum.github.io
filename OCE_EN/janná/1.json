I know it&#039;s not a big deal to most people (especially those who never regret what they purchase in which case, lucky ;-;) but I wasted my three points back in Season 2 when I had no idea how this game worked! It&#039;d be amazing if summoners could some how earn one or two a season? What does everyone else think? :)","replies":[]}
