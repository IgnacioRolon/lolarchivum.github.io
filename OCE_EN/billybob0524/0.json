If we managed to look at the statistics and see how much yasuo is played by players around the world, we can deduct that he is one of the most played champions out there, his kit is just so amazing and versatile, a new yasuo skin would definitely get most people forking out money at the checkout for an RP card without the smallest ounce of reluctance. {{summoner:6}} Me OMW to Woolworth&#039;s to grab an RP Card.\r\n* Sushi Chef Yasuo, I mean come on, who doesn&#039;t wanna see him prance around with that funny little hat and some ingredients hanging at his belt. His recall could be him taking out a smaller knife and crafting a piece of sushi, it would actually be sick.\r\n* Arcade Yasuo, enough said, this skin would definitely sell and there are just so many concepts that can be explored. Although this may be similar to the project line, it has many possibilities that the development team can look at.\r\n* And last but not least, this is the skin i think could even be legendary... SAMURAI YASUO, just imagine him in that armor. He should have a ribbon tied to his sword that is bright red so it contrasts with his jet black armor, and when he recalls, he spins around really fast so the ribbon envelops him, then he stops and bows on his knees, pushing his sword into the soil and places his hands upon them.\r\nAnyway, those were just some ideas I came up with on the spot. But the main point i wanna express is the huge percentage of league players who would appreciate and purchase a skin for one of the most played, coolest and bad-ass champions in the whole of League of Legends, Yasuo.\r\nThanks,\r\n&quot;A Dirty Yasuo Main&quot;","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-09T04:00:39.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flatulent yasuo or poosuo\n\n*Poot* sagi!\"\n\nFace my wind! *parp*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-09T00:04:32.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as i cant stand Yasuo, (even though i used to be a main) \n\nI do agree he needs a really good new skin. \n\nPROJECT: Is his only good skin.\nHigh noon is okay, but the colours are contradicting and muddy.\nAnd Bloodmoon is just crap, _\"Lets make a skin for the most popular champ... and change nothing except making it bright red all over... perfect!\"_\n\nIm saying this, not becasue i want Yasuo to have a good skin.\nBut becasue i want Yasuo to look good, us non-yasuo players have to deal with 2 of them in every game... they could at very least not all look bright red..\n\nI think an 'honourable' Yasuo would be a neat skin, set in a world where he didn't abandon the guy he was supposed to protect and became a hero.\nHe'd have a mantle of decorum, and fancy armour like Ionian Master Yi. \n\nOr 'Rugged' Yasuo, and have him in the same style as the Garen skin of the same name (but with a Japanese twist of course)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-08T13:11:22.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I used to play a lot of Yasuo and PROJECT is such a good skin in my opinion.  I like your Arcade Yasuo idea, that could be cool.\n\nTo be honest every champion would look cool with an arcade skin though.","replies":[]}]}
