If you play during Oceania peak hours (which I'd guestimate at 2pm to 11pm), you should have queue times between the 0-5 minute mark, on average.","replies":[{"poster":"LordOwen77","date":"2016-07-20T09:34:52.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to reply!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-07-20T09:36:42.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/fm5JqspHFgIXm/giphy.gif","replies":[]}]}]}]}
