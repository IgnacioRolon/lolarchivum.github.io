Most of you might think &quot;but she just got Star Gaurdian Lux&quot;, well it&#039;s been like a year since it was released. \r\nBut i mean think about it. Popstar Lux. \r\nThe skin model can be similar to ahri&#039;s, but maybe a different colour because Lux already has a pink skin. Her wand can be a microphone or something like that. And you know when she yells when she ults?, she could do a high note or something. \r\nIdk tbh just think Popstar Lux would be an amazing skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-07-31T23:35:47.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I'm looking forward to french maid urgot more but yeah that sounds like a good skin idea. You could probably also have Popstar Janna and Ezreal since both of them have flashy ults and that showoff personality. Janna's ult could turn into like a sparkly popstar stage and Ezreal could be like a male popstar since he kinda looks like one and already has sparkles.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zumbo Prime","date":"2016-08-02T22:25:19.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely not a fan of the Star Guardian Lux, yours is much better.\n\nStill waiting on that PROJECT Lux.","replies":[]}]}
