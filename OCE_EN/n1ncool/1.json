Here is an idea by me:\nCheerleader Lux:\nModel - Lux can wear a crop top with a short skirt with sneakers. (what a regular cheerleader would wear).\n - she can hold pom poms.\n - Her hair can be untied and fairly long\nDance - She can do a dance routine while cheering for demacia.\nLaugh -  Same as default laugh.\nBack to base - She can be on a grandstand cheering and dancing.\n\nI honestly dont know how the abilities can be, but i guess her doing a back flip or something when she ults can be pretty cool.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-21T07:56:58.072+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why hold pom poms when she uses a wand?\nWouldn't a \"spirit stick\" be more appropriate.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Gun Show","date":"2015-02-21T10:01:46.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya its been a long time thou but they r trying to create a new skin for her\n{{champion:99}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-21T08:06:54.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the [void lux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CpLDUgbcoY) concept better.
