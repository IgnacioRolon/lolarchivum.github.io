This happens rarely happens but after doing the ult animation and dealing the damage when you hit the ground you get stuck. You can&#039;t move or aa for about .5 - .75 you can definately feel it and it&#039;s caused me to lose duels because of it. This also very rarely happens after doing the e+q combo. I dunno someone pl0x look into it {{champion:157}} It&#039;s definitely not something riot intended to do because it feels very inconsistent. It also doesn&#039;t happen every game so I am not sure it there are specific triggers for this bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-28T04:05:39.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it has been for ages, put several requests (along with other bugs they are yet to fix) to fix it in bug board, riot refuses.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-28T03:45:20.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check [over on this board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) (there are so many yasuo issues rn), and check if it has been described.
