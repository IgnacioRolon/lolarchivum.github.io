Nice one.\n\n- Many champions have true damage\n- Every champion can move through un-passable terrain with Flash, and even more with any dash/blink ability ({{champion:38}} can do it every 3 seconds)\n- Her teleport ult isn't instant, it's got some casting time, and she isn't the only one who has a global TP, plus it's conditional, she can ONLY teleport to tunnels\n- Xerath's Q totally has a slower \"projectile speed\" off\n- TARIC HAMMERS MELEE BOTH EARLY AND LATE (seriously though, {{champion:126}} hammers AND cannons through early and late but I ain't complaining)\n- Tryn gains HP from Fury...and crit m8\n- So many people have knock ups these days to make Yasuo's life easier...Rek's one has a tiny radius\n- All in one champion?

That's ok, because every new champion is a little weird playing against when no one has experience against him/her, but honestly you're just getting laughed at because you haven't taken the time to figure out how to counter him/her and you just blurted on the forums so-and-so is OP or not.\n\nJust work your head around Rek'Sai and stop complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"Sniff","date":"2014-12-28T14:42:50.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No, she is op, currently stands with the highest win rate in game.

Specifically what Strider said about the fact people take time to get used to new champs. It's been, what, 2-3 weeks since Rek'Sai was released? People are still getting used to Kalista (and arguably Azir) and you expect them to be used to Rek'Sai? Fact is people are still unaware of what best counters Rek'Sai and how to effectively play against Rek'Sai meaning, yes, she may have a higher win rate than a lot of other champs but that doesn't mean that she is OP.
