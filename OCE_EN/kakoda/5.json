Though this post is not so much about the ban but more about a comment from the riot support team!\n\nI told them I believed my account was compromised and hacked and this may have been why I was ban and this is there response!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nHello there,\n\nIf you strongly believe that your account was compromised, keep in mind that you are fully responsible for all activity made on your account, and if suspensions or bans are incurred we are not be able to modify them.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nSo the riot support team basically told me that it doesn&#039;t matter if I got hacked. They told me that it&#039;s my account my responsibility! Like come on.... are they actually serious here?\n\nHow can I be at fault if my account was hacked? How is that my fault and my responsibility? Sure there may be spy ware on my computer (thank God I don&#039;t do banking on it!) But how is someone else&#039;s actions my responsibility?\n\nIf your bank details are hacked or credit card details are hacked, they don&#039;t blame you they help you fix it and recover the stolen money.\n\nJust because it&#039;s a game shouldn&#039;t make a difference! My account was stolen and I was hacked. Instead of saying to bad your fault why not help me recover my account? \n\nThat being said I am sure I been hacked most my passwords have been changed and I&#039;ve been locked out of most of my games at the moment and in the process of recovering my accounts for multiple games at the moment.\n\nI&#039;m really disappointed at the comment from riots support team about this. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-02-27T01:52:35.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you suspect your account has been hacked your suppose to contact Riot Support.
