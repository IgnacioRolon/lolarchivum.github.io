I was informed it was due to the normal scripting hacking 3rd party shit and so on. Thing is I actually have never used any of that. I have been using my mobile for internet because I have no internet at the moment and haven&#039;t for about 6 months now. I got a lot off &quot;you have been logged in from another location&quot; I assumed this was due to using mobile data as an internet source.\r\n\r\nHonestly I have no idea what this ban is for, I am pretty sure I was not hacked I never noticed any games that I didn&#039;t play. Could it be possible that the lag from the mobile data is the issue here? I lag to like 3k ping at times and disconnect when receiving phone calls.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing would be like the error saying im logging in from another location all the time. Maybe they think it&#039;s something dodgy going on or something?\r\n\r\nIt is super frustrating because I put a stupid amount of money and time into this game. I would not risk my account for something so stupid. It took me 3 years to get to level 30..... I never want to go though that again lol. \r\n\r\nSuper frustrated here. I&#039;ve heard some people have been wrongly ban and had there accounts restored I&#039;m just hopping riot will take the time to look into this check over all my games i don&#039;t care I have nothing to hide you know... Like there all clean I really hope riot doesn&#039;t pass this off as ohhh prob another person crying and trying to lie.\r\n\r\nLike if i cheated or what ever used another program or something I wouldn&#039;t bother complaining like would be my fault yeah. Though this isn&#039;t cool I have legit done nothing super annoying.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-01T01:08:28.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a support ticket.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Luxium","date":"2017-03-01T00:52:18.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wat","replies":[]}]}
