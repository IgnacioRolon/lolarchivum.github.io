Hopefully someone from riot can help with this. I have looked around and have not been able to find a clear answer.\n\nBasically at the moment I am playing a lot of a game called &quot;Path of Exile&quot;. I recently learnt that you can use AutoHotKey in this game to check the stats of items and selling prices and so on. It is allowed in this game and the creators of the game encourage it actually. The issue is although I want to use this to make identifying items in this game easier, I am worried that just having AutoHotKey installed on my computer may cause a ban. \n\nMaybe just being installed, or maybe I forget to turn it off or something. I have no use for it in LoL, in fact I reformatted my PC and will not install LoL for this reason. Thing is I love playing LoL, but at the moment I&#039;m really into POE. Am I able to have AutoHotKey installed while LoL is installed on the PC? \n\nIs it able to be running while LoL is open?\n\nI feel like AutoHotKey is basically like having Razer Synapsis or something running. Then again I am not sure how Riot will see it? \n\nI mean it does not effect the game it doesn&#039;t read or change packets or any fancy shit like that. It is basically like the Macros you use on your gaming keyboard.\n\nSo guys do any of you use this program and play LoL? Have you had any issue?\n\nCan someone from Riot please comment on this?\n\nhttps://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro This is what I will be using.","replies":[{"poster":"combat","date":"2017-04-09T14:50:04.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't use it on LoL you will be fine.

I would have assumed so much, though they always word it in a way they you may get ban for it. He said \" It's technically a third party \" So technically its against there rules. Then again there rules say that gives you an advantage and well I would not be using it for LoL. I just worry there cheat detection will pick up a script (POE trade macro) running in the background or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-06T14:25:51.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ultimately it's a use at your own risk, but that's mostly just to stop people trying to play Riot and get away with bad stuff by skirting the lines. Realistically, if it isn't giving you an advatage in game, and doesn't contain anything packaged with it that would give you an advantage in game (and in the case of macros, one action for one press) then you won't be banned for it.\n\nBiggest thing is to keep an eye on any updates they make in case something changes to violate the rules, but that isn't really anywhere close to the purpose of the program so I doubt it will be an issue.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-06T03:29:24.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Autohot key wont get you banned unless you use it to macro such as lee ward jump or galio ew.\n\nUsed to use it for mundane things such as a quick login or to automatically locate a tab in the shop.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-04-06T13:06:03.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you had it running before while LoL was active and you were fine?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-06T13:22:45.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Been fine with it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
