BE WARNED!!!","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"https://imgur.com/a/YCI2HIp\n\nSo today I was in a game of league and some guy was being well let's just say he was trolling the game. Anyways after some time of trolling I was shocked to see he somehow from no information from me found my email and password. \n\nThe only information he had was my Summoner Name as obviously everyone in game has this information.\n\nFrom a Summoner name alone he was able to get not only my email but also my password to that email. \n\nI think it is safe to say RIOT you have an issue and this is not on! It is not acceptable to be harrased in game let alone have someone in game able to find your email adress and password, then give that information to the other 9 people in game. God knows what he could have done with this information and in face since then even though I was quick to change my password in the 10min or so that it took me after the game to change my passwords it was to late. The damage was done and fraudulant payments were made on my credit card.\n\nRoit this is a SERIOUS issue! \n\nYour player base is at risk this is not acceptable, I now have to go to the police and file a report on the matter. What will riot do about this? My bet is nothing I have already sent support tickets but they probable will give him a few days ban or something stupid like that. Well ROIT this is a serious issue and I really hope you fix what ever data base leak you have!\n\nSo Summoners be warned apparenly anyone from your in game name alone can get your email your password and apparently your Credit Card details just by playing a game of league!","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-02-10T02:26:22.534+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If those are your details, then they are not from this LoL account or any other you may have, though if you've had to change your password then that means you use the same password on your LoL account that you use on other services.\n\nThis person you encountered is likely quoting info dumped from other services you've used that have been breached. Look up your info on https://haveibeenpwned.com/ and you're likely to be surprised by the amount of services you've used that have had your information stolen or leaked.\n\nThis is why you should avoid using the same username and password across different services.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2019-02-10T04:06:33.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Will this person get a perma ban?

That said, Riot's standing policy regarding Player Behaviour cases is that they wont provide details of another players punishments to *anyone* (except the punished player), as that classifies as a \"breach of privacy\", so (unfortunately) all anyone can tell you is that \"appropriate action will be taken\", just not which *specific* action(s) if any.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2019-02-10T05:45:07.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I gather that would be the case. Though this is quite serious in my opinion. Don't get me wrong I can at times be toxic and stuff, and I have received chat bans deserved.

Different people react differently to that kind of thing, and I think it's clear that this particular player isn't being deterred just by the threat of punishment in-game.\n\nHopefully you're situation will be appropriately addressed by Riot and the police, and you'll be \"back to normal\" (so to say) soon enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2019-02-10T07:36:53.734+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a perma ban won't stop them in my opinion, though at least if they bought any skins or anything they will lose it all.

There is nothing to indicate that the information he posted is legitimate. Also, many hacking websites have had their data breached. It is how one of my mains were banned back when I scripted for laughs.

Also, you did not block out everyone's names.\n\n1. It is not harassment. Nothing about what he did is harassment. You are calling him out on the forums, knowing anyone with half a brain cell will be able to find who he is, could be considered harassment. You should have just made a ticket.\n\n2. It is not illegal to have 'leaked' information. It is illegal to use it maliciously or with an attempt to break the law. Blackmail, et cetera. Also, he has no documents. He most likely, as I said, got it from a website that leaked everyone's emails and previous passwords. You yourself said, in the picture, that the information he had was, and I quote, 'Not even close'. Why are you worried if the information he had was not even close to being accurate?\n\n3. It is hardly against Riot's Terms of Service to have leaked documents. There has been no official breach and the fact you think some silver kid from OCE is a master hacker baffles me. He most likely got your information from any known cheat program breach. There have been three of them in the past few months.\n\nSo, he has access to a few of your accounts? The police cannot follow this up and they will not even attempt to. It is **YOUR** account and **YOUR** responsibility. You would simply waste their time because you most likely fell for some kind of scam and have a keylogger on your computer.\n\nYou are just going to waste their time, which is, funnily enough, a genuine crime.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2019-02-10T11:01:24.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Haha, you are talking like you know what's up but really you have no idea.

The Code of Conduct is not meant to be exhaustive, and we reserve the right to modify it at any time, as well as take appropriate disciplinary measures including account termination and deletion to protect the integrity and spirit of the Riot Services, regardless of whether a specific behavior is listed in the policy as inappropriate. In addition to the Code of Conduct, please review the Summoner’s Code for additional guidance on exemplary gameplay behavior.\n\nThe following are examples of behavior that warrant disciplinary measures:\n\ni.

Before that the last match played under my account was me, over two years ago. I'm certain whoever did it was probably accessing accounts to test cheats/hacks for in game exploitation -- I feel like RIOT should be able to find out which IP addresses (if they aren't passed through a VPN/spoofed -- which they probably are) and be able to determine beforehand whether it's a legitimate login. \n\nI contacted RIOT, mostly because I was angry someone was even able to access and use the account.
