I have been ban for supposed scripting. Knowing I have done nothing wrong and after contacting support with multiple support tickets. Informing Riot that there was unsual activity on my account and being constantly replied to with copy and paste messages I have decided to start a class action law suit against riot games in hopes that they will stop over looking matters and take action.\n\nI have been constantly told that scripts were detected with no evedence of a single game where scrips were used to gain an unfair advantage. I have not had anyone actually look into the matter because I am sure that if they did they will see no games has scripts used. \n\nRiot is claiming they were detected yet as we all know there system from time to time does make mistakes. The last ban wave many accounts were wrongly ban and riot has admitted to this. So clearly there system can make mistakes. I will be contacting a law firm on Monday to in hopes that Riot ups there game and there support team stops over looking ever ticket and sending generic copy and paste messages without actually looking into it at all!\n\nIf you are toxic they will send you the chat log proving you were toxic yet in my case they can not provide any evedence of any rules being broken other then something was detected by there systems. As we all now know there systems make mistakes. Vote and comment so I can get numbers as to how many people will join me on this fight vs riot games!\n\n\nOn a side note.\n\nIt is not hard to do and really you wont have to do much. I started one not long ago due to the fact the area where I lived had no internet or phone phone provisions and within 1 month guess what.... We now have access to internet after 1 year without it. So it is not something difficult to do. Though please only say yes if you were actually wronged.

I mean, why does the community always have these contradictory narratives that simultaneously claim that the punish system overly bans people and not banning people at all at the same time? But I digress.\n\nYou also do realise the reason why Riot \"takes away\" your stuff after you're blacklisted is simply because that the goods are virtual, directly integrated into their infrastructure, and completely irrelevant if not used on Riot's service, right? \n\nTo draw parallels, it would be the same as say having a house which you spent money decorating it (here let's pretend the decoration service is state-owned). And after some incident, such as you're found out to idk, deal drugs or getting into trouble with the community continuously or something, you would get run out of and thus lose your house, and whatever that decoration you'd worked on it is also lost naturally. The account is the same thing. It's not that Riot intentionally takes away your things after the account bans, it's that the service and goods are directly connected and losing one also means losing the other by nature.\n\nEDIT: This is the same for say, Steam, where if your Steam account itself is banned, all of your games accessible via that account are also no longer reachable. This is also the same as say paid TV channels (though one can not interact with others via TV so access can't be banned via misconduct). The service is to provide access, not to provide ownership.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-19T13:11:28.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that the misbehaviour i said wasn't accurate, trying to focus on that specifically is moving away from the point.\n\nAnd the issue is that if we are trying to draw exact parallels then it's.\n\n1) You get banned from a store, and everything gets repo'd.\n2) You can re-enter the store, if you simply give them a different username (as in this store you don't use your name but a username).\n\nAny store attempting this method would quickly be boycotted whether any bans were justified or not, because it would be seen as a cash grab attempt.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-02-19T13:25:13.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=3lsIOFpj,comment-id=000300000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-02-19T13:11:28.307+0000)\n>\n> I get that the misbehaviour i said wasn&#x27;t accurate, trying to focus on that specifically is moving away from the point.\n> \n> And the issue is that if we are trying to draw exact parallels then it&#x27;s.\n> \n> 1) You get banned from a store, and everything gets repo&#x27;d.\n> 2) You can re-enter the store, if you simply give them a different username (as in this store you don&#x27;t use your name but a username).\n> \n> Any store attempting this method would quickly be boycotted whether any bans were justified or not, because it would be seen as a cash grab attempt.\n\nThere are more than 1 type of service platforms than your local grocery store. When the goods are inseparable from the main infrastructure of the said service, a service operates under the goal of providing customers access to the goods rather than selling the goods' ownership.\n\nRiot can NOT give your purchased champs or skins in a bag, it's not some takeaway food as it's completely virtual with a virtual existence on a virtual platform like a purchased emoticon on Facebook or something. The only \"physical\" thing in this entire trade is the account of the customer, and thus their goods are tied to it.\n\nBut when the user is denied access of the service due to breach of rules such as misbehaviour or egregious act of hacking, by the virtue of the account being a shared entity with the goods purchased itself, the goods are also no longer accessible along with the loss of the account. And it's only natural.\n\nAs I've said, this is the same deal with Steam in my Edit, if your Steam account itself is banned (not just VAC'ed, the account itself is banned), all of the games on it are lost for the same reasons as here in League. They are not going to send a physical copy of the games to your mailing address because that's not what you'd traded for during the businesses with them.\n\nEDIT: Also Riot can not stop people from making multiple accounts, because unlike in Korea or something, your game account is not tied to your actual personal identity. That and, Riot is very indecisive when it comes to whether or not they should allow the players to reform (a lot happened you see). But then again, I don't think Riot actively encourages players to come back into the game to spend more money after perma ban to begin with (as afaik their copy-paste response to perma ban is usually \"we will not lift the ban, I hope you behave well in the next game you've decided to play\") so personally I don't see that much issue tbh.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Viagra","date":"2017-03-01T02:47:38.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"its not like if you bought a house then they took back the deed, its moreso if you're renting a house and they terminated your contract.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-19T06:30:34.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, they can't do that.

Sometimes it may not be directly your fault, but indirectly so too. It's entirely possible that your computer is hosting programs that may be interacting with the core files of League without your knowledge, which led to the ban, but we won't know.\n\nAs I may have said, Riot does look into a lot of things during a case review, perma ban ones in particular. So there has to be a reason why your ban is unchanged, either it's still being processed, or that you're just found to be guilty in some way even if you're not personally aware of the offence.\n\nAs the Rioter have said to you in the other thread you made, they will notify you ASAP maybe before the end of tomorrow.

Let's be honest we can't do anything but accept these terms and conditions right....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-18T16:56:59.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=3lsIOFpj,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-02-18T15:44:09.412+0000)\n>\n> Unfortunately a class action lawsuit probably wouldn&#x27;t work.\n> \n> This is an excerpt from the EULA that you agree to when you patch the game\n> \n> This line basically gives them the right to do whatever they want in these sorts of scenarios.\n> \n> That said, i did notice that the EULA has an issue in it, that the closest thing to &quot;you are not allowed to script&quot; is\n> \n> Which i have to say is really shittily worded, and seems more like &quot;you won&#x27;t abuse bugs&quot; then &quot;you won&#x27;t script&quot;, which if that held up in court (by some way shape or form) would actually mean anyone banned in the previous ban wave get off freely and have to be unbanned.\n\nAhh yes I know my account is not mine, but there has to be something to protect us right? I mean we dump a lot of money into our accounts. \n\nOn the other hand that saying anything to give an unfair advantage over other players means you can basically cheat with bots? Stupidly worded but still not the point.\n\nThe problem here is they are unable to actually check what's happneed.  No one has looked into why I kept getting a error saying my account was logged in else where or if scrips were actually used.\n\nI am not asking for them to tell me how they found a scrip being use I only want to be shown a single game where a script was used. \n\nSurely showing us a reply that we already have access to anyways will not compromise how they find scripts right? I mean it's litrally a replay of hey this is a game that a script was used in.\n\nIf they can show me that I'll accept a ban but they can't because I never used any. This is why I'm fighting so hard because I'm sure there system found something but I know it wasn't a script what ever it was I don't know. But something has happened here and all I ask is for someone to actually take there he time to look into this proporly.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-18T17:06:13.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know some of you may think this is a bit over board and if I cheated I wouldn't go though the effort. It's been a while now and all I wanted was for someone to look into this case and take it seriously. It's quite sad that is has to come down to something so drastic for something so simple.\n\nI really hope riot will look into this before it gets to that stage. I can't be bothered going though another class action law suit again. At the same time I'm sick of big company's taking advantage of us little guys. If no one stands up to them nothing will change.\n\nI'm sure most of the time there bans are correct. Though they can't dismiss every case as someone lying and trying to get out of it. \n\nIf only they take a few moments to check the games they will quickly see its a mistake. \n\nI'm really saddened that no one will look into it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-03-01T03:35:32.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm literally dying lmfao \"Roit Games\" I cant take this seriously","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wikid","date":"2017-02-22T21:12:23.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to tell ya buddy, you can take all the \"class action\" you want.

That is the point of a class action law suit though it's the only way for the little guy to make a change. Look at steam for example and how they changed there refund policy.\n\nTurns out this \"sook\" didn't deserve the ban and has now had his account restored!\n\nThere is a difference between doing something wrong and sooking because you got cought and not doing anything wrong and being ban for a mistake.\n\nWhen you have a legit reason to fight then you fight. Big companies rely on the little guy to give up because it's to hard.... if you don't you can win vs big companies happens all the time.
