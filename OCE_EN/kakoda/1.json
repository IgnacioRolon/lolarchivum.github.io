Someone from Riot please look into this.","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"Guy&#039;s I need your help here. I understand that what you are about to here is a very common thing, I am not here to waist your time let alone my own. Please take a few moments to read this and help me get the attention of someone who can genuinely help me.\r\n\r\nI was recently ban for use of scripts. Thing is and I know you hear this all the time, I genuinely did not use any scripts in any of my games ever! I got an email saying that a script was detected in my account, and you know what.... I&#039;m sure something was detected, I mean they wouldn&#039;t ban me for no reason right? Though I 100% can say I have never used a script EVER!\r\n\r\nAll I am asking is that someone from Riot really take the time to look into this and look over my games. If anyone looks at any of my game play they will quickly notice that scripts are not there! I play cass and honestly miss about 50% of my Q I can not kite and use E very well I cant CS like a God and I cant auto attack and cast at the same time. I also get hit by almost every skill shot like legit I suck at dodging skill shots. Sure there may be the occasional wow cant believe that happened moment, though they are far out weighed by the omg that was so trash moments.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that they can look into my games and find one game where any sort of script was used. I can assure you all that non will be found.\r\n\r\nFeel free to check my games on https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=kakoda and you can see I&#039;m not the best player and my stats show it quite clearly. \r\n\r\nLook, I&#039;m not here to stuff around I wouldn&#039;t bother wasting mine or anyone else time. Like I understand there &quot;system&quot; detected something what I do not know but 100% I have not scripted or changed anything in the game files.\r\n\r\nAgain PLEASE, I need your help to get riots attention so someone can look into this matter further and not just leave me in the dark with &quot;well the computer said you did so you did&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere are the emails.\r\n\r\n**Me**\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI went to log onto LoL this morning and found I have been perma ban. I have no idea why I have been ban. I have been getting a lot of messages saying I have logged in from a different location though I put that down to using my mobile for internet. It kept telling me my account has been logged in from a different location though most of the time I was on line when it would happen so I am not sure what is happening there.\r\n\r\nWould you be able to help me recover my account please?\r\n\r\n&lt;---&gt; Ticket Summary &lt;---&gt;\r\nAccount Signup Email: not sure\r\nDo you have access to your signup email?: no\r\nUsername: \r\nSummoner Name: Kakoda\r\nRegion: oceania\r\nDo you remember the account signup info?: no\r\nAccount Creation Date: \r\nDate of Birth on the account: \r\nLocation where account was registered: \r\nPlease explain how you first gained access to this account: \r\nOther people who have ever had access to the account: \r\nDo you remember the store information?: no\r\nWhat was your first ever RP purchase?: \r\nWhat did you use your refund tokens on?: \r\nDo you remember the first 5 champions you have purchased?: \r\nFirst 5 champions you ever purchased: \r\nFirst 3150 IP Champion: \r\nFirst 4800 IP Champion: \r\nFirst 6300 IP Champion: \r\nDid you receive or give gifts on this account?: \r\nGifts Received: \r\nGifts Given:\r\n\r\nSo I was informed that apparently my account was ban due to scripts. hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs. I spoke with someone from another team and they said to recover my account from here. He informed me that it is possible to recover my account though this method. As mentioned previously, I have been constantly getting logged out from LoL saying my account has been logged in from another location. As I said also before I put that down to using my phone as a source of internet.\r\n\r\nI have no reason to use scrips, my internet at the moment is way to unstable to play any ranked games I struggle playing normal games. I am now worried that there has been something happening with my account. It could be possible that I got hacked? Could this be the reason to why I kept being logged out?\r\n\r\nI have been looking into these bans and stuff and read that some people may have something on there computer that is detected by your anti cheat systems. I figure this would be the case maybe? Please feel free to look though all my games I am sure you will see nothing other then your average player with some awesome plays and some really bad plays that will make you cringe lol!\r\n\r\nIf this is the case and something on my computer that caused your anti cheat to get a false positive would reformatting my pc be the best option?\r\n\r\nPlease I have already for the generic response that is sent out to everyone there first few emails. This is a legit claim I don&#039;t want to waist time, I know the generic responses so if possible can we please skip that? I compleatly understand there are 1000s of emails coming though claiming i didnt cheat bla bla bla. I am sure 99% of them have. In this case though I can assure you I have not scripted or hacked or used any 3rd party software. Would really appreciate if we can move on to investigation what actually happened so we can resolve this as swiftly as possible\r\n\r\nSo I was informed that apparently my account was ban due to scripts. hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs.

Accounts that are caught using hacks to gain an unfair competitive advantage are subject to permanent suspension. We work hard to preserve a fair and competitive environment in League of Legends. Regardless of intent, use of unauthorized third-party programs is explicitly against the Terms of Use, which can be found here:\r\n&bull; http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that account sharing of any kind is also against the Terms of Use. You are responsible for all activity on your account, so be sure to keep your account information to yourself.\r\n\r\nWe won&#039;t be able to go into the specifics of an account&#039;s exploit abuse, as divulging this information could compromise future investigations. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nVynix\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\n\r\n&quot;You can&#039;t milk those.&quot; - Alistar\r\n\r\n\r\n**Me**\r\n\r\nLike I have said I have already got that reply. I understand this is a process. Though I feel my account was ban unfairly. I have never used hacks cheats or third party programs.\r\n\r\nFeel free to go through any and all my games I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t find anything out of the odenary.\r\n\r\nSeriously, please show me 1 game where a 3rd party program was used? I know 100% I never used anything so I can be sure that not a single game will be found.\r\n\r\nLike I have said I have already got that reply. I understand this is a process. Though I feel my account was ban unfairly. I have never used hacks cheats or third party programs.\r\n\r\nFeel free to go through any and all my games I&#039;m sure you won&#039;t find anything out of the odenary.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Riot**\r\n\r\nHello Kakoda,\r\n\r\nOur system detected the use of scripts within your games. \r\nI hope you can see why it would be unsatisfying and frustrating to play against other players who are using a tool to tamper with the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nWe took action to protect the fairness and integrity of the Fields of Justice.\r\n\r\nWe have explained the context of your suspension, will not remove or modify it, and consider the matter closed.\r\n\r\nAlways willing to support, support, support!\r\n-Hueronymous\r\n\r\n\r\n**Me**\r\n\r\nShow me one game where a script was used? I have not scripted. I have also mentioned my account was constantly giving me an error saying it was logged in from another location. \r\n\r\nI kept a close eye on my games and nothing seemed out of the odenary. Please provide me one game where scripts were used. Just one game...\r\n\r\nLike I said I have never used scrips all my games are clean. Check the history check every game if you have to from when these so called scripts were detected. \r\n\r\nI can assure you that you will not find a single game where a script was used.\r\n\r\nSure I understand that you say something was detected and again I assure you nothing was used by me. I&#039;m 95% sure my account has not been hacked as I said I kept a close eye on my games since the errors started happening.\r\n\r\nI understand you would get a lot of people saying they didn&#039;t do it when they did. Though in a very very small amount of cases it can be wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to look into these games directly please send this to someone that can help.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned many times I am sure not a single game had scrips used. Unless you can show me one game just one game this ban is unfair.\r\n\r\nI have been on oce.op.gg and my games from the last month are there and all are clean as I know I personally played every single game. Unless you can find a game that scripting was involved this is not fair.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure your system has found something odd with the account, though it&#039;s defiantly not scripting. If only you give me the chance and personally look over these games you will see your your self that there is not scripting in any game played.\r\n\r\nI ask senserly please look into this more closely. Instead of just relying on a computer system that can once in a while make mistakes take a moment and look over my games and see for your self this is a mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-19T08:01:15.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot still quite no response this is ridicules!","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-02-21T01:08:50.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Kakoda,\n\nI'm taking a look for you.

I have been emailed my multiple game company's. Sony, majang, xbox and a few more saying my accounts have had suspisus activity. I fear that all my accounts on all my games have been compromised. \n\nI'll be emailing then all shortly to see what I can do to prevent furather damage.\n\nThough like mentioned before I kept a close eye on my games in lol. As I've been trying to improve I've been keeping track of my game play to see where I need to work on.\n\nBy doing that I feel like no games were played by who ever may have hacked my account though something on there computer may have caused my account to be flagged.\n\nThey emailed me saying scripts were detected and if my account was compromised and something on the computer set off a flag it's basically my fault and I'm to blame and my account won't be unban.\n\nI'm not going to lie here, that is extremely disappointing to hear.\n\nFrom what the support member told me I'm really disappointed that instead of helping recover my account and help take steps to prevent this happening again that I'm stuck with a ban I don't deserve.\n\nI can't stress enough how much it saddens me that the support members would tell me that is my account was compromised and a 3rd party program was detected it is my responsablity.\n\nHonest anyone can get hacked, going to a website a download spy ware is everywhere! \n\nI'm just glad I don't do my banking on my computer that would have been bad.\n\nPlease Gehirn, the support team was no help to me it seems as you are my last chance here.

Makes it hard to remember these things lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kakoda","date":"2017-02-18T05:26:59.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Can we just get someone to actually look into what's happened to my account?

I am unable to reveal how our investigations work or what specific evidence we found in these cases. We sometimes get players who will write in trying to figure out our detection methods. I am sure you can understand why we have to keep such information private.\n\nDue to the severity of the actions taken on this account, we won’t be able to remove or modify the permanent suspension for any reason. If you have any new concerns, let me know. Otherwise, I will consider this matter closed.\n\nHixian, Riot Player Support\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCan I just note that all they are saying is we have looked something was detected yet every ticket response is from a different person!\n\nI just want someone that can actually help to look into this.

I created a new ticket seeing as the last one has now been ignored. Here is what I said.\n\n\n**Me**\n\nHello,\n\nI have been getting error messages saying my account was logged in from another location multiple times a day for the last few months. I put it down to the fact that I have been using my mobile phone for internet and thought that was the reason for this error.\n\nI later found out that my account received a ban for scripting. Knowing I have never used scripts I feel like something odd has been happening to my account. I have kept a close eye on my games and game logs and never noticed anything strange all games seemed to be played by me. \n\nThough after the ban I am concerned that there has been something fishy happening on my account. Could this please be looked into? I understand that your systems have picked up scripts, knowing I have not used any and my games seem to be all mine can we look into why I have constantly been receiving this message of \"Your account has been logged in from another location\"?\n\nI feel as though this ban is a result of something out of my control and possibly something to do with this error or even maybe my account was hacked. I am unsure as to my account being hacked as it seemed that the games were all played by me but something is off here for sure. \n\nI have created a previous ticket that was closed and I was told scripts were detected on your account consider this matter closed. This is unfair as they did not even look into any games that were played with these scripts and more importantly ignored the fact that my account had been getting logged in from a different location.\n\nI ask that someone take the time to look into this matter properly. Not just that a script was detected but find a game to where this was the case and also look into where my account was being logged into.\n\nI serenely am asking for Riot's help here to help me recover my account!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFingers crossed someone will actually take the time to look into this.\n\n**Come on RIOT look into this and stop dismissing it!**","replies":[]}]}
