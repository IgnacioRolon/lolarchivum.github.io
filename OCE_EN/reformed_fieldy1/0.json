Now i've had trouble in the past with somone hacking my account and playing on it while i took a break from LoL. My issue more settles around the ticket system \nDuring the first time i was hacked i was prompted by an automated blizcrank bot email to simply change my password. This time, my microsoft was hacked 1 hour before ( recieved an email from microsoft ) my league was banned. \nBoth tickets have been under \"recovering my account\", in both tickets i've provided information on my account to 'assist' them \nAnd also sent photos in attempts that a support member will use the information and photos of the email microsoft sent me to prove that the account is in fact mine. After all this both messages were replied with an automated \"change your password\" blitzcrank bot email \nMeaning all said information, detail must have just been ignored and the support system has sent me this message all because it's listed under 'recovering my account' \nI have so much proof that could help if my account is under investigation \nEg photos, bank charges which corollate with the account\nJust spent $32 on elementalist Lux and cant play it all because some low life has hacked me and possibly made my account unusable!","replies":[{"poster":"Pluie","date":"2016-12-13T14:07:14.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They can always track down the IP Address and if those games happen to be under your IP Address despite \"you being on a hiatus\" it could possibly mean you were lying and trying to avoid being banned by putting the blame on the other person.\n\nI'm not saying that it was you, but I have my doubts. My friend who did indeed got hacked got his account back easily with no dispute, they immediately tracked down the games and it wasn't to his IP Address and they solved the issue. They allowed him to reset his password, and change his email.","replies":[{"poster":"Reformed Fieldy1","date":"2016-12-14T02:14:06.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Microsoft provided me with the IP address an details of person who hacked my microsoft right before my league was banned \nBoth my microsoft and LoL passwords were changed too by the way! \nWhy go to the efforts and extents i have if i am responsible? \nIt's a damn bronze 5 account aha! \nOnly vaulable to me! \n\nhow did he do that?
