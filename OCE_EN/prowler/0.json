I don&#039;t want to get stomped by people who are better than me, in blind queue, that&#039;s messed up.\r\n\r\nYou don&#039;t get randomly matched against NBA players when you&#039;re in a local Thursday night basketball comp, so why does LoL match me against people who are that much higher, and also organised when I&#039;m solo? \r\n\r\nFrankly, it makes it un-enjoyable and I&#039;m starting to feel my time is better spent elsewhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-02T23:10:16.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked and normal mmr is completely different.","replies":[]}]}
