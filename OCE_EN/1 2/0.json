Can't hook/place a good lantern? Or just support in general?\n\nPlaying as a support is really half of a whole, it may not just be you. If you choose Thresh for *every* game, you're bound to have loads of bad combos (not everyone needs a hook), although unlikely there will be times where you have a massive string of terrible games.\n\nMaybe take a bit of a break with Thresh, try something **completely** different that you're not used to - if you totally suck at it, no harm done. Change can be good from time to time.","replies":[{"poster":"1 2","date":"2015-08-07T04:42:30.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bad calls and mechanics","replies":[{"poster":"1 2","date":"2015-08-07T05:05:15.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I use to be able to read where the enemy was going and I'd hook there, but now I can't even land a hook.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raikonecromancer","date":"2015-08-13T14:53:28.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feeling as well.\nMy wukong is really good when i start rolling but know im not felling so confident playing him like my skill and mechanics with him are not the same.\nBut i agree on the fact that trying new champs helps alot, when you stop the losing streak and you are feeling good again you may hesitate at first when you have the chance to pick your main but when you do and it works it means you are ready to play him again","replies":[]},{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-08-13T12:50:33.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happened to me with my Miss Fortune, when suddenly I got extremely thirsty and made all these unnecessary decisions, so I can confirm that playing other roles and other champions for awhile will help, and most importantly, playing in a good environment (friends).\n\nA good environment helps because when you fail they help you not feel like crap and become worse, and I played other champions for a couple months until my skill in the game increased, (positioning, not being thirsty, positioning, kiting etc.) and I was ready to try out MF again.\n\nIMO for me it was just adjusting to the level of skill of my opponents, particularly when I became lv 30, and starting to vs silvers and golds in normals xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2015-08-09T20:36:37.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break from the champ !!
