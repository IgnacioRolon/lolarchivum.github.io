Yes I know he may have fired some shots against another fellow ally, but he was antagonised by the whole team. He wasn&#039;t the first one to fire with the racial insults, though he only mentioned one racial insult. The account of <redacted> was targeting my brothers account, referring to him as an &quot;indian&quot;, &quot;refugee&quot;, &quot;dirty %%%%%%...or arab&quot; and the list doesn&#039;t even end there. To mention a few of the other summoners who were on the racist, big mouthed <redacted>, who which also ignored that my little brother being a victim of racial abuse. <redacted>. During his heated arguments in the post-game chat he was rudely interrupted by a notice stating that his account has been permanently banned. This has been a proofs of Riots job to completely ignore the context of the game. I am not blaming you but I am pointing out that the amount of injustice shown upon this game is out  of this world. So please Riot I ask you to do the following. Take away the permanent ban on Bloodstorm5th and to bring justice against those accounts who were in support of this racial abuse. I&#039;ll state their names again, <redacted>. Please email my account back for further notice. I even have Screenshots to prove that  i had nothing to do with starting conflict between myself and the others","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-09-18T01:50:52.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nApologies for such a delayed response.\nI've gone ahead and removed the offending players names from your post as it violates the \"No Naming and Shaming\" rule on the boards.\n\nWhile I understand how frustrating it is to be a victim of abuse, it is important to remember not to stoop to the level of such players.\n\nThere is a mute function built into the game for just this reason, the best course of action is to always mute the players who are being abusive, racist, or anything relating to that and then report them in post-game.\n\nIf you stoop to their level and retaliate with abuse, worse or not then you also risk punishment (As is evident by your case), however be assured that the players in question would more than likely have received punishment for their actions as well.","replies":[]}]}
