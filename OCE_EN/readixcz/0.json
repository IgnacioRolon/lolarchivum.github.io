After patch 5.3 I have one problem and I don't know how could I solve him.. \r\nBefore this patch I had high graphics and everytthing was ok.. No lags.. No problem.. But now I have low graphics 100+fps 30ping and game freezes every +-10sec.. Fps drop from 100 to max.80 but I think that's not the problem. Anyone know how could I fix it or something?

Don't ever think you'd have to buy a new monitor *just to play one game*. That's insanity.\n\nIf your monitor can display 1600x1200 at 75Hz, then it will be able to display any resolution under that at a higher refresh rate. That's how monitors work.
