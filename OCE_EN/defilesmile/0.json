The main problem was that Rek&#039;Sai could still go through the tunnel as many times as he wanted without cooldown and use his ultimate to transport himself to it. I do not have any screenshots or video evidence atm and haven&#039;t been able to recreate the bug.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-26T11:46:43.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_\"I do not have any screenshots or video evidence atm and haven't been able to recreate the bug.\"_\n\nNo one can really help you then. Try using [this](http://www.replay.gg/) site, to recover the replay footage (it's down ATM though).\n\nAlso bug posts now go on [this](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) forum. Any gameplay bug reports here will likely be ignored.","replies":[]}]}
