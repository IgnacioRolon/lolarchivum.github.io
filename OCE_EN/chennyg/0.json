I've been pretty much only playing Janna and Thresh since the end of the season unless banned and or picked. \n- Availability: Pretty much all the time.\n- Play style: Aggressive and Objective based. Lane phase I like aggressive (and smart) trading. I also tend to roam after first back to deep ward so I like an adc that knows where I'm going and doesn't get caught 1v2.\n- Anything else you would like to add: I'm not the strongest shot caller but I do feel like I bring constant vision to the team that allows for safer calls. I have been working on my warding and find myself constantly out warding the enemy support by 10-20 wards. I'm a pretty easy person to get along with and do take practice seriously, while at the same time not being someone who will snap at people making mistakes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sins of Asura","date":"2014-11-29T06:52:33.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"- Name Rhys\n- Age 22\n- Rank P4 on NA IGN Raguru, casual with friends on OCE S2 IGN Sins of Asura\n- Champion pool Diverse palate.

I was climbin' and climbin' last season, but exams are more important than League. Played enough to get a shiny border and badge, though!\n\nPool: I've always loved aggressive supports. I made it to platinum playing support Poppy nearly exclusively! From there I ended up transitioning to all-in supports like Leona who could win lane at level 3, then to safer, peel-heavy multi-role supports like Alistar in Diamond when the skill levels started to equalize and I had to be more flexible with how I played. Alistar would probably be my go-to since he can initiate, peel, punish, and roam with the flow of the game, though I can play champions like Leona to roll a lane or Nami/Lulu for more fragile bully lanes. I'm still working on my Thresh, he's my weakest, but we'll get there!\n\nAvailability: U N I ' S O V E R B O Y S! I don't have a Christmas job, so whenever, zzz\n\nPlay Style: Aggression wins games! Hit 2, all-in, scare the pants off your opponents and draw jungle and top attention, spam laugh and avoid ganks, snowball the game with presence. I don't like playing from behind, but that's why I switched to champions like Alistar who are still very useful even then.\n\nAnything Else?: Solo queue is fun, but I want to learn and play in a team environment. It's more fun, and hey, prestige!","replies":[{"poster":"chennyg","date":"2014-11-28T11:50:25.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply :) I'll add you in game and we can discuss further","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"4L Rampage","date":"2014-11-27T12:36:53.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"- Name: Gagi 4 M (Changing soon)\n- Age: 19\n- Rank: Peaked at diamond 4 then decayed from that to p2.
