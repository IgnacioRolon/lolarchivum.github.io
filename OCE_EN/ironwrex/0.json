The reason that tank junglers are no longer considered part of the \"meta\" is because their ability to be front line champions, to tank and to protect their squishy backline carries has been considerably hammered through patches and nerfs that you have made. Since I began playing League of Legends back in 2010, back in season 1/season 2, the tank has undergone probably the most prolific of changes compared to other roles. This is a direct result of changes to both the kit of newer characters, such as Lucian and Azir, and the modification of already existing champions and items, such as character reworks like Nidalee and item modification like the Warmog's Armor nerf as well as the introduction of more tank shredding items e.g. Blade of The Ruined King. Tank Junglers have become less useful because it is extremely difficult for them to keep up with laners let alone get ahead of them which is what they need if they want to become tanky enough. Tank Junglers already have clear speed issues, with their abilities not being able to clear camps anywhere near as fast as more damage based junglers such as Lee Sin or Nidalee, this problem was increased due to the reworked jungle which added more health and damage to neutral minions and monsters, making it very hard for tank junglers to clear and to even survive those early levels. Because the experience that the jungler received from camps was modified its considered rare for a jungler to maintain the same level as the laners let alone get ahead in experience. Tank Junglers need levels in order to be able to efficiently clear out their jungle while still having the resources to perform ganks. Tank Junglers are being forced to choose between farming camps or ganking lanes. Even if they choose to gank non-stop or farm non-stop they will always end up behind in levels and in items. Which brings to me to my next point of items. With the introduction of quill coat and spirit of the ancient golem tank junglers benefited quite well because they gained health and mana the longer that they were in combat with neutral camps. This reflected the slow clear speed of tank junglers and allowed them to still perform ganks with high levels of health and mana not to mention that the sapping barbs passive stacked quite well with the bladed armor mastery. The tanks had the clear now to buy items and to be what they were designed to be, immovable tank front liners of survived team fights to slug it out with other tanks. The removal of the spirit jungle items hit tanks really hard as well as the introduction of the new tank shredding item Blade of the Ruined King. With the recent buffs to armor and magic penetration items, such as Last Whisper, Youmuu's Ghostblade and Void Staff meant that tanks were resorting to stacking health because it was the only way that they could avoid being blown up with burst damage or shredded over time as they were kited by AD Carries or cced by Supports or just focused out by Mid Laners. Subsequently Warmogs was nerfed. Tanks and Tank Junglers became what we know now today, weak and overall pretty much a meat shield for skill shots. A tank has to rely on the cooldowns of their abilities while also relying on their team to back them up or follow them into the breach. Unless the tank has huge amounts of cc then they become useless as the second an ad or ap carry hits late game its lights out for the tank. In order to be a tank you need items. An average tank would have lets say 4 purely tank items including boots. Now to get those four items it costs near 11 thousand gold. This is a really difficult amount to get. A tank jungle struggles to clear and a tank struggles to get kills. Unless you are in a game where everyone is ridiculously fed and handing you kills/assists you are going to have to farm minions in order to get anything. That brings us back to our first problem of tanks struggling to clear. Sure you can build full damage but then you get destroyed because you are not at all tanky. This is why tanks have been replaced by high base damage champs who build tank such as Lee Sin, Jarvan IV, Elise, Udyr etc. These champions have decent clearing speed and damage allowing them to be effective with dps early on and late game with minimal damage items but being tanks who have huge presence in the front line. With more cc based supports such as Braum, Thresh and Alistar being a part of the current meta it is harder for tanks to engage and get past this peeling and crowd controlling super supports. Finally ADCs and APCs have more options for kiting out tanks or just simply avoiding them. Items such as Ghostblade allows for escapes and aggressive kiting with bonus attack speed, Blade of the Ruined King deals percentage health damage, punishing tanks who gain health because the majority of magic resistance and some armor items give large amounts of health, and its active effect allows ADCs to quickly to regain health, slow chasers and escape, and Quicksilver Scimitar removes all forms of cc allowing ADCs to be uninhibited during team fights and chases. APCs can kite out tanks who don't have gap closing abilities beyond flash with Rylais, slowing them, and using Zhonyas Hourglass to allow cooldowns to come up and make their escape. With the nerfs to tanks it comes down to the base kit of a champion to determine how well they can tank based on their crowd control, shields or plain out high base armor and magic resist. Tanks were in heaven and you have brought them crashing down to earth to be destroyed by those they once brushed off like gnats.\r\nYou made this wondrous the game the way it is. You made the bed, you lie in it. \r\n\r\nYour Sincerely\r\nIronWrex","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-14T09:53:42.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A little bit Tl;dr mate","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlimyDan","date":"2015-02-13T21:46:07.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually read the whole thing and I sort of agree with some points. \nI agree that tanks have a hard time fulfilling their job when there are items such as BotRK, LW, VS\n\nHowever you also said that in the new jungle the tank junglers are having a hard time surviving which I personally would disagree with. I've personally tried a couple people in the jungle ( http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/IrXAdm8b-champions-that-can-clear-the-jungle ) and I've found that champions like Cho'Gath, Shen, Malphite, Alistar, Taric (he's not listed on the page yet), Nautilus, and Nasus. All have a fairly easy time clearing the whole jungle, then there's Leona, and Amumu who can do it but get a little bit low on health.\n\nAmumu has a harder first clear but after that it's easy and has fast clears. When I played Taric jungle in nemesis I found his clears got pretty quick. Nautilus surprisingly had a relatively fast clear the first run. Cho'Gath also gets pretty quick when he gets some attack speed. Malphite doesn't get as fast at clearing than others but maybe if you built him AD you might have fast clears.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tweekerz","date":"2015-02-13T14:58:57.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr next time please, I got half way through and thought %%%% this. You know what else I thought though. As a new season jungle main I found tank jungle champs such as Naut, Sejuani, Amumu, Maokai actually have decent clear speeds and sustain whilst being able to still gank successfully when and where its needed.  And absolutely no clue why you would think otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-13T14:01:51.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just fix J4, that's all I want.
