I'm friendly and won't cause any unecessary problems. I usually play norms and intend on playing ranked next season. Tundradragon or Park Chanyeol if Tundradragon doesn't work (I changed my name and not sure if it's one or the other you're meant to use to add me) and if you wish to add me then there you go. P.S, please don't ask me for help with the quests; i'm not interested\n\nHave a great day guys :D","replies":[{"poster":"NinjaAsianAndy","date":"2017-10-22T03:18:41.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me: NinjaAsianAndy :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Latent Ability","date":"2017-10-20T09:00:14.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sent you a friend request: Markahba","replies":[]}]}
