I heard they are on sale for the first week of their release from 1350 to 975 rp. But ive noticed lately that this isnt the case, since neither Infernal Diana nor The Program skins have been on sale. So is there any chance the new Taliyah Skin will be on sale for 975rp at realease?","replies":[{"poster":"AnthonyWD","date":"2016-05-14T03:04:29.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So how much does the bundle usually cost?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-05-12T15:09:18.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1350RP skins no longer go down to 975RP at release.
