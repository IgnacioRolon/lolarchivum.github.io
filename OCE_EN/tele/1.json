What friends and players in champion select have told me is that usually after a 20 minute queue time, people are just insta-locking their role because they can't afford to wait another 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nThis is a bad system and is punishing the players.\r\n\r\nWhy don't we have a small re-queue vote? If someone insta-locks and 4/5 of the team agree then everyone gets re-queued. Of course if you queued in a party of 4 people this option is not available. This system is for normal games by the way. I'd be happy if anyone at Riot considered my idea at all, thanks for reading!","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-02-18T10:29:44.870+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">This ... is punishing the players.\n\nWait, you mean, accomplishing one of the entire points of the queue (creating an unpleasant experience for people who made the experiences of others unpleasant)?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-18T09:30:02.334+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"people are just insta-locking their role because they can't afford to wait another 20 minutes. \"\nlol, do people not realise the insta-locking makes people wanna dodge the queue though?","replies":[]},{"poster":"xStorm","date":"2015-03-04T12:27:37.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"instalocks yeah definitely but for the afks and d/c i think league should have a proper way of identifying them. coz there are some people in the middle of a match and say a damn blackout happens they are just as frustrated as you are. and well riot doesnt have the capabilities of knowing if the person afk on purpose or some sort of issue and in the end the person pays for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-07-21T07:41:30.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> for the afks and d/c i think league should have a proper way of identifying them.\n> ...\n> riot doesnt have the capabilities of knowing if the person afk on purpose\n\nTwo contradictory statements. Either Riot has the capabilities to determine if someone AFKed/DCed on purpose or they don't and, with current technology, there's pretty much no way to tell the difference. Besides, if there was a way to do it and Riot was using it people could just disconnect their modem or computer from it's power source and as far as Riot is aware it was unintentional.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thae","date":"2015-07-20T17:04:35.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im one of the people who just flatout has a shit computor with a whopping 2 gig ram and no graphics card","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yuudachi","date":"2015-02-19T07:59:31.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-02-27T04:54:28.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why cant they just like 5 min low, then every time they do it again n a week it goes up by 5 to max of hour?
