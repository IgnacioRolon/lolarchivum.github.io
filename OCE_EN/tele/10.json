But what do I do when I&#039;m playing a ninja? \n\nThere seems to be 2 opinions on ninjas and CDR;\n1. You build CDR just like any other champion, there is no downside to having your abilities up faster.\n2. You build no/less CDR because you&#039;ll spam all your abilities and run out of energy.\n\nI&#039;m trying to get back into Akali but I&#039;m not sure if I should take CDR runes/items, what do you guys think?\n\nTL;DR\nIs CDR on ninjas worth?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-12T11:01:23.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could repeat everything that has been said, but instead i will say this, there are fringe cases to building CDR for energy based champions, example let's say your playing shen top, buying a Kindle Gem in lane is still worth it, because your main spell usage will be your Q, and only using that doesn't really dint your energy bar too substantially.\n\nHowever that is of course a fringe case.\n\nChamps that use energy:\nAkali; Don't bother with CDR\nKennen; If your only using your Q, then maybe, but this is an extremely fringe case in an example of something like Seiges that are going to last a long time\nLee Sin; Don't build CDR unless you actually understand how his passive works and actually use his passive, otherwise you are just going to energy gate yourself.\nShen; Mentioned above, CDR is fine on him for poke/laning reasons.\nZed; Build the core items that give CDR but don't bother extending past that (Brut, Cleaver.)","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-11T23:37:02.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"CDR isn't usually very good on the energy based champions since the energy pool is so small. Akali is a prime example, her q and e have such short cooldowns to begin with that you will easily expend your entire energy bar in a fight, at which point your next ability usage is gated not by when it comes off cooldown, but by when you regen enough energy to cast it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-11T21:51:10.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well your W is 20 seconds, Q is like 4 at max rank and E is 1 at max rank and R will gain charges quicker but for that CDR you could have more bursty type items so for cost effectiveness I'd rate it low.\n\nTry: http://www.lolpro.com/guides/akali/84-akali-build-guide-solo-lane-by-voyboy\n\nLolpro's guide. This is a core style for aka in my opinion although ghost ignite double dorans boots of spell pen Aka top lane is nice as are some builds like Randuins & abyssal vs mixed damage teams as an offtank or builds that incorporate Rylai's (She slows u to crap) and Rageblade (wreck turrets quickly).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mauradon","date":"2015-08-11T21:12:17.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with CDR on energy-based champions is that it doesn't matter if you can cast your spell every x number of seconds if you don't have enough energy to use it (but CDR is still fine on Zed/Talon because the items that give CDR are still good on them [mostly ghostblade]). \n\nEven though Akali's ult recharge time reduces with CDR it's really not noticeable since it's already 15 seconds at max rank and you get 3 stacks which reset on kills, and you would be better off building other items since her other abilities don't benefit from CDR too greatly.","replies":[]}]}
