It is exactly the same as previous seasons, but with only solo for Challenger players and the current [role selection improvements](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/client-new-features-feedback/KP6bBY6Z-position-preference-in-testing) on PBE.\n\n>  A new &#039;Flex Queue&#039; will be added. It&#039;s essentially Dynamic Queue; you can queue as 1 - 5 players. _Solo Queue players will not be playing against anyone in this queue. **They are completely separate queues.**_\n\nThis goes a lot further than what was initially [leaked](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ychi5/possibly_new_ranked_format_for_season_7/) about the new ranked format. As a Solo Queue player I&#039;m extremely overjoyed with this change! :D\n\n__*\n\n**The new Flex Queue poses some really big issues though, especially for OCE.** I&#039;d like to get some of your thoughts on this specifically.\n\n_Here&#039;s the issues I forsee (and I hope **Riot** is accounting for):_\n\n**Flex Queue needs solo players in it for it to work well.**\n \n+ **Riot** has said they will allow solo players to play in Flex Queue to fix potential issues (mainly queue times). The idea is that Flex Queue will attract solo players who like co-ordinated play.\n\n I strongly doubt this will happen. Unless Flex Queue premades open up and allow solo players into their voice calls, then for the solo player, Flex Queue will just be a really strange and worse solo queue.\n\n Even if this wasn&#039;t the case though, most &quot;co-ordinated&quot; solo players will gravitate towards getting into premades. They supposedly like co-ordinated play, _so why would they chose to play solo?_ They&#039;d obviously enjoy it more if they wait for their friends to be online and play with them.\n\n It's fairly clear to me that there needs to be big rewards for consistent solo Flex Queue play, or else this will not work.\n\n**Flex Queue will likely not make it to OCE.**\n\n + **Riot** said in the announcement that; _&quot;It may work in some regions, but not others. If that&#039;s the case, we&#039;ll turn the Flex Queue into a strict five-man queue&quot;_.\n\n   If it doesn&#039;t work in OCE we&#039;ll understand that it&#039;s not possible and accept that until our population grows a bit. **But I want to see Riot try the queue on live before they decide.**\n\n  I&#039;ll be pushing to make sure this happens, but unless the community is behind it I really can&#039;t do much. Once the decision is made to not implement Flex Queue, it will likely be too late. \n\n  We need to make sure the initial decision is to **try** Flex Queue and then remove it, if it does not work. Also if it does work, it&#039;s a really strong argument to bring back Draft Pick.\n\n__* \nLet me know if you guys agree or have other things to add. This is definitely a big step in the right direction. Now it&#039;s about making sure we don&#039;t repeat the mistakes made with Dynamic Queue.\n\nThanks for reading :D","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-10-06T19:01:16.349+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a possibility that players will appreciate the ability to play Ranked solo in two queues, especially when things go sub-optimally in Solo and you don't want to play on a Smurf or level a new account. Further, if the rewards in Flex are good enough, even though I doubt they will be of the same quality as Solo so it steals the limelight, there should be enough incentive to fill up those missing slots.\n\nWell, I'm pretty confident that will be the case on other servers but I can't say for sure about OCE. I'm keen on trying Flex Queue solo, and possibly in other numbers, but I can't speak for everyone. I also can't foretell how players will behave in what's essentially a rebranded Dynamic Queue environment (will the same problems arise?).\n\nRegardless, I agree with your sentiment - let's at least give the thing a go. It'll be a worthwhile learning experience for our server moving forward and that's nothing but a good thing even if it doesn't work.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-06T21:14:10.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think if there are small rewards for specifically for playing solo in some way, then it could work. Otherwise, I feel like most people looking to try out the mode will queue up with friends because that's the play style they most enjoy.\n\nThanks for the input though :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FEED AND SUCCEED","date":"2016-10-06T13:11:18.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"cool, you gonna unban (at least on a 'good behaviour trial\" basis) people that were largely banned as a result of that toxic cesspool called dynamic queue? you know, all the solos that got ganged up by 4 stacks etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-06T20:49:55.495+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think those people deserved their ban to be honest.

Too often the case in OCE (especially might be a clean system in other regions) that 4 stacks get matched against Solo/Duo players. I don't personally think Flex Queue should be tried in OCE.

As long as they chose the experience, rather than it being forced on them, then I think it's a great idea ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-07T07:06:33.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just re-read the official post and i must of missed the bit about Flex being strictly 5 man and being merged with Ranked teams queue, i personally love that idea. It's essentially playing Ranked Teams but for Solo Queue rating  having the option to Solo or Duo your rating in it's own queue with no 3-5 stacks involved and having a separate queue for Stacks merged with ranked teams is excellent it encourages high level play and everyone is likely on comms so theres no unbalance there.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-05T23:06:01.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oce server population might have an impact on its efficacy.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-10-05T23:23:32.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely, this is a big concern.\n\nI want to see Flex Queue it at least tried though. We may need to close the queue during \"off-hours\" and that's ok. But at least an attempt for a few months is needed IMO. This hasn't really been done before, so I don't think **Riot**'s population estimates for a queue to work can apply here. \n\nLast year, before Dynamic Queue was introduced, OCE was just over 150,000 ranked players total. Now we are at [220,000](http://oce.op.gg/statistics/tier/). Some of those 70,000 players will just be the result of server growth, but I think many are Dynamic Queue players as well. \n\nAlso with less negative stigma attached to Flex Queue, it's possible even more people will play. The JP server is working really well with 90,000 ranked players. I think it's very reasonable to have Flex Queue assuming we get around 50,000 who play it.","replies":[]}]}]}
