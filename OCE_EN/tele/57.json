It&#039;s far too hard to see what I&#039;ve selected. The brightness for the masteries I select needs to be much higher IMO.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/dcba585e40818cb807606eb12d6345a1.png\n\n> In that picture, I can hardly see the luminosity difference between Runic Armour and Veteran's Scars. The Keystone I selected is hardly visible as well. If not for the border I probably wouldn't be able to tell it was even selected. \n> \n> **When I&#039;m about to go in-game this information needs to be VERY clear and right now this isn't cutting it.**\n\n\n__*\n\nAside from masteries, I think in general the client is too dark. I get you&#039;re going for a different feel to the old client, but it shouldn&#039;t be at the expense of clarity. \n\n_**Here are some side by side comparisons: **_\n\nChampions:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D3co6Wv.png\n\nRunes:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZX3L2Yc.png\n\nHopefully someone from the design team is generous enough to read through this.
