I recommend watching it. \n\nCurrently League has very little strategic diversity, ADC are always ranged, mid laners have burst, top laners are tanky etc. The 2 most strategically diverse roles right now are support and jungle. I think it&#039;s about time we had a new role.\n\nNow the video I linked talks about Bard. Bard&#039;s passive was almost the game changer along with the introduction of scuttle crab, it could have been a support who roams for the laning phase and relies on, chimes + inspiration mastery to stay relevant in levels. This was too bold of a move apparently, so they just buffed his Q until he was viable. The true roaming support was almost a reality!\n\nTherefore I want to introduce the roaming support item; **Ranger&#039;s Satchel**\n\nHere is an image of the item.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QuhMXin.jpg\n\nThere would be 2 play styles for the roaming support:\n\n1. Ward for the team, get scuttle control and vision on the jungler. In addition roamers like Bard can leave health packs for their junglers and laners.\n\n2. Gank. This would be roamers like Alistar. They want to get level 2 as fast as possible and then gank.\n\nNow if you look closely you can see that the item is useless in lane and is very cheap. The cheapness of the item allows the passive roamers to get up to 3 wards (including trinket) and 1 pot. It also allows aggressive roamers to get a ward + 3 pots, or any combination possible really.\n\nThe totems allow you to get triple experience, gold and movement speed on that side on the jungle. You can only capture them with Ranger&#039;s Satchel. Here&#039;s a map with where I think placement will be\nhttp://i.imgur.com/euBTzwS.png\n\nIdeas:\n\n1. Roaming supports could allow for more ADC junglers. Think of a Bard always looking out and leaving health packs for his Vayne in the jungle.\n2. Roaming supports could allow for 2 man invades into the enemy jungle, and more level 2 - 3 skirmishes.\n3. Roaming supports could be a hard counter for champions like Lee Sin and Rek&#039;Sai, by warding everything early.\n\nProblems:\n\n1. I don&#039;t want the duo bot meta to completely disappear! The roaming support item will have to be balanced very carefully to allow for both. It probably needs more drawbacks than it has currently.\n2. The ganking power for roaming supports might be too strong. Especially if the enemy support is bot lane. Maybe lane items such as Doran&#039;s Ring, Blade and Shield will have to be given + [Mandrake Ward](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Mandrake_Ward). If this is done, then they need to implement a jungle camp buff that gives immunity to this vision.\n3. Might get a little boring? I'd have to see it in action to know. Bard has his chimes mini-game going, but Alistar will just sit and heal between ganks. Maybe something else has to be added to make the players work for experience?\n\nThese are all ideas for Season 6, if you need me to clarify anything just ask!

If I was with the jungler and just stood on top of a captured totem all game for the triple bonus I'd have 330 gold in 3.6 minutes. This isn't even including the EXP and bonus counter jungling gold. Even without the 3x bonus I'd pay it out for 11 minutes.\n\nA jungler on average would have 15 gold per 10 by taking this item compared to the 7 gold per 10 from Spellthief's and Ancient Coin, which is a ton if they're powerful enough early game to counter jungle monsters worth more than 30 gold.\n\nFinally, all of this stacks so I can have two of the item after taking machete or boots.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-07T21:12:56.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like the range on totem experience will have to controlled so it doesn't reach lanes.
