I think it&#039;s probably about time for 2 things;\n\n1. The skin for OCE servers. We have been waiting over 2 years for this skin, I know you want to make it a really cool skin, but it&#039;s probably about time to just finish it up. I know solo creators who can make a high quality fan made skin in 1-2 days.\n\n2. Draft Pick normals. Blind pick can get a little BS sometimes, and I&#039;d like to practice counter picking for ranked.\n\nIt would be awesome if we could get these done for the start of season 6.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-28T06:31:16.536+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. In order to 'finish it up' they need to have started first, the last we heard of it, was that one of the oce rioters had an idea that wasn't instantly rejected by the skins team. that was the last report of it, I personally am content to wait however long, and if they decide that they don't want to make one then I'm ok with that (although I would like there to be one of course) but because we are associated with water, all the pool party skins are always used when advertising our server and so we can lay claim to them technically. \n\n2. I think that having either norm or ranked 3's is more important than draft pick, after all we do already have summoners rift active and after champ select draft pick means nothing, I'd rather we have a whole new game mode than a different way of selecting champions In a game mode we already have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-09-27T13:14:07.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You seem to not realise that those 175,000 people aren't all UNIQUE players.\nChallenger in OCE pretty much consists of only five people with their multiple accounts.\n\nFor us to have all queues open, we need an ACTIVE playerbase, a playerbase that is large and consistently active.\nWe have this not.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-27T21:03:37.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish Riot would disclose this information, but we can't say this is for sure without official information.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-27T11:02:27.616+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. I would just like to point out that the Oceanic server gave out Pool Party Ziggs to players that transferred during the beta of the server. Whilst I'm sure a lot of players here do not have that skin due to creating accounts on this server this was still a nice gesture by Riot. That said I don't oppose an Oceanic skin being developed. But the biggest issue for creating an Oceanic server is coming up with a concept. Most concepts that have been drawn up for the Oceanic skin are usually Australian themed. The Oceanic server covers several countries, not just Australia. So the biggest goal would be to create a skin that caters to the needs of all the Oceanic region.\n\n2. Even with that figure Riot still believes we do not have enough players to sustain Normal Draft Pick. Queue times for ranked are still fairly long. Riot only just released a 24 hour ranked queue as a test to see if it will sustain without blowing up the matchmaking system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-09-27T10:25:34.482+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Can I get an amen?
