{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-11T08:16:29.730+0000","title":"An Open Letter to Riot Games: Heading into Season 6","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":15,"down_votes":2,"body":"With Season 6 going live in a few days, I think it&#039;s time the community set some guidelines and goals for 2016. Firstly though, I&#039;d like to acknowledge all the ground we&#039;ve made in Season 5. You&#039;ve done a great job with the introduction of the new ranked queue, Champion Mastery system and Hextech Crafting.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can get into what needs to be addressed seriously in Season 6 and possibly onward.\n\n1. **The Replay System. ** \n Riot began working on this sometime around 2013, then randomly stopped. It&#039;s been 3 years since then, we are now the most popular multiplayer video game on the planet, and still have no way of recording our games. \n\n It&#039;s become so bad that Riot uses software made by **a single developer** at Skin Spotlights, for all their official videos and teasers. WTF?\n\n This is disgraceful and needs to be addressed. You guys have stated in the past that technical demands were an issue, but this seems like bull shit now. People are fine with downloading their games anyway, so the server load could be much less than you think ATM.\n\n2. **Sandbox Mode.**\nYou guys decided against this, and I can respect that. I&#039;m just glad you told us.\n\n You did say this though:\n\n _ &quot;We do want to support your ability to grow in mastery, and there may be other avenues to do so, but not this (Sandbox Mode).&quot;_\n\n Season 6 is looking like a great time to start exploring these &quot;other avenues&quot;. You&#039;ve told us that Sandbox Mode is not something you&#039;d like, but given no alternative. I&#039;ll even give a few ideas if you&#039;re stuck:\n\n    + **Super Hard Bot Mode:** Insane dodging, uneven passive gold etc.\n    + **Teaching Spectator Mode:** Currently in DotA 2, spectators are able to draw on the game to help. This would obviously need regulation. http://i.imgur.com/LXpU4Mu.jpg\n\n3. **AFK/Trolling. **\nI&#039;m the last person to complain about this, but the truth is, the system is a little anarchic. \n\n Don&#039;t get me wrong, you&#039;ve done a great job with the verbal abuse side of the tribunal, but intentionally feeding and AFKing, more often than not, goes unpunished for large periods of time. Even on accounts that have multiple offenses.\n\n This is will be a large scale operation, due to how difficult it is to monitor in-game behavior. But it needs to be done. It&#039;s possibly the most common complaint on the boards after imbalance.\n\n4. **Lore.**\n League of Legends lore sucks. I&#039;m sorry, but it&#039;s true.\n \n When I think of great lore games, I think of Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls, Star Wars games etc. League pails in comparison compared to them, and we really shouldn&#039;t. \n\n + The first biggest problem is that; there&#039;s no good official place to read lore. The client lore has one paragraph on Rek&#039;Sai, despite there being a decent amount of lore diary entries, that came with her on release.\n\n + The second problem is, there&#039;s no depth to anything. We have some OK info on **the Watchers** but we don&#039;t go very deep. No large underlying connection to all the different regions.\n\n5. **Skin Updates:**_ (Now we&#039;re into some of the smaller goals.)_\n \n There&#039;s a few old skins like, The Magnificent Twisted Fate and Red Baron Corki, that don&#039;t follow the skin guidelines you guys set [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752874-Guide-to-Skin-Price-Tiers). No harm in giving them a bit of love, right?\n\n6. **Community Game Modes.**\nThe game modes you guys have provided in season 4 and 5 were awesome. It&#039;s been a little lackluster lately though, with some modes on repeat. \n\n The community has limitless ideas on new modes. It would be great if you could listen to them a little, like you do with champion ideas and concepts.\n\nThat&#039;s all I have for now. I might add more to this post later though. Just make sure you don&#039;t loose sight on some of the big issues this season guys. Season 5 wasn&#039;t great on this.\n\nThanks and kind regards.\n_- Telecasterdude_","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-11T13:19:18.115+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\n*Edit wow this is a big post =P\n\nLet me just start off by saying, we definitely want to do more for you guys. We need to clean up a few things on our end (*cough cough* spaghetti code) to deliver things faster but we are making progress (Soon™).\n\n> You've done a great job with the introduction of the new ranked queue, Champion Mastery system and Hextech Crafting\n\nSeason 2016 is going to be a good one, we made a lot of promises upfront about what we want to deliver to you guys.\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/\n\n**Preseason changes** - \n\n* The whole marksman update, making every adc feel more unique in their own way rather than...you know....everyone being auto atk IE into stattik shiv.\n* A tonne new items to help diversification of builds\n* Revamp masteries to make them feel more impactful in game\n* The Rift herald to balance out map pressure (get herald top? or dragon bot?)\n* And the vision rework!\nStill using preseason to balance all of this, but the changes have brought more diversity to the game. (can't wait for first patch of the season!)\n\n**[New Champ select!](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/Mc1nPqMw-new-champion-select-coming-to-ranked-soon)** - need I say more.\n\n**[Ranked Improvements](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/ranked-improvements.html)**\n\nMore for **champion mastery**! Which is why we are looking to introduce **Hextech Crafting**.\n\nSocial Features\n\n* Clubs\n* Parties\n* League friends mobile App\n\nAND Last but not least we announced the **League Client Update Alpha**\n\nWe haven't actually delivered on any of this yet. So we have a lot of work ahead of us to make all of this a reality. Soon™. The reason I bring all of this up is because before we can work on\n\n1) Replay Systems & 2)Sandbox mode, we need to deliver on all of the above first. Then we reevaluate what we should be working on (what adds the MOST value to MOST players) and that may or may not include Replays and Sandbox mode.\n---\n3) **AFK/Trolling**\n\nWe have a system in place called [LeaverBuster](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/updates-leaverbuster) to deal with AFKs and we recently added [intentional feeding bans](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers) to our instant feedback system (4 months ago)\n\nNow I am not saying these systems are perfect, but we have been putting just as much effort into targeting these types of behaviours on top of verbal abuse and negative language in our game. In fact one of the main reasons we are working on the new champ select is because not only will it be a much better experience visually and audibly. It should also remove a main friction point for League of Legends players that always fight for roles. This should not only make the champion select experience a lot smoother (#TeamworkOP) but also make the overall game experience a lot more pleasant.\n\nhere's a similar question that was asked to Riot Lyte a while ago - https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132490777026\n> **What is your stance on the statement \"Riot places more emphasis on punishing flamers than punishing feeders/trolls'?**\n> We've always taken both problems (verbal toxicity and gameplay toxicity) quite seriously. We launched the new Instant Feedback System that addressed verbal toxicity with instant bans after we launched LeaverBuster, which reduced leavers/AFKs dramatically. These two systems targeted different verbal AND gameplay toxicity issues. We've been working on Intentional Feeders in parallel for awhile, but it was a tougher problem to crack because we have to be very, very careful not to ban players who have occasional bad games (or even really awful games).\n> In other words, it's not that we think verbal toxicity is much more important than gameplay toxicity. We just managed to finish research and development of other systems first.\n\n---\n4) **Lore**\n> The first biggest problem is that; there's no good official place to read lore. The client lore has one paragraph on Rek'Sai, despite there being a decent amount of lore diary entries, that came with her on release.\n> \n> The second problem is, there's no depth to anything. We have some OK info on the Watchers but we don't go very deep. No large underlying connection to all the different regions.\n\na) No official place to read lore. No Lore hub. You're right. we don't have this. Maybe it's something we can evaluate with replays and sandbox mode and feature X Y Z once we've delivered on all the 2016 promises so far.\n\nb) OK info on the watchers but nothing else that's deep. First off let me say this we are working on it. That's why we did this - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra (kind of retconned a lot of old lore)\n\nSince then we have released the following Lore\n\n* [Freljord event ](http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/)  (this is where the Watchers came in as you mentioned, glad you liked that!)\n\n* [Shurima event](http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/story/index.html)\n* [Bilgewater event](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/bilgewater/#story-1)\n* [Shadow and Fortune](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/chapter-1.html) (continued from the bilgewater story)\n\nLore updates for a lot of the champions involved; Hecarim, Kalista, Mordekaiser, Thresh, Karthus (I've probably missed some too).\n\nNow please don't get me wrong, I am definitely not saying this is on the same level of depth as Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls or Star Wars like you mentioned, but please keep this in mind. It takes a lot of time to create a great deep compelling story, and we didn't do it right when we released the game. When we released the game the story was almost exclusively there to explain why the Summoners Rift exists and why all these random champions are battling on it. We decided to move away from that to create the kinds of stories that our players, you, deserve. \n\nWarcraft - was released 1994 (21 Years)\nElder Scrolls - was released 1994 (21 years). *Elder Scrolls Arena\nStar Wars - Episode IV A New Hope was released 1977 (38 Years)\nLeague of Legends - was released in 2009 (6 years)\n\nI'm not trying to make excuses, but what I want to say is we are definitely working on it. It's going to take time, and I hope you can understand that.\n---\n\n5) **Skin updates**\n\nThis answer is not as long phew, but once again we are working on it. I guess it just takes time. You can check out a list (might not be comprehensive) here - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule\n\nJust to list a few from the list\n\n* Gangplank\n* Poppy\n* Tristana\n* Sion\n* Twitch\n* Heimerdinger\n\n---\n\n6) Game modes\n\nI don't know much about this actually so can't comment too much. But I know we had All for one for harrowing, special modes for Bilgewater and the poroking was back for snowdown. Would be happy to hear about your ideas for game modes on the gameplay and strategy sub board!\n\nGiant wall of text I know, hope you found it useful though.\n\nTo the people that read it all\nhttps://49.media.tumblr.com/ce2992e272e03264d883ffc80f6f9561/tumblr_mowjer5HDD1s9frcro1_500.gif","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-11T14:59:39.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":">We have a system in place called LeaverBuster to deal with AFKs and we recently added intentional feeding bans to our instant feedback system (4 months ago)\n\nSo we are just going to get the same blanket statements?\n\nHow about an actual stat on what these are doing (IE. How many bans have occurred due to AFKing/Intent Feeding)?\n\n>and we didn't do it right when we released the game. When we released the game the story was almost exclusively there to explain why the Summoners Rift exists and why all these random champions are battling on it. We decided to move away from that to create the kinds of stories that our players, you, deserve.\n\nHonestly the old lore was a decent story, and i am yet to see anything that has happened since this lore rework (for lack of a better word) that honestly required a Retcon, and serious question, do you think the player base \"Deserved\" to have all our lore just put as nothing because you guys can't involve the story around the League existing (or ceasing to exist in a more logical manner then just a delete button)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-11T22:54:53.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey JasonWazza,\n\nLet me try an provide insight into the two topics you raised.\n\n**1) How about actual stats?**\n\nI am definitely not an expert on this field but if you are super interested here is a similar question that was posed to Riot Lyte a while back.\n\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132695895746\n\n> **you say \"harsher punishments are showing pretty successful reform rates.\" Are we ever going to see the statistics? Also are they going to be REAL statistics? I say real because for example \"\"harsher punishments are showing pretty successful reform rates\". Do they even have the option to be 'toxic'?**\n> We've often posted our statistics in academic talks, or industry talks like GDC. However, we're generally not going to post immense detail about statistics in a random social media post or blog post.\n> When I think about it, very few companies release full blown studies on their work to \"prove\" their statistics. Secondly, we're extremely transparent compared to most companies about our data, and you can see numerous peer-reviewed publications about some of our work conducted by external universities. For example:\n> 1) Regulating Anti-Social Behavior on the Internet: The Example of League of Legends (Kou & Nardi, 2013) from UC Irvine\n> 2) Exploring Cyberbullying and Other Toxic Behavior in Team Competition Online Games (Kwak, Blackburn & Han, 2015) from QCRI, Telefonica Research and University of Washington.\n> 3) Predicting Crowdsourced Decisions on Toxic Behavior in Online Games (Blackburn & Kwak, 2014) from University of Washington.\n> 4) Governance in League of Legends: A Hybrid System (Kou & Nardi, 2014) from UC Irvine.\n> We're also officially collaborating on some work coming out later in 2016 with MIT and University of York and both are coming out in peer reviewed journals.\n\n**2) Lore** - The dev blog does a way better job than I (they are the expert story tellers) - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra\n\nBut if I will provide my take and some excerpts from the big post, go a bit more in depth than I did in the initial post.\n\nThe original story was kind of only there to build a \"reason\" to explain why the game was the way it was. \n\n* How did you as a player come into it? **Summoners**\n* Why are there all these champions fighting each other? - **The Institute of War**\n* Why are we fighting on the same map every game? - **The institute of War created the Fields of Justice (Summoners Rift) to resolve conflict in a controllable and systemic way.**\n\nEtc etc\n\n> In the early days of League, we created a fictional background that would justify how players could control champions during games. We came up with concepts like Summoners, Fields of Justice, an Institute of War, and indeed, the League of Legends itself – all in an attempt to provide fictional context for in-game action.\n\nAll of the above caused an interesting issue, with all conflicts being resolved on the Fields of Justice stories would become repetitive. With these all powerful \"Summoners\", our awesome, strong, devious champions just felt like puppets that were being manipulated by higher power.\n\n> After a while, these early choices began to create unexpected problems. Every new champion needed a reason to join and remain in the League, and as their number grew, the net result was that over time the world started to feel, well, small, and eventually less interesting. The institutions we’d designed fostered creative stagnation, limiting the ways that champions, factions and Runeterra itself could grow and change. Furthermore, the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers. The background we’d created to explain in-game action was ultimately restricting the potential narrative development of the game’s defining characters.\n\nSo because of all of this we decided to separate the game and story. \n\n> we’ve decided to push League’s story beyond its original focus on explaining in-game action and forge a new narrative path for Runeterra – a world in which the factions and champions we all know and love have full freedom to grow, travel, and kick ass on a worldwide scale. From champion interactions to bios to events (and beyond), we aim to expand the scope of League’s story and pursue a more dynamic and wide-ranging world fit for the outsized capabilities and personalities of our champions.\n\nWhat about the older stories?\n\n> Does this mean older story efforts like the Journal of Justice and League Judgments are meaningless? Of course not. In the same way that we can go back and enjoy old books, shows, films, art, and comics that have been superseded by more recent interpretations of the same material, League’s original lore remains a cherished part of its history. From comic books to classic literature, exploration of the same creative space in vastly different ways is a natural part of storytelling.\n\nLook I agree with you, it sucks that after that dev blog post it took us awhile before we released anything. I would like to ask what your thoughts and feedback about the stories and champion bio updates I posted above, what did you think?\n\nEspecially the latest Bilgewater novella + Shadow and Fortune continuation.","replies":[{"poster":"Revelstoke","date":"2016-01-13T03:55:05.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maraudaur do us  a favor and stop with the red herring's!\n\nAFAIK Facts are;\n\nThere is no public data or research anywhere to suggest the new Champ select will reduce Feeders/AFK's/Trolls (Red herring #1)\nThere is no public data or research anywhere to suggest Intentional feeder detection is working\n\nThere's plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest it ain't.

I'm really glad this was interesting enough to get you to make your first post on the boards.\n\nLet me just re-emphasise I am always happy to discuss these things. But I do not work on the Player Behaviour team, I am NOT an expert on game design aspects or how they are impacted by human psychology. I am just here providing the information I know is out there and hopefully information that you and other players haven't seen before.\n\nIt was definitely not my intention to red herring any of the discussions, I bought in champ select because it was extremely relevant to the original discussion which was around how we have done a lot for chat behaviour but not leaving and trolling.\n\nLet me try break down your discussion points.\n\n**1) Champion Select - no public data or research anywhere.**\n\nSo I just dug back up this old video - http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020389/Enhancing-Sportsmanship-in-Online\n\nIt talks about champion select and the pre game experience and how that can affect the in game experience. Now I watched this a long time ago, and I know in this video it doesn't say new champ select decreases specifically afk/feeder/trolls. But it does say that if the champion select chat is negative it results in 15% more reports, even if players win.\n\nI guess I merged that statistic with anecdotal reasoning in my head. (Why do people troll/afk/feed in my games? because they didnt get the role they wanted). So it would make sense if we removed that friction point for our players there would be less trolling, afking, feeding and negativity in general.\n\nBut anyway, happy to leave that point out as I personally have no proof or statistics. We all know anecdotal evidence is not something to use as they are extremely unreliable.\n\nAlso if you enjoyed that talk make sure to check out the others - \n2013 - http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n2015 - http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player\n\n**2)There is no public data or research anywhere to suggest Intentional feeder detection is working**\n\nYeah I haven't come across anything yet, I don't think Riot Lyte's ask.fm has had that. Like I said in my latest reply to JasonWazza I will definitely be trying to get some more up to date trends for you guys, but it will take time as the Player Behaviour team is really focused on getting new champ select out and making sure that all runs smoothly to all our League of Legends servers.\n\n**3)So please, stop referring people to Lyte's posts / Articles based off data from prior to April 2013, and usually discussing Tribunal as having any relevance in 2016. (Red herring #2)**\n\nLike I mentioned above, this wasn't an intentional red herring from me. I am just trying to help you guys get an answer for your questions. I don't work on the team, I'm not an expert in this field. But I recalled a similar question was asked directly to Lyte about wanting statistics and wanted to pass on that information. please note in the quote it also stated there would be more peer reviewed journals coming out in 2016 with MIT and University of York.\n**\n4) Question / (Red herring #3) There's no data on how leave buster is working, however some lyte quotes saying 19-34% reduction.**\n\nNot sure if you read my latest response to JasonWazza on this one, but heres the quote for you anyway. TL:DR thought he was asking about Leaverbuster stats, gave it, then realised he was after something slightly different.\n\n> \n> In saying that let me see what I can find out for you, this will take time though as the team that handles Leaverbuster is currently extremely busy working on the release of the new Champion Select. \nOnce again, I'm sorry for not recognizing your statement of the recent increase earlier.

What were your highlights for the most recent lore releases?\n\nLet me just reemphasize, I am always happy to have a discussion but I'm not an expert story writer =). In my personal opinion, if you really think about the old lore with the institute and summoners, if you considered the difference in power levels there was no way champions could challenge summoners (who have the capability to summon them and control them?).\n\nDo we take out the champions from the game that aren't on board with summoners? \nHow do champions fight the institute of war and summoners when they can \"summon minions, monsters, or structures for their use.\"They are gifted spell casters who has the power to bring forth a champion to fight as their avatar in the Fields of Justice.\"\n\nHow would the Shadow Isle's be a compelling evil(?) when there could just be a bunch of summoners that come in and neutralize the threat?\n\nHow could Bilgewater be the lawless town with MF and Gangplank fighting for power when a Summoner could easily come in and bring piece to the region?\n\nHow could Hecarim, Thresh, Karthus, Morde bring death and despair from the shadow isles when they could be stopped easily by a few summoners?\n\nI'm not saying it wasn't painful for players especially lore fans (me included) when we said we are heading in a different direction with lore. I love the direction we took with the Watchers and Freljord, I love the Empire that was Shurima, I love Bilgewater and the power struggle within, I love the new Shadow Isle and its tragic/tainted history. I want MORE lore all the time, but unfortunately it takes time to write and develop deep compelling stories. \n\nIt hurts that we retconned summoners and the institute I thought it was cool at the time too, but I personally don't feel like the stories we have released since would be compelling if I know everything could just be solved the \"right\" and peaceful way through the institute of war and summoners.\n\n---\n\nAs for the Lyte post, \n> \n> we all know those stats are damn well padded to hell to make you look good at these talks, while the stats may be right, the stats are basically lies because you're modifying the conditions so that they are true, and it's not like it's ever been hard to tell.\n\nYou could potentially say anything I say is a lie?\n\nI dug around Riot Lyte's ask.fm here's another relevant post\nhttps://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132562353346 - Below is an excerpt for you\n\n> 3) LeaverBuster - we decided to tackle one of the root causes of leaving/AFKing, and work on a new LeaverBuster system that introduced Low Priority Queues into the game.

(i.e. story doesn't have to explain in game actions and vice versa)\n\n2) Your main gripe is even though our story doesn't have to explain in game actions that doesn't mean we needed to remove summoners, institute and their backstory.\n\nAm I correct in these two statements?\n\nBut let me just address a few of your points, when The League of Legends was a thing. Champions joined for multiple reasons. Including dealing with domestic issues and localized conflicts. In fact if you wanted to make an impact on the world as a champion your best bet is to make a name for yourself in the League of Legends to garner Influence points which you then use to solve issues.\n\n\"Even still, all political entities abide by the governance of the League of Legends. No wise regent would be foolish enough to rail against a vast cabal of immensely powerful magicians, summoners, and champions.\n \n The fights in the various Fields of Justice over which the League presides are not only of great political interest to Valoran, but also of great social interest. The League magically transmits the sights and sounds of the action as it unfolds to specially built arcane receivers located in key settlements throughout Valoran. Watching a fight in a Field of Justice is one of the more popular entertainment activities Valoran’s denizens engage in.\"\nSource - http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_League_of_Legends\n\n\n\" In the lore, the concept of influence covers a wide range of potential things. They could be favors, promises of support, IOUs - whatever the summoners decide on. It also can represent wealth and physical possessions - things, both tangible and intangible, that helps promote a summoner's personal agenda.\"\n Source - http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=249763&page=1#post2924382\n\nThis was posted on reddit a year ago to sum up why each Champion joined the League of Legends\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2cdw6i/why_did_champion_join_the_league_of_legends/\nIt ranged from a variety of reasons\n\n* spreading the Wuju style\n* Unite and strengthen Bilgewater\n* For the Winters Claw\n* right the injustice in the world, regulate magical experimentation, advance techmaturgy\n* to find leads on Du Couteau's disappearance\n\netc etc\n\nI guess my main point is, how do we get a sense of Runterra as a vast, open and compelling world when every notable person comes to the League of Legends/Institute of War.\n---\n\nOkay now onto the next topic which seems a bit more contentious. You are making some very concerning claims, I would be very interested in seeing some specific examples of what you are talking about.\n\n> Cause as far as i can tell, i'm asking about the increase recently, not the decrease that was observed months ago.\n\nSo I've shown you studies and figures to show that LeaverBuster has been successful. Now it looks like what you are actually after is numbers and facts to disprove that recently there has actually been an increase. Maybe that's what you were saying from the start, I apologize for missing that context earlier.\n\nWhat makes you think there has been an increase recently?\n\nHave you done some studies, surveys to back up your statement about there being an increase recently?\n\nUsually when I have a discussion I always provide proof and sources for any claims I make. When two parties are in a discussion and one asserts a claim that the other disputes, the one who asserts has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim.\n\nNow I know this is hard for you as a player to prove that there IS in fact an increase recently. It's just extremely difficult to have an engaging discussion where everything you say is assumed to be true while everything I say requires sources and proof.\n\nIn saying that let me see what I can find out for you, this will take time though as the team that handles Leaverbuster is currently extremely busy working on the release of the new Champion Select.\n\nOnce again, I'm sorry for not recognizing your statement of the recent increase earlier.

We need to clean up a few things on our end (*cough cough* spaghetti code) to deliver things faster but we are making progress (Soon™).\n> \n> Season 2016 is going to be a good one, we made a lot of promises upfront about what we want to deliver to you guys.\n> http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/\n> \n> **Preseason changes** - \n> \n> * The whole marksman update, making every adc feel more unique in their own way rather than...you know....everyone being auto atk IE into stattik shiv.\n> * A tonne new items to help diversification of builds\n> * Revamp masteries to make them feel more impactful in game\n> * The Rift herald to balance out map pressure (get herald top? or dragon bot?)\n> * And the vision rework!\n> Still using preseason to balance all of this, but the changes have brought more diversity to the game.

It should also remove a main friction point for League of Legends players that always fight for roles. This should not only make the champion select experience a lot smoother (#TeamworkOP) but also make the overall game experience a lot more pleasant.\n> \n> here's a similar question that was asked to Riot Lyte a while ago - https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/132490777026\n> \n> ---\n> 4) **Lore**\n> \n> a) No official place to read lore. No Lore hub. You're right. we don't have this. Maybe it's something we can evaluate with replays and sandbox mode and feature X Y Z once we've delivered on all the 2016 promises so far.\n> \n> b) OK info on the watchers but nothing else that's deep. First off let me say this we are working on it. That's why we did this - http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra (kind of retconned a lot of old lore)\n> \n> Since then we have released the following Lore\n> \n> * [Freljord event ](http://promo.leagueoflegends.com/en/freljord/)  (this is where the Watchers came in as you mentioned, glad you liked that!)\n> \n> * [Shurima event](http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/shurima/story/index.html)\n> * [Bilgewater event](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/bilgewater/#story-1)\n> * [Shadow and Fortune](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/shadow-and-fortune/chapter-1.html) (continued from the bilgewater story)\n> \n> Lore updates for a lot of the champions involved; Hecarim, Kalista, Mordekaiser, Thresh, Karthus (I've probably missed some too).\n> \n> Now please don't get me wrong, I am definitely not saying this is on the same level of depth as Warcraft, The Elder Scrolls or Star Wars like you mentioned, but please keep this in mind. It takes a lot of time to create a great deep compelling story, and we didn't do it right when we released the game. When we released the game the story was almost exclusively there to explain why the Summoners Rift exists and why all these random champions are battling on it. We decided to move away from that to create the kinds of stories that our players, you, deserve. \n> \n> Warcraft - was released 1994 (21 Years)\n> Elder Scrolls - was released 1994 (21 years). *Elder Scrolls Arena\n> Star Wars - Episode IV A New Hope was released 1977 (38 Years)\n> League of Legends - was released in 2009 (6 years)\n> \n> I'm not trying to make excuses, but what I want to say is we are definitely working on it. It's going to take time, and I hope you can understand that.\n> ---\n> \n> 5) **Skin updates**\n> \n> This answer is not as long phew, but once again we are working on it. I guess it just takes time. You can check out a list (might not be comprehensive) here - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule\n> \n> Just to list a few from the list\n> \n> * Gangplank\n> * Poppy\n> * Tristana\n> * Sion\n> * Twitch\n> * Heimerdinger\n> \n> ---\n> \n> 6) Game modes\n> \n> I don't know much about this actually so can't comment too much. But I know we had All for one for harrowing, special modes for Bilgewater and the poroking was back for snowdown. Would be happy to hear about your ideas for game modes on the gameplay and strategy sub board!\n> \n> Giant wall of text I know, hope you found it useful though.\n> \n> To the people that read it all\n> https://49.media.tumblr.com/ce2992e272e03264d883ffc80f6f9561/tumblr_mowjer5HDD1s9frcro1_500.gif\n\nSmall question about game mode suggestions from the community, is it actually possible for RIot to read a suggestion, and take into consideration about making the game-mode come to life?

Their names blocked out of course and if these people are found guilty they shall suffer a somewhat more substantial ban. 6+ months on their account but this is only after 24 hour or 6 hour bans have taken place previously.\n\nThere needs to be more risk when it comes to feeding or trolling otherwise the community is still going to be toxic if they know they can get away with a slap on the wrist.\n\nThoughts?","replies":[]}]}]}
