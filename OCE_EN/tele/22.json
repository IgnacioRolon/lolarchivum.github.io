Every time Ekko goes back in time he ends up in the same position. His hand pulling on an ignition chain for his time machine. This probably means that in-game you can set a \"recall point\" just before a team fight, if the team fight goes bad, you take your whole team back to the recall point. This would allow counter-play, rather than just going back 7 seconds (imagine, you&#039;d never be ganked). \n\nAlso look at how his injuries seem to stay even when he goes back in time. When the Singed/Urgot thing crushes his arm it stays limp for the rest of the fight. Probably in-game he&#039;ll reset everyone&#039;s cooldowns and health but not his own (or else you would just spam ult right?).\n\nTL;DR\nHis ult is going to go back to a certain point, not go back by a set time. It will also manipulate time around Ekko, but not his own time (no cooldown resets for Ekko himself etc.)","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-11T08:19:47.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And with the monster its singed mainly bcz the tank, gas and lack of crab legs lel\nBut that arm doe","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-11T08:21:46.515+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Monster/opponent has been confirmed to be neither Singed nor Urgot, just an unnamed Zaunite BBEG.\nStill, it's not the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-05-11T09:36:22.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"apparently it is a champion though so maybe sion skin?","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-11T11:05:28.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Ghazan,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=WQHxP83j,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-05-11T09:36:22.300+0000)\n>\n> apparently it is a champion though so maybe sion skin?\n\nTanks? gas? either singed a monster OR unlikely urgot? tho only feature is his arm","replies":[{"poster":"2Kills1Cat","date":"2015-05-13T10:21:01.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOpe riot confirmed not urgot rework or singed said it was just another zaunite thug surrender@20 has the link to twitter posts but if it is somebody its obviously bane duh","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-13T11:35:27.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They said **it's not a champion, neither is the thug an Urgot or Singed rework** the character is **just a zaunite thug.**","replies":[{"poster":"2Kills1Cat","date":"2015-05-13T11:38:50.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont understand the need for bold if you just said what i said.
