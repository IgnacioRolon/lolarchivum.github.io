I mean who checks range indicators on Renektons Q before casting it? No one - they can tell the range and telling the range of skillshots like Jinx's Zap etc isn't really any different and if you are smart-casting you are essentially able to cast and combo skills far faster and the more skills you have to chain IMO the more important and beneficial it is to be able to smart cast.\n\nThe difference is only minor though so it shouldn't really effect you that much but it does affect clutches and combos etc and can be game-changing.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-06-28T14:45:51.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really?

It is really not possible to make gold teir without quickcasting?\n\nEveryone else uses quick cast (or at least the vast majority of players) so you don't gain a \"big advantage\" rather remove a small disadvantage you've placed on yourself.\n\nAnd it's possible to climb with quickcasting off, however you learn to be more autonomous with quick cast turned on (meaning you do the necessary thinking without actually thinking about it)","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-28T15:21:10.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen a j4 \"slingshot\" gank which was enabled because of the delay from normal casting.\n\nJust saying","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-29T10:10:30.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesnt make any sense.
