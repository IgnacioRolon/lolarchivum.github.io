But the last game I played as Amumu in ranked was complete bulll shit. Our total MMR accounting to op.gg was 1360 and the enemies were 1500. We had one Gold player rest low to mid Silver, they had all Gold but one Silver 1 player. We got annihilated.\r\n\r\nI wanted to ask is 200 MMR difference between teams pretty common? Because I didn&#039;t feel like that was fair fun match at all. \r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nA 1300 MMR team got matched with 1500 MMR, is this normal?","replies":[]}
