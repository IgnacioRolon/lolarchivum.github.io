Janna is mainly classified as a disengage support which means she is better at preventing and spliting up fights rather than starting them. Janna's kit rewards more passive play in the early game by protecting the duo lane with shields and preventing fights with her knock up and slow. Janna works best with late game carries, such as jinx & kogmaw, because she can protect them in the early/mid game while also giving them a big attack damage buff on shield in the late game. The reason why you aren't doing so well as janna is because you aren't playing her to her strengths. So instead of trying to make picks you should be aiming to make plays in team fights by protecting you damage dealers and preventing the enemy team from engaging on your team","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-05-09T02:52:07.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I kind of see what you mean, but how do I get my ADC fed in the first place so he's worth protecting? If I can't make picks, it's really hard to get ADC fed.

Also the reason why I said that late game carries work well is because if you are protecting them and letting them free farm then they will just scale better than other adcs. So early game your main focus should be onletting your carry farm, mid game game try get some map objectives with your ADC or just group, team fight and protect your ADC letting them get gold and possibly kills. Also your point about blitz and morg is also a valid point. Janna doesn't do too well against poke or zone heavy lanes. So if you get into a situation like this basically just play safe, shield as much damage as possible while trying to keep up with the opponent.\n\nTL:DR\nJanna should try to passively lane\nThen she can start getting getting her ADC fed in team fights where janna succeeds very well","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-21T03:44:56.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, here is what I learnt not so long ago.\n\nThere are two different classifications that I give to a support; How tanky they are and what they do to help the ADC.\n\nFor example, I found Alistar to be a Tanky Peeler. He keeps the enemies off of his ADC, but he doesn't exactly fair well when going aggressive against most other champs.\n\nOn the other hand, Morgana is a squishy poker. Her Q W combo deals a lot of damage to enemies, while her Q alone offers quite a long CC duration giving her ADC the chance to layeth the smakethdown (score a kill)\n\nJanna would be a squishy peeler, keeping the enemies away from her ADC. Peelers generally enjoy passive lanes and just sitting back and throwing the general nado/headbutt/other form of GTFO to the enemy.  Keep your ADC alive and save them from the predicaments that they seem to always find themselves in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ForStSpyda","date":"2015-05-21T02:55:28.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=EMEugKPI,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-05-09T02:13:23.411+0000)\n>\n> I main Thresh, Leona and Braum.
