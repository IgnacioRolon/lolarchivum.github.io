Just looking for a bit of help.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve always struggled against the reworked Soraka. I know I&#039;m supposed to focus her, I&#039;m able to do that in team-fights and skirmishes. My biggest problem is trading in the laning phase.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s very hard to land hooks or any CC on Soraka, because she&#039;s always so far back in trades. For half of the early game laning phase, she&#039;ll actually just use pots to sustain and wont need to Q for health. Because of this, I&#039;m always getting outraded, and loosing the laning phase.\r\n\r\nI always pick aggressive hook supports into her, but seems really ineffective early. Ever since the ignite change she&#039;s been problematic for me.\r\n\r\nAny tips on Soraka counter champions or trading techniques are much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-08T00:32:02.596+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Burst, CC and hard engage are good against Soraka. Think Leona, Blitz, Annie, etc. Depending on your lane comp at some point you may be able to just ignore her and instakill the ADC before they can get healed. e.g. Leona + Graves post-6 after Graves has a BF Sword. Even if you're able to instakill the ADC though, if you're playing Blitz then just go for Soraka each time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-09T05:15:30.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you talking about in a 1v1 situation or?\ni mainly play support and Soraka is my main\nwhen u say hooks, i assume you are using hero like robot or thresh?\ni don't think they are very effective counter against Soraka\n\nlike u say, us supporter stay at the back out of enemy reach healing our ADC or who ever we are supporting\neven in a 1v1 situation we stay as far away from enemy as possible. why?\nas you know Soraka can not heal herself, yet every time she heals someone he loses HP\nand her Q is very slow casting\nduring early stage that is a real problem, especially facing high dmg hero with dashing or stun skill\n\neven with items, soraka has very little HP and def, very very fragile\none wrong movement will give enemy the chance to dash up/stun and do high damage on Soraka\nin a 1v1 situation, once you get close to soraka\neven if i could silence you, even if i could land Q on you\nbefore the next Q cd, i am already dead, or left with little hp\n\ni might suggest using ADC, or hero with long ranged skill to get Soraka\nwait for her to make that one wrong move, and release hell onto her\n\nhowever, during early stage you don't really need to focus on Soraka imo\ninstead focus on killing the hero she's supporting because Soraka's healing power is very little during that time\nin a 2v2 situation, if the two of you separate dmg onto two hero, they will both get away for sure, especially after Soraka hits lv6\nbut if you only focus on the one, Soraka will not be able to heal in time\n\nhope it help a little","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-08T09:50:47.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:92}}  \nAmen","replies":[]}]}
