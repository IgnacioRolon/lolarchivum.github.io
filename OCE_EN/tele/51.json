I always thought I was getting 25 - 30 LP gains because I was playing these higher ranked players.\r\n\r\nBut then I played some duo queue with a friend and everyone on the enemy team was Silver 5 -  4. I earned **37 LP** for that game.\r\n\r\nWTF happened? I should have earned like 15 LP since everyone was lower elo than me. Is ranked changed now?","replies":[]}
