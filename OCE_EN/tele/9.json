I&#039;m just looking for any general tips along with some answers to these questions if possible.\r\n\r\n1. Who are the 2 most impactful junglers on throughout the game (not just early).\r\n\r\n2. I usually try to gank top or mid once after my first clear, but then once I buy, I almost exclusively stay on the bot side. Is this bad?\r\n\r\n3. How much are early dragons worth?\r\n\r\n4. How do I play devourer champions, like Shyvanna and Warwick without my laners getting dominated in lane?\r\n\r\n5. I think I struggle a bit with item builds. How do I know whether I should get Dead Man&#039;s Plate, Sunfire Cape or Randuin&#039;s Omen as my first armour/health item?\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nHow do I become a better jungler?","replies":[{"poster":"Shyvana Bot","date":"2015-09-07T00:47:46.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like to play evelynn, \n\nThe many advantages of Evelynn:\n1- Stealth, may more gank opportunities due to not having to worry about wards\n2- Can easy lvl 2 invade the enemy\n3- Can build either full damage of full tank, both are viable\n4- Very easy to play, as long as you understand how to avoid being seen\n\nYou should be ganking the lane you want to shut down or help. For example if your top lane is a lulu and the enemy is a mundo. You generally don't want to gank that lane too often. Because ganking for the lulu doesn't affect her late game too much and shutting down the mundo doesn't affect him either. But if your mid is a zed against a yasuo, you generally want to pitch your tent and stay there because both have extreme snowball potential.\n\nAs for dragon, you generally want to get dragon whenever the situation presents itself for you.\n1- Is the jungler top or dead and bot is free to help?- Get Drag\n2- Did you just ace the enemy?- Get drag\n3- Is the whole enemy team mia?- Don't get Drag\n\nAlso, the first drag isn't that important, don't risk a death just to try and contest it. \n\nThe trick to devourers is to just ignore your lanes, farm farm farm, because you are playing devourers in order to carry late game. If you are unsure of your laners' skill don't play a devourer champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-06T23:50:13.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK for Devourer Junglers either Udyr, shyvana, Warwick, Vi\n\nbest two are probably Vi and Shyvana(but i prefer shyvana)\n\nfor shyvana build i go\n\n1-stalkers blade/blue smite-devourer\n2-sunfire cape\n3-Blade of the ruined king\n4-trinity force\n5-ravenous hydra\n6-black cleaver\n\nyou may not build it in that order-its really situational-i then run tanky runes and masteries\n\nalso all these items are expensive but the farming to get sated really helps-also gank and take dragons whenever an opportunity arises","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-06T11:33:32.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) Pretty hard to answer. All champions have the chance to effect early and late game depending on how fed they and the rest of the players in the game are. Some junglers that stick out in my mind as being \"present\" from beginning until end are Xin, Udyr, maybe tanky junglers like Naut and Gragas?\n\n2) I too like staying on the bottom half of the map. Top should expect to have to hold their lane by themselves, and if you're banking enough on the bottom two lanes, the enemy jungler should be practically forced to mirror your pathway to make sure his laners aren't being set back. I like it because you have 3 champs to cover you if you need to make an escape, as opposed to two.\n\n3) Early drags are great, and if you can solo them, always try after you hit level 6. But never go for them if it means losing kills. What is _far_ more important than early dragons, is warding of early dragons. Your job as jungler should be to control drag, and that means vision, even if you can't contest. At least with vision, you other lanes know they can push other objectives if dragon is too risky to contest.\n\n4) Don't forget, you still get devourer points for kills and assists. But yes, your laners will still have to cope somewhat by themselves. You can make it a bit easier on them with communication. Let them grab the lesser monsters in your jungle, but make sure they leave the larger ones for you. Extra gold for them, you clear jungles quicker, more ganks, happier for everyone.\n\n5) For item builds, I always set up my Item Sets. I will research first on League Wikia, and Mobafire. I will put a category for 'Essential Items', and then optional 'Offensive Items' and 'Defensive Items'. If I'm not getting my arse kicked, I will usually build all of my core essential items. That's usually 2-3 plus boots. Then my last two items will be either Offensive items to hammer home the advantage if I'm unkillable, or Defensive items if I'm getting targeted/killed loads. If I reaaaaaally need to step up my game, then I'll rush a Defensive item (or part of it, such as an MR item) before even a core item. The exception to this is there's a particular counter item for a fed enemy champ, like Thornmail, in which case I'll get that in place of a normal Defensive Item. So if you set up your items in this way, it becomes far clearer on how to progress your champion throughout the game. Research is the main key I'd give for this point.\n\nHope this helps!","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-05T08:59:34.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) No simple answer to that. Considering youre new to jungling I'd recommend champs that are fairly straightforward to play and are decent at all stages of the game like Xin Zhao, Vi, Rek'sai.\n\n2) It's not bad to stay mainly on one side of the map, but where your time will be best spent will vary from game to game. Before the game even starts try to look out for enemy champions that will likely be easy to gank (ones with no escape spells, squishy, likely to be pushing the lane a lot etc.) and allied champs that will be able to set up/follow up on ganks well (gap closers, cc, good burst early) and form a bit of a gameplan from here. Also try not to waste time by ending up on a side of the map with no jungle to farm, or trying to force ganks that have a low chance of success.\n\n3) They're good to get, but don't overcommit yourself trying to get one. Usually the best time to get the first drag is just after you've ganked bot or mid and either killed them or forced them to recall. Somewhere between 5-10 minutes you should start trying to keep drag warded and get the rift scuttler so the enemy can't pick up an easy dragon without you noticing.\n\n4) You don't. You should expect your lanes to be behind if you're farming while the enemy jungler is putting pressure on the map, it's the tradeoff you're making for a strong lategame. You need to be able to pick up the slack later if you want to do well consistently with devourer champions.\n\n5)Deadmans plate is probably the best most of the time. Randuins is geared more towards the lategame now when enemies have more crit, though is still worth to pick up early against several autoattackers or if it's the only armour item you'll be buying. Sunfire cape isn't worth buying unless you need the aoe, in which case you should've already bought cinderhulk, so basically never get this on junglers. frozen heart/thornmail are also decent armour options if you've already got hp from other items.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-05T22:11:28.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for this man.

I'd have to say {{champion:102}}&{{champion:254}} But that also determines what your role has a JG is like  Tank Damage etc. {{champion:421}} is also a great JG champion\n\n2) Apart from taking towers and destroying the Nexus one of the most Key things is taking Dragon so don't hesitate to take, Just make sure its in your control all the time keep it well warded and try to take it asap.\n\n3) In almost all circumstances Dragon taking is the most key thing in the game (part from taking nexus) so the earlier the better.\n\n4) Ganking and farming can be hard for new farmers in experienced JG without having to put up with \"Shitty JG never ganks now I'm behind.\" or \"Noob JG lost dragon or never ganks.\" So basically with devourer JG champs I normally start by getting Gromp, blue then red or Golems red then blue then back get devourer JG item then kill rift scutter then gank a lane.(hopefully we get first blood or waste there flashes.) \n\n5) With Armour/Health normally I get {{item:3068}} as it is very helpful in those JG camps with the extra damage, unless I will be ganking lots instead of {{item:3068}} I would get Randuins Omen.\n\n\nHopefully these tips have helped and Good Luck in the JG.\n\nP.S. Don't forget Smite because without smite you can't get any JG items.\nP.S.2 Also try not to camp top if dragon is still up or the enemy will prob get free dragon.","replies":[]}]}
