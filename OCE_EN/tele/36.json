Before everyone downvotes, just read a bit more ;) \nYeah, I know there are few assassins that are doing decent right now, such as these guys {{champion:91}} {{champion:238}} {{champion:76}} {{champion:105}}.\nBut honestly the great majority of &quot;true&quot; assassins have been in a bad place since the great assassin purge in [patch 5.2](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-52-notes). \n\n>Lets look at a few examples:\n\n>{{champion:121}}**Kha&#039;Zix**  - This poor guy hasn&#039;t any serious play since **mid season 4**, almost 2 years ago.\n\n>{{champion:84}} **Akali** - Now that she&#039;s no longer super easy to play, she&#039;s completely out-classed by the other assassins.\n\n>{{champion:55}} **Katarina** - The only AP assassin to survive the 5.2 patch, but was nerfed shortly after. She&#039;s around the low tier of winrates for a bit, and her play rate massively dropped.\n\n>{{champion:38}} {{champion:28}} {{champion:245}} {{champion:56}} {{champion:107}} and {{champion:7}}?\n\n>I know a few of those guys are just recently bad, but the main thing I&#039;m trying to say is that **assassins aren&#039;t what they used to be. **There&#039;s now a few decent assassins and everyone else is beyond trash tier. \n\n>**Nutty** (challenger player) has a great video on this;\n\n>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxXGT5aYOYc\n\n+ _**\"So why is it like this?\"**_\n\n>The 5.2 purge happened for a reason. Assassins were so broken at the time, ADCs were effectively useless and utility mids were just not as good in that meta. Many ADC and support mains complained, and Riot realised that the game couldn&#039;t be in that state too much longer.\n\n+ _**\"Cool, what&#039;s wrong? I like being alive as ADC\"**_\n\n>Well, we are in an ADC meta right now. **Dignitas ** just played 3 marksmen against **TSM** who had 2 marksmen in [NA LCS](https://youtu.be/GjoX2LqOAuQ?t=7m59s) just yesterday. \nWe&#039;re in a meta where; **Graves** Jungle, **Quinn** Top and **Corki** Mid are top tier picks. Now even **Kalista** Top is being played in Korea.\n\n>_Something is wrong IMO, when you have all these ADC&#039;s, yet assassins are still second tier and not doing their job properly._ Weak items {{item:3035}} {{item:1400}} , and strong counter items {{item:3053}} are hurting assassins. The video I linked above explains this really well^\n\n>{{item:3147}} was kinda nice, but it actually benefits utility-assassins like **Jarvan** and **Pantheon**, who really needed this to reliably be able to 100 to 0 people.\n\n+ _**\"Yeah, but whenever assassins are strong this game is toxic AF. Better to keep this way.\"**_\n\n>Exactly the problem. Assassins are really really frustrating to play against for so many roles, especially ADC. But something got me wondering;\n\n* _**\"Why don&#039;t mid laners have this problem?\"**_ \n\n>It&#039;s the **Orianna**s, **Ahri**s and** Annie**s who have to face off against these assassins for most of the game, yet they complain so much less, but are just as squishy. ADC&#039;s have a **whole role** there to help them with assassins but they still have trouble.\n\n>The reason is {{item:3157}}.\nWhenever any mid is focused hard by an assassin in a fight, they&#039;ll pop this and let tanks deal with it. ADC doesn&#039;t have this option. Which leads to the main point:\n\n+ _**\"The Zhonya&#039;s active should be reworked into a summoner spell.\"**_\n\n>It&#039;s really powerful active for an item anyway, and it&#039;s very clear that more champions than just mid laners need it badly. Obviously, once this happens we can start making cool viable assassin items with utility, that enhance kits.\n\nSorry for the long post guys, just read the last bit above here, if you&#039;re lazy XD\nAny thoughts would be much appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-22T08:59:10.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So just going to look at this in order (all from Champion.gg)\n\nWin Rate\nTalon: 52.17%\nZed: 51.67%\nNidalee: 50.12% (i don't know why she is on the list of good assassins)\nFizz: 50.26%\n\nSo first out these are the \"top class champions\" according to your post.\n\nKha'Zix: 45.88%\nAkali: (Mid) 47.33% (top isn't a usable statistic for this as Tank Akali top lane is a thing.)\nKatarina: 47.23%\nKassawin: 46.03%\nEvelynn: 50.21%\nEkko: (Mid) 45.62% (Top) 47.81% (this is slightly tank, and Jungle Ekko isn't being used because the meta is tank jungle ekko.)\nNocturne: 48.72%\nRengar: (JG) 46.98% (Top) 48.6%\nLeblanc: 45.95%\n\n\n\nSo now lets get into the meat.\n\nFirst and foremost, using what the meta is in professional play to justify that assassin's are weak, is not really useful, as being a team they tend to slightly counter Assassin's by the communication, as for why Marksman are seeing the play time, it's mostly due to the marksman update, let's analyze what you used as the team comp.\n\n>We're in a meta where; Graves Jungle, Quinn Top and Corki Mid are top tier picks.\n\nGraves Jungle is still tanky so he ends up being half tank half marksman, Quinn top, is just mobility, and especially in team games the mobility of the champion to be able to join fights as a top laner without teleport means a lot, and Corki mid basically subs for a caster, especially with all his hybrid damage (Corki tends to be 60-80% magic damage based on how often you use auto's.)\n\nSo the real problem here is that we are in a meta where Marksmen, outclass their counterparts in other categories (Graves out classing tank jungles, Corki out classing caster's mid), and they all do so with a lot in their kit to deal with assassin's (which is why you can't pick assassin's in these games).\n\nThis doesn't mean that Assassin's are inherently weak, it just means that these marksmen in particular are TOO strong with very little counterplay (reminds me of Juggernauts ;) )\n\nNow lets come back around, and deal with the assassin's in general.\n\nI'll start with Kassawin, the problem with Kassadin in the current meta is the inherent lack of Magic damage in most comps, this results in our anti-mage assassin having problems in his games, Kassadin is still strong but the meta has shifted to being focused on AD's.\n\nGiven the AD point, let's go to Rengar, now if you recall Rengar was amazing, until he got taken down a few notches and given some viable counterplay, the problem now, is that without that instant snare AND the increased knowledge of range, AD's have a lot of time to prepare to sidestep the snare, resulting in Rengar dying quite easily, the problem here actually lies in the changes that riot made, they gave the E a Cast time while mid air AND made him known sooner, this basically means that because mobile ADC's are a thing, he got screwed, had it been one or the other, Rengar would still be viable, but he isn't.\n\nNow i'll come into my favourite champion, Nidalee, honestly she has been in the ditch for so long that her being good in the meta is fine to me, but fact is she is only 50% (5.23 she was 45.83%), this is a showing of strong Runic echoes is but nidalee tends to bring a double edged sword, and that is her damage is basically all she has, sure she is mobile and does damage, but she has no utility outside of a mediocre heal, so as a champion she is fairly balanced in that her win rate is a showing of how skilled you are on her, she can be overwhelming, but that tends to be the good nidalai (nidalee's?)\n\nTalon and Zed i will do in one, because the fulfill the same niche, just one is AoE, and one isn't as AoE, These two are interesting, in that they tend to be very viable thanks to the new item, why? because the item fixes their biggest problem, which is how do i deal with the tank, that is why they are increasingly meta, however they aren't in meta for LCS due to organization, yes you can argue they were meta, but this is a very different meta to when they were fully meta.\n\nKatarina and Leblanc, how they are frustrating, these are the ones that tend to instigate the \"This meta is horrid\" sort of feelings, the 100 to 0 stuff they can do is just annoying, and Kata and her resets are horrid, these ones tend to have to be skill based or else you will hear the rampant cries of Reddit.\n\nThe last one i will mostly discuss is Evelynn, she is basically in an interesting spot as a champion, she is great in lower elos because of the lack of cohesion and disorganization, but is knocked on her ass by a few pinks in higher elo, honestly her 50% win rate is mostly just runic echoes most likely.\n\nNow i want to round this out with your final discussion, and that is a Zhonya's Summoner spell, and the utility champs that still exist.\n\nSo first, the reason you see less complaining out of the Annie's, Ahri's and Orianna's of the world, is because of their kit's, they have CC to stop the Assassin in their tracks once they are jumped, and if they are killed, they were generally outplayed, Marksmen don't have this luxury, they have to try and kill the assassin before they are popped to have a chance of living, because they simply lack the ability to counter play the champions jumping them.\n\nAs for the Zhonya's summoner spell, there are a few problems with that.\n1. Counterplay to Zed in a Summoner spell, Zed would be screwed (this depends on the duration of the effect but is mostly accurate).\n2. This just gives utility mages another item in exchange for a Summoner spell that they likely weren't even using anyway.\n3. Marksman having this spell at their disposal on top of QSS would just be a royal pain in the ass.\n4. Dear god i don't want to see this in low elo, that would be disgusting to watch the ADC use in the middle of lane for no real reason and to just die from.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-22T20:59:02.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wont go into much depth on your champion statements, as stuff like this is largely opinion based. Although looking straight at the stats you provided, assassins are in a weak place. Most were at below 50%.\n\nIt's not just that they are hard to play either, champion.gg only uses data from Platinum or higher, where most players should be comfortable with complex champions.\n\nI will go into depth about my Zhonya's summoner spell though:\n\n1. I did mention that:\n\n _ \"Obviously, once this happens we can start making cool viable assassin items with utility, that enhance kits.\"_\n \n Essentially, we can buff assassins and give them utility items like tanks have. Maybe like a AD item, with a passive like **Deadman's**.\n\n2. The stats on the **Zhonya's** replacement item would be similar, 100 AP + Utility. Kind of like when **Luden's** replaced **DFG**. I doubt it would change too much at all, since they still have the active available as a summoner spell.\n\n3. Might be problematic for hook champions or kits that revolve around locking down targets. \n\n A few friends actually raised this point to me. I'd say maybe still allowing the target to be displaced in Zhonya's would fix this (they still take no damage though). We'd never really know until a play test :D\n\n4. Ahaha I really wanna see a Zhonya's missclick compilation now","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-23T12:08:20.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While that is accurate, i feel i didn't bring my point across that it's more the marksman being too strong then the assassin's being too weak.\n\nAlso\n\n1. i may have read that as \"mage items\" but the point stands that the same point follows, Zed is boned with that summoner spell.\n\n2. The difference is actually in the removal of the need for Zhonya's, mostly Zhonya's is bought as a need rather than a want, this puts that need into a summoner spell (also pushing it onto everyone) and means mages have a lot more choice in their item builds (as they are locked in very heavily in some cases, eg. Mana item, Zhonya's, Deathcap at some point, removing one of the main items is massive) whether or not they get the same AP is a null factor.\n\n3. That would be disgusting to have happen, oh your zhonya's, your now a free pull for our blitzcrank who is now a counter champion to your summoner spell and makes Zed + Displacement champ teams really powerful.\n\n4.

Maybe you're right. Although ignite heavily counters Swain, yet he reaches 51%+ winrates often. It's not as straight forward as it seems.\n2. Mages were given this option when they buffed **Deathcap**. Since most/all full AP items give 80AP or 100 AP you can now pick and choose between **Luden's** and **Rylai's** without loosing much damage. Before it was **Deathcap**, **Luden's** and **Zhonya's** or no damage.\n\n3. There needs to be a downside to using an ability like this Zhonya's or it will become OP. This way we can keep the cooldown relatively short. Hooks and other displacements have plenty of counterplay, but rewarding when used.

I'm saying it's not a good thing that you're letting mages go other utility over countering the zed, if your going to counter a champion, it shouldn't be in champion select with a summoner spell.\n\n3. there are several downsides, in that you have to stay where you are doing nothing, but that said, the cooldown can't be \"relatively short\" it needs to be 240 seconds, having it any lower is just stupid, but adding to the whole \"you have to stand here and do nothing part\" if it adds \"you have to stand here and not only be a target when it ends, but during the whole thing\" then this would probably be a buff to zed in the end instead of a nerf.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-24T06:52:05.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like the Zed problem solved itself then XD","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-24T07:28:58.283+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well considering Zed needs neither a buff nor a nerf (possibly a slight nerf but i dunno about that)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-23T12:16:44.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My problem is that god damn cow buff, it used to be you got the skill to do it you win, now its impossible to stuff up unless you're that retarded to its free team fights every time with nearly 2 seconds+ of easy cc which cant be dodged without busting flash or some sort of blink.\n\nAlistar was always the \"perform combo well and easy win\" now he is just a big fat prick spamming insta kills on teams, and because he is tanky as fuq you can't do much to him.\n\nhe is the 2nd most aidsy thing in this game other than malz space aids... because those are aids...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-22T08:13:22.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kassadin is fine from my experience and I've seen a few Nocturnes recently.
