Do you really kid? Well, let me tell you that what you think is trolling, isn't _grieving _, get that into your puny little head kid.

Like you, for not knowing the difference, forcing me to show you the difference.\n\nMy horrible attitude above is an example of _grieving_.\n\nTrolling comes in many flavours and can even be fairly innocuous but depending on the person effected the miles may vary in how it goes down. Hell, starting out in LoL double top was something I enjoyed because new players can't really jungle with limited masteries and NO runes. Nowadays though, please, get the fuck out of my lane. PISS OFF. STOP FOLLOWING ME. I AM NOT PLAYING POPPY SUPPORT I FUCKING CALLED MY LANE - GET THE FUCK DOWN THERE THRESH. YOU PICKED AND SAID NOTHING, YOU EVEN HAVE EXHAUST TO FURTHER CONFUSE EVERYONE. And now JINX IS FUCKING DEAD. FIRST BLOOD. YOUR FAULT. %%%%.\n\nNow, this is very likely not what went down exactly but I know we have all been there. That trolling that in one way can seem like very little can SERIOUSLY stuff up the entire game and unfortunately examples like that are partially the fault of the meta, but always the players first. There needs to be a squishy, ranged AD champion in the bot lane and it needs to have back up. If they don't, bad things will likely happen. Caitlyn, Twitch and Urgot are three examples of these that can, if careful, hold a lane under their tower, with the latter two becoming particularly dangerous post 6 under their own towers. But their success comes down to who the opposing bot lane is.\n\nI hate the term \"troll\" when applied to people who want to build AP on RIven or play Re-Raka in the jungle (wtf is disco nunu though?). Trolling involves irritating player interactions rather than actions themselves. If you go on a landslide 4v5 victory even with that AP Riven were you really trolled if it didn't effect you? Having Riven sell all her AD items for AP in a 50 minute game for the final boss fight is trolling...unless, say you are playing against bots with friends and you all do that. Who is being trolled? Nobody. Grieving is systematic. The Riven that brought AP all game was grieving the team. Selling everything and buying AD items to make it look like they did something at the end when it is far too late to make a difference makes it trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-18T12:45:38.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DianasGotSwag,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=VPoOhb3O,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-09-18T12:11:16.669+0000)\n>\n> You want to know what it is?
