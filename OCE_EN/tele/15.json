Here's a few of my mains that are significantly worse:\n\nEkko{{champion:245}}: Was such a cool early game jungler for comps with too much AD, now with the removal of Purple Smite he's significantly worse. He needed that item for faster clears and sustain.\n\nAmumu {{champion:32}}: In season 5 being in combat with a jungle monster gave a health and mana regeneration buff. This sometimes would even allow Amumu to give blue buff to mid. Not an option anymore, you're basically forced to start Blue, and the hunters talisman mana regeneration buff does nothing.\n\nJarvan {{champion:59}}: I didn't play this guy since season 4, but when I saw we were in a snowball meta I thought I'd pick him up again. OMG does he take the D in the jungle. I thought he was early game champion, but that first clear is terrible.\n\nThose are some stand-out cases. I'm just finding I'm always a pot short on clears, especially with Refillable Potion.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-13T14:09:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait purple smite gone?
