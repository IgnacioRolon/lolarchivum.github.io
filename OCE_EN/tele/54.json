I also attached the corresponding screenshots for that too.\n\nThis is pretty serious IMO, some sensitive information could get out this way. I don&#039;t know how to replicate the bug, but it&#039;s happened at least 2 more times this week.","replies":[{"poster":"Fed In Vayne","date":"2016-05-29T00:26:24.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not another chat I believe if you scroll up your messages will be towards the top of the chat..
