{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-06T21:50:10.482+0000","title":"Analysis on Mind of the Virtuoso Teaser.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make sure you have watched the video before you read this. Check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4-BgDEy2AE).\n\nFirst up, we can debunk the theory that he was in the Zaun gang with Ekko, Jinx and Vi. \n\n1. First his concept seems a bit too mystical for Zaun. \n\n2. This picture [here](http://i.imgur.com/Fu8N7ei.jpg), shows the symbol on his gun. It is 4 lines downwards, reminiscent of ancient greek symbolism. If he was part of the gang this would surely be a roman numeral, like we had for Ekko.\n\nOk so now that we have that out of the way, lets look into the core of this analysis:\n\n_Re-watch the teaser and you&#039;ll see that each movement represents a different element._\n\n1. The first is fire. \n http://i.imgur.com/hgefObE.jpg\n\n2. The second is water.\n http://i.imgur.com/KuUXcdw.jpg\n\n3. The third is air. \n http://i.imgur.com/tP7Idai.jpg\n\n4. The fourth is earth.\n http://i.imgur.com/bpNE6dP.jpg\n\nEach of these elements matches a teaser we got.\n\n+ Zed: Earth.\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-n_QLf7u5Urk/Vn80n6Vdj1I/AAAAAAAA2Vc/eWRWzghzRU0/s1600/J7TUHek%2B%25281%2529.jpg\n\n+ Sona: Air.\n http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HVMJ6VUUGKQ/VoG1d7t-6nI/AAAAAAAA2W8/N2IWF2Xbw8E/s1600/sn.jpg\n\n+ Garen: Water\n http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlHvPVSacbY/VoRacyeqTYI/AAAAAAAA2Xk/1_jj29gWPe8/s1600/garen.jpg\n\n+ Vi: Fire\n  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Acynvt18Xpo/VocRqsRA4II/AAAAAAAA2Yk/f-B8HVhNKmw/s1600/vvv4.jpg\n\nAnother interesting point is that these teasers were released in the exact opposite order to how they appeared in the Mind of the Virtuoso.\n\nNow the obvious and speculation stuff:\n\n1. He/She is an ADC. The prominent use of guns confirms this.\n\n2. Jhin is a female. This one is speculation, but if you look at Jhin&#039;s eye at about [1:00](https://youtu.be/B4-BgDEy2AE?t=1m), the eyelashes are extremely feminine in my opinion.\n\n3. It's likely at this point that each element relates to one of his/her abilities. 4 elements, 4 abilities, seems logical.\n\nIf I missed anything, or something has come up since I posted this, please tell me.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-06T22:30:23.846+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2016-01-07T02:27:07.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=QaEejn38,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-01-06T22:30:23.846+0000)\n>\n> {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}\n\nThe moment I saw this thread, I was ready to bet that a comment from Marauduau would have the 'zombie slayer Panth munching on popcorn' sticker, taunting our faces.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-07T03:09:28.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"too true","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-07T15:11:18.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure 99% of his posts in regards to teasers have that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-07T00:44:21.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This thing becoming avatar man.
