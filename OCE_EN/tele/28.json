But the splash art and even in-game model is kind of bad honestly, and a lot of people in NA and EUW seem to agree with me. It&#039;s just the face and hair really, rest of the model is great. She looks like she&#039;s borderline 45 and really pissed, plus her cool and iconic fringe is gone, no one really had that hairstyle (maybe Vi but it didn&#039;t cover her left eye like Fiora&#039;s). Just bring back her youth and the fringe! Here&#039;s a fan art example http://fatinnd.deviantart.com/art/Fiora-The-Grand-Duelist-388176120\r\n\r\nHopefully a rioter can see this and at least consider brining this up at the office. I don&#039;t mean any offence, I just want this game to be as good as possible :D\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nWhen I play Fiora I want to look like a young agile duellist, not like my Mom when she tells me to stop playing and go to bed.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-07-22T07:14:41.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I saw this https://twitter.com/MarkYetter/status/623695968886632448","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-07-22T07:48:36.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god.

There's some dream potential there.\n\nEDIT: As I saw on a red post, they changed her fringe to make it more note worthy and standout. Currently the coloured strip blends too much with the rest of Fiora's hair. The changes are to make it more noticeable.","replies":[]}]}
