Riot will still do all the production, but now BAMTech will market it. Generally this deal looks pretty good, but there&#039;s some downsides.\n\nHere&#039;s a quick Q&amp;A style breakdown. The source to most info is [here](https://esports.yahoo.com/riot-games-and-mlb-advanced-media-unveil-50-million-annual-league-of-legends-partnership-through-2023-150236799.html).\n\n**_What is BAMTech?_**\n\n+ BAMTech is a tech company owned by MLBAM which basically does distribution and monetizing for media content. They&#039;re in charge of MLB, PGA, NHL and some other stuff like HBO GO.\n\n__*\n\n_**What is actually going to happen?**_\n\nSo far Riot has told us 2 major things will happen:\n\n1. **Ads**\n\n A lot of you might remember [this ad](https://youtu.be/m_LjpEPHQ2w?t=2h23m48s) from Season 6 worlds, we&#039;ll probably be seeing a lot more of those, especially during the wait between games. There will also be a lot more sponsorships, so expect things like _&quot;Welcome back to Day 2 NALCS brought to you by Intel&quot;_ and stuff like [this](https://youtu.be/AsVEBI9oEe8?t=43s).\n\n2. **A LoL eSports mobile app is coming**\n\n The President of MLBAM said _&quot;yeah, we wouldn&#039;t be here if they weren&#039;t an app involved&quot; _. That&#039;s not an app you must have to watch the game or anything, it&#039;s going to be more like an app to give you stats and keep you up to date.\n\n__*\n\n_**What MIGHT happen in addition to that?**_\n\n+ They talked about the possibility of in-client streams, rewards for viewing streams, and premium subscription services. \n\n A premium subscription service is a paid service for something extra. Possibly like, a second exclusive stream for ADC mains with DoubleLift and Imaqtpie.\n\n__*\n\n**_Do I have to pay to watch League of Legends now?_**\n\n+ No. League of Legends eSports matches will still be streaming free on YouTube and Twitch in HD. [The current way you watch LoL online will not change.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5iokpg/mlb_and_disney_pick_up_league_of_legends/db9qr4u/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=leagueoflegends)\n\n__*\n\n**_What&#039;s in it for Riot?_**\n\n+ They&#039;ll be getting a guaranteed minimum of 50 million dollars average per season until 2023. But the actual figure they get will probably be much larger. The President of MLBAM said _&quot;That&#039;s the minimum guarantee and I hope we can exceed that by a large margin, and I expect that we will...&quot;_.\n\n Not all this money will be going just to Riot though. Riot has a lot of [new systems and bigger prize pools](http://www.lolesports.com/en_AU/articles/2017-na-lcs-changes) coming up for LCS which will cost a lot of this money. Riot also said they [&quot;absolutely&quot;](https://youtu.be/CuV5ewLCjEE?t=17m3s) intend to share the revenue from this.\n\n__*\n\n**_What&#039;s going to happening with VODs?_**\n\n+ Here&#039;s where some big downsides come in. VODs will still be [free to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5iokpg/mlb_and_disney_pick_up_league_of_legends/db9srtd/)  on YouTube, but the Head of eSports at Riot has said _&quot;maybe if someone were to set up another service that was not licenced and not sanctioned by Riot Games, that&#039;s something that we may choose not to allow&quot;_.\n\n It&#039;s a little unclear at the moment, but it seems like there&#039;s a possibility we might not be able to upload full VODs to our own channels. I would Imagine that Riot will still allow highlights in the worst case scenario, but legally those fall under the licence too, so who knows.\n \n__*\n\n**_When are these changes actually coming?_**\n\n+ Riot said around 2018.\n\n__*\n\n_**Is this going to be the same for each region?**_\n\n+ Looks like there will be minor changes for each region. They want to do _&quot;the best thing for every region in every League as it makes sense&quot;_ and will be working with the local teams to do that.\n\n__*\n\n_**Since Riot has sold some of the streaming rights, does that mean they now have no control over what happens?**_\n\n+ [Riot said](https://youtu.be/CuV5ewLCjEE?t=10m30s) _&quot;One of the reasons that this took as long as it did, is we wanted to make sure we maintained control over the experience&quot;_.\n\n Little unclear, but it looks like they&#039;ve made sure they have a big say in what happens.","replies":[]}
