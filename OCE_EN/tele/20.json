If you look it up on the item sets tab, you&#039;ll see it&#039;s there. It&#039;s even on the [official website](http://gameinfo.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/items/) if you search for it.\r\n\r\nSome one will point out that this is an old item from Black Market Brawlers,_ probably a bug right?_ \r\nSo why are none of the other items from BMB there? if you search for **_Trickster&rsquo;s Glass_**, **_Martyr&rsquo;s Gambit_** or **_Netherstride Grimoire_** you wont find anything.\r\n\r\nEven more strange, this item was intended to go live with the original pre-season changes. Check out these posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3qnm30/new_preseason_items/) and [here](http://boards.pbe.leagueoflegends.com/fr/c/bugs/GesNdrtG-staff-of-flowing-waters-not-in-the-in-game-shop).\r\n\r\n_Was this item intended to be a Dead Man&#039;s Plate thing, where it transferred over to live servers? \r\nWhat happened Riot? \r\nDoes anyone know why it&#039;s still on live?\r\n_","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-08T13:01:22.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the most likely thing is, its such a small unimportant problem that riot doesnt give a fuck about removing it. it will and would have caused some confusion with people seeing it and attempting to use it in their games already, but its really not hurting anybody directly. if they wanted to keep the item they could have just taken it out and put it back in later. i feel like with the AP and MR stats it might be the replacement of abyssal scepter or maybe it builds into the new one (since it was supposed to be changed ages ago)\n\nseems like a reeeaaally bad item though. i can only think of cassiopeia for it to be effective on, otherwise athenes will always be better. 1735 for 40 AP.....im trying to think of some, of any situation to buy this but, nope. the 30% MS in the river is way too situational too..... soooo thats it then, just let it be m8, useless thing to worry about unless its a component of new abyssal sceptre or a new item thats gonna come out with mana font that is hopefully much better than this","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-08T19:46:19.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has 20% CDR even though it's not listed. This item is legit the true calling for supports who roam like me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-08T20:06:26.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I remember the talk about bringing Staff of Flowing Water into normal games like they did with Dead Man's Plate in preseason. As you say it is pretty much aimed at supports (it was in BMB too for that matter). No guarantees, but I Imagine that's why it's still there, they likely intend to bring it back still, but didn't want to push it through with all the other item changes in the first preseason patch (for pretty obvious reasons).","replies":[]}]}]}]}
