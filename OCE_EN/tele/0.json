I was expecting a similar level of players that I get in normals but instead I got matched up with players way above my ELO. My ADC was gold and probably the best ADC I have ever played with. I keep letting my team down because I can't make plays at this level.\r\n\r\nShould I wait a few days for Riot Match making to sort my ELO out?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-06T02:56:11.485+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a few things to consider in this situation.\n1. If it's the first time you've played ranked your initial MMR will be around Silver 5.\n2. It is entirely possible for an individual to have an MMR that is an entire division below their rank. What this means is that it's possible for someone with a rank of Gold 5 to have an MMR at the level of Silver 5.\n3. As Fog has already mentioned, people are pooled closer at the start of each season.\n\nA little bit of advice, listen to what Knuuckles has said. You don't need to know their ranks, in fact it will probably intimidate you if they are ranked higher than you despite the chances of them having the same or lower MMR than you. If you do want to know their ranks wait until the end of the match, that way gameplay wont be affected by it.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-06T03:39:24.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the samw time, he has only mentioned the rankings of one person on his team.

Rank as much as possible because you will be getting experiance and heaps of it. You'll see how they act and how they cs, when they poke and when they back off.

When a season starts players are pooled in closer to each other in terms of MMR which means players from different elos can end up in the same game. After the first month or so the players are all split back up into their rightful tiers. The ones that are good enough to get out are back in higher divisions and less capable players are placed in lower divisions.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-02-06T02:45:56.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh right.
