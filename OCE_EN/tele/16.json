OPL Finals had viewing parties in Christchurch, so why the hell would you cut short on the biggest event of the year?

Basically we are focusing on making sure we deliver the best experience possible for live esports events in cinema. To do this we are using satellite for the broadcasts, this means we can only use cinemas that can accept the sat feed. We have seen some poor experiences where we and other games have relied on internet connectivity in cinema and the quality was poor as was the up time. If you are paying $20 for a ticket you should expect a cinema grade experience with great sound and picture. We are working with the cinema groups in OCE to get more cinemas enabled to take sat so we can expand the footprint in 2016. Hope this clears it up.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-07T23:29:56.423+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are working with the cinema groups in OCE to get more cinemas enabled to take sat so we can expand the footprint in 2016.\n\nBy Cinema groups, are you meaning Hoyts and reading etc?\nAlso are you contacting the cinemas directly? Within other cities in each country? I.e In NZ, wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.\nAlso PNG, Fiji etc.\nMy reason is alot of cinemas are privately owned, such as Palmiston North in NZ.","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-10-07T23:33:26.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey presently we are working with HOYTS as the sat pieces are quite complex. But yes they cover predominantly AU and NZ and they want to bring more cinemas online to take the sat feeds so hoping we can expand further in the coming months.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"OCG LittleKaz","date":"2015-10-08T08:11:29.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello!\n\nNot sure where you're from in  CHCH etc but here in chch we have a viewing party (which was posted on Oceanic Gaming and Southern Summoners and LoLNz)!\n\nLast year we had 300 people for the first EVER Christchurch viewing party.\n\nHad it in a bar, with themed drinks and everything!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1006735886056966/\n\nThis is the link for this years, so if you're in Chch, come hang and have a really wonderful time!","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-13T06:01:27.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could also post it on the events page of this website as well.\nFacebook and twitter are good for younger generation, but not all us slightly older people.\nhttp://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/events?after=2015-10-28T11%3A00%3A00.000Z&language=en","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-10-11T04:49:18.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good man!
