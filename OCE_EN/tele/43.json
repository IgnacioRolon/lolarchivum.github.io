We waited for 3 hours and never got in game. We queued from 4:26 pm till 10:26 pm (Sydney time), and never even managed to get a full team in lobby. I&#039;m Silver 3 elo so there is no reason for long queue times. 3 hours queue time is ridiculous, I even recorded it because I&#039;m sure many people wouldn&#039;t believe me. \r\n\r\nWhat the hell is wrong with Team Builder Riot? Can we get it replaced with Draft Pick already?\r\n\r\nNot trying to hate on you guys but this is unacceptable honestly.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-02T16:12:48.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cos nobody use teammaker, ty.\n\nPlease remove team maker and replace with draft pick","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-02T21:46:27.515+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All the more reason to replace it with Draft Pick","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-04T04:10:01.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will be another year before staff wake up to do something thou","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"M e","date":"2015-09-29T13:38:44.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah dude I 100% agree, it is so fucking stupid that teambuilder is up 24/7 while being a completely useless queue, yet 3v3 which takes less players is only available a few times a week. When they released teambuilder it was cool but its problems started showing, no invites like you said, longer and longer queues, no fill role, lobbies having to be completely restarted and probably other issues I forgot. I really wish they could just replace it with draft so we could avoid some of the problem champions of this meta while having some fun in normals or at LEAST just remove it.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-02T16:13:17.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg riot oce.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"efiasko","date":"2015-09-30T15:35:54.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"swapping for draft is a neat idea","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sleepy Russian","date":"2015-09-30T06:54:22.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yo that's #ludacris lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-29T12:40:28.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rito why you no release Normal Draft pick ...","replies":[]}]}
