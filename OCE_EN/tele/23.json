These Homeguards in question have at least two aspects of their favourite champion, and it is up to you to tell us how they are helping defend Oceania against the Monsters.\n\n---\n\nWrite us a short story about who your Homeguard is. It could be about you as a Homeguard, or your friends/family as Homeguards. Tell us what they are like, and what abilities or aspects they have adopted from their favourite champion. The story can include as many Homeguards as you like, or  it can be about just a solo Homeguard. \n\nPerhaps you will tell us the story of a bot lane combo you and your friend usually play as, Ashe and Nami. Your Homeguards could be using waves that are frozen in ice to clear out massive clumps of Monsters. It could be the story of a solo act as an Assassin such as Akali, taking out key targets to win the war against the Monsters. You could even tell us the story of a full team of your friends banding together. It&rsquo;s really up to you.\n\nOnce you&#039;ve finished your story, submit it down below for us and others to read :)\n\n---\n\nThere are no rules on length or how &quot;overpowered&quot; your Homeguard can be, however do try to keep it interesting. But we do have to lay down a few ground rules though:\n\n1. Try to keep the stories PG 13\n2. Adhere to the universal rules of the boards\n3. Post your entries in the comments by the end of Ocean Week\n4. Stories written have to be your own, and written specifically for this competition\n\nThe winner will receive 1000RP and the runner-up will receive 500RP.
