My cool-down for my Unbreakable came back and I attempted to absorb the final blow to protect my allied Jinx; however the issue that arrose was that i was left on approx 150 hp, and deathfire touch wasn&#039;t going to kill me alas I took the shot but all the damage came through.\r\n\r\nTo finalise, either there is an issue with Braum not being able to negate the damage from Jhin&#039;s final shot, or (the unrealistic alternative) it being negated forces all the damage from deathfire touch to go through anyway.\r\n\r\nPlease fix this, as this is a very major issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSlendie","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-02-01T13:38:56.168+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not too sure, but there might not be any issue with Deathfire Touch. It's description states \"Your damaging abilities cause enemies to take magic damage over 4 seconds\". However, there doesn't seem to be any indication of how that's affected when the abilities damage is negated.\n\nLooking at the LoL wiki, I can't find any info on that specific interaction.\n\nIt might be worth the effort to try going it a custom with a friend and seeing how Jhin's Curtain Call interacts with Deathfire Touch when applied to the first \"damage-negated\" instance of Braum's Unbreakable.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T15:02:30.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A thought, had you taken any hits recently before putting unbreakable up? Kind of a weird thought, but maybe a previous application of dft ate up the 'Stops first ability\" part of Braum's unbreakable?","replies":[]}]}
