We mostly played bot matches to get level 10 quick and the last guy got level 10 2 days before the Refer-a-friend ended and I never got the chance to Claim Medieval Twitch on the website :c, was just checking if I could do anything to get it? Like, Riot checking my account for refers or something? Or maybe I should just wait for them to be added in the Social unlock thing...\n\nEDIT: I received the skin, TY RIOT <3","replies":[]}
