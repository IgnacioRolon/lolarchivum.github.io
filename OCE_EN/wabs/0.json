For this reason I have removed the eamil from the post. If you wish to contact Riot you can submit a support ticket here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nAs for your suspension, has your account ever been shared with anyone else for any reason? Most commonly these cases come up when an account has been shared for the purposes of MMR boosting, and the booster has used scripts on the account.\n\nEither way, Player Support will be able to tell you exactly why you were banned, just be aware that it may take a couple days for them to get back to you as they are very busy atm.","replies":[]}]}
