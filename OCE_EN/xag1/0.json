Everything is **100% free** and our amazing mentors teach because they genuinely enjoy helping others. Important to note is that we only want a positive learning environment so absolutely NO RANTING or salt here.\n \nWe have a number of verified mentors from the all main servers including a myriad of master/challenger players with extensive knowledge on their signature champions. We are always looking for more talented educators to join our ranks! Please message our head mentor Muyuu or one of our admins if you&rsquo;re interested.\n \n \n&nbsp;\n \n \n***\n \n#How it works\n \n&nbsp;\n \nWe offer many free services such as VOD reviews, classroom style reviews in the voice channels, general discussion of in game strategies and points of improvement, tier lists, and Pro play (LCS/LCK) discussion. Every once in a while we will also host events such as the Mentoring Games where teams of players of a rank will be assigned to mentors for a few weeks to prepare for a faceoff against a team of the same rank led by other mentors. For example 5 bronze players being coached by a master coach vs another team of 5 bronze players coached by another coach. It is great fun so sign up!\n \nBeyond learning, being a part of a community is an important part of our server. Staff-hosted events, chatrooms, and an achievements showcase channel bind us together to involve you. Our goal is for people to be able to find long lasting league friendships and form mentor-student relationships. There&#039;s nothing better than seeing our students climb through the ranks and hit new achievement breakpoints.\n \n**If you are interested in receiving a VOD review from a coach PLEASE read the &ldquo;VOD review coaching&rdquo; channel in our server for more information BEFORE asking**\n \n \n&nbsp;\n \n***\n \n \n#I&#039;m sold!
