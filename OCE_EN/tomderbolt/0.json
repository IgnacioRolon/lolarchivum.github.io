I was thinking that every champ could get one or two items for free to start the game (the amount taking into account impact on early game champs). I know ARAM is meant to be the faster game mode, but I would love to start a summoners rift match as Yi with a BORK for example. \r\n\r\nThe point of the game mode is that kills would be more free-flowing in a more deathmatch style. Passive gold income rate could be increased too.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-26T05:30:56.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a retarded version of aram","replies":[]}]}
