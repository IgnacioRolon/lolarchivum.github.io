A 7pm AEST start time means that people like myself in Western Australia are struggling to get home from work for a 5:30pm end of lock-in period. If that was even pushed back by a little bit I&#039;m sure it would help people from WA and SA to be able to participate in Clash.\r\n\r\nThanks for the consideration!","replies":[]}
