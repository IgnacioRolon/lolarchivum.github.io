I suppose if I wasn't a Malphite player I'd call it unlucky :P.\n\nBut I can confirm though that the drop rates for Malphite skins are just as high as any other mystery skin, not counting for promos like double legendary or the current double legacy promo.\nSpeaking of which, it IS still possible for you to also get Marble Malphite through mystery gifting, with double legacy chance until 7PM November 17, so maybe be careful with gifting if you're not super keen on getting yet another Malphite skin :D","replies":[]}]}
