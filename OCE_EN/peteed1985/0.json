Knowing how a champion works is more important than playing the \"OPs\"\n\nI know that best is who you are best with but picking the good ones as the ones you learn so you become good with them isn't a bad idea right? :) theres a few lanes like top where I just fail at since I don't know how to play any top champs. So a list kinda gives me ideas who to learn for top.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-05T06:48:41.652+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well the \"meta\" for top and mid is pretty huge range of champions.\n\nI suppose the most common top laners would be Irelia, Gnar, Riven. But theres a tonne of champs you can play. Renekton, Nasus, J4, Olaf, Jax, Lissandra, etc etc... top and mid you can play almost anything and get away with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-05T06:29:22.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but if you pick one that you have a higher skill at to start with, then you get better with them faster.\n\nOP champs aren't always actually OP, they are just strong because of either a low skill floor (meaning easy to pick up which tends to be OP in the more lower elos) or a extremely high skill ceiling (these tend to be the stronger ones at higher elo because everyone already meets the skill floor easily)\n\nWhat you should do is get a list of things you do well (IE: are you good with skill shots? wave control? split second mechanics?) and go through the champions that work for you, and pick from that list.","replies":[{"poster":"Peteed1985","date":"2015-02-05T11:14:54.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=RXL8imyM,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-05T06:29:22.287+0000)\n>\n> Yes but if you pick one that you have a higher skill at to start with, then you get better with them faster.\n> \n> OP champs aren't always actually OP, they are just strong because of either a low skill floor (meaning easy to pick up which tends to be OP in the more lower elos) or a extremely high skill ceiling (these tend to be the stronger ones at higher elo because everyone already meets the skill floor easily)\n> \n> What you should do is get a list of things you do well (IE: are you good with skill shots? wave control? split second mechanics?) and go through the champions that work for you, and pick from that list.\n\nlast hitting and split second mechanics are my weakest areas. I am good with skill shots and even good at Ashe and Jinx type ults across whole map. If I get a bad start I rarely recover however.
