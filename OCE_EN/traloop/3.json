Little did I know that I can&#039;t click on any of the masteries, forcing me to go into a game with no masteries OR having to dodge. This has happened several times, wasting my lp as well as mine and everyone&#039;s time. I have lost probably 30lp or so and wasted hours of my time due to this. I know you folks at riot won&#039;t compensate anyone because of this, however I do ask you to fix it.\nComment if this has happened to you aswell.","replies":[]}
