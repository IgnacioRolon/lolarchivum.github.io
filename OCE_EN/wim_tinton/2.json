Although it is only recently released, I&#039;ve already noticed a significant postive change in player behaviour in my games. My only problem with the update is that with a dodgy laptop, my client closes during games to reduce lag. This then has to reboot at the end of the game. I don&#039;t at all have a problem with this in itself---it is great for players with lower spectrum computers, and for myself, it is the economically viable way to play League. However by the time I get back into the client, I&#039;m usually flashed the honour screen for about two seconds, and then it times out, and I don&#039;t have time to vote for a teammate. This is, as I&#039;m sure you can understand, a little frustrating.\r\n\r\n\r\nTl;dr: **Would you consider increasing the time to vote for honour until, you, the player, leaves the lobby? **\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n~Wim Tinton","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2017-06-14T23:28:25.683+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a great feedback explained well with good manners.
