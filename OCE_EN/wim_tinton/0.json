I would love for people to tell me what they think.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n~Wim\r\n\r\n\r\n**Beneath the Hunger**\r\n\r\nI rise from the Void.\r\n\r\nI am hungry.\r\n\r\nLight lacquers off the white sand and I am forced to blink. I am above a beach, water stretches to my side as far as I can see, starlight glazing its waves gold. I move inland, the hot air sluggish against me as I twist through the sky. The heat and brightness do not bother me after its first suddenness. This star is not as bright as other ones. I have eaten stars before. \r\n\r\nI am filled with the knowledge that I have been to this world previously, how long ago I do not know. As much as I have collected, time is still a strange concept to me. \r\n\r\nThe hunger fills me. I can feel it towing my limbs forward. The hunger never truly goes away. It is seething in the pit of me now, icy cold, coiling and uncoiling, unresting.\r\n\r\nIn the distance, a tangle of reflective surfaces rise from the earth and glint in the starlight. Brassy calls and low burrs drone from the place. Good. Food.\r\nI am so hungry.\r\n\r\nI move closer. I can taste waste in the air. It seeps into me. The sky is grey-thick with it, clogging, cloying, so dense the light almost stays clear of it. \r\nThese creatures amuse me. For it must be creatures that have done something like this, destroying their own world slowly &ndash; it always is. \r\n\r\nThe hunger rears in me. I quicken.\r\n\r\nI am above them all. Small, boxy constructions beetle along the ground. A smoke of some kind billows out into the air from small nozzles attached to them.\r\n\r\nCreatures pale-faced with beady little eyes fill this space. They have noticed me. They stand on their haunches and only have four limbs. What are they?\r\nI melt one. \r\n\r\nThe man I have melted is quite intelligent. He is a scientist. An environmentalist. One of the ways to limit environmental impacts in governmental buildings is&ndash;Interesting. I have been here before, I recognise them now. The creatures have grown since I last met their kind.\r\n\r\nThey have forgotten me. \r\n\r\nThey should not have.\r\n\r\nThe constructions, the ones the humans call cars, have sped up, crashing into each other in their haste to escape me. Crowds of people surge away from me like they are ripples in liquid and I am the wind. They have left a lame one hobbling on the sidewalk. These creatures are selfish. But, if the one I melted before is like the rest, they are also quite intelligent.\r\n\r\nI consume a man who is stepping out of his car.\r\n\r\nSome of them are not very intelligent.\r\n\r\nI melt the hobbling one. She is much wiser. She is old by their standards, not lame as I had previously thought. They do not live long, even without me here. _The flowers need watering. I wonder if Sarah&rsquo;s OK, she hasn&rsquo;t called in_&ndash;I consume the car. So that is how they work. That is one of the reasons why the pollution clouds the sky. I can see the exhausts of the other cars idling there. It frustrates me. I do not know why. I destroy the cars anyway.\r\n\r\nI glide to the tall construction some people have hidden in (I can see their faces pressed up to the side of the transparent walls.) I move upwards. An image of me is reflected on top of their horrified expressions. A woman hugs a young girl next to her who is crying.\r\n\r\nI disintegrate them.\r\n\r\nAh, it is a skyscraper. So tall it touches the clouds. Concrete and steel. The reflective surface is called glass. It is nothing but knowledge now. _White cubicles and green pot plants. John hasn&rsquo;t accepted my brief yet, is something wrong with it? l skipped my lunchbreak but_&ndash;Something pricks me. I turn. A group of humans dressed in matching clothing stand in a line shouting, holding contraptions made of metal that flare brightly. Pellets slap at me. An annoyance. I burn them out of the sky (they are bullets) then I burn the people (soldiers). Interesting. The soldiers are no different physiologically from the ones they will to protect. They are not very effective. The humans build machines to do work for them. Compared to similar civilisations theirs are far cruder. _I don&rsquo;t know why I took this job. I need to go home to Belinda. If I go home and see her still in bed curled up like a child my heart will break. Maybe we can try for another baby? If she wants to. Does she want to?_\r\n\r\nWhat are these voices in my head? Not just the voices. I&rsquo;m bombarded with visions too. The flare-bright petals of an orchid on a windowsill; a man and a woman crying in a hospital room, the woman&rsquo;s face the same shade as the sheets; a man swooping down a road on a bicycle, sun bright in his face and filling his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd thousands of other images impale me too, swifter moving than the bullets, each seeming to tear a little something out of me and destroy it. I lash out my limbs around me in pain and anger.\r\n\r\nThis world hurt me.\r\n\r\nI will destroy it.\r\n\r\n(Hunger.)\r\n\r\n_My beam blazes through the city. A vast outpouring of knowledge fills me. Mice: small rodent-like creatures, often carrying disease, not very intelligent. A piano: an instrument built of strings, this one transported from Vienna 200 years ago. And phones. And clocks. And notepads, lip-balm, pockets and sewers and blankets. Glasses, rubber, wiring, and rubber-wiring. Dogs, tan-lotions, trains and artwork&hellip;_\r\n\r\nThe voices grow louder.\r\n\r\nI push away the voices. They persist, needling into me.\r\n\r\n(Hunger!)\r\n\r\nI disintegrate chocolate-rectangular-biscuits-typical-of-the-country-Australia and fridges, light-posts and sign-posts and fence-posts. Trees, curtains, sparrows and ice-cream. Hats, bridges, hotels and traffic lights and speakers and ten cent pieces and pillows and quartz and sandwiches and suits and shampoo and&hellip;\r\n\r\nA child is standing on the ground in front of me looking up at me. \r\n\r\nShe has bright yellow hair. I have just eaten her mother. \r\n\r\nShe is crying. She tilts her head and the tears on her cheeks catch the starlight and gleam.\r\n\r\nIt would be instantaneous.\r\n\r\nShe wouldn&rsquo;t feel a thing. I should disintegrate her.\r\n\r\nI pause. There is something about this that doesn&rsquo;t feel right. The thought stuns me. I did not know I was capable of thinking like this, of thinking when it comes to eating. If I stripped away the hunger, there would be nothing beneath. I have always been a being of consumption. \r\n\r\nThe hunger stirs in me. It rises up from the depths of me like a cold tendril. My limbs quiver. I want&hellip; I do not know what I want. For the first time since I consumed the first human in this city, the voices inside of me are quiet. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; the girl says.\r\n\r\nThe hunger inside of me seems to be amused as it draws me back and disintegrates the girl while I watch. Nothing of her is left but a deep cleft in the ground from where the beam cut into.\r\n\r\n_I&rsquo;m hungry_, a thought says, but for once it isn&rsquo;t mine.\r\nI recoil. The rest of the voices rise until they are a cacophony of noise that deafens my every sense. I reel blindly back in the direction I came from, feeling the call of the chasm to the Void that I entered this world through.\r\n\r\nI feel&hellip; I do not know what I feel. I have the knowledge of thousands of worlds and still, I do not know what it is I feel. \r\n\r\nSo I cower backwards, find the chasm that I came through and lower myself back into the dark, cold simplicity of the Void.","replies":[{"poster":"H20Dartford","date":"2018-03-26T06:20:45.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"love this story so much! i think you did an amazing job with bringing out vel's voice and developing his character. i have to say, you are an absolutely amazing writer, the descriptions are so vivid and compelling.\n\ni really enjoyed how you slowly learn things about earth through vel's head, it really convinces you that you are there with him. the concept of this is super cool, and i also love the contrast between having incredibly descriptive sentences that finish with short, simple lines such as \"I will destroy it\". it emphasizes the fact that vel is a construct from the void, yet retains his voice as an intelligent being. i think that the simplicity fits vel really well- it makes him seem much more vicious, and still was done in a way that doesn't make him seem simple or stupid. \n\nit reads really well as a -1500 word short story, i like that you dropped little hints of his past to give the character more dimension (i have eaten stars before) without going on a long tangent. it keeps the story interesting and focused. \n\namazing job mate, you have my vote ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-03-28T06:48:27.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IndieFlash","date":"2018-03-24T02:29:58.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really enjoy the simplicity of the sentence structure and the way in which you make it sound like he is rediscovering the world as he roams through it again. I also enjoy that you moved away from the norms of the subject looking at something a little more out there. The way you use the voices of those who he eats in how he understands is very cool I think and I enjoy how you make him confused about some of the emotion that is flooding him while he consumes more, simultaniously wanting to feast but in doing so, confusing himself more and more. The depiction of the Void as a simple home is also nice and I like to think he retreats there to just contemplate all the knowledge he has gained.\n\nI think I would've liked to see a bit more reflection on his previous experience in this world but that was probably limitted by word count :)\n\nWhat I'm not too sure about is why he is able to disintegrate a young girl and her (assumed) mother before hand but when he does it the second time it is his tipping point. Also I feel like if he has done this so many times before (\"I have the knowledge of thousands of worlds...\") he wouldn't be as surprised by the voices he's encountering (\"What are these voices in my head?\"). Maybe a greater knowledge of the voices but an inability to understand them might have worked nicely? (eg. \"I feel them swell in my mind again, rising and falling, ebbing and flowing, the voices that have greeted me so many times before, the visions that cloud my sight..\" or something like that.\n\nThat being said, really enjoyed it :) good luck for the competition!!

You choose a very simple sentence structure for a highly intelligent being, (which I'd love to hear your choice for, actually!) and with that active sentence type it's easy to repeat pronouns a lot.\n\nAlso interested to know why you chose to pull on a 'hunger' aspect, too, considering in his canonical lore (though you may have purposely choose a different path from this, which I'd be interested to hear why) he is portrayed to be above base instincts. \n\nAlso, why choose a child and her mother when Vel likely has had no mother & so direct sense of empathy for motherhood? If he is developing empathy from those he's deconstructed, do you think there would be a less cliché but equally effective means of portraying this? Moreover: why now? \n\nPlease don't take this as a slight against your work.

From the lore I’ve read, and the accompanying story, Vel’koz seems highly highly driven to acquire knowledge. There is no reason stated to why, apart from learning the weaknesses of other races the Void seeks to exploit. A construct created for this purpose would most likely think simplistically — that’s my take anyway. The story written by Riot also had similar sentence structure — even more simplistic actually. I used the metaphor of Hunger to display the drive to acquire knowledge. I interpreted it as a truely base instinct wired into Vel — he’s being exploited / used for this purpose and nothing else.\n\nIn regards to the mother and her child, him acquiring all these people’s Knowledge beforehand (especially the mother’s) made him hesitate. Him being influenced by the knowledge he gathers is foreshadowed earlier in the piece, when he becomes annoyed at the pollution of the cars after disintegrating the scientist. Yes, the mother/child trope is overused, yes there was probably a more subtle way in conveying this, but I think it still works all the same.\n\nAs for the ‘why now’ aspect of his empathy or at least his thoughts of empathy, I don’t know! That was the opening thought I had before I wrote this piece: What if a being tasked with acquiring knowledge of things he destroys, acquires their thoughts and feelings as well? Would the being hesitate? Block out those voices? How could they cope? \n\nThanks,\n\n~Wim","replies":[{"poster":"Fluff ewe","date":"2018-03-08T10:14:03.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for taking the time to reply. \n\nThose are respectable choices! I've always interpreted him a lot differently, though you've probably gleaned that from the initial comment anyway. It's good to hear what others think. (Especially since the contest is based on popular vote, haha.)\n\nI can't really vouch for any either being more 'true' or not. Say, I think that Vel would be highly sophisticated and that his thought process would reflect this, but this is practically impossible to prove, considering a/ lore doesn't have to be followed to a tee (and his original piece itself doesn't even seem to be edited ): b/ his lore isn't very comprehensive anyway. It's all about the interpretation, and so I'll take yours, here.\n\nIt's always strange reading something that subverts tropes to fall into another, or maybe that's just me — to have seen too many iterations of tropes that everything has become familiar. 'The mindlessly hungry darkness creature' is one, and 'unexpected empathy from killer/antagonist/dark creature' is another, and 'motherless child spurring empathy' is yet another. It's not really a crime considering how unavoidable it is, or when you want to consider your demographic and how many tropes it's likely that they've seen to grown weary of. \n\nAlso, if I were to answer that last question, I would say that he wouldn't hesitate. I'd say he lacks many of the biological instincts and/or responses that would spur 'feelings' simply because his brain is not a human one. If something that could inherently, biologically, and structurally not 'feel' were to be presented with the synapses, neurons, and mappings for feeling — because that's what they are, at least to my understanding — he would objectively understand it but never _experience_ it. Maybe that would drive him to continual destruction, pursuing something he physically cannot comprehend.\n\nThat, or he understands it so fully: the emotional manipulation regarding it as well as the objective understanding of where, why, and for what benefit that feeling has occurred, that he is simply beyond reacting to it. That could make for an interesting story. But that's not what this is about, and it's also another 'twist' in a well-creased fabric. So I'd say good work on your story and the consideration behind it~","replies":[{"poster":"Wim Tinton","date":"2018-03-09T00:44:52.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your reply,\n\nYou make some very good points. Re the popular vote though, that's why I'm pretty unconcerned with the tropes I've used. The mindlessly dark creature though, that was the whole of Vel'koz's official story and lore. All he wants is to obtain knowledge, for the Watchers, so they can destroy the universe. I've tried to in some way expand this; now he (well, it) has its own misgivings. I think my portrayal is a more complex--yes, it has it has its own pitfalls, but still, a little more complex.\n\nYour last two paragraphs are very interesting. I'd love to explore those concepts, if I wouldn't have to rework so much of the original piece.
