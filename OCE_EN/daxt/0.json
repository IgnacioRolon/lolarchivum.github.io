I then today, earned an S on a different champion and also received a chest. To my knowledge I can only earn 1 chest every week ( 6 days )? \r\nI am not sure if this has anything to do with the new month, but even then it&#039;s only the 30th. \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s probably something really simple that I stupidly didn&#039;t realise. Thanks for your help!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-30T10:27:17.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests stack up to 4 (like how rerolls stack up to 2) when you don't collect them. You have two stacked there (see how they're gold instead of grey?), then you'll get your next one in the 6 days.","replies":[{"poster":"Daxt","date":"2016-04-30T11:32:08.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh wow, thanks.
