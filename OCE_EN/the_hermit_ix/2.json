I have checked the store for a couple of days now and but nothing has seemed to have changed. \r\n\r\nWas wondering if someone might know when the boxes will be in store or i'm just blind.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Mask Serenity","date":"2015-02-20T02:20:48.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea same I bought a chest for mystery champions ( the 490 one ) does that still count?

I don't think it's labelled as \"Lunar Revel Mystery Box\", just the regular Mystery Gift and the Mystery Skin worth at least 975 RP or more. When you select the one that's worth more then it's name changes to \"Mystery Chest\", so I think it's safe to say that getting that will net you the icon, as the statement includes \"Mystery Chest\".\n\nIf you want to make one hundred percent sure, though, ask a red themself. You'd probably be able to catch them on the Miscellaneous boards doing some fan-pandering if you're lucky, or if you want a guaranteed reply, send it a ticket.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, best of luck with it!","replies":[]}]}
