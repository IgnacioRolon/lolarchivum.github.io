Seems to be limited to specific games, that is, most games will still have my normal ~60 ping, while some are sitting on ~200. I even tried reconnecting to a game once, and it improved the ping for the game.\n\nIt *might* be related to ports that Optus makes, but I'm more thinking it might be something at some point which is lowering the priority of our connections until they are refreshed. Is what I explained similar to what's happening to you?\n\nAlso, you might want to look over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664) in the meantime. Mainly, make sure there's no background applications open, and that automatic updates are all disabled.","replies":[]}]}
