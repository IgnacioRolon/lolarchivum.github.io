I might have said some profanity here and there, but my type of chat wasn&#039;t really as toxic as the Varus did. I only wanted to defend myself from the false accusations I constantly received.\n\nMy main question here is **if you guys actually review the game before banning people or it&#039;s like a robot-something that automatically bans people when they got reported?**\n\nBecause it feels _unfair_, like with **videogamedunkey**&#039;s case as well. It&#039;s unfair that the way Varus flamed and to how I flamed, we probably still got the same punishment.\n\nI&#039;m just scared to get permanently banned because I dedicated my whole life and spent large amounts of money in this game.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\nViksen \n{{champion:203}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-22T14:33:15.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First of all, there is a no naming and shaming rule on boards, please refer to the [Universal Rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules).\n\nSecond, Dunkey was banned for toxicity. He was toxic in chat and thus was punished for it. Multiple times. Being famous does not exempt you from the rules, and it isn't \"just banter\" if you're involving the stranger players in it.\n\nThird, reports work as basically a flag. The report flags the game and the Instant Feedback System reviews it (no report no review). The IFS is an automated learning system, namely it learns what is and isn't ok by what gets reported and what doesn't, along with manual reviews from Rioters. Over the years it's gotten quite good at it.\n\nA false report (which you seem to be claiming) means nothing, and will not get you punished.\nYou being punished does not mean noone else was.\nRetaliation is not ok. Defending yourself is fine, but I doubt that was the extent of things. Throwing abuse back makes you just as bad as them when there are 8 other players int eh game.\n\nIf you really think that you didn't say anything wrong, then post your chat logs from your reform card and we can tell you what would have netted you the restriction.\n\nIt's also worth noting that typically the punishment system follows the tiers pretty linearly, those tiers being 10 game chat restriction, 25 game, 14 day ban, perma ban. So assuming this is your first chat restriction, you're pretty far away from perma, but you also now have a history of toxicity/punishment, so you will be treated with less leniency in the future.","replies":[]}]}
