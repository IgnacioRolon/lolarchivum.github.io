The clone he leaves behind loses this red eyes, and the new fiddle he controls runs ecstatically/jittery as if it is glitching and blood spills out of his mouth when chasing.\r\n\r\nE:\r\n\r\nCharged (Hold):\r\nFiddlesticks spews out spirits(or crows or ghouls) from its head/mouth and spirals around him in an increasing radius.*and damages enemies struck. If 3 spirits strikes an enemy champion, they are silenced.\r\n\r\nInstant Cast:\r\nFiddlesticks spews out the spirits abruptly in a straight line, still damaging enemies struck and silences enemy champions struck 3 times.\r\n\r\n- * The spiral of spirits emitting from Fiddlesticks visually looks similar to Aurelion Sol stars, HOWEVER instead of 3 circular stars, it's a spiral cluster of spirits.\r\n- Each spirit deals a specifically small amount of damage, possibly similar to current Fiddle E.\r\n- If 3 spirits have entered an enemy, the remaining spirits will continue to travel around or in a straight line. Except jungle camps.\r\n- Jungle camps engulfs all the spirits. (So that it doesn't pass through walls and reveals Fiddle location).\r\n- Charged E is best for charging after R into a teamfight as it will guarantee AOE damage (similar to current Fiddle R) and best chances of silencing more than 1 enemy champions.\r\n- Instant E is best use for bursting jungle camps, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nW:\r\nFiddlesticks swings his sickles in a CONE AOE. healing him and causing enemy champions struck to have blood tracks(rephrased as it is not a bleed DOT effect like Darius' Passive).\r\nMoving (stepping) on the path of blood heals Fiddlesticks.\r\n\r\nStacks 3 times. However, the 3rd strike is NOT AOE, instead, a point and click where he slams his sickle and rips his target apart, letting out more blood, dealing more damage and heals him more.\r\n\r\n- Visually, after swinging his sickle, the enemies struck will emit a flowing blood towards Fiddle's mouth and heals him.Fiddle swings clockwise, counterclockwise, and the third stack he slams his sickle on the target instead of AOE.The only problem I have encountered with this is differentiating the blood path from Darius' enemies struck by his passive. It's up to your suggestions what it could look like.\r\nTLDR: fiddle swing swing, 2 times, third time is a point and click; damages and heals him; enemies struck leaves blood tracks which heals him as well.\r\n\r\nQ:\r\nFiddlesticks emit a dark aura/barrier which fears enemy champions that stay within his radius for a few seconds after the ability is casted. Lasts 10-20 seconds. Champions are feared after 3(?) seconds. (Numbers are up to balancing team).\r\n- AOE Range is similar to the max cap range of Charged E.\r\n- Visually may look like old Maokai R, but instead it has an eerie dark mist around it.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nWhile creating this concept, all I had in mind is that the new Fiddle will still play almost exactly the same as the current Fiddle, with Q having the Fear, but instead of point and click, it's an AOE where enemies that stay within his radius gets feared; W being a healing purpose, but instead of standing still like a sitting duck, he can finally MAKE USE OF HIS SICK SICKLE; and E is just stripped of his old R. and the Passive and the R are pretty much one thing, but the reason why the passive is in the passive instead of R Passive is so that pre-6 can still be menacing and spooky with the clones popping in the bush.\r\nJungling combo: Q, E (Instant), then W.\r\nGanking Pre-6: Q, E (Hold), W\r\nGanking Post-6: R, Q, E (Hold), W\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nSkin ideas for the E spirits.\r\n- Classic - dark spirits/ crows\r\n- Spectral - clear spirits\r\n- Bandito - bullets/ crows\r\n- Surprise Party - dog shaped balloons/confettis?\r\n- Risen - locusts\r\n- Praetorian - robotic crows\r\n\r\nTLDR: This Fiddle Concept speaks \"don't get close to the scarecrow\".\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE UPVOTE if you like this so Riot can see\r\nAnd let me know what you think!\r\nIF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMPLAINTS PLEASE KEEP IT OPEN MINDEDLY, AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS!\r\nI tried my best to make it so it could be balance-able and not to overpowered, e.g. the passive does not have grant much vision, the damage, healing, and durations of CC's are up to debate, etc.\r\n\r\n{{champion:9}}","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-16T20:21:11.871+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"good stuff but don't forget about little kids having nightmares :/ lol-ish (lol-ish = half a lol, an unsure lol)","replies":[{"poster":"Xis","date":"2019-08-17T07:16:05.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha spook the kiddies {{champion:9}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2019-08-16T16:04:24.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is already down for rework, the process started, but as its early, if you can get the idea to the team and they like it, it may end up in there in some form or another","replies":[{"poster":"Xis","date":"2019-08-17T07:15:42.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hopefully {{champion:9}}","replies":[]}]}]}
