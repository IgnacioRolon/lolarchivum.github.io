(_Which I guess, most of the community loved_)\r\n_I&#039;m probably not the only one who thought of this submission, and I don&#039;t mind how it will change._\r\nBut here it goes:\r\nSo basically the ultimate is just switching between the Lamb and the Wolf.\r\nAs for now, Lamb is the one with a body, and Wolf is spirit-sort of entity.\r\nIn my suggestion, the Ultimate (being available at level 1 like Elise&#039;s and Nidalee&#039;s),\r\n should swap Wolf as a body (with the same colour as his spirit form) and much like _Zoroark_ (from Pokemon)\r\nAnd the  spirit surrounding him will be Lamb (with of course, the same colour as her body form)\r\n\r\nNow, (_This might sound like the DhaMa concept_) \r\nLamb&#039;s kit being more focused on **healing** and **light crowd control**.\r\nWhile having wolf as the spirit gives **additional damage** and **vision**\r\nAnd Wolf&#039;s kit (**melee**) being more focused on **more health** (such as Mega Gnar) _OR_ **armor and MR** and **movement speed bonus** (being the **chaser**)\r\nWhile having Lamb as the spirits gives **additional range** (Lamb&#039;s attacks, &quot;like Wolf&#039;s Frenzy&quot;) and **heavy crowd control**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is so that they can share the theme equally, which really fits them being two spirits.\r\nI don&#039;t really want to go deeper on what their skills can be changed to and what Wolf&#039;s skill kit can be as long as these concepts above involving the balance will be acknowledged. \r\n\r\nI much appreciate the comments if my suggestion seems unnecessary, and I&#039;d also be happy if my suggestion gets acknowledged. :)\r\nThank you :)\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI love Kindred so much, just that the ultimate seems not to fit the theme of hunters.\r\nWish the best to Riot Games and more **unique** champions to come!\r\n\r\n**Finals.** :)\r\n{{champion:121}}","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-17T23:03:56.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I agree Kindreds ult just looks unoriginal, like a fiora/bard ultimate put together, Riot really needs more ideas :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrMuffinZ1","date":"2015-09-17T23:00:14.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that does sound quite good, albeit sounding a bit repetitive considering the similarities to elise, nid, and quinn (also udyr with changing stances) the idea itself i think is awesome though and i agree that it would fit better with the concept of eternal hunters. However, the healing and invulnerability also makes sense considering thee *eternal* cant hunt if your dead right? idk just some of my thoughts feel free to let me know what you think too and who knows maybe we can come up with something great?","replies":[]}]}
