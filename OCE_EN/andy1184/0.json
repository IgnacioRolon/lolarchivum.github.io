When waiting for a clash game, players can lock in 30 mins before the game starts but are unable to do anything while waiting. I found this as a problem as I had gone to an internet cafe to play clash but 30 mins of paying for the computer were thrown down the drain as I waited to be able to play a game.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is that players are allowed to play in custom games with/ against their own team while they wait so that they can practice and no time is wasted. The team could then be alerted in the custom game that their clash game will start in 10 mins, and then at around 3 - 5 mins, the client kicks them out of the game so that they are ready for their clash game.\r\n\r\nI know if this was to happen, it would mean a lot of work for the development team but I think it would be well worth it as players aren&#039;t wasting time (and in cases like mine, money as we pay for internet cafes).\r\n\r\nThanks Rito.","replies":[]}
