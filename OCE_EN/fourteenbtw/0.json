I logged in at the time I said I was supposed to be unbanned and I&#039;m still banned. Is it due to timezone differences or does this sometimes happen? Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2018-11-17T05:48:13.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ban should tell you what timezone it is based in (usually UTC I think). If not, check in with [player support ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). It's end of season so things are a little hectic right now and it may take them a while to reply. Try to refrain for sending multiple tickets or \"bumping\" your ticket as it will have the opposite effect. \n\nGood luck with your account, and remember the next ban is a perma so be careful.","replies":[]}]}
