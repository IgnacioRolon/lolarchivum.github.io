I also like the stylistic approach with vivid colurs instead and a more cartoony appearance, and yes, we do need Koala Poros so badly!

Really cool getting to see it made across all 3 days and was great talking to such a chill and friendly guy like yourself.\n\nNow that I've played a bit of the new rift I really want to know what parts in particular you worked on most and what's your own favourite part of it? Any chance of changing the frog to actually be cool? My favourite parts are the southern quadrant and reds base, and I love the raptors and bristlebacks! So cool.\n\nAlso, who is your favourite champion? and do you have many online resources for reference and learning different anatomy?\n\nThanks again for showing off your cool as art skills.

He could maybe be a hopping kangaroo/wallaby with his Yordle form (fits well with his bounce skill and maybe you can make his walking animation bouncy too) and as for his Mega-Gnar form, he could be some kind of wombat or frilled neck lizard or some mythical Australian beast (eg. Yowie; basically an Australian version of big foot).\n\nWhat do you think of this skin idea? Do you think it has potential to not only fit well for the OCE region, but also be appealing enough globally to make it a worthwhile skin to make?","replies":[{"poster":"RiotEarp","date":"2014-11-21T16:57:23.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's a great idea, and worthy of some concept iteration.
