VAYNE IS IN SUCH A BAD SPOT RIGHT NOW. Can&#039;t you do anything about it???? Every game Vayne just gets trashed on.

Your discussion about vayne is better suited for the gameplay and strategy boards :)\n\nThat being said, I don't think vayne isn't in a bad spot right now. Its just that the meta has shifted more towards utility adcs like ashe and Jhin, and away from the full on tanky meta in which vayne excelled. She still provides tonnes of damage in the late game, but nowadays the games don't last long enough for hyper carries to scale and reach their full potential.","replies":[]}]}
