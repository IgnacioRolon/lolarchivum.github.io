I reckon there could be so much more play making potential and so much fun if there is 3 teams. The third team could have a yellow nexus and also yellow inhibitor. I believe this would be awesome having 15 players in one game and also a extra team to battle against. I am new to this discussion thing so may you just have a read through this? Even though you guys might not like it. Thanks for reading this. RIOT you guys are the best XD.","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-07-06T05:31:11.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would just end up in one team strugling then two teams killing that team. after that it would be One vs one and one team sitting watching a normal game. games would probally stretch out to like 1.5 hours and no one would have time for that. \n\nWouldnt work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-07-04T10:06:24.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea.. but what about if one team just gets ganged up on??? kinda unfair then hah","replies":[{"poster":"The Violation","date":"2015-07-05T06:05:39.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sure it'll be which ever team is in the lead will get ganged up on","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-07-04T10:08:18.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean critterous has a good idea but this could be a really fun mode like my idea once a ffa mode","replies":[]}]}
