He was my favorite champion but he is so weak now. So pls rework him asap. But if u really wanna design a champion that is mastered by only one player (a korean you-know-who) in the world, forget what I said.

Is the shield too weak? is his ult too hard to coordinate in soloq? does he not have enough cc, movespeed, base stats, earlygame damage, lategame scaling? Projectile speed? Ratios? What happened?\n\n It feels like at some point, something happened, a nerf too far or something, and suddenly he's the weakest champion in the game.\n\nLike 40% winrate, something needs to be done, but I wonder if it Riot really wants to do a 4th ryze rework, because, well, that's alot of reworks.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-01T10:32:29.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=d6JEGixj,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-31T11:48:09.318+0000)\n>\n> why is ryze so weak though?\n> Is the shield too weak? \n\nCheck\n\n> is his ult too hard to coordinate in soloq?\n\nTriple Check\n\n> does he not have enough movespeed?\n\nFrom Q proccing? Check\n\nIt's mainly the ult offering no damage and being bad in soloqueue and that there are other mages that burst him down from a longer distance.","replies":[{"poster":"Skitzoner","date":"2017-11-02T00:42:30.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, my point is that Riot said another Ryze rework should come out before patch 7.22. But it didn't. So there is no need for us to argue whether ryze is weak and desearve a rework or not. I'm just curious about the process of rework that they promised and why is it delayed.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-02T06:01:45.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya i was replying to Nightjar there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
