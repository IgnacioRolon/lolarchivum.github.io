I enter solo queue for a game of normals, I begin the normal wait, Until I get to about 5 minutes in the queue and I realise this is taking a while, So I give it some time, alot of time. I end up cancelling the queue due to having a wait time of 14 Minutes when the expected queue time was 3 minutes (This soon jumped to 7 minutes) Is anyone else having this problem? Im sick and tired of doing Aram Queue (It also happens on Aram just smaller wait times) {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"sp4nkmyp3nguin","date":"2016-07-16T22:30:28.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u can get 4 minutes in silver.. if u click fill ull instantly get placed as a support because every no noobs play it in silver..frustrating supporting some spas that doesnt know when to engage as an adc. really really really hurts me..\njust waited 15 minutes to play jnugle or bot/ mid or bot/ top or mid/ click fill instantly dropped into a game as a support with what i like to refer to as a poke eater of an adc.. \nthen they sit there and go ur not doing anything im getting pumped..id pay to get to gold got dropped because i didnt play for 3 months..climbing back through the dromes and tards back to gold 4 time on promos wait for someone to throw the game..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kobayashi Maru","date":"2016-02-21T04:43:24.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im currently sitting in a low bronze queue (top,adc) for 25min.
