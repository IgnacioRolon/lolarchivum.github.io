The problem that persists is that I will play 1 Game with Ultra and get 200+ Frames and everything is fine, however its when i go into a new game that It decides to play Roulette with my frames, I have recently been getting 35-45 On Very Low, is there a possible fix or is this just a bug. (Side Note: I have disabled the inbuilt card but it seems to have done nothing) {{item:3070}} \n(Note 2: I would be playing and then out of nowhere the game would spike to 300+ FPS and than drop a second later)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:21:18.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this happen on any of your other games/applications?","replies":[{"poster":"D to DFlash","date":"2015-02-05T00:16:59.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, Just league","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-05T06:43:07.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not likely your computer then, so any maintenance won't get you higher frames.\n\nNow, this might be related to the high pings everyone is getting connecting to the server. Crazy, yes, that ping is affecting FPS, but it happens. I'd wait it out a bit more before trying anything.\n\nBut if you're certain there's something wrong with the way League is working on your computer, then you can try the following:\n\n* Repair your client. It will take a while, but it'll make sure it's not the installation itself.\n* Update your drivers. It's entirely possible that something happened with your drivers and how they handle League's and only League's graphics. I for one, know that Nvidia released an update today/yesterday.\n* On the subject of drivers, make sure that none of your driver control panels have abnormal custom settings for League in use, such as x128 anisotropic level or something.\n\nIf those don't work, then it might be a program purposefully set to interfere with League. You can test this out by opening your task manager, viewing all running processes (including services) and then open League. If anything more than Lol Patcher and League Client open, then that might be your issue.\n\n[Here's the support page about it.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-troubleshooting)\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"D to DFlash","date":"2015-02-05T22:12:43.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've went ahead and tried those 3 Ideas, and Im sad to say that It doesn't work.

I'd say to do some other things, but those things would also be affecting your other games. Nevertheless, we've run out of options so I'll list them.\n\n* Disable your automatic maintenance. This varies for each operating system, but usually it's in or near your security settings. Go in and disable this, then run League. If you can't do that, then force close the maintenance task in your task manager.\n* Clean, defrag and reindex your drives. This will make sure that your computer can access them as fast as possible.\n* Troubleshoot with your graphics card manufacturer. You brought the card to be able to play games at a high frame rate with them. If you can't do that, and you've made sure it's not your computer, then there's something wrong with the card. You might be eligible for a refund.\n\nFor the moment you can try disabling shadows and muting all sounds to increase your frame-rate.
