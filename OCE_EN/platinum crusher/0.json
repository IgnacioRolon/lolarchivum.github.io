I would assume I wouldnt go from 14 days to perma ban.\r\nI can say I was tilted the account was still in low elo where I left it and I wasnt enjoying playing there as no one does. I feel like when you take out of context what was happening and just have me getting angry at people trolling me ie. (following me around jungle with smites trying to steal or feeding my lane because they didnt see me call the role first ) I dont get much other choices but to react, either I sit and try play a game where my whole team is abusing me and trying to ruin my fun which leads to me losing and not leaving low elo which means I still play with these players or I leave which also results in a ban. I have tried muting team but it doesnt stop their actions or how they feel only just means I quietly get screwed over. Long rant Unban please or I would like to talk someone about what the options are.","replies":[{"poster":"djfunkey","date":"2018-02-20T05:29:47.901+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Option 1: Create new account and start being nice to others\nOption 2: Go to riot support to see if they can help\nOption 3: Quit league, get a life and move on","replies":[{"poster":"TM06ASF","date":"2018-02-20T05:45:32.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"number 3 sounds the least stressful. its roit(tencent) blanket ban on toxicity doesn't matter if you greif int or even afk at fountain if you say anything that makes someone uncomfortable yes uncomfortable so you could say good job that makes me feel uncomfortable so ima report now. but swearing or anything remotely offensive to someone else and you get a chat ban or perma its stupid and it just means that roit (tencent) can get all these b5s who wanna be faker to start again and buy more shit so they can get more money","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-20T12:18:37.913+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> after spending hundreds of dollars and getting all the champions and playing the game for years with no bans beforehand.
