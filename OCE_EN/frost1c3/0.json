Like I understand that ekko and the like where being abused as quasi tanks and so you made them scale better and nerfed base dmg, but Galio is a Tank HE DOESNT NEED DAMAGE, he was fine the way he was, at best the should of just given him a small scaling buff (if the idea was to nerf his tank dmg), why did he have to scale 30% more on his passive and 15% on his q, plus 1% more per 100ap. The actual hell.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-25T10:48:47.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Case in point...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmrRWISURUI\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-10-25T10:11:01.930+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Galio is blance right now, the player you vs probly better than you.

I respect that you believe Galio is balanced and I respect that others believe that Galio isn't balanced.
