When I go into a game, the loading screen does not appear and tells me there is a firewall issue, and proceeds to quit the game. This has resulted in me unable to play this game for several months, and though recently one of my laptops has begun working again with great speed (~100 ping), it only lasts for a short period before my Internet decides to crash, which for some reason only happens when I play lol. This means I can play an average of 20 minutes of lol per week, which is very frustrating for me. If possible, can someone please give me some advices on how to fix this issue? Thanks and have a nice day :)\r\nP.S. i think our Internet provider is called Adam's wireless or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-11-29T01:17:44.328+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"simple, turn your virus protection firewall off when you play","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2014-11-29T02:46:16.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would do that, but it is apparently my internet's problem as it works well when I use other internets.","replies":[]}]}]}
