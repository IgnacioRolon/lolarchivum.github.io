After one of the players remade, however, he added a twist to the game: all players must pick a jungler, and must pack smite no matter what. The rule steadily evolved throughout the game, and here is the final: all players must pack smite, pick a jungler or mage (so that means no adc or resetting assassins) and you are not allowed to enter lanes no matter what, and both teams brawl it out in the jungles until one team reaches 70 kills.\r\n\r\nThis idea might sound stupid at first, but after we played it, the game was surprisingly fun, due to the fact that the jungle monster camps have a long respawn timer, and were cleared lightning fast when there are 10 junglers in the game, the main income of xp and gold was the enemy players. After the game began, players farm the initial wave of jungles (or tried to counter jungle), then moved onto an arena game where players ventured around checking brushes for enemy players, scanning for wards, placing wards at strategic locations and brawling out from small encounters to epic team fights consisting of a bunch of level 3s. There is also a high intensity when it came to contesting for dragons and barons, as everyone has a smite, and the objectives could be taken by anyone.\r\n\r\nThis gamemode is highly intense and exciting, the game length can be adjusted by the amount of kills needed, and almost feels like what a proper arena game should be, instead of ARAM where whoever gets a poke comp wins (cough cough Nidalee). Unfortunately, while this gamemode is very exciting and fun, it requires a lot of coordination and self-control, as everyone must obey the rules and never go to lane or pick champs not allowed like Kat.\r\n\r\nThat about sums up my proposed gamemode, thanks for reading and please leave constructive comments :D (once again, the idea was not thought up by me)\r\n\r\n\r\ntldr: 5v5 where everyone must pick a jungler or mage, must take smite, no laning, first team to 70 kills win.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-01-20T03:55:35.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"this sounds hilarious!

As a gamemode, I feel the base walls should also be straight up removed in favour of more mobility to both sides.\n\nThere should also be a camp on both side's nexus (your high risk high reward idea), where if you kill your side's camp you gain a small amount of xp and gold, but if you manage to kill the enemy's camp, you get significantly more xp, gold, as well as a small speed buff, the enemy team gets some kind of debuff and the camp respawn timer takes much longer. This should enforce the players to take risks and venture through the enemy's jungle, as well as trying to protect their own camp.\n\nA new summoner's spell like in poro king would be pretty cool, as you get smite, and another summoner where you can place down a small unpassable terrain on the ground very briefly to block certain paths of the jungle.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-01-19T10:47:36.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds interesting enough to be fun. but if it were to become a game mode then the turrets should be replaced with something like the old jg camps (wraiths, wight, the old dragon in the centre of mid lane haha) or have heavily reduced hitpoints and respawn like a camp to add high risk to get greater gold income... make base turrets invulnerable to suit theme.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ringbear","date":"2015-01-19T06:52:52.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe add another win condition like first team to however many camps (250-300?) wins.

When we reached level 18, it was already past the 40 minute mark, so early game champions are generally much better than late game, since a champion needs to kill enemies to level up and get gold, and if you pick someone with a weak early game, odds are you won't even reach late game. \n\nAs an example, in the game i picked sion, and a huge teamfight occurred at the river after both sides cleared their camps, and i got pulled into their team by a blitzcrank, got ganged up on, died immediately but then got a triple kill in passive form due to the fact that everyone had barely any power to stop me. \n\nTeamfighting and fights in general are highly important in this game mode due to the fact that buff camps respawn every 5 minutes, and small camps respawn every 1 minute. Considering how fast a single camp gets cleared and the fact that there are 4 small camps per team, while there are 5 players, this by itself tend to promote some players to prod around the enemy jungle and see if they can pick off a champ or steal a camp.","replies":[]}]}]}
