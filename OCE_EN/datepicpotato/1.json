For example, when you just got into the lobby when a group of your friends came on and asked you to play, often times the dodge function is used so that they could join their friends. However, if they are in a queue for nemesis, they would be conflicted between joining their friends or keeping their icon.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant but I would just like to throw this out there, hopefully Riot could one day put a solution to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-13T06:54:03.817+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not a very good icon, in my opinion, and I wouldn't care if I didn't get it. However, I feel your pain, because if his treatment is used in other gamemodes the same thing is gonna come out. I think it should be something based on the amount you dodge and the amount you play.\nFor example, if someone dodges one game and finishes ten, I think they should still get the icon.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2015-02-13T08:02:31.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do we not get the icon if we dodge a game?\n\nOh.\n\nI accidentally dodged a game because I was picking at the same time as someone else.

The mode seems to bring out the worst in people (and yes sadly that includes myself). Theres just something about giving the enemy 3 ap then the final guy on our team giving them shaco and spamming lol. Or us having 5 tanks and then someone gives them garen. Or when the guy i'm supporting bot gets on a killing spree and decides to run into the enemy and die while simply saying lel. I'll try a few more but this mode is even easier than a normal SR game for a single person to just make downright unfun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-02-13T11:42:39.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, just one dodge for no reward is a pretty harsh punishment, and would actually drive the players that actually want the icons away from the game mode, which is very counter productive.","replies":[]}]}
