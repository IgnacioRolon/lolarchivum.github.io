As you can see none of my mains exactly follow the meta, and I never had problems with that.\r\n\r\nHowever, since ranked apparently \"shows how good you really are\", I decided to play a couple of ranked games under the pressure from my friends. I played a few ranked games last year and the experience was not pleasant. I chose talon mid and my entire team flamed me for not picking zed, despite me doing well. I picked yasuo and everyone questioned me, and when I lose first blood to a volibear top, everyone began nitpicking at my mistakes and at how top yasuo sucks. I got fed up so I reverted to normals before my 7 month firewall issue.\r\n\r\nNow, I finlly got a new router which enabled me to play lol again, and I decided I wanted to try my hands at ranked again, but the same things happened again. I play wukong mid and everyone flames me because I lost to an ahri. I play heimer top and everyone flames me because I was 1 shot by the enemy shaco that fed off our Warwick.\r\n\r\nI feel this is unfair and unjustified. I should have freedom to play whatever cheese pick I choose without being considered a troll. I know that this post is just me ranting but seriously, what happened to everyone's creativity? Everyone should simply play the champions they enjoy playing rather than picking the champion currently most op in the meta, then moving onto the next one once the champ gets nerfed. People say that winning is fun, but playing a champion you don't like just because it will help you win, is that what people consider fun?\r\n\r\nOnce again, I am sorry for the text wall and the rant, but I feel this issue must be resolved somehow, and I think lol will be a much better place when people can play whatever they want without being flamed at for stupid mistakes. Thanks for reading and have a nice day :)\r\n\r\ntl;dr meta is stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-01-23T08:11:15.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> tl;dr meta is stupid.\n\nCouldn't agree more. I love playing Quinn and whenever I pick her in normals I get flamed, even when I do well (sometimes managing to 2 hit enemy tanks). People just think that META is the *only* way to go and not using the META will immediately result in a loss because they're all mindless sheep that can't think of playing for fun. Mind you I am just talking about those who flame people who don't always pick META champs, not necessarily anyone who follows the META.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-23T03:31:38.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meta doesn't exist in bronze\n\n\nI %%%%ing picked Vlad bot lane and still manage to go 3/0/1 at bot.(normals, but you get the point, meta doesn't exist at low elo)","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-23T05:40:00.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You missed the point, I am NOT a meta player, and I go around getting 10-1 and stuff with ad taric and mid wukong.

For example, if 2 people at the same elo picked Gnar and Heimer top, id back the Gnar 10/10 times because hes proven to be alot more useful on a daily basis. Having a cheese / off pick is ok... but unless you accept that its probably a dumb move doing it every game unless youre a proven god at that champ.. id stop.","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-23T03:19:37.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about sleeper champions?

However, in the case of to Yasuo, I lost first blood to volibear by around 20 health, and even when I became powerful late game, I was still being nit picked at how top yasuo sucks.\n\nAs for my wukong mid, I came to ranked after not playing for a really long time, and fought an ahri, who I had no idea what to do against before I realised I have always dreaded fighting ahri as wukong. By that time, I was already 2 kills behind due to a failed gank where our jarvan pressured me to push which resulted in me being charmed under turret.\n\nI have been playing off meta picks for about as long as I have been playing lol (even my first ever main was heimer) and I am rather good at most of them enough to have a decent ratio.
