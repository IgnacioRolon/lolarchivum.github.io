I have always loved mordekaiser' design (HUEHUEHUE) but when I picked him up and played him, I realised how horrible and anti-fun to play as, and walked away disappointed. Recently, however, I began playing AD mordekaiser, and have found him to be extremely fun and hilarious to play as, and decided to restart playing mordekaiser again.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I saw the patch note, I see that you guys are reworking mordekaiser while also making him far more centered towards AP. I understand that you guys want to make him a more enjoyable champion to play as and against, but I would like to ask what will happen to AD mordekaiser? Will his q ad scaling be kept? His kit also seems to make no sense whether he is meant to be a tank or Mage or support, so it would be nice if you guys could clear it up for me.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a nice day :)","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-02-20T08:55:11.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They scrapped the rework and just left the movement speed buff on his W.\n\nAnd they wanted him to be less AP centred and more of a tank-ey beef-ey champion. AD Mordekaiser really doesn't exist.\n\nHe's meant to be an AP Bruiser.","replies":[]}]}
