I know that most people don&#039;t really care, but I would like to ask how exactly does the tracker track your role? For example, if I play AP Volibear mid, will I be marked as a mage or a bruiser?","replies":[{"poster":"Nardiastorm","date":"2015-05-09T03:12:43.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what believe, the way that champion mastery  identifies your role on a specific character is from that champions primary role rather than what role you actually played in game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ediwir","date":"2015-05-09T08:40:32.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yup.\nEven my games as Ashe are counted as ADC rather than Support.
