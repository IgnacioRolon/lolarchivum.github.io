Personally I find it really disrupts my play style as it doesn't allow me to quickly glance right down towards my skillbar to see the duration of effects on me. \n\nA major problem with the new tiny icons stuffed in a corner is that I enjoy playing graves, but with the new status bar, I find it difficult to keep track of my passive to ensure when to hit a minion to keep it up.\n\n@Riot, if possible, can you guys add an option to change the location of the status bars? I would greatly appreciate the option, along with many people I know of. \n\nThanks for reading and have a nice day. :)","replies":[{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-09T05:49:13.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"+1\nI don't like it being split up either, I always get confused how many potions are active on me at one time....etc\n\nMaybe I just need to get used to it, but I much preferred when all buffs were located in one spot and not needing to think about where to quickly glance.","replies":[]}]}
