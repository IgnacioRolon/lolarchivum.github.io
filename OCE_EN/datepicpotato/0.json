The thing is, I have not used Fiora a single time yet, but to refund her I still need to use a refund token. Therefore, I request that there is a free refund if you accidentally purchased a wrong champion, skin or rune, but did not use it a single time. Seems rather logical to me tbh.\r\nHave a nice day {{champion:35}}","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-01-10T04:07:53.683+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"How did you confuse zyra with fiora?

Now I go onto someone and they immediately zhonya's while I just stand there looking stupid. As a matter of fact assassins used to have the most silence in the game, tied perhaps with mages.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-10T03:59:49.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah they did, and everyone complained about them.
