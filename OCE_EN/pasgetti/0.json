I only have an issue with this game. My speed when browsing or downloading are normal, my set up hasn&#039;t changed and I haven&#039;t changed any settings either.\n\nAnyone have any clues on what the cause could be?\n\nALSO  part way through the match I always get disconnected for a minute or so before reconnecting automatically.\n\nEdit Again: When I ping the OCE servers I get 5-6 replies at 51-52ms, then one at 170-350ms, 5 more at 51-52ms, then a Request timed out. From here the cycle repeats itself.","replies":[{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-08-29T09:08:57.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i did a ping too and i seem to be getting 1k+ms every 2nd reply and <20ms every other time.\n\nit just seems to stick to 300+ms throughout game\nriot pls :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DamoMan","date":"2015-08-25T11:33:18.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i am having this exact problem minus the D/C, its fine for a minute but then will go up to 500 ping or whatever stupid amount! and jsut keep repeating itself.
