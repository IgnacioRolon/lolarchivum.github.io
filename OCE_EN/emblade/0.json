Please try to reconnect to the game.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well this is the first time in a LOOONG time i&#039;ve experienced this issue. I&#039;ve checked the boards for solutions. Updated drivers, checked firewall, turned off anti-virus etc. I have come to the conclusion that it is not my computer, or internet, but must be a problem with the client itself. Bear in mind this only happens during the loading screen as the game starts. I am unable to connect to the loading screen, and thus I lose LP. This is the 2nd time that this has happened. \n\nRequest - create a way where if a person/s does not connect within the 5 minutes of the game starting, the game is disbanded. This will allow players to not wait 20 minutes to surrender, and thus they are able to wait a shorter time to get a proper 5 on 5 match. \n\nAlso, with problems like these, if it is not my own computer/internet(s) fault I should not lose LP over not being able to connect to game. That only seems fair as I find it frustrating now that the queue times are much longer. \n\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-04T03:25:49.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have been talking for a while now about something like an early surrender or something of the like for games where someone afks/doesn't connect. The issue lies in creating a system that can't be abused.\n\nAs for your second point about it being out of your control, the stance is essentially \"it may not have been your fault, but you still ruined the game for 9 other people\". If it happens every once in a while you'll face no punishment for it. If it is a consistent problem, and you continue to play under those conditions, then you have to accept that you will face punishment for it.\n\nYour issue most likely lies somewhere in your client as you say, and since you have tried most other things your best bet is to try for a full reinstall. Beyond that, I'm no tech expert, but it's the one thing that fixes most things that I can see you haven't done yet, so I'd suggest giving it a go.","replies":[]}]}
