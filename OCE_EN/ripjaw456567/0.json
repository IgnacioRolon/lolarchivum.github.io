Welcome to patch 6.3, the one where we finally make changes to Dragon and give assassins a shiny new toy. Shout-outs to Pwyff for covering in my absence - now let's dive in and get educational. 6.3, like the two patches before, can be thought of as the 'final chapter' in our preseason follow-up trilogy.","url":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-63-notes","image":"http://na.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/patchnotes_2016header.jpg?itok=BemmClU5"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"HELLO THERE PEOPLE OF LEAGUE OF LEGENDS! I am a Zed main and due to this item joining the game. I have decided to speak out my opinions of this item being added to the game. In my opinion i think this item is making Zed not &#039;unique&#039;. I think that the item&#039;s passive should change instead of removing it. It&#039;s a great idea having an ad assassin item but it would be more better to change the passive so it would not be so similar to Zed&#039;s ult. An example of a different passive for Duskblade of Draktharr","replies":[{"poster":"MaherKBT","date":"2016-02-10T06:56:31.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-02-10T07:27:21.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Being a zed main myself, Zed will still be fun.....how can one item change the excitement you get from playing him.....Not like you're adjusting some massive playstyles to fit this item.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-02-10T07:22:59.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apart from the damage being delayed, how is it similar to Zed's ult? Zed's ult damage is based off of how much damage Zed does after using his ult whereas this new item does damage based on how much missing HP the target has. \n\nThis is a pretty big buff to Zed and other assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-10T07:20:13.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This isn't the first time this is happened. The Riot design team often uses cool mechanics from different areas of League, and applies them to others. \n\nA few examples of this are:\n\n{{champion:432}} **Bard**'s and {{champion:127}} **Lissandra**'s Ults are essentially {{item:3157}} **Zhonya's Hourglass**\n{{champion:1}} **Annie**'s Tibbers' passive is a really strong {{item:3068}} **Sunfire Cape**\n{{champion:40}} **Janna**'s Passive is pretty much the {{item:1307}} **Captain Boots Enchantment**\n{{item:3075}} **Thornmail** is {{champion:33}} **Rammus'** W\n{{champion:86}} **Garen**'s passive is very similar to the passive on {{item:3083}} **Warmogs Armour**\n{{item:3026}} **Guardian Angel** is also akin to {{champion:26}} **Zilean** Ult\n\nIs this lazy design on Riot's behalf? Not really I'd say. They've just thought up really fun mechanics, and they want to open up those mechanics for more champions.\n\nI definitely understand where you're coming from with this though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-02-10T06:41:12.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}}  \"Ok\"","replies":[]}]}
