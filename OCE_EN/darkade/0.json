I'm looking for a consistent group to play with. I'm really committed to the game so will take on any advice I can get and would love to play with you guys. I main ADC, almost never go negative and feel like I get a pretty high level of CS (60-70) @ 10 min. I've encountered heaps of issues with people trolling support if at all.

I main top lane but can play all roles except ADC. I have a large top lane champ pool, medium sized pools for both mid/jg. I am available most arvo's most days so pretty flexible.
