He has excellent harassment abilities at early game, he's also very versatile and can be played in any lane(or maybe the jungle; tell me if it works!), and his early-to-mid power spikes are enormous partly thanks to his innate double critical-chance. \n\nHowever Yasuo has his fair share of weaknesses; he is relatively squishy and is therefore at a slight disadvantage in the Season Five Bruiser Meta, and early crowd control will destroy him, but that's not what I want to discuss. \n\nOk, straight to the point. I will show you a reworked version of Yasuo's Sweeping Blade which highlights what I am talking about.\n\n(Listing modified factors only; stats are the same)\n\n* Using Sweeping Blade on an allied unit will dissipate Yasuo's flow shield giving the target the shield for one second.\n* Doing this will disable Sweeping blade for a longer cooldown and will cancel Yasuo's Rising Storm stacks.\n\nRiot was emphasising \"Strategic diversity\" in late Season Four, and I think this rework fits the deal. \n\nThis new version of Sweeping Blade means that while Yasuo can get away from a desperate problem such as a gank or a chaser by dashing through a trusty minion or support, he is vulnerable to further threats as his E is on cooldown longer and rids Yasuo of his essential dash skill. It can also encourage Yasuo players to play supportively also at a risk of losing fight potential.\n\nPlease, give me some feedback and share some ideas. If Riot uses this? Hooray, my dream comes true.\n\n{{item:3074}} for life!","replies":[{"poster":"Socio","date":"2015-02-18T09:29:13.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe there should be a disable that affects Yasuo in a more significant way. Maybe all his skills have five seconds added to their cooldown? I really want to emphasise the fact that an allied dash should be an absolute last resort. I don't know, better ideas anyone? Maybe I'm just making him too difficult to play, which I'm fine with because I am fine with Azir and I also main Meepo from DOTA 2. \n\n{{item:3074}} for life.
