First of all we had a fizz top, he claimed to only play mid and after being denied he picked him (sure what could go wrong he must be great at fizz to be so confident, 1/4 btw), then after the enemy had picked pyke and kaisa, our support picked xerath despite losing 2 games before horribly (I checked his match history 2/3,6/8 and this game 3/9). This is borderline inting in my opinion, but i still decided to give it a shot because I was in a positive mindset to climb. The game starts withs a 2 minute gank down bot, of course despite my pings, my xerath played too aggressive and give up first blood, this is when i said lame. When xerath returned to lane, he did not care that he just died and played even more aggressive and gave up another kill to our already losing match up which annoyed me quite a bit. Xerath continued to ignore my pings and did not say a word, which is considered very honourable btw. Soon after I was dived, and was dived again when i returned to lane, this was when i said open please, our lane was 1/5 at this time (1 kill on the jungler). I did not say open please simply because the bot lane itself was getting dumpesterd on, no doing a quick sweep though the map the only lane that is not being out matched with champs was mid, and that alone would not have made me say open please. My top lane and junglers were arguing around 5 minutes in, telling each other to afk and threatening to report each other(jungle afkd for 2 minutes btw), I did not see even a chance of us winning a game where the enemy jungler could just continually dive us without consequences it would just tilt me and ruin my chances to climb in later games. Seeing that others did not open and give up i gave it one more shot, and it worked, I killed the pyke while he was diving me but was soon dived by 4 people once again. I do not blame anyone I lost lane but lets take 1 step back and see how my team was doing, top fizz and afk jg still arguing, my support is still not talking and just keeps shooting at the blindly with barely any wards, and my mid lane is remaining positive since no one has touched her lane. I admit this can be considered toxic at this time but i was being truthful and wanted to convince my team to not waste time as I saw no chance of our comp winning and especially when we&#039;re performing badly, ahri&#039;s taunts (why do you even play?) however  just added fuel to the flame and made me more aggressive, when she herself barely survived in lane. Despite saying everything I still played and respected the players on my team that still wanted to play (even though i hated them). But because of the feud between my jungler my top my support, the whole team started to threaten a report on everybody, when I was finally targeted i said &#039;colddog: i report u for wasting my time&#039; which was just out of pure frustration at how the team would rather sit in a losing game and type the whole time rather than surrendering and move on to a new match. I know i was being negative and everything, and have lost my season rewards, I just wanted others opinion on the fairness of the one sided ban, the afk flaming jungler, the silent half trolling xerath and the angry cocky top fizz have not been banned and I was the only one.

Any further offences in the near future will result in a permanent suspension of your account.\n\nIf this was a chat restriction, then it is a warning that your behaviour is getting out of hand, and that you need to step up your game if you want to avoid further punishments.\n\nIf you want to appeal for removal or as is appropriate in come cases, for a reduction of your punishment, you can do so through player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new \n\nThey will only answer the questions you ask, yes or no questions will receive yes or no answers.

If you think a 1.9 KDA is so bad what about these games in *your* recent history?\n\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/220617507/200485695?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/220606067/200485695?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/220554392/200485695?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/220536651/200485695?tab=overview\n\nWere you inting in all of them?\n\n>my xerath played too aggressive and give up first blood\n\nYou could have said \"Hey, let's not be too aggressive just poke them out\". Instead you called your support lame for dying once.\n\n>this was when i said open please\n\nSo you decided it was a lost game and that it wasn't worth playing. Why do you get to make this decision? Since when is 1/5 a deciding vote? Since when does a lost lane (badly or otherwise) guarantee a lost game? You don't, it isn't and it doesn't. \n\nThat is what a surrender vote is for. Assuming no extenuating circumstances, until that surrender vote succeeds, you are expected to be trying to win just like everyone else, and if you aren't, that makes *you* the griefer. This is *especially* true in ranked games.\n\nI can't count the number of times I or someone or multiple someones has lost lane hard and we've still won the game, you are only doing yourself and your team a disservice.\n\n>My top lane and junglers were arguing around 5 minutes in, telling each other to afk and threatening to report each other\n\nIt sucks, it happens, but you realise you did exactly the same thing? You say \"open\", have clearly given up playing properly at this point and proceed to abuse your top, jng and support. If their behaviour is so bad, why do you get a free pass?\n\n>I know i was being negative and everything, and have lost my season rewards, I just wanted others opinion on the fairness of the one sided ban, the afk flaming jungler, the silent half trolling xerath and the angry cocky top fizz have not been banned and I was the only one.

If those other players were reported and had done the same, they will be punished as well, while you are only responsible for *your* behaviour.\n___","replies":[{"poster":"FuriousGamer2000","date":"2018-10-07T12:30:58.241+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello, firstly thanks for reading everything i've written and providing quite a lengthy response (reading back i realize the whole thing is really passive aggresive and toxic, but my english isn't very good and this is the best i can do to convey how i feel)\n\nFirst of all,  the xerath and jhin pick into pyke kaisa is a horrible match up, with a small jungle pressure advantage there is hardly any space for us to catch back up. \nThe 'lame' I said was refering to the fact we got level 2 ganked and did not blame anyone. \nAs for the inting games you have sent me is almost a joke, are you even looking at the scores of my teammates, I'm not blaming them for my loss because i lost too, but there really isnt much you can do when all 3 lanes lose especially in a game where the assassin champs get fed, plus that I had no intentions pushing on the blame on xerath, he played better than everyone on the team after the laning phase, I was the only one to actually try and turn the game around with xerath despite what i've said. Which is not fair when you said i did not play properly. I sent the link of the match to show how little my team was trying they did not defend, did not team fight, did not ward, they were simply their to flame. It was too difficult for xerath or myself to fight back when we have no peel and no reliable cc agaisnt their team, when I said borderline inting I meant it as picking a very obvious bad pick into a very strong counter, had xerath picked a tank cc support such as leona, who knew what could have happened.\nWhen i said open please, I made it quite clear that it was very early into the game with already losing matchups, and at this point i have no expectations for getting carried by a losing fizz top, flaming  afking kha'zix jungle, the ahri who got solo killed, every lane lost! It was quite simple, but the mid and support refused to move on to a new match. Turn around is not uncommon, but with a team comp such as ours, and scores as bad as ours, it would be obvious for most players to end it at that point and as i've said previously I did play the game out as i usually would. I am not gonna bother trying to get out of a ban because i know how strict riots system is, they do not care that the people who have submitted the reports are just butt hurt cause they lost a match together (don't bring bs about my negative attitude losing the game, i tried harder than the other players despite the crappy circumstances and chat log), and not actually offended by me calling them 'stupid lol'. \n\ntl;dr I 'flamed' the whole team, my negative attitude held the team hostage despite me wanting to end the match? Threatened and did definitely did not ASK for my team to open and move on to a new game. And carried out my 'threat' with  91% kill participation.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-08T08:54:08.506+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">The 'lame' I said was refering to the fact we got level 2 ganked and did not blame anyone.\n\n\"of course despite my pings, my xerath played too aggressive and give up first blood, this is when i said lame.\" Was what undertstandably gave me the impression the 'lame' was specifically referring to the Xerath, and it seems likely it was taken that way too.\n\n>As for the inting games you have sent me is almost a joke\n\nThat was the point. You reduced the Xerath's skill to two bad scores, not even including the assists in your judgement. I'm not saying you were inting, I'm saying that if you are going argue that the Xerath is inting with your only proof being two bad scores, then by your own argument you are inting in more than a couple games as well.\n\n>Which is not fair when you said i did not play properly.\n\nPerhaps you got back to it at some point, but noone is going to be playing properly while they are calling open bot, intentionally or otherwise. At that point you've accepted it's a loss, so why put in 100%? YOu may well have seen some hope and started putting your all in later in the game, but for a decent chunk of the game your attitude was \"this game is already over\", which is not a good attitude to have in ranked.\n\n>I meant it as picking a very obvious bad pick into a very strong counter\n\nComfort over counter. He could have picked a tank support, but he would have done worse on Braum having never played him before than a Xerath he is familiar with.\n\n>When i said open please, I made it quite clear that it was very early into the game \n\nThat makes it worse not better. The earlier in the game the more potential for comeback. You don't get to make that choice, the team has to make that choice. Losing does not mean lost, and a lost lane doesn't mean a lost game.\n\n>they do not care that the people who have submitted the reports are just butt hurt cause they lost a match together\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right. If you hadn't done anything worthy of punishment, the reports would have been thrown out. If you hadn't done anything worthy of punishment you wouldn't have been punished.","replies":[{"poster":"FuriousGamer2000","date":"2018-10-10T02:44:05.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't think you've read everything and understand everything I've tried to explain, but I appreciate your responses. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-10T02:52:55.933+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did read everything, but it's difficult to fully grasp another player's perspective from a few posts.
