Honestly not bad but I don't think it'll happen.. I have friends with 100000+ IP and all the champions who just spend it on name changes, so I'd probably get gifted every champion off them.. It wouldn't be too fun/fair really. I like feeling like I really earned something.\n\nAlso it would increase botting, since they'd grind IP then use it to champion gift others.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-21T07:24:48.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did your friend buy all the runes? tier 1/2/3","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-21T10:24:00.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have all runes and champions.
