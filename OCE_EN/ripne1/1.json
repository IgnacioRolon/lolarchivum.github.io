You essentially waste 900 gold building that item. If you built morellonomicon, you'd only be spending 2400 as opposed to 3000 gold. Morello gives the same amount of AP, the same amount of CDR, gives you mana to help with mana problems, and applies grevious wounds, meaning adc's using heal will heal significantly less, meaning you'll be more successful in assassination, for less gold.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Oprah Windfurry","date":"2015-09-17T21:29:11.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked system is working as intended.
