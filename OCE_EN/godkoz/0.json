I&#039;ve now had a message from you saying that you are protecting my account from demotion but i need to win games to keep my ranked.\r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks its nice that you dont let a couple of loses stop you from dropping a division. \r\nAlso not thanks... Your protection is what is stuffing me over at the moment. My MMR got tanked from some loses so I&#039;m P5 playing in games with silver 1s and gold 5-3s. That&#039;s all well and good if that&#039;s my mmr that&#039;s my mmr. \r\n\r\nBut you are still treating me as a P5, so when i win a game you only give me 11-15Lp. But if i lose you are removing 22-26Lp.\r\n\r\nSo for every lose i have to win 2 in a row to break even 3 to get ahead. You are requiring me to have a 75% winrate in order to move up 12-15Lp at a time. That is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI implore you please either level out my Lp lose/gains where I am at p5. Or let me drop to gold so my lp gains level out again and i dont have to keep up an unrealistic winrate in order to climb anywhere.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-18T01:31:24.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You earn LP basd on your mmr not your rank. If you're earning little and losing lots, it's either because you've climbed super fast and it's dragging you back down to where you should be, or it's that you've dropped super fast and it's essentially testing you, since theoretically if you belong in that higher MMR bracket and have just had some bad games you'll be winning more games than losing and will climb back regardless, but if you've genuinely dropped in skill (be it from time, inattention etc etc) then it'll drag you down until you plateau.","replies":[]}]}
