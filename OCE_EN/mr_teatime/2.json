now.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":6,"body":"Nothing in the chat log is edited, yes it was a one game chat log (this was an INSTANT feedback, like i got suspended while in the champ select for the game after this one)\r\n\r\nThe only things i said that were reportable were \r\n\r\nMr TeaTime: im afk till you fucks stop farming the jungle and grow a brain\r\nand\r\nMr TeaTime: this wukongs actually retarded\r\n\r\nNow dont give me the whole \"reee you have to go through the chat ban tiers first\" i went through both tiers of chat ban in in just the last week, i know full well that my next punishment was a 14 ban, what i didnt expect was it to get triggered by something so simple.\r\n\r\nThat and you can see in the chat log that im pretty civilly if not bluntly talking to someone who is and i quote \"using derogative terms to talk to me\" and we both know he isnt banned.\r\n\r\nIll let you in on a secret riot, the reason you will literally never get rid of toxicity in your game with a chat based report system.\r\n\r\nis right here, staring you right in the face.\r\n\r\nMr TeaTime: im not gonna sugar coat shit to protect the feelings of someone i wont ever see again\r\nMr TeaTime: like you need to get that through your head dude\r\nMr TeaTime: the reason i have no remorse\r\nMr TeaTime: is because i literally dont care about you\r\nMr TeaTime: i dont know you\r\nMr TeaTime: i have no reason to care\r\nMr TeaTime: Its actually naive to think everyone you meet will treat you like youev been friends for years\r\n\r\nYou can keep lowering the bar on what will flip the switch on the instant feedback bot, but it will literally never change human nature.\r\n\r\nYou want to ACTUALLY stop toxicity? remove the anonymity, take the korea approach, Tie peoples accounts to their ID, then ban based on ID not on account.\r\n\r\nWe both know you wont because you make more money letting toxic people make new accounts.\r\n\r\nThe bad thing for you is when i make a new account no money goes to you, Pumping out those S's gets me everything i want pretty fast.\r\n\r\nIts also why i dont care if people report me, because lets say you do perm this account, i just spin up a new one, and get all my shit back by stomping on noobs, and make their games worse because they have to deal with me in their games.\r\n\r\nAnd im so low in elo that people are pissing me off enough that im getting reported for it, then starting a new account also cuts weeks out of my ranked grind.\r\n\r\nTheres literally no consequence here, The only punishment you have is to take away something that has no value to me, and is based on the circumstances actually benefiting me to get rid of.\r\n\r\nBut hey dont listen to the person who \"is toxic\" about why they are toxic, and just keep taking stabs in the dark about what youre doing wrong, im sure youl figure it out eventually once weve killed your game by pissing off your community.\r\n\r\nBut ill give you a hint, shitty matchmaking that puts HUGE gaps in team skill = toxicity\r\nA report system that doesnt actually punish people who deserve it and only goes off whats said in chat and is in turn very easy to manipulate (see my \"ive been doing this for years comment, i obviously slipped up with two lines, but if i hadnt said those two i wouldn't been punished at all, and ultimately i DID make those 4 players have a shitty game, which was my intention, i was being legitimately toxic, but in a way that chat logs can never show, and it wasnt gameplay either, it was very carefully done so its not re-portable, chat bots don't fucking work) = toxicity\r\n\r\nRelying on people to be nice to complete strangers =  toxicity\r\n\r\nThe matchmaking fix alone would cut out like 90% of toxicity.\r\n\r\nBecause think of your typical example of someone being toxic, how many of those cases are because someone made a mistake thats legitimately not normal in your elo and the toxic player has said something along the lines of \"Youre trash go back to iron\" thats the majority of toxicity in this game, and guess what, its caused purely by shitty matchmaking, because its triggered by an action, which is caused by a player of lower calibre being in the same team as the toxic player.\r\n\r\nIf matchmaking had more of a focus on getting even team skill spreads instead of going \"oh we put this much higher mmr player on this team so we will give them a much lower mmr player to average it out\" because we all know thats how you do it, we all know you work off team average mmr, instead of trying to match on the individual level, and it doesnt fucking work.\r\n\r\nLike heres an example if i just throw a 2000 mmr player into a 1000 mmr game doesnt happen but lets do it to show the point.\r\n\r\nBy going with team mmr average you are in turn REQUIRED to give him a player of literally 0 mmr to reach the average you are looking for assuming the enemy teams average mmr is 1000, this sounds like it would work, but heres why it wont.\r\n\r\nTeam A with the 2000 mmr player has 1 player whos better than 5 of the enemy team players. awesome.\r\n\r\nTeam B has 5 players that are better than a player on team A.\r\n\r\nAnd since this game has strayed so far from \"just get fed and solo carry\" due to the intense team focus, id actually rather be on team B in that scenario.\r\n\r\nId rather have to face the insane 1000mmr above me player, than BE that player.\r\n\r\nBecause if i have to face that player, but i know everyone on my team is JUST as good as i am, you know how ill respond? ill play safe, and not get him fed.\r\n\r\nYOu know how the 0 mmr player will respond to an ENTIRE TEAM being better than him? hes going to steamrolled and gangbanged till we beat the much better player through sheer gold advantage.\r\n\r\nYour matchmaking system Punishes you for being good but not too good, \r\n\r\nAnd i didnt even get to the part where those 5 players who are worse than you will get mad mmr gains for having you on the enemy team, while if you win you get shit fucking all mmr gains since youre \"twice as good as the enemy team\" which in turn trains you to not care if your teams doing good since if you win it doesnt really matter, and to blow your shit if your teams shit since you lose ALOT if you lose.\r\n\r\nBut hey again as i said, dont listen to the actually toxic person who knows whats going through their head and KNOWs why they do what they do, just keep taking stabs in the dark and see if you can figure out the problem by yourself, dw, i dont believe in you, i know youl never figure it out.\r\n\r\nNow if youl excuse me, im going to keep playing, because its super naive to think this is my only account.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nMr TeaTime: how the fuck do they send their entire team mid faster than it takes you guys to go mid\r\nMr TeaTime: im afk till you fucks stop farming the jungle and grow a brain\r\nMr TeaTime: report me i dont give a shit\r\nMr TeaTime: all i care about is the win\r\nMr TeaTime: this wukongs actually retarded\r\nMr TeaTime: 100% if i went afk right now youd lose simple because itd be a 3v5\r\nMr TeaTime: kill whoring isnt a viable strat\r\nMr TeaTime: Nah actually threatening afk works wonders\r\nMr TeaTime: worst case scenario you get a bit cranky and report me\r\nMr TeaTime: which i dont give a shit about\r\nMr TeaTime: and best case scenario\r\nMr TeaTime: you do what youre told\r\nMr TeaTime: which makes us win\r\nMr TeaTime: so its actually win win for me to threaten you\r\nMr TeaTime: sorry fam\r\nMr TeaTime: yeah?\r\nMr TeaTime: and?\r\nMr TeaTime: As ive already stated\r\nMr TeaTime: you reporting me and thinking im toxic\r\nMr TeaTime: is not a reason to not be toxic to you\r\nMr TeaTime: because i dont give a shit\r\nMr TeaTime: youre only way out\r\nMr TeaTime: is to just not give me a reason to be toxic\r\nMr TeaTime: yeah of course i have no remorse\r\nMr TeaTime: because ill call a retard a retard\r\nMr TeaTime: im not gonna sugar coat shit to protect the feelings of someone i wont ever see again\r\nMr TeaTime: like you need to get that through your head dude\r\nMr TeaTime: the reason i have no remorse\r\nMr TeaTime: is because i literally dont care about you\r\nMr TeaTime: i dont know you\r\nMr TeaTime: i have no reason to care\r\nMr TeaTime: Its actually naive to think everyone you meet will treat you like youev been friends for years\r\nMr TeaTime: THATS retarded\r\nMr TeaTime: i wont get banned\r\nMr TeaTime: ive been doing this\r\nMr TeaTime: for years\r\nMr TeaTime: Im not using racial slurs, im not using derogatory terms, im not telling you to commit certain acts\r\nMr TeaTime: riot\r\nMr TeaTime: doesnt\r\nMr TeaTime: care\r\nMr TeaTime: why would someone who doesnt care that you exist\r\nMr TeaTime: want to facebook you?\r\nMr TeaTime: are you stupid?\r\nMr TeaTime: you know if you just did what youre told instead of arguing back i wouldnt be busy typing\r\nMr TeaTime: Like you guys do realise\r\nMr TeaTime: all of this\r\nMr TeaTime: literally all of this\r\nMr TeaTime: is because i told you to do something\r\nMr TeaTime: and you talked back\r\nMr TeaTime: weve just been reactively typing back the entire time\r\nMr TeaTime: issue is theres nothing tangible i can do to stop this\r\nMr TeaTime: there is something tangible you can do however\r\nMr TeaTime: oh no see its not that i want this to stop\r\nMr TeaTime: what part i dont care dont you get\r\nMr TeaTime: all i care about\r\nMr TeaTime: is that you end up doing what youre told\r\nMr TeaTime: and?\r\nMr TeaTime: heres a hint buddy\r\nMr TeaTime: just because you dont like it\r\nMr TeaTime: doesnt mean ill stop\r\nMr TeaTime: because by extension of not caring that you exist\r\nMr TeaTime: i also dont care about your feelings\r\nMr TeaTime: so you not liking something is not a reason for me to stop\r\nMr TeaTime: lol insult me all you want dude doesnt change shit\r\nMr TeaTime: infact just gives me a reason to report YOU\r\nMr TeaTime: and considering how much weight you think reports hold\r\nMr TeaTime: that should scare you shitless\r\nMr TeaTime: like lemme give you a wake up call\r\nMr TeaTime: You are actually using derogative terms to speak to me, thats an actual reportable offence\r\nMr TeaTime: im just talking alot\r\nMr TeaTime: thats not reportable\r\nMr TeaTime: so lets do a logic excercise\r\nMr TeaTime: im doing something not on the list\r\nMr TeaTime: you think you can still report me\r\nMr TeaTime: that must mean in your mind reports are very easy to go through\r\nMr TeaTime: so youre doing something that is on the list\r\nMr TeaTime: which makes reporting you about a hundreds times more effective\r\nMr TeaTime: if im reportable\r\nMr TeaTime: what makes you not repotable\r\nMr TeaTime: why dont YOU care\r\nMr TeaTime: Oh right\r\nMr TeaTime: because reports\r\nMr TeaTime: dont do shit\r\nMr TeaTime: exactly thats my point\r\nMr TeaTime: you on the otherhand\r\nMr TeaTime: you actually HAVE a chance of getting an infraction\r\nMr TeaTime: because unlike me\r\nMr TeaTime: youve actually done something reportable\r\nMr TeaTime: again just more fuel for the report\r\nMr TeaTime: ill literally tell you how riots report system works\r\nMr TeaTime: you insult someone, potentially hurt their feelings\r\nMr TeaTime: tahts a ban\r\nMr TeaTime: you do literally anything else\r\nMr TeaTime: scott free\r\nMr TeaTime: no actually you dont\r\nMr TeaTime: because ill repeat myself\r\nMr TeaTime: ive been doing it for years\r\nMr TeaTime: im not banned\r\nMr TeaTime: im walking proof\r\nMr TeaTime: your report\r\nMr TeaTime: is useless\r\nMr TeaTime: yeah\r\nMr TeaTime: my report will get you banned though\r\nMr TeaTime: &lt;3\r\nMr TeaTime: but hey\r\nMr TeaTime: if you be a good boy and do what youre told\r\nMr TeaTime: maybe i wont\r\nMr TeaTime: more fuel fam\r\nMr TeaTime: insulting me is just a really stupid thing to do\r\nMr TeaTime: because 1, its reportable\r\nMr TeaTime: 2, it just gives me more reason to report you\r\nMr TeaTime: out of spite\r\nMr TeaTime: i wont get banned weve been over this\r\nMr TeaTime: the only thing you can do at this point, is sit down, shut up, and do what youre told\r\nMr TeaTime: otherwise you get banned, and i just go about my day with nothing changed\r\nMr TeaTime: because i dont care\r\nMr TeaTime: for what though lol\r\nPost-Game\r\nMr TeaTime: Report me go ahead\r\nMr TeaTime: 1. it wont work because i didnt do anything\r\nMr TeaTime: 2. it just lowers your report score\r\nMr TeaTime: which makes it even harder to report me in the future\r\nMr TeaTime: and 3 im just gonna report you because unlike me, you actually did shit\r\nMr TeaTime: mate talking alot isnt toxic in riots eyes\r\nMr TeaTime: unless i actually legitemately insulted you\r\nMr TeaTime: which i did not\r\nMr TeaTime: the report will do nothing\r\nMr TeaTime: did i lose us the game by talking alot?\r\nMr TeaTime: yes\r\nMr TeaTime: but thats not reportable\r\nMr TeaTime: and i actually played pretty well,

Who are you to them? a nobody, they dont own you anything.\n\nThis isnt about age, or rank. You have a short temper. You actually dont know how to let petty words go by.

Because people actually care about succeeding, if you do well in a big 4 and prove yourself, you can work pretty much anywhere in corporate, worlds your oyster, so if your superior says something you listen.\n\nI cant fire my teammates i have to put up with them, that doesnt go down well when my goal is to get home from work where ive spent all day managing people and oh look the game i wanted to play to wind down, im STILL managing people.\n\nMakes you blow a fuse eventually.\n\nThat and i absolutely HATE being judged personally based on the people around me, I am ME, i am not the group im in, take work for example, if im pulling a 150 kpi and everyone around me is scrapping by on an 80 its not my arse on the line (if my kpi is high its implied my teams kpi is high too, and if it isnt i step in and tell them how to fix their work WHILE they are doing it, real time constant feedback, does wonders, my teams happy, im happy, and we all hit the pub after work because im not \"That boss\") in league however i AM judged based on how my team performs.\n\nLets use an example from my match history 5 days ago, 12/8/10 akali, 81% kill participation, 6.1cs per minute (low but very good for my elo) tied for second highest vision score, most damage done by about 5k, 20k ahead of most of our team, twice as much gold as everyone on my team but renekton.\nLets check the timeline\n\nkat kills me twice, oof im getting recked in lane.\n\nI kill kat\n\nNasus kills me AND vayne, interesting im mid nasus is jg and vayne was the adc, this is 9 minutes into the game, youl see a pattern here soon.\nkat kills me still getting rekt i was having a bad game and the kat was pretty good not gonna lie, and... vayne wait what? and... vayne again just 1 minute later?\n\nWait hold on vayne died at 9 minutes in my lane, then at 10 minutes in my lane, then at 11 minutes in my lane? hmmmmm.\n\nvayne dies to kat again at 13 minutes.\n\nKeeping in mind at this point in the game im 1/5 and vaynes ran it down mid 4 times, so im fuming.\n\nNow im sure youve noticed that i said i ended the game 12/8 and im already 1/5 so clearly i pop the fuck off at some point.\n\nlets continue\n\nkat kills me again 1/6 and... vayne dies... at the same time again.\n\nI kill kat (ooft shutdown gold im back in the game)\n\ni kill blitz (roamed mid because vaynes inting)\n\nVayne dies... To the thresh adc... and... i almost immediately after kill said thresh adc... its 16 minutes ok vayne is still running it down mid.\n\ni kill blitz im now 5/6\n\nDarius kills me and renekton kha kills kat and darius, ok teamfight/skirmish, makes sense.\n\ni kill kat and blitz, im now at 7/7\n\nI kill kat again then the thresh adc then darius, 10/7\n\nI die to the nasus at the same time as kha, renekton kills nasus another teamfight clearly.\n\nI kill darius, and nasus\n\nwe lose\n\n\nDid you notice the pattern there? like... maybe there was a particular player that... may have possibly died alot very quickly, and didnt contribue anything to the team? mightve gone 3/12/1 into a thresh + blitz lane while their support was 2/6/17, name might start with V.\n\nWhen quite literally a single player can single handedly throw a game (i ended the game much stronger than kat despite my early game vs her) there is no room for people to argue whether or not they fucked up, you just dont fuck up period.\n\n\"If people dont respect you, they wont listen to you.\"\n\nVery true, which is why when you know better than them you basically have two choices.\n\nDont say anything and lose the game because they are fucking up so badly that they will single handedly lose the game.\n\nOr\n\nCall them out on their bullshit, and when they respond by arguing back, just switch off, weve already lost, they exist in our game, they are going to throw, why should i stress myself out trying to carry their boosted ass, and thats when i start talking to them, keeping in mind i ended that game with the best kda on my team and the player i was arguing with was 2/8, this was literally a case of \"if he dropped the go and listened wed have won\"\n\nNotice theres no option where we win the game there? thats because 1 its a shitty player so weve already lost, if they werent so shit they were losing us the game id have nothing to say and in turn i wouldn't talk to them, and 2 nine times out of ten its a child, yes anything under 18 is a fucking child, they dont have the concept of respect yet,  they still think the world revolves around them, and if they are playing bad its someone elses fault not them, or they are having a bad game, or the enemy team is hacking, or the enemy are smurfing, its never them.\n\nSo when you call them out they flip their fucking shit.\n\nThose are actual toxic players.\n\nAnd those are the players that i am \"Toxic\" to, Like without a doubt, if you managed to track down every single last victim of my verbal assaults over the years, every single last one of them will have a sub 50% winrate, and would have been underage at the time i verbally berated them, ill bet literally any money on that.\n\n\"1st of all. if you were to talk to adults behaving the way you did, you think they will quitely listen to you?

So why cant you apply it in game? I find the contradiction unmatch. You dont start off with: Dude, you are such a shitty person and this is how you should fix yourself, so i dont find you annoying.\"\n\nI do apply it in game, remember when i said i spam pinged everyone? that was me attempting to direct them while im still focused on the game, the aggressive start is because i just spent the last 15 minutes doing the equivalent of aggressively gesturing between one person and an object while they stand there shrugging over and over instead of A. Doing it. or B. Asking what i mean.\n\n\"Here is the thing though and i dont know if your head is in the cloud but. You're a bronze 3 argueing with other bronze 3 that YOU KNOW BETTER.\" except im not bronze 3.\n\nits start of season im lower than im meant to be lol.\n\nI ended last season silver 1, im a borderline gold player. not quite there, im not even going to claim im gold, but i could 100% hit gold this season if i keep up my rate of improvement from last season.\n\nYou just have the same mentality of the majority of these players \"well youre in the same elo as me right NOW so you must be just as good as me\" because they dont understand elo isnt static, it goes up and down, and there is a grind involved, you dont shoot straight through an elo unless youre MILES ahead of them, id 100% believe that faker would shoot through bronze in under a day, but in a world where faker can get rekt by a gold 4 brand in the 1v1 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZxdMA6XFaA) dont try and pretend that low elo players cant just luck their way to a win against a higher elo player, that and with the MASSIVE reliance on all 5 members of a team succeeding ever since season 6 its now harder than ever to carry a shitty player to the win.\n\nLike to put into perspective the skill difference between me and the elo im in, my literal first game of new kayle was a 1v5 penta (ended up a quadra because one of the players came and stole the last kill) i only had an hour of practice in the practice tool before hand to get used to her animations and try out builds.\n\nAkali who currently has a 39% winrate and is objectively one of the weakest champs in the game? ive had a positive winrate with her ALL SEASON, never went below 50, and thats with over 100 games.\n\nOr hey lets use warding for example, when i buy a control ward in mid guess where it goes? enemy jungle,  or the river bush closest to my nexus but right at the edge so it can see into the river (not the pixel bush in the center of it) you know, actually good ward placement.\n\nHell i know what a slow push is, and can pretty consistently freeze my lane during lane phase, like if you actually watch a replay of my games i normally have a 10-20 cs lead on my lane opponent with the lane right infront of my tower while constantly threatening an all in  if they try to farm, good lane control.\n\nLike theres a reason i almost always win lane in this elo, there are a handful of cases where i dont, but those are players that i expect to not be in this elo for very long, because they are just like me, \"stuck\" (stuck as in moving through tar, were still moving up, we have positive winrates, its just hella fucking slow) where they dont belong.\n\nInfact if a player can legitimately beat me in a 1v1 you know what i do? i duo with them and every player ive ever duo'd with ive managed to get them out of bronze literally every single one.\n\nOr hey lets use the pièce de résistance, when you one trick akali so well that the enemy player on the team, literally named \"akali is life\" Exclaims in all chat \"fuck this %%%%s pretty much professor akali\" (i spend so much time in the practice tool that i find alot of the mechanics he shares before he makes videos on them, so it ends up looking like i learned them instantly after he shares them, gets some good reactions from those in the know #revertakali)  then opens mid to let you win then adds you after the game to ask for advice. there might be a bit of a skill gap i dunno, just a smidge.\n\nAnyway, rant about how \"rank doesn't determine skill level\" aside lets continue\n\n\"Then they will called you out on your BS, but since you are such an offensively geared person. You'll look pass yourself and attack them.\"\n\nIf the person calling me out is actually better than me, or atleast equal, ill listen, some people say they will listen, then theres me, for example lets use that one time i tried coaching, where i had a 10 minute session where we reviewed one game vod, and the main takeaway was \"Mechanically youre quite good but your decision making is lacking you should stop relying on your reaction speed and start trying to predict what your opponent will do\" i didnt say \"oh yep that makes sense\" i took that to my core and spent half a season not playing akali and just played tryndamere and other low skill bs to learn macro. it got to the point where i can confidently pickup any champion in the game right now, and first time them not knowing their mechanics at all, and i could still win the game, assuming my team doesnt throw it faster than we win ofc. So yeah, you could say i actually do take advice when its warranted.\n\n\"Your men will hate you and any chance they get, they will torn you down from your high horse. You want to have a hostile work place.\"\n\nI dont have a hostile workplace though, did you miss the part where i always get invited out by the team for drinks? like always, they fucking love me, And heres why, because im genuinely a nice person, i will literally lay into you if A. you deserve it, aka you fucked up royally, and B. if you act like you didnt fuck up.\n\nLike your attitude towards constructive criticism just makes me sad for the current state of humanity, no wonder were so far in the shitter.\n\n\"The ways your thought process is layout. I find it really hard to believe that you are what you claimed to be. How do i say this...Low IQs one dimensional thinking.\"\n\nThis one made me laugh.\n\nTwo things, being jaded is a pretty common quality of someone with a higher intelligence, purely because jaded quite literally means, to not see through a filter of emotion, to see things as they truly are, and it comes from being worn down to the point where you stop trying to see the small positives and just see it as it is. And its a double edged sword because yes, it does reduce the amount of enjoyment from life, but it also reduces the level of disappointment in general because if you don't convince yourself that things are better than they actually are then everything is just as you expect it to be.\n\nAnd secondly, and this is why i found this comment hilarious.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes, from Stephen Hawking, alot of people know it, but doesn't change the fact that its pretty accurate is this \n“People who boast about their I.Q. are losers.” \n\nYou want to know why? because I.Q isn't a measurement of intelligence, its a measurement of a subset of skills, namely logic, memory and spatial awareness.\n\nJudging someones worth on their I.Q is about as valid as judging someones worth on their ability to solve a Rubik's cube, because they have the exactly the same skill-sets used.\n\nIronically enough ive find in my years that people who put said value to such an insignificant number, tend to be very unintelligent.\n\nLike i dont like talking about my iq, so ill just say im a mensa member that should say enough, and holy shit most people in mensa are bloody stupid, its literally a club for people to circlejerk themselves about their iq because they have nothing else going on in their life.\n\nThe actual intelligent people in my life, are quite simply the people who give enough of a shit to actually attempt to learn, because someone who can barely read but cares enough about science that they struggle their way through a physics textbook is going to be smarter than the guy with 200iq that never touched an academic medium in his life.\n\nOn that note aswell, im talking intelligence in the academic form, there are multiple forms of intelligence, so its not fair to say someone who isnt adept in say math isnt intelligent, take my mother, so bad at math she needs to count on her fingers bless her soul, but shes an award winning artist and runs her own business, so yeah, shes kinda smart.\n\ntl;dr putting value into IQ tells me enough about how smart you actually are.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-03-08T08:47:11.867+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">This proves you dont know what a big 4 is, the 4 major banks are my CLIENTS, i tell them how to fix their shit.\n\nSo do tell, if it isnt banking. Then what are you refering to? **You're trying pretty hard to veiled it. **\n\n>You want to know why? because I.Q isn't a measurement of intelligence, its a measurement of a subset of skills, namely logic, memory and spatial awareness.\n\nIQ is a measurement of cognitive ability. It name sake \"IQ\" is Intelligence Quotient. All of what you said is what make a person intelligience. \n\nThere are varying level of intelligience.\n\n> Judging someones worth on their I.Q is about as valid as judging someones worth on their ability to solve a Rubik's cube, because they have the exactly the same skill-sets used.\n\nThen  you should tell the AUSTRALIA DEFENCE FORCE that their method of recruitment is WRONG. Because apparently this guy called MR tea time, claimed that everyone can do the same task, and they only need to be taught how.\n\n>The actual intelligent people in my life, are quite simply the people who give enough of a shit to actually attempt to learn, because someone who can barely read but cares enough about science that they struggle their way through a physics textbook is going to be smarter than the guy with 200iq that never touched an academic medium in his life.\n\nThere are things people can and cant learn well. If a subject is out of your range of mental ability. Then sorry to say, try as hard as you may; The chances you will make the average compare to people within that field, is practically close to zero.\n\nIQs measure a person's ability to learn. The smarter a person is, the faster they'll learn. The case of your mother being an artist has nothing to do with how high her IQs is. IQs does NOT measure creativity.\n\nHave you talked to people or have a chance to interact with 80-84 IQs?? They have trouble learning comparing to a person with 95IQs. And if the task is ever changing, then forget it. They cant keep up.\n\n> Like i dont like talking about my iq, so ill just say im a **mensa member **that should say enough, and holy shit most people in **mensa are bloody stupid**, its literally a club for people to circlejerk themselves about their iq because they have nothing else going on in their life.\n\nNo you're not, you dont even know wtf you are talking about at this point. But i do understand that you like big titles. So untill you can **provide proof**; The evidences suggest other wise. \n\nPfftttt, this guy. Ok, show's over people. This guy tried so hard to conceal his lies, and it all come out the more he talk.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr TeaTime","date":"2019-03-08T09:49:41.479+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CauseSCIENCE","date":"2019-03-13T01:26:13.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay but you 2 guys have literally just posted your argument on a board looked through by hundreds of thousands of people.

Helping is genuinely giving advice gently regardless of your team's actions. I've won quite a few games that way. Anyway, there is nothing wrong with getting mad at people, the problem lies in actually going at those people in chat.
