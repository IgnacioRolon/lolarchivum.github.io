It could be a splitpushing trynd allowing for a free baron, or it could be a an inter just happens to get caught out around the time of a big teamfight or objective push.\n\n Vision score can actually be quite hard to obtain in some games and easier in others. The value of vision can also vary between game winning or rarely but often enough to be of note, nearly a waste of time. You gain vision score when your wards sight an enemy, your ward survives or you clear a ward or vision plant. However if you run a particularly aggressive teamcomp, if your stomp lane down hard, the enemy jungler feeds, then warding isn't really a priority. In some games it can literally come down to trying to end the game pre-20min. In which case you'd be hard pressed to get vision down in the spare moments and the enemy team is not likely to leave their turtle formation in the base. You could place down 20 strategic wards in this 17min game, and yet your vision score would be limited to ward survival, which would be worthless.\n\nObjective damage is generally a good indicator, but sometimes splitpushing is the wrong call. A malphite with their tp burned and no demolish keystone could still possibly get decent objective damage through purely splitpushing and then fighting whoever decides to stop them (if anyone ever felt the need), but the damage and push is so slow it would never be anywhere near as useful as a malphite who groups.\n\nDamage per gold can be a bit of a feels bad too, A tank playing selfishly and not peeling for their mages and adcs, could actually get more damage off per their gold, but it would often be dwarfed by the value and damage that could have been achieved if they had decided to protect their damage dealers.\n\nRoam dominance is a bit subjective as well. As an assassin jungler, you could gank a lane, kill their laner, but if the laner is too low hp to push the wave out without risk of an enemy ganking them as soon as you leave, and you don't help them bounce and reset it, it can actually put the laner in a worse position than before you ganked since the enemy would have a perma freeze, which would be worth more lane pressure and potential gold than the assist you gave your laner.\n\nBaron Buffed Minion damage could also be a bad measure, sometimes it would be more efficient to all-mid, and just go for the end, if you got baron and the enemy jungler died trying to steal it. That 1 pick could be more valuable than the 3 lane baron minions, if you already had a lead and the enemy jungler was necessary for their teamfight.\n\n-----\nIf there was a perfect measure of individual skill, I would be fine with it. However I know enough about how to game the system for champion mastery tokens and hextech chests (I used to farm these for months when they first came out, never missing a single refill), cheap ways to improve your apparent scores, and how scores don't always correlate with leading your team to victory.\n\nThe scoring system has gotten better, but it's impossibly far away from being a fair ranking system, since it is still quite easy to manipulate and there are forums of people who have a very clear idea how to warp it.\n\nAlso as you point out, even in an idealized system, there would be strategies that you wouldn't be able to measure by a standard metric because they are completely out of the norm. These people have strategies, that, though obtuse, are legitimate strategies to win the game.

There are other games where we won literally because we had complete vision control, and managed to make rotational comebacks. Not warding in the vision control game, or focusing on getting wards down in the hammer rush game, would have both been the wrong call.\n\nI've had games where as a shaco, I literally had to suicide an Oriana ball onto the backline and cripple my KDA, so that we could win teamfights. In terms of an S+, this was a bad idea, but in terms of winning, the sacrifice was worth it, we managed to assassinate the backline.\n\nKDA players who just trying to get alot of cs, ksing kills, will get S's in all their stats, but they aren't playing to win, they're playing for scores.

That was about 130 games in flex queue, and 160 games in soloq. \n\nAs a true low Gold player, it took me slightly over a 100 games to climb an entire tier and a bit in a queue. I wasn't hard stomping these games, my stats were good, more importantly consistent, but even in bronze 1-silver 5, I didn't appear much better than my opponents. However, I was consistently better, my stats didn't show it, but my shotcalls, my macro plays, my choices were impacting my team positively. I climbed fairly quickly, whereas under your proposed system, this would all count for nothing, and I'd be stuck in bronze because I'm not a selfish stats player.\n----------\nI bit my tounge and made the 'winning play' not the 'soloskill play', and that lead to the climb.
