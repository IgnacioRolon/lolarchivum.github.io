Go grab a drink, go to the toilet, grab a quick snack or just browse your favourite website for a few minutes (or whatever else, really). The chances of you getting matched with the same people is negligible in the first place, but taking that short break between matches will also give them time to get into their next match, further decreasing that possibility. An additional advantage to a quick 5-10 minute break is that it will give you a few minutes to cool down after the match, allowing you to be in a better state of mind when queuing for your next match (which, believe it or not, has the potential to make a difference).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-11T08:07:50.543+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ok so this feature is implemented, you proceed to use it to blacklist players who had a bad game and made costly mistakes that may or may not have cost you the match, along with those who either had one negative game, or who will soon be punished anyway.

Hour long queue times aren't realistic. You'd be seeing more like a 20-30s longer queue time on average during even the quietest times on the OCE server.\n\nFor Ranked Soloq this wouldn't be a bad idea, maybe even Flex queue. I could imagine this being a problem for pre-lvl30 players, or for the TwistedTree line queue which already needs some love to help increase the player pool.\n\nBut I feel like this could be a major improvement, because I wouldn't want to have to play with the same feeder more than twice before I decide to stop playing that night.\n\nOther ways to reduce the effect of a blacklist on queue times, make it so that you can only blacklist a cap of 10 players at a time? Also you could further reduce this effect by making the blacklist only prevent a player from being on your team, not on the enemy team, so maybe you'll reconsider that hit or miss Syndra mid who either carries or feeds.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr TeaTime","date":"2018-11-10T20:24:59.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh id rather spend 3 hours in queue to get people who actually care about improving and winning, than 5 minutes to get shitty players who say \"i dont care its just a game\"\n\nActually scratch that, id happily take a one week queue per game, if it meant that the one game a week i play all 10 players in the game are super serious about the game and are of extremely close skill level.\n\nBecause then rather than having one good game out of every 100, id have one good game out of every 1.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-09-15T09:42:39.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Either take Heart's advice.\n\nOr if you can't wait, If you see them in lobby, just dodge?
