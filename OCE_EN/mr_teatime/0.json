they are good enough\r\nMr TeaTime: and when you tell them they arent\r\nMr TeaTime: they shut down\r\nMr TeaTime: because they cant handle it\r\nMr TeaTime: i know\r\nMr TeaTime: because matchmaking

starts with B\r\nMr TeaTime: and ends in 5\r\nMr TeaTime: and thats not me insulting them\r\nMr TeaTime: thats their actual rank\r\nMr TeaTime: like when silver players are getting matched with b5 0lp players\r\nMr TeaTime: all accuracy goes out the window\r\nMr TeaTime: and the validity of &quot;well youre in the same game as us&quot; does to\r\nMr TeaTime: you dont have to be faker to call a iron 4 player iron 4\r\nMr TeaTime: like i will repeat myself, if you dont like me shit talking, dont play like shit\r\nMr TeaTime: its a simple one step process\r\nMr TeaTime: and if you arent willing to do that, then man up and deal with it\r\nMr TeaTime: i know\r\nMr TeaTime: because i shit talk shit players\r\nMr TeaTime: win or lose\r\nMr TeaTime: thats what you arent getting i dont discriminate\r\nMr TeaTime: yoiu play like shit, i shit talk you\r\nMr TeaTime: that simple\r\nMr TeaTime: dont play like shit, i dont shit talk you\r\nMr TeaTime: you dont get it kaisa, telling me to shut up, wont make me shut up\r\nMr TeaTime: its binary, either you play like shit and get shit talked, or you dont and dont get shit talked\r\nMr TeaTime: there is not third option\r\nMr TeaTime: no safe word\r\nMr TeaTime: tehres no combination of insults that will make me stop\r\nPost-Game\r\nMr TeaTime: But in all honesty, if you cant handle being told what you do wrong\r\nMr TeaTime: just quit ranked at that point\r\nMr TeaTime: because all that says is you refuse to be wrong\r\nMr TeaTime: and if you refuse to be wrong you cant

Of course I agree that intentional feeders should be punished swiftly and harshly, but that doesn't excuse your own behaviour. If nothing else, those 'mere words' are entirely unnecessary and accomplish nothing. If nothing else, you agreed not to use chat like this when you signed up to play the game.\n\n>Gameplay based offences > Chat based offenses objectively.\n\nNot objectively. There are more defences against chat, but frankly I'm much more bothered by someone spouting racist bs in chat than I am by someone intentionally feeding. That's my personal perspective, and obviously you don't share it, but such is the nature of subjectivity.\n\n>Im not toxic, i just dont sugar coat anything\n\nThe very first words from your keyboard were brutally negative. Right from the very start of champion select you are throwing your team under the bus and basically guaranteeing your loss. Not doing that isn't sugar coating, it's not being an asshole. It works in your favour as much as your teams.\n\n>Oh ofc you cant understand why someone would be toxic when faced with a constant barrage of shitty players in their ranked games\n\nThat doesn't sound like much fun for anyone involved. Perhaps you should reevaluate your reasons for playing the game. If you hate ranked so much, don't play it. If chat bothers you, mute all, unbind your enter and drag chat off screen. If you hate people's stats from champ select, dodge it. If you don't like the way people are playing, even afking is a better recourse than the one you are taking.\n\nAt the end of the day, you have an agreement with Riot that you will adhere to their community guidelines or face consequence and eventually removal. Whether you agree with the principle or the nature of the punishment or not, you agreed to follow those rules.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr TeaTime","date":"2018-12-05T05:15:05.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Look in the mirror? sorry but hurting one players feelings, is not the same as destroying the ingame experience of 9 players at once for half an hour plus just because you chucked a temper tantrum at the person who was mean to you.\n\nAnd quite honestly i find it really sad that you value your chat experience greater than your gameplay experience, this isnt an IRC, this isnt discord, the primary experience is not the chat, and more importantly the mute/block functions exist, if you really REALLY dont like how a play treats you, you can block them and you will never see their chat again for as long as your account exists.\n\nYou cant do that with people who make your gameplay experience worse, there is no \"avoid player in queue\" option, and that fact alone makes gameplay based offences worse than chat offences, and thats ignoring the fact that again, league is not an IRC client its a video game, the main experience IS the gameplay, the chat is just a supplementary addon function that can be removed without detracting from the gameplay experience, meanwhile if you mess with the gameplay the entire experience becomes shit.\n\nAnd before you say \"avoid player in queue would be unhealthy for the game\" avoid as teammate exists in overwatch, and... games not dead guess it works, the chat experience is still shit dont get me wrong, but as ive already made my case above, the chat experience should not be how you are basing your opinion of a video game, since the chat is an optional feature.\n\n\n\nI dont hate ranked.\n\nI hate the people that play ranked.\n\nThe percentage of players in my elo that actually take the game seriously is so infinitesimally small that when i do meet another player who actually cares about winning and doesnt just excuse bad play with \"its just a game\" i immediately friend request them and jump into discord with them.\n\nI actually get along REALLY WELL with those types of people, because hey would you look at that, when i have no trigger im actually really really nice.\n\nBut when you come into my game, and play like absolute shit, throw myself and the other 8 players under the bus by doing it i wont take kindly to that.\n\n I say 8 instead of 3 because people like me care when the enemy team is shit too, i dont want the game to be a stomp, i want a perfectly even matchmaking experience where if i win i won due to outskilling my opponent fairly, not because one of their players was a trashlord.\n\nLike at the end of the day, the reason i blow up at them, is they are 100%, objectively assholes.\n\n\nheres the logical process that goes through their head.\n\n\"im really bad at the game, and i dont really care about winning enough to improve at the game, infact i really just play for fun so which queue should i choose\"\nRanked\nNormals draft\n\"I mean they are the exact same queue... the only difference is if i pick ranked then ill be ruining the competitive experience of the other 9 people in the game, and if i pick normals draft ill be match with other likeminded people who just play to have fun...\"\nPicks ranked\n\n\"you know what fuck those other 9 people lol\"\n\nSo i chew them the fuck out. Like i would any asshole.\n\n\n\nAnd Before you say \"well maybe just dont play ranked then\" no, i ONLY play ranked, for a damn good reason, because i dont play purely to have fun, i play to satiate my competitive desire in a fun to play method, normals doesnt do that for me.\n\nAnd i have suggested for years now, a opt in queue, that you have to pay for like a season pass, just for ranked.\n\nYou buy your $15 a month ranked+ pass, you only get queued with other people who spent the $15 a month.\n\nAnd your credit card/paypal etc can only have 1 ranked pass so no smurfing, no trolling (you get banned youre done) etc etc.\n\nA Utopia queue if you will.\n\nBecause i guarantee you, theres a market for it.\n\nAnd you could argue \"reee but then people will miss out on that exclusive ranked\" thats the point, people who arent willing to spend the $15 a month clearly dont care about ranked in the first place so they are the exact people such a queue is meant to screen out.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-05T10:27:36.148+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":">hurting one players feelings\n\nYou think your chat, to the extent you are using it, is affecting only one player? Sorry but no. Whether it's directed at those 3 other players or not, they still have to sit through it. If they mute it, they still have to sit through you not playing the game because you are spending all your time typing, and playing worse when you are because you are distracted. They still have to sit through the player you have targeted getting tilted and not playing as well as they could, an effect that is only compounded if they have recent bad games.\n\nNot to mention, that \"it's just one player\" does not in any way justify your blatantly aggressive and toxic use of chat.\n\n>not the same as destroying the ingame experience of 9 players at once for half an hour plus just because you chucked a temper tantrum\n\nSo you are allowed to chuck temper tantrums over someone's winrate and abuse them, but they aren't allowed to chuck a tantrum at you? Seems rather hypocritical. You don't get special treatment, so why are you expecting it?\n\n>And quite honestly i find it really sad that you value your chat experience greater than your gameplay experience\n\nIn ranked, a toxic player will tilt me much faster than someone playing badly. In normals, I'm there to have fun, and winning isn't the only end goal, so if someone is being an ass literally from *the start of champion select*, that experience is going to be ruined. So yes, I highly value my chat experience. \n\n>more importantly the mute/block functions exist\n\nThe mute feature existing is not a free pass for you to spout your diatribes in chat. That's like saying it's ok to steal as long as you don't get caught, that's just not how it works.\n\n>that fact alone makes gameplay based offences worse than chat offences\n\nFunnily enough gameplay offences are punished more harshly than chat ones. You don't get the luxury of two chat restriction warnings for gameplay offences, you jump straight to a 14 day ban. I'm not arguing that gameplay offences aren't bad, that was never on the table. What I'm saying is that someone inting does not excuse you to insult them from *champ select*, and since you can't int in champion select (when you started hurling abuse) you kind of destroyed your own reasoning.\n\n>I actually get along REALLY WELL with those types of people, because hey would you look at that, when i have no trigger im actually really really nice.\n\nSo any and all faults in your behaviour are caused by other people? That's rather naive. You have self control, use it. If you struggle to, strengthen it or find ways to support it. You aren't 5 years old anymore, you can think for yourself and shouldn't be having such a strong negative reaction to the slightest thing not going your way. Do you hurl abuse at your parents/roommates/partner when you don't have milk for your cereal?\n\n>Like at the end of the day, the reason i blow up at them, is they are 100%, objectively assholes.\n\nAgain, you seem to misunderstand objectivity. Objectivity isn't when you are 100% set in your opinion of something, it's when there is only one logical and factually accurate conclusion to draw from a circumstance. People have bad games. Saying they are all assholes because they chose to wake up in the morning is not an objective assessment, it is a heavily biased one, influenced strongly by your own opinions and perspective of the game, and therefore **subjective**. \n\nYou are entitled to your opinion, but that does not mean everyone else is required to share it, nor does it mean your word is law and you suddenly make the rules.\n\nYour whole example thought process describes...basically no-one. There are people who are unbelievably stubborn (somewhat like yourself), who will refuse to take a break and continue to play when tilted, but they are still trying to win. There are people who have come off some good games but something just isn't going right and they lose their focus, but they are still trying to win. There are those who aren't that great at the game, but 'good' is relative and they will be matched against other people of their skill, they are still trying to win.\n\nAre you saying you've never had a bad game?\n\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/226333728/202476373?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/226265617/202476373?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/226265617/202476373?tab=overview\n\nDid you queue up with the intention of losing those games?\n\n>avoid as teammate exists in overwatch\n\nBecause Overwatch can and will dump you into a higher ping server if it can't find a good match for you close by.\n\n>And i have suggested for years now, a opt in queue, that you have to pay for like a season pass, just for ranked.\n\nGood luck versing the same few 100 people, you'll be challenger in no time with a population that small, if you can ever find a game. Not to mention there are people for whom money is no object who can and would join that queue for the sole purpose of screwing you over, and with such a limited population they would make up a _much_ higher percentage than they do now.\n\n>people who arent willing to spend the $15 a month clearly dont care about ranked in the first place\n\nWhere does this logic even come from? Not everyone can *afford* $15 a month for a luxury, it has nothing to do with how much they care. That's the whole appeal of a free to play game, you can support the game to your means, and are under no obligations to do any more. You're alienating a substantial percentage of the population with a statement like that.\n\n>they are the exact people such a queue is meant to screen out\n\nSo...poor people? You said it yourself, the chat experience in Overwatch has the same pitfalls that League does, and yet Overwatch has a price tag attached. You literally have to pay to be an asshole, and if your account gets banned, you have to pay again to continue playing and/or being an asshole, *and yet people do*. A paywall doesn't screen out the toxic players (whatever brand of toxic that may be), it only screens out the ones who can't afford the luxury of *playing a video game*.\n\nI'll quote myself here:\n\n\"At the end of the day, you have an agreement with Riot that you will adhere to their community guidelines or face consequence and eventually removal.
