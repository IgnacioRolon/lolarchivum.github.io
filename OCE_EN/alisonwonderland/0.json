Yes. Easy? certainly not.\n\nBottom line, Riot *could* attempt to take legal action and have the websites taken down, *however* that isn't going to stop people from making and distributing the bot programs. Just look at the case of \"internet piracy\". Websites for that are *always* being taken down, time and time again, and yet it hasn't done anything to stop people from streaming/downloading stuff. Several of the more common websites for it have been taken down dozens, if not hundreds, of times and yet they still continue to exist, and generally they will have multiple domains active at any given time.\n\nFrom what I understand, that's currently not the case with bot/script programs that are used in LoL. Since they don't have the constant \"chase\" of having sites taken down all the time, they generally stick to only a single domain for each site, and don't tend to change anything about the sites. If anything, that would (arguably) make it easier for Riot to keep track of the more common programs being used, even being able to obtain a copy of the programs and more effectively figure out how to detect them.","replies":[]}]}]}
