I&#039;m interested in the Xayah and Rakan skins and I&#039;m a sucker for character icons! However I don&#039;t like the signature borders! I know the icons aren&#039;t sold separably; but since they&#039;re always 250RP, and because of the border that bundle is 2240RP (if you own the champ), making it too over priced, especially if you want more than one skin. The skin and icon would be 1600RP all together in which I would totally be willing to buy then! So long story short, I think I might just buy the skins normally, however, I&#039;m not 100% sure if the icons will be returning? Haven&#039;t been able to find anything if they will or not. I&#039;d suck not be able to get it ever again!\r\nSorry for the complaining! Thanks!","replies":[]}
