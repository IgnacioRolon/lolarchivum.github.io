I know it&#039;s still too early in the year, but I heard that the Victorious skin is based off either who plays which champ the most in the LCS or a champ that really impacted their games, like a player making awesome plays with that champion or something? I don&#039;t follow the LCS so I was just wondering what peoples thoughts were on which skin it might possibly be and how the skin is actually determined? I was just thinking about this today cause i was gonna play ranked and yeah c: Thanks ^ - ^\n\nJust a fun question too, which champ do you wish for it to be? :3 Me? Aha welp - Victorious {{champion:119}} or {{champion:122}}  would be just lovely <3 They could even have Viktorious Viktor, purposely making the C a K for the lolz c:","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-05-03T10:13:34.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"i think it will be sejuani\nvictorius skins are mostly based of the viability and impact they have on the game\nsejuani has had a HUGE impact being picked or banned in almost every ranked game that i have played","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-05-03T11:13:41.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay c: So it's not entirely based within the LCS and all that?
