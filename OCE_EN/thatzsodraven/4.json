When he was blinded the rest of his senses were improved so it makes him more bad ass xD Anyways, just kinda thought, Lee Sin is blind, specializes in hand to hand combat, would be cool to &#039;see&#039; a skin based off Daredevil for Lee Sin since they have some similarities. I would totally start playing Lee Sin if he had a skin based off Daredevil P: But just an idea! The outfit is pretty simple too, even if it were to be like a 750RP skin.\n\nLe pictures v","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-04-30T12:23:59.956+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also just started watching Daredevil, actually came on here to make a post about this then saw yours :) +1 buddy.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-05-01T00:25:30.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha yay ty :3 it's pretty dang awesome!
