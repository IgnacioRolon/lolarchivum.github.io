I am more hyped as he&#039;s a Zaunite and he also reminds me of the Supreme Kai and Uub from DBZ if they used the fusion earings! (Don&#039;t know who they are? There&#039;s pictures below! :D) \nI&#039;m just really hoping they actually give him a decent lore unlike the last couple that have been given like 3 - 4 lines that doesn&#039;t really explain anything new. He may possibly have a connection to Jinx as well! There was a picture of her to the left of the wall that had the candles lit up, looked kinda like a memorial. So many questions already! I also wanna know who the kid was in the middle of the other pictures, he&#039;s most likely a friend of Ekko as he looked so heart broken at the end when the wall was shattered, so maybe his friend died or disappeared?\nGonna guess that he&#039;s a top laner, assuming on his fighting style. I&#039;m not much of a top laner, but I will deffs try for him. I&#039;m also interested who Ekko was fighting, looked like Urgot with legs xD But it was confirmed it wasn&#039;t the Urgot rework, so who exactly was he? Maybe a troop sent to steal Ekkos time weapon? Who knows! Either way, I just can&#039;t wait! What&#039;s everyone&#039;s thoughts and ideas? :3\nEKKO HYPE!~\nhttp://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/05/ekko-preview.html#more - In case you don't follow Surrender at 20 like a mad man, here's a link to the Ekko preview video!","replies":[{"poster":"Soviax The Llama","date":"2015-05-11T05:38:53.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also believed the person he was fighting was a hinted Urgot rework or something, but from what i have read it's Augmented Singed :s which makes a lot more sense.\n\nI cant wait for this champion, definitely seems like a cool champion many people will main like a Yasuo, Zed or Riven sorta type.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-11T07:06:31.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Soviax The Llama,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PgK1dnfB,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-05-11T05:38:53.731+0000)\n>\n> I also believed the person he was fighting was a hinted Urgot rework or something, but from what i have read it's Augmented Singed :s which makes a lot more sense.\n> \n> I cant wait for this champion, definitely seems like a cool champion many people will main like a Yasuo, Zed or Riven sorta type.\n\nHe was clearly fighting Bane from DC comics.\ncrossover between DBZ, LoL, and DC comics confirmed.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-05-11T10:43:16.705+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aha yeah I was thinking Bane too in the end when it was confirmed not to be Urgot xD I think Riot have really won me over with this DBZ cross over (Or so I will believe it is from DBZ!)
