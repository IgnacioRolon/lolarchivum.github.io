Lux is about 15, Sailor moon was about 14 when they started, why make her like a 7 year old? D; Maybe I&#039;m just looking too into this but a Sailor moon would be better for Lux instead of Chibi moon :s Plus basing her skin off an anime, I&#039;d go with trying to base it off the main character that people would most likely know better! Anyone else feel the same about this? xD I don&#039;t use Lux but I just kinda thought Sailor moon would work better. \nWith those of you that don&#039;t know Sailor moon I have pictures below! The blonde is Sailor moon, pink haired one is Chibi moon who is Sailor moons daughter c: Last picture is the model of 'Star Guardian Lux'.\n(I could be wrong to who they based it off, maybe it&#039;s from Madoka Magica or some other anime, but if anything with Magical girls, I think of Sailor moon lol).","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-29T06:10:19.001+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will probably get punished by the moon so they hesitate on following through the idea.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-04-29T07:16:00.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well said xD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"MlkyIceCrmyShk","date":"2015-04-29T07:40:01.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-04-29T08:18:24.967+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same xD I was like \"Sailor moon in Leagueeee?\" o v o Just casually slaughtering your enemies on the rift as a pretty pink magical girl, I don't even Lux but very tempted now.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-29T03:03:17.245+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly thought madoka when i first saw the skin.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-29T06:15:00.590+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=27EEFcG1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-29T03:03:17.245+0000)\n>\n> I honestly thought madoka when i first saw the skin.\n\nTbh it reminds me of that Fate spin off that features Illya as a magic girl, I mean just compare their outfits, the magic staffs are identical just that it has 2 heads instead of 1.\n\nOr maybe it's a homage to Cardcaptor Sakura","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadLuckFollowsMe","date":"2015-04-30T04:28:56.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GoldenTomat0,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=27EEFcG1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-04-29T03:03:17.245+0000)\n>\n> I honestly thought madoka when i first saw the skin.\n\nSame.
