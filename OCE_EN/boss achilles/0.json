Whatever, it went to change my login username but apparently it was taken. Maybe someone from NA already signed up or something. Anyway, i change my username and relog back into lol using the new user and pass, no problems.  \r\n  \r\nHowever, now my friends list doesn't show. It says everyone is offline and keeps disconnecting and reconnecting me.   \r\n  \r\nWent on my smurf, and no prompt to change account to a riot account. Friends list works fine no problems.  \r\n\r\nWhat the fuck is going on????? My Main is unplayable....","replies":[{"poster":"Smaze","date":"2019-11-29T08:01:21.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have you fixed ur problem?
