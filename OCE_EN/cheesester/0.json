And i know that NOTHING will happen from me submitting a report ticket. i just really wish riot or someone who can do something sees this and tries to make a change. because at the moment this is the type of game we&#039;re playing. a game where other people think that because they are behind a screen. it has no ramifications. Telling someone to kill them self is not okay. it never is. \r\n\r\nWe have all encountered that one salty person. but even the people who were apparently Qued up with T1 Kai, didnt even say something. is this the type of community riot is accepting now? \r\n\r\nI just hope something can be done about this. if it wont happen soon. it never will.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-20T01:52:31.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can point out how pitiful/comical it is that they're so overly joyous over a win, especially if it isnt ranked. them saying anything beyond 1 \"ez\" means that they're shit players and they need to savour every moment of a win they can get because they have absolutely nothing else going for them in this game and most likely in their life once they exit the post game chat and enter the realm of mediocrity that is their depressing lives, amongst 7 billion people that they are forced to inhabit this planet with","replies":[]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-12-19T22:17:38.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls no name and shame","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-19T21:25:32.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"T1 Kai probably got more reports than you think, but people didn't stick around to hear any more of his bull shit. Also just to be clear, just your report alone would have been enough to incite punishment from the tribunal. Although your responses don't make a great case for yourself either.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that this isn't fixed overnight, there's many layers of complexity.
