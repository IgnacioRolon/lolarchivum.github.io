Each stack of Scoured Technology grants +4/6/8/10 armour and magic resist and 10/20/40/60 (+15% AP) magic damage on basic attack. Caps at 10 stacks. Stacks are refreshed when Cybermaw deals damage to a champion or neutral monster.\r\n\r\n**Q.: **(Ravage): Cybermaw&#039;s next basic attack will deal 150% damage plus 50/75/100/125/150 (+40% AP) bonus magic damage in a 250 unit area around himself. He gains 1 stack of Scoured Technology for each champion or neutral monster damaged this way. Basic attacks against enemy champions or neutral monsters reduces the cooldown by 1 second.\r\nCD: 14/13/12/11/10\r\nMana: 55/65/75/85/95\r\n\r\n**W.: **(Personal Domain): After a 0.5 second delay, Cybermaw begins to channel for up to 15 seconds. During that time, an area up to 1000/1250/1500/1750/2000 units begins to become corrupted _(rate of 66/83/100/116/135 units per second)_. If the channel is interrupted in any way, the current area corrupted will stay as is. This area lasts indefinitely unless Cyrbermaw exits it where it will decay at 100 units per second (increased by 100 units per second for each enemy champion in the area). In the area, ally minions and Cybermaw travel with a 15% movement speed boost, minions gain +25/35/45/55/65 attack damage and 55 armour and magic resist and neutral monsters will attack enemy champions as soon as they have vision of them (excluding Baron and Dragon).\r\nCD: 60\r\nMana Cost: 135\r\n\r\n**E.: **(Dimensional Rift): After a 0.6 second delay, Cybermaw travels up to 650 units in target direction. If he is on corrupted ground, the delay is removed and he gains +35/45/55/65/75 armour and magic resist for 3 second.\r\nCD: 20/18/16/14/12\r\nMana: 70/75/80/85/90\r\n\r\n**R.: **(Ultimate Corruption): After a 1.5 second channel, Cybermaw inhabits the body of a target ally unit or neutral monster (excluding Baron and Dragon) for the next 30 seconds. If Cybermaw right-clicks any other ally unit, he will transfer to their body after a 1 second delay. If he right-clicks an enemy unit within 800 units of the body he has corrupted, he destroys the corrupted body and leaps to the target, dealing 10/50/100 (+75% AD)(+75% AP) magic damage. If he re-activates the ultimate, the body is destroyed by an enemy or the corruption wears off, he destroys the body he has corrupted. \r\n\r\nNote: Enemies can see when Cybermaw enters or transfers from a body if they have vision of his target. Any destroyed body will also not grant bonuses to the one who killed it or to Cybermaw.\r\nCD: 120\r\nMana: 120","replies":[{"poster":"Stup1dHoe","date":"2016-06-19T08:03:21.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
