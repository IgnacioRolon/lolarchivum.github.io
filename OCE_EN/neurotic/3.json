If he cast the spell, he instead gains +20% movement speed for 1.5 seconds, but will not gain movement speed from spells cast around him for 6 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Q.: **(Drain the Magic): Toggle: Kaleb's basic attacks drain 5% of a targets current mana as well as deal +10/30/50/70/90 (+100% of the mana drained) magic damage. If the target doesn't have mana, they instead deal 20/40/60/80/100 (+25% AP) bonus magic damage\r\nCD: 4\r\nMana Cost: 3% of your maximum mana +20/30/40/50/60 mana per hit\r\n\r\n\r\n**W.: **(Dodge the Magic): Kaleb dashes 500 units in target direction. Kaleb cannot be affected by crowd control during this time or for 1.5 seconds after the dash.\r\nCD: 24/22/20/18/16\r\nMana: 100\r\n\r\n**E.: **(Catch the Magic): Kaleb quickly spins around, not interrupting his movement, catching any nearby spells within 350 units of himself. If he catches a spell, it deals 50% of its damage to Kaleb (after defenses) as true damage and allows him to use Counter the Magic for the next 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n If the caught spell was an AoE spell, it is sent to target location and will deal its damage in a 350 unit circle around where it landed. If the caught spell was single target, Counter the Magic becomes single target, if the caught spell was a skill shot, Counter the Magic becomes a skill shot that stop on the first target hit.\r\n\r\n*Catching a spell will still count it as a hit, for example Malphite Q.s, will still steal movement speed but Kaleb cannot catch, for example, something like Malphite's W., E. or R.*\r\n\r\n**Counter the Magic:** Send a ball of magic energy to target location, dealing 50/70/90/110/150 (+50% AP)(+50% of the Caught Spells damage after defenses) magic damage.\r\nCD: 15\r\nMana: 50/60/70/80/90\r\n\r\n**R.: **(Annihilate the Magic): After a 1 second cast time, Kaleb deals 200/250/300 (+25% AP) magic damage to target enemy champion and silences them for 2 seconds. For the next 6 seconds, Kaleb gains +40/60/80% attack speed and the target gains a mark which is consumed when it dies. If the mark is consumed, Annihilate the Magic can be cast again but will only silence the target.\r\nCD: 120\r\nMana: 150","replies":[{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-02-03T09:34:52.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was this on the old forum?","replies":[]}]}
