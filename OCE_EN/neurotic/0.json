These magics are rumoured to be so foul, that they tear at your very soul. Few people practice these, and very few live past their first incantation before they are put down for extermination. Nomiin was one of these Exterminators of Runeterra.He was an honorable soldier serving the Noxus armies by day, and an exterminator when the moon rose.\n\nOne day, he raided and assassinated a mage called Alexis Rize. She was tampering with magic born from the flesh of her victims, much like hemomancing. But this involved devouring both the flesh and soul of your victims. She had murdered countless people in the nearby village and ate their corpses. She had left one surprise for whoever tried to kill her. As Nomiin was about to leave, magical runes prevented his escape, as some ominous gas filled the room. Before he knew it, he had absorbed the life essence of all those Alexis had killed. Nomiin felt the power of the flesh of hundreds of people. He thought he would be disgusted, but he only smiled. Now, he has the ability to call on this dark whenever he likes. It is said he wonders the land, continuing Alexis' dark fantasy. He murders and devours to keep himself alive, and to keep his power charged up. \n\nThey say Tendrils of darkness grab those most foul and drag them to hell. Nomiin was happy to be the one behind those tendrils.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-29T13:10:45.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Ult and Ult-E have mana as their cost, although I assume you meant Flesh Pool (spooky).\nHe seems like an alright idea.
