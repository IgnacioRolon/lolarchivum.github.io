There&#039;s a lot of things that need doing and it&#039;s only an idea at this stage, but this is much like an expression of interest to see how many people out there that are high elo are willing to participate. I won&#039;t be wanting to play, I want to be something like a manager/coach or something, I dunno but I want my team up in lights on the stage. Anyone who is keen on trying out, add me. My ign is Couus Couus\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[]}
