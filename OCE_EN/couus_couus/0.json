I know it doesn&#039;t happen overnight and while I do a rough idea of what is involved, I know there&#039;s still a whole lot more that I don&#039;t know. \r\nI&#039;m not a high ranking player myself but I won&#039;t be looking to play once it all gets off the ground. I&#039;m looking for high elo players that may be interested in starting something from the ground up, and being involved in the creation process. My end goal is to eventually have my own personal team compete in the OPL (long shot, I know)\r\nI have a few base ideas, and a few base concepts, but other than that it&#039;s really just an idea. \r\n\r\nIf anyone&#039;s interested or willing to lend a helping hand, no advise will be turned away.
