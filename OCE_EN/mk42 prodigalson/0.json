So his average score is far less impressive that Lee Sin's _(at least atm)_, therefore it takes less to get an S.\n\nBut stick at it, I'm sure you will get your S soon enough. :)\nCS has a huge part to do with it from what I've found.","replies":[{"poster":"FutanAhri","date":"2017-02-19T14:32:58.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its also effected by the role you take them in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-13T02:35:51.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that explains my S's with yorick, tristana, sion, nami, veigar, anivia, viktor ,(and if i owned him) yas (probably more champs im forgetting :D)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TSM Swish","date":"2017-01-20T09:54:27.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery level 5 is no bad thing to stop at considering you need  blue essence etc to advance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neosinf","date":"2017-01-12T22:02:23.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My friend, do you really need that S+ grade?\n\nIf you have a beautiful kda, how about you print out a screenshot of your match history and put it on the wall of your work office.

This is because the first thing that they want people to focus on is winning the game, as opposed to farming for certain things that get them a higher mastery score. However this is what they have said about the mastery system:\n\n> #What is in the champ mastery grades formula?\n\n>The grades you receive are driven by how you rank against all other players in your region who also played your champion and position across various performance categories. We don’t reveal the exact formula so that it can’t be min-maxed as we really want to avoid incentivizing playing for stats like CS or K/D/A rather than playing to win. However, the variables are fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winning.\n\n> -Riot Socrates, Lead Game Designer\n\nWith this in mind since the system ranks you against other players that play your champion in various performance categories we know that if you play a champion that is very popular such as Yasuo, it might be harder to get an S rank because of the amount of people setting the bar for that performance rating.\n\n---\n\nWith this in mind the best thing that you can do to try and get an S rank on a champion that you want to get that level 7 mastery is constantly be improving. If you feel like you should have gotten an S when you shouldn't have, look for a section of your gameplay you could have done better in your game to improve yourself. There must be something there that you could improve on to help you get that S rank.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps give a bit more clarity and info about how the mastery system works. If you have any more questions or there is any other way I can help let me know. Good luck in your games and good luck getting those S ranks.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
