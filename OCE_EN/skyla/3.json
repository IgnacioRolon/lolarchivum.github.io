I like to farm up in lane and play passively, going for that late game damage. I've been playing since Season 2 and am quite experienced. Tell me if you're interested :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jacyl","date":"2015-10-03T09:56:24.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I'm in Silver 3 and with a decent ability to play ADC (It's my 3rd role, but I am becoming more proficient at it).\nIf you can play a good, passive Janna I think we might have some success. I normally play ADCs that like scaling into lategame, like Ashe, Tristana and Ezreal, but am increasing my ADC pool as time goes on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GalaKnight","date":"2015-10-03T07:31:57.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello I currently got back into playing ranked from 5 months. I also have dropped in the ladder and is now Bronze 4 because also I get the occasional trolls and afks. Recently today I got a Teemo that went adc and grabbed clairvoyance  and clarity. I am decent with most of the ADCS but my personal favourite is Jinx, lucian and Sivir. I am buying Tristana next and have played Graves for the free to play champs for the week and I must say I am decent at him.\n\nYou can say no to me, I am not forcing you to play with me at all. Thank You.\n\nGalaKnight","replies":[]}]}
