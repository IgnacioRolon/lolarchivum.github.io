Taking flash on the support also means they have lower limits for helping the adc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-04T04:42:09.175+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soooo Varus' W isn't a thing? I'm sure there's reasons not to build Rageblade Varus but I don't think \"not having a passive for it\" is one of them.\n\nAnd you're saying, the ADC should never take heal? And the support should not take flash? Heal support is a thing with Ardent sure, but not taking flash on support because it \"means they have lower limits for helping the ADC\"? Fuck that's degrading who would ever want to support you if you can't even respect them as their own player?","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2018-02-04T13:24:07.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are right, I shall play soraka with an infinity edge instead of an ardent censer from now on, because if I don't it is degrading to be beneath the adc and support them instead of carry myself. I should attempt to take their cs as well so i can build my carry items, otherwise I would be considering myself to be beneath them and that is degrading.\n\nDon't be a sheep, use your own brain with a completely neutral thought process without emotion.

I'm not your slave, I'm not your yes man, I'm your support, your backup.

You would then be relatively worthless. So you are already taking the inferior strategic pathway.\n\nYou appear to think you have some kind of extra value by taking something that allows you a safety net to compensate for lack of strategic preparation.\n\nBy giving your adc more opportunity, you increase your teams chances of winning, which means you are contributing more to YOUR rank because your team wins, not you. You get mmr based on whether your team wins or loses.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
