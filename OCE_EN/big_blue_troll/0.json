Its a Skin that looks like a Scary Clown Skin and all of them are like wearing leather coat covering all their skins and stuff. Other&#039;s wear a bulletproof vest. Like an actual heist stealing money from the bank and stuff. These are the candidates;\r\n\r\n**Graves**: I mean why not right? He will look sick with clown face on. and at least just a Brown Leather Jacket with a Scary Clown Face. \r\n\r\n**Mundo**: Why the hell not? I mean a guy who&#039;s throwing  knife. Mass murderer on the move.\r\n\r\n**Singed**: Singed is a good one. Releasing smoke gas while his team is escaping? Heist? Yea I believe a smoke are the best to escape.\r\n\r\n**Jinx**: I mean a psychotic girl carrying a machine gun and a bazooka? Nothing could go wrong with that.\r\n\r\n**Shaco**: I mean why not? He&#039;s the real clown from the start after all.\r\n\r\nand the last one is....\r\n\r\n**Ziggz**: A bomb planting machine. Everyone needs that!!.. I mean why not?? Imagine Ziggz wearing a white Mask with a scary face on it throwing bombs. But I&#039;ll be best if the bomb animation is an actual grenade bomb.\r\n\r\nPlease consider my request RIOT. :) Thanks!! Its a good idea though.. why not right?? I&#039;m pretty sure you guys will find a way to get this done.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-07T09:27:24.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like an edible skin please.
