When I get into game, there are noticeable rank differences in both teams,  with players that are Silver but also players that are Challenger. This means that some games are just one team stomping the other. With a 40 minute queue time, it takes so much time to play one game (and also the chance that the game is one sided and therefore not fun).\r\n\r\n\r\nMy problem is that getting better at this game is so much harder now and I don&#039;t think I can maintain my current rank. \r\n\r\n\r\nSome possibilities for the long queue times I think are:\r\n\r\n- Less people are playing on the Oceanic Server.\r\nor\r\n- A decent amount of people play on Oceania but there aren&#039;t as many people in my MMR range.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to know if anyone else is facing my situation or if anyone knows why this is happening. \r\nWould be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-16T20:10:34.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you pretty much answered your own question. \n\n-OCE has less players than other regions\n-Most people on this server, just like on any other server, are in bronze & silver. we're talking about 80%. diamond would be something like 2%. therefore,  at any given time there will be a lot more of them queuing up for a normal than people in diamond, and i would suggest that most people of your elo are probably queuing up for ranked anyway.","replies":[]}]}
