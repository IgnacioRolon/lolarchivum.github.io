I am responsible for Riot in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.  My colleagues have informed me of your question/concern.  I would like to begin by saying that I am sorry for your frustration.  As a fellow player, I can totally understand how frustrating it can be when you see a skin that you really like but there is no way of getting it.  Unfortunately, there are 5 independent servers in SEA (Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore/Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia) and they all have minor differences in terms of availability of different \"rare\" skins and they are not always aligned with the availability in other Riot regions (e.g. OCE).  This is because as my colleague has explained earlier, we have a partner in this region (Garena) who publishes League of Legends on our behalf.  As part of our partnership, we entrust them with the power to decide which skin to make available, as well as when and how.  I am sorry I don't have better news for you. \n\nCheers,\nWayne","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-11-22T21:01:46.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im sorry but what is SEA?","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-11-22T22:15:02.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Torea2,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tUiAZ5WW,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-11-22T21:01:46.008+0000)\n>\n> Im sorry but what is SEA?\n\nSouth East Asia.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-22T23:25:31.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it like a different server or something?
