I&#039;ve managed to proc it with Cait, di, zyra and ezreal so far. Cait seems to be the easier to get this bug to happen - drop a trap under gromp, hit it over the wall and then try to catch up to gromp before it runs back and wahlah it sits there with its max hp regen going and 0 patience until you manage to kill it despite the hp regen","replies":[{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2015-09-30T20:59:38.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add Sivir & Jinx to the list and I can also get the bug to proc on wolves if I hit them from over the wall in front of the camp (ie: not hitting the camp from behind). My total guess is that it has something to do with the camp reaching 0 patience just as it comes into view... total guess though","replies":[]}]}
