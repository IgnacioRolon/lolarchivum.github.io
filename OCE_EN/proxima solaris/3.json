Basically, during champ select, if I go to change my masteries before locking in, the lock in button becomes greyed out and requires me to cycle between champions before it becomes clickable again. This actually resulted in a \"you didn't pick a champion\" ban one game. I've had myself and a few friends try this and we were all able to get the button to not be clickable. I put in a support ticket, but they said I should put up a bugreport here too, so I am.\r\n\r\nGood luck on the Rift~","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:30:35.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wish they would stop telling people to bug-report here.
