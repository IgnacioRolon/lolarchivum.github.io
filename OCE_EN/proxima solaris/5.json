The moment you come back though, it does die but not until then. Essentially this extends the time it's up by potentially however long your death timer is. And how stupid/preoccupied the enemy team is.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T07:40:05.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THAT EXPLAINS HOW THAT HEIMERDINGER HAD ONE PORTAL FOR THE WHOLE GAME\n\nWOW\n\nBug reports go [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), though.","replies":[]}]}
