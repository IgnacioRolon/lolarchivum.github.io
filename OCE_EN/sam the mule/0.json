It then said I couldn&#039;t join queue because I was already assigned to a game, so I restarted the client. After I logged in, I got taken to the Game Abandoned screen. When I try to reconnect, it goes to a black screen for a little bit before telling me I&#039;ve crashed due to a bad network connection. When I retry it does the same thing. I&#039;ve reloaded the client 3 times and it&#039;s still doing it, telling me to rejoin the game I abandoned. But I finished the bloody thing. I&#039;m loving URF, please help me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-24T01:16:41.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems you experienced a ghost game. This happens when the game server you were playing on fails to communicate the game-end message to PVP.Net.\n\nThe ghost game will usually last a maximum of 2 hours after this occurs. Sometimes this issue can be fixed by relogging into League of Legends. Occasionally, restarting your computer may help. These actions force the client to request a new update.\n\nSeems to be happening to quite a few people atm.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nisbo360","date":"2016-04-23T12:01:28.905+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"MyRiceStory","date":"2016-04-23T11:54:17.878+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here... just finished a game and cant make another because apparently I am still in game... when I try to reconnect itjust has a black screen... not working for all my other friends who were playing with me as well. rito pls","replies":[]},{"poster":"Si√∏pao","date":"2016-04-23T12:40:35.398+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exact same thing happened to me.
