If it is wrong please forgive me and tell me where I should post.\r\nNow that, that&#039;s out of the way, lemme come to my question but first lemme tell you the scenario. I&#039;ve been playing LOL for about a month now and I got really hooked to the game(Thanks RIOT), but all of a sudden it says I cant connect to the server after my champion select(it goes into a black screen instead of showing the loading screen), the net works fine with other things but I just cant play the game. I spoke to my university about this( I stay at the dorms btw) and they said that the internet providers did the university a favor by blocking all gaming servers and the university is refusing to remove this block. Now my question is, is there any way that i can play the game? I&#039;ve tried downloading VPNs like HotSpotShield and a few others but they are blocked. So can you suggest me a way that I can bypass the sever block and still get to play? I just started playing recently and i&#039;d hate to stop for a silly reason.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n {{champion:222}}          {{champion:22}}          {{champion:119}}  \r\nADC FTW","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-05T09:11:16.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry to hear that your university has done this. Have you tried discussing it with the university further?\n\nPerhaps mention the [vast amounts of University clubs that Riot supports](http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/uni-clubs/).\n\nIf they simply won't budge and you can't find a free VPN service that works, perhaps look into a paid VPN service. I hear [Tunnelbear](https://www.tunnelbear.com/pricing) is good.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachuusedsurf","date":"2016-04-05T10:08:41.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well talking to the Uni is like telling a goldfish to climb a tree. They just wont budge. \nI might try paid VPN like you suggested but Im also afraid of high ping and lag with VPN. My ping used to be 150ish ms when it used to work.","replies":[]}]}]}
