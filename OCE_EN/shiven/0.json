There are extensive periods in the chat log where I  just talk to myself. His summoner name is Weelzop.- he was the alistar (cow) I can get him to comment on this thread and confirm everything and he was honestly so surprised I was banned.\r\nI'm terribly sorry and know that I should have been more careful and not be using the ingame chat in that way. I honestly was just poking around with him and not being toxic to anyone directly in the game. \r\n\r\nOnly had a bit of banter wif enemy  gnar and j4 after a good play but they also bantered me.\r\n\r\n I NEVER FLAMED ANYONE IN MY TEAM. The only reason I was even reported was because someone was mad we lost a winnable game. I even reference in the chat log that chavee is egging me on to type more so he can report me and get me banned- Literally it was all a joke I promise I was not being toxic.\r\nIf you give me a second chance and lift my suspension so I can please play my favourite game, I will be very careful in future and not use the game chat in such a way. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\n\r\nIn-Game\r\nShiven: btw ali is dog shit\r\nShiven: hes my duo\r\nShiven: uve been warned\r\nShiven: dont trust him\r\nShiven: just setting expectation\r\nShiven: ok ull see\r\nShiven: haha\r\nShiven: i hope so\r\nShiven: lil %%%% been playi%%%%or 2 months\r\nShiven: thinks he's bunny fufu\r\nShiven: my ping is retarded\r\nShiven: p\r\nShiven: kk\r\nShiven: i fkcen went rambo\r\nShiven: and put cable\r\nShiven: wtf\r\nShiven: wtfs\r\nShiven: fs\r\nShiven: df\r\nShiven: g\r\nShiven: df\r\nShiven: g\r\nShiven: gdf\r\nShiven: g\r\nShiven: g\r\nShiven: .. mb\r\nShiven: mb sry\r\nShiven: if i dint lag id have had more dmg\r\nShiven: gj\r\nShiven: i luv palying\r\nShiven: i luv palying wif u chavveee\r\nShiven: even tho u %%%\r\nShiven: i dunno%%%hiven: it means\r\nShiven: u like dik\r\nShiven: %%%*\r\nShiven: %%%*\r\n%%%ven: sry wr%%% chat\r\nShiven: no ciggarete\r\nShiven: not bad\r\nShiven: cavee\r\nShiven: chaveee\r\nShiven: id idnt say bad\r\nShiven: i said f 88888 g\r\nShiven: cahve emid\r\nShiven: chaveee\r\nShiven: cahveee\r\nShiven: omg\r\nShiven: kncock him\r\nShiven: in tower\r\nShiven: u fucken dubm cow\r\nShiven: nice gnar\r\nShiven: u cant touch me\r\nShiven: even j4 lil bich\r\nShiven: nah it wasnt\r\nShiven: im stupid chavee\r\nShiven: cois\r\nShiven: im abd\r\nShiven: happy\r\nShiven: u fucken dumb cow\r\nShiven: learnt to use ur abilitiues\r\nShiven: im gonna stop abusing u\r\nShiven: i know ur reporting me\r\nShiven: omg\r\nShiven: ez\r\nShiven: lol\r\nShiven: hbahaha\r\nShiven: hahaa\r\nShiven: that was hilarious\r\nShiven: i woulda prob done the same\r\nShiven: that was ur fault chavee\r\nShiven: sumhow\r\nShiven: yeh it wast\\\r\nShiven: chavee am i racist?\r\nShiven: chavee\r\nShiven: did u rly\r\nShiven: let him not tank it\r\nShiven: omfg\r\nShiven: im sry guys iu went to get tower\r\nShiven: o thout he wud\r\nShiven: if i was there\r\nShiven: ic oudla told him\r\nShiven: overmic\r\nShiven: im not there\r\nShiven: omg how\r\nShiven: howd\r\nShiven: u lose base\r\nShiven: wtf\r\nPost-Game\r\nShiven: its so bs i coulda carried that so ez not even mad at anyone\r\nShiven: but myself\r\nShiven: dude ur dog shit\r\nShiven: and u knwio it\r\nShiven: lol","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-28T09:18:42.786+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Have you considered that *team* chat is not just you and your mate?\n\n\"Joke\" or no, you repeatedly use what I can only assume is the 3-letter homophobic slur as an insult. \n\nYou insulted the enemy team, but that's mostly minor stuff. What's relevant here is the experience you are creating for your team. Between you and your friend this all may be relatively harmless fun, but it isn't between you and your friend. Your team has to sit through this tirade of insults with little context and no consent or want to. Even if they mute, the damage is already done and their experience is soured.\n\nThey also have to live with the fact that you are typing some random BS to your mate instead of playing the *ranked game* that you queued up for. You are doing yourself a disservice, and them a disservice.\n\nAs for the degree of punishment, this was a 14-day and not a chat restriction because of the use of no-tolerance language (i.e sexism, racism, homophobia, suicide encouragement, etc). With an [appeal](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and a testimony from your friend you ***might*** have a case for a reduction to a chat restriction, but I wouldn't count on it. \n\nIt's classed as no tolerance language for a reason. It isn't a joke. Even if your intent is as purely benevolent as you say, for every person who uses such language as a \"joke\" there is someone else learning and/or validating their opinion that that kind of BS is ok without the context of the \"joke\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-08-27T08:19:27.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Shiven: chavee am i racist?\"\n\nOut of interest since you seem to have cut this log a decent chunk, what in the hell is this even possibly referencing?\n\nIf your making racist comments, it's not gonna matter whether it was well intended or not, riot doesn't care.\n\nYou can be a 5 man premade with friends that jokingly report you (or the enemy report you out of frustration) and get banned, so it's not like it matters what your team think is ok either.","replies":[{"poster":"Shiven","date":"2019-08-27T09:06:39.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"cut the log? can i get a comment form a riot moderator please. this guy has no context. i didn't bother reading the rest of the your comment because you clearly did not read mine.\n\n\nedit; I decided to read your comment because I realise I have come here to defend myself and some people might actually read what you wrote-\n\nAs I said I was talking to my friend charlie who I affectionately refer to as \"chavee\".\nHe has commented below and here is a link to the actual game (it's the last one I played).\n\n[https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Shiven](https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Shiven)\n\nAgain I made no racist comments towards any teammates. if you read the chat log and was referring to a joke charlie made via VOIP.
