They should have more advantages to against another team. However, what they usually do is feeding and abuse. For example, there&#039;s a jungle didn&#039;t gank midlane in whole game, he&#039;s not care about the  mid solo teammate because he needed to help his friends. Thus that, solo teammate would be tough in his lane if enemy jungle ganked him. However, our jungle would spend 5 miuntes camped other lanes even he found there&#039;s a ward in the brush sometimes. Actually, their skills are under average level. Then they lost game and blamed solo player with their offensive words and reported him for 4 times. This is unfair to the solo player since they just wana improve themselves in normal games. Here&#039;s an idea to solve this problem. Can roit separate the 3/4/5 premade-teams and solo/duo players in matching system? This idea can make sure that premade-teams can against the same premade-teams instead of destorying the solo/duo players&#039; game experience. What&#039;s more, it also can improve those premade-teams&#039; collaboration. What do u guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"11or11","date":"2017-06-24T15:01:04.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These permade team are really awful since they are not on their right elo. What they only did is balming u while they keep feeding. Can u image the all other temamates never gank ur lanes whole game. If they really good at premade, they should make a team which has five members instead of blame solo players after they lose.  Only idiots or bitchs can learn more dirty words from them. They are like cancer which would destory this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Void Beast","date":"2017-06-02T04:45:59.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A few problems with this.\n1. Queue times will get massive.\n2. If you queue with a premade, you are more likely to get matched against a similar sized and MMR one. The only reason you don't is if there is none available.\n3. Normal games aren't meant to be competitive, sometimes games aren't going to be fair, sometimes there will be smurfs, these are the games we hate, but learn the most from about ourselves as players. Where a higher elo player or a more co-ordinated team is exploiting your weaknesses, you can recognise the weaknesses and improve upon those areas.","replies":[{"poster":"11or11","date":"2017-06-03T08:08:20.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, you cannot be improved if ur teammates sucks. They just keep dying and blaming you with disgusting language. I cannot find any possibility of communication with them. You cannot fight alone while all your teammates stay in the resurrection point and curse you. You cannot have fun in such dumb games. For my idea, it's make sure your teammates can be selected from different parties at least. We can improve when the team has duo players as well. Usually, these four premade players are selfish and rude in games cause they have 4 guys. What I hope is to stop this kind of games instead being reported 4 times unfairly after terrible games.","replies":[]}]}]}
