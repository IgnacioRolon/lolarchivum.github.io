I'm a big believer in practice is perfect and so i am on almost everyday practicing. I am anti-toxic and want to play in a ranked team as i want to know the players i am supporting and really get a feel for they play style and adapt to it. I'm easy to get along with, i'm fine with the whole \"chain of command\" IF that's how your team works. Oh and i have skype but if i have to i can use teamspeak.
