Only duo&#039;d one game out of all of my matches this season so far so it is safe to say I could do with a partner who is on regularly and fairly consistent in their play. Role is not too much of a concern. I play ADC so as long as you don&#039;t want that then we&#039;ll be cool. Sick of going 7/0 then finishing the game 10/5 or something because I got some 10/0 irelia shoving her blades up my butt. \r\n\r\nI peaked P4 last season but I finished P5. This season I got placed in S1 and currently I am G5, within the next two hours from this being posted I should hopefully be G4. I would prefer someone who was plat+ In season 6 who really wants to climb. Hit me up in game ya want I&#039;m on ALOT.\r\n\r\nAlways keen to improve as I really do want to climb, so like minded people are always welcome to tag along.\r\n\r\n- Target Me Please","replies":[{"poster":"xDrEaMeRx","date":"2016-12-12T02:57:25.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have a close mmr, added you on league.","replies":[]}]}
