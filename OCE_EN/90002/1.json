It would help if you posted the logs from game 1 as well (and any other games that were included, if any). To be clear, the system doesn't work by comparing your behaviour to others, simply to a \"baseline\" of what is and isn't acceptable. As well as that, it also considers only your behaviour because the punishment given is about *your* behaviour.\n\nWith all that said, I (personally) don't see too much wrong with this. It certainly doesn't help when you blatantly call your team mates trash, even if it is true, and that probably has something to do with the restriction. Without knowing the context, the \"fk the rest\" *may* have also contributed, depending on context (some clarification with what that was in response to would help).\n\nAs it stands, and using the information provided so far, this *may* (and I can't stress that \"may\" enough) be a false positive, but there's no way to know without looking at all the related chat logs. If you could try going onto the support site again and attempting to submit a ticket to appeal that would get the process started (not sure if restrictions are revoked, though). I'm going to ask around, see if anyone knows anything about issues with the support site.\n\nEDIT: With the Support site issues, you could try clearing your cache (clearing your browsing history/stored site data).","replies":[]},{"poster":"90002","date":"2018-02-13T13:19:21.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Edit: I 1v1'd the silvers and won","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-02-13T13:32:06.433+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me get this right.
