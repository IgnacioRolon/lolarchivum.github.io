I have had 1 of my accounts banned in the last week because of me being toxic and for &quot;verbal abuse and harassment&quot; yet in those 2 games i had to stand up for myself because my whole team was flaming me in the last game because i was a female and apparently i am &quote, \"a disgusting fat pig, with no life\"(which isn't true, i am a petite girl) nobody cares why I was flaming them but what really really bothers me is that they probably didn't get suspended or muted.\nstarting to find this game disgusting and highly offensive towards female players in the chat, and nothing is being done about it. i am constantly getting bans and chat restrictions for standing up for myself while guys are discriminating and being highly inappropriate against females in the chat.\n i swear or curse once and riot goes nope get permanently  banned. It is so fucking unfair on how this happens and that i swear once in game and riot has to instantly ban me but people feed and i try carry them and i pay the price because im toxic to the environment. Riot explain to me why this game is cancer?\n{{sticker:sg-soraka}}","replies":[{"poster":"meatjacker","date":"2017-12-25T09:13:24.508+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"If people are sexist in real life, what would you do?
