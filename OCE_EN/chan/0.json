I have previously tried suggestions of deleting config files but it has not fixed the problem.\r\n\r\nCould anyone help me with a solution to this?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-11T01:33:34.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try the following to reset your configuration to default. (Please follow these steps exactly)\n\n* Login to the client (which syncs your settings with the server)\n* Go to C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\n* Delete the \"PersistedSettings.json\", \"game.cfg\" & \"input.ini\" files.\n* Launch a custom game\n* Exit the custom game\n* Exit the client","replies":[{"poster":"Chan","date":"2016-12-11T03:17:22.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's working fine now!
