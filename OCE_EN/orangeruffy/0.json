I don't care if the people i play with aren't particularly good, just as long as we don't get mad at the game or each other if we lose, and don't take it TOO seriously, but playing to win of course.\n\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=OrangeRuffy\n\nSummoner Name: Orangeruffy, add me and message me if you are interested, i main support and thats what i intend to play.\n\nEdit: I have found and joined a team, we have 4/5, need only a jungler. Message Ivery (our team captain) for an invite.","replies":[]}
