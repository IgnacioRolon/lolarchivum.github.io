Some games I am the only human player.\r\n\r\nI have been reporting bots when I encounter them as they are easy to spot (feeding, diving, not communicating, not buying etc....)\r\n\r\nI think it has become such a problem that when you report players there needs to be a &quot;this player is a bot&quot; option.\r\n\r\nI have noticed that there have been multiple threads about this in the past couple of years, but the problem persists and is getting worse.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m starting to miss the toxic players I used to play with, at least they weren&#039;t bots.","replies":[{"poster":"LadKiller","date":"2016-12-27T01:41:26.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sick of bots too!!

Riot's recently opened applications for [Anti-cheat analysts](http://www.riotgames.com/careers/228983), which might be a good sign there's a solution coming. But realistically it's still unlikely we'll see anymore than a 30% - 40% reduction in the amount of bots, which would still leave a lot of bots left.\n\nThe only solution that would kill the bots for good for sure is an official smurfing service. But obviously there's some big downsides to that, and it looks like [Riot's pretty divided on the issue](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/lets-talk-smurfs-snow-and-bans-ask-riot).\n\nI'm usually pretty decisive this kind of stuff, but TBH I'm not really sure what the best solution is in this case :P","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-27T08:38:32.934+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Botting is a script, it is 100% detectable, just like scripting, riot just doesn't give a fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-27T23:55:41.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've seen bot programs which act as an entirely separate program (they're fairly common actually), they process simple information on the screen and then control the mouse to move around. It never touches the actual game files which makes it essentially impossible to detect. Even just coding your scripts in ring0 makes detecting you so much harder.\n\nEvery game company struggles with this for a reason, it's really not that straightforward. If you're not realistic when making demands like this, it doesn't really help anyone TBH.","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-28T00:44:51.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's good new that they are hiring anti-cheat analysts, I'd apply for this job if it were in Oceania.\n\nAnd yes the only defence to some forms of cheating is good old human logic. For example, a simple example is using that fact that a player's mouse cannot be in two or more places at the same time.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-28T02:52:08.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeap, you're right. If Riot was given the ability to actually scan your whole computer and HDD, they could probably put an end to all scripting (and detect weird anomalies like a double mouse).\n\nBut of course that's where things can get complicated with privacy laws, I believe in the EU there's all kinds of [strict regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive) against stuff like that. I'd also wonder how frequent scans would get done without lagging out anyone with an average/low end CPU.\n\nWhen I consider all that, I think the _'official smurfing service'_ seems like a more realistic solution, but we could end up with more problems than before if it was implemented.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-12-27T01:41:56.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not regularly.
