They are both super fun and I'm actually planning on using them both next season to climb. Some other good picks are {{champion:85}}, {{champion:122}} and {{champion:58}}.\n\n**Jungle**\n I'm not too good at jungle, but for this price range the best champions for jungle are easily {{champion:120}} and {{champion:62}}. They are both really good bruiser champions who can deal out tons of damage while at the same time taking a lot themselves. Both have great carry potential, and actually have a similar play style to each other.\n If you want {{champion:64}} is alright but you have to be good at him and honestly there are just better picks. \nFOREWARNING: PLEASE DO NOT PLAY {{champion:104}} IF YOU WISH TO CLIMB, YES HE CAN SOLO CARRY AND YES HE DOES DO TONS OF DAMAGE, HOWEVER HE DOES NOT PROVIDE HIS TEAM WITH ANYTHING. YOU WILL NOT CLIMB WITH THIS CHAMPION.\n\n**Mid**\nYet again, mid isn't one my strongest lanes. In all honesty, I have no idea who is good and who is not for mid. I usually just always pick {{champion:103}} as she is actually really strong and good for carrying. \nAnother forewarning: don't play {{champion:157}}. Just don't. People understand how to counter this guy even in lower elo. He is more of a normals champion. You will find yourself more often feeding your ass off than you will hyper carrying games (I know he's not in the 4800 price range, but I just wanted to mention him as people always fall into the {{champion:157}} trap). I guess some other good picks for your price range are {{champion:105}}, {{champion:61}} and {{champion:112}}.\n\n**ADC**\nYes! Finally I get to talk about my most played position! Look, this might be more of a personal opinion, but I feel like {{champion:51}}  is super useless and can't carry games. For your price range, a better ADC might be {{champion:67}} or {{champion:81}}. If you wanted you could even save up for {{champion:202}} or {{champion:222}}. \nSeriously though, just pick up {{champion:22}} and learn how to play her (she's probably the easiest ADC anyway). She's so good and no one realises it. That ultimate stun is just so good for long range snipes and her damage in team fights AND in lane is just insane. By far the best ADC in my opinion. She also has the best skin in game (PROJECT: Ashe if you were wondering).\n\n**Support**\n I don't know anything about support. Leave it for the weak. I've never heard of someone climbing out of bronze to high elo by playing support. However, it is always a good idea to have a support on hand just in case you get autofilled. \nI just use {{champion:12}} because no one ever bans that cow and he is strong-ish. If we have to stick to price range though, then {{champion:89}} is the best 4800 support. Just dominate in lane, get your ADC fed and stun the whole enemy team late game. Ez pz.\n\n**Out of the champions you suggested,** I'd recommend picking up Riven. She might not be the easiest, but if you like her and end up getting good at her, she can carry any bronze game. \n\nFor the love of god don't play talon in ranked. Even with his new rework. Just don't. Big no no. He's useless.\n\nPick up Caitlyn if you want but as I said my personal opinion is that she's just meh.\n\nTrundle is OK. Never played him tbh but I've also never seen a trundle carry.\n\nJayce is strong. Pick him up if you don't want to pick up riven. \n\nFrom the champions you suggested I'm guessing you play top a lot. Seriously, just get Riven, Fiora or Renekton. Best solo carry champions for top lane. Even Kennen is good enough to be in this category, however I only really pick him when my team needs more magic damage.\n\n**Hope this helped.
