I have very extensive Ranked knowledge particularly in the lower divisions of B/S so I'm very confident I can answer any questions you may have about the ranked vs normal experience!\nCheers,\nAezuros","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-15T01:04:13.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ult nerf doesn't seem that big, I'm sure he will be still be a fine pick. But I'd highly recommend playing more simple champions than zed (annie, talon maybe) so you can focus more on improving decision making, map awareness etc. (which are usually the biggest weaknesses of newer players in my experience) rather than having to think about doing combos correctly and stuff. That said, zed is pretty easy to farm with so he's certainly not the worst champ if you stuggle with that.\n\nPresumably you play mainly mid since you're asking about zed? If this is the case you REALLY need to have at least one or two other roles you can play well, since there are a LOT of mid mains is bronze/silver (which is where you start ranked) so you will rarely get mid if you're not one of the first few people to pick.\n\nIf you feel like you're ready just go for it, you can always go back to playing normals if you dont like it or feel like you want to improve a bit more first. I'd also suggest you only play your best champions in ranked and try out new stuff in normals until you can play at your best with it.","replies":[{"poster":"NIGERiaFTW","date":"2015-05-15T04:53:06.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the advice. I am mid main but I do have atleast two characters for each role. Just asking is tf a good pick?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-15T09:34:16.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really... For starters, it takes lots and lots and lots of practice to use TF to his full potential as he is very difficult, and while I'm not judging  your skill level since I've never seen you play, it might better to practice some simpler champions first.\n\nEven if you were a godlike TF (You very well may be) he just isn't as good in low elo's because a lot of people will not know how to play with a TF on their side in terms of map pressure and following up on roams and ganks. Not to mention most games just turn into ARAM at 20 minutes. (SO annoying) in which case your ult becomes useless and your team is kinda put in a disadvantage.\n\nI'm a mid main, and while I'm not in a high elo, I was placed in Bronze 5 this season and carried myself to Silver 4. The key is honestly mastering roughly 2-3 champions in each role, and making sure they are good champions for Solo Q, while I can't speak for other lanes and roles, generally CC is what you wanna go for in Top, Jungle and Support. And dominant laning ADC's with self peel are good.\n\nAS FOR MID LANERS.... You want champions with high mobility, high damage and with some CC also. You want a strong laner (You don't wanna get stomped in lane in Solo Q). Someone with strong roams so you can gank for other lanes. And someone who can make solo plays and get solo kills so you can get YOURSELF fed. Teamwork is important, but you can never fully rely on others in Solo Q.\n\nPersonally I almost solely carried myself from B5 to S4 on Ahri. She was about 70% of the time the champion I played. But other champs that I used or didn't but are also good are Zed, Talon, Leblanc, Cassiopeia, Diana, Kassadin, Nidalee, Fizz and Ekko will be SO good with Solo Q when he comes out","replies":[{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-05-15T10:19:18.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is like saying a gold/plat/diamond/master TF main wouldn't hard carry games in bronze/silver... TF is by far one of the best champions to stomp solo queue with but you need to put in the time; 40-80 games depending on how fast you learn. \n\nyou are silver 4 so your opinion is worthless","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-15T15:40:01.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How in the world was anything I said like that at all? What?\n\nAnd you may think that, and you may be right but I highly disagree. He is a sitting duck in lane and in teamfights. He gets wrecked by just every other meta mid laner, is prone to ganks and has little self peel in teamfights. He offers great map pressure though.... considering your team actually follows up on your moves which they 50% of the time do not. Sometimes  the ports end up badly too where the enemy team can bait you into bad situations. \n\nTF requires teamwork and communication to stomp SoloQ. Something you unfortunately don't get all that often","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-15T09:40:44.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any champ is good.
