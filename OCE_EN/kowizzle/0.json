I was stuck in a 50 minute game with an entire team who flamed me because I was having a bad game (and no, before those of you who start the flame like, \"oh you probably deserved it\" Nope. No one deserves to get flamed and abused for about an hour. Like it actually got to the point where they were too busy abusing me to actually play the game, they'd be typing and die by the enemy, \"UNINSTALL THE GAME\". Everyone lost lane because they were too bloody busy slamming their keyboards like some kinda SJW.\r\n\r\nTHEN I GET A CHAT RESTRICTION: Do you now how annoying it is to PLAY, A T E A M BASED GAME WITH CHAT RESTRICTION.\r\n\r\nAin't nobody in other lanes caring about your pings, you haven't said anything the whole bloody game, wanna ask for a gank? NOPE, ping that shite, or wait 4 stupid minutes just waiting, waiting to be able to say \"gank please\". \r\n\r\nAlso wanna point out this thing called chat filter, the filter that you can decide whether you want swearing **** out or not. Why bloody have it if your game just bans them in chat anyway, that's so stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubt anyone cares, but my rants done.","replies":[{"poster":"Yizus","date":"2019-07-27T12:29:33.015+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"You only get bans if you say specific words that set off liberals.
