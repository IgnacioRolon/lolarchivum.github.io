Gameplay offences naturally skip the two chat restriction tiers since those punishments don't apply in that scenario.\n\nYes, you can be punished for a single match, but you will never receive a permanent suspension without first receiving at least a 14-day ban, so an account is never permanently suspended without warning (with exceptions for things like cheating).\n\nNow without knowing which game you were punished for, there isn't much context we can offer at all, only general advice based on past experiences and the information available. If for whatever reason the match history link isn't working for you, and you don't know what game it was, Player Support will be able to point you in the right direction.\n\nAs far as general advice goes:\n\nTiming is irrelevant. For example, if you played normally for most of the game, but intentionally fed for the last few minutes, that's still intentionally feeding.\n\nThe system is generally quite conservative with gameplay punishments to ensure that it has correctly identified negative intent as opposed to someone just having a bad game. This doesn't mean that false positives don't occur, simply that they are very rare. \n\nIf it was just a bad game and not one you intentionally ruined (a false positive) then the punishment should be removed. With that said, we on boards can never have the full context, so we can't make any guarantees. Player Support has access to all the background info that goes into a punishment like this and can give you more context if you ask for it.\n\nYou can find all the general information about the punishemtn system here: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-","replies":[]},{"poster":"CJvrdan","date":"2020-02-10T13:26:59.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a link to \"Game 1\" but wont open at all.. and apprently it only takes 1 game for you to get banned what a \"fun\" game this is...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2020-02-13T05:54:32.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can try, but it almost certainly won't work.
