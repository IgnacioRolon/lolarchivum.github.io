If someone else knows, I&#039;d greatly appreciate it. The example one in mine is: LOL_E2EF002B-B1FE-E103-A7F1-811267F7F230. I only know this because I had an old item set sitting there which I could look at. Though I imagine if you&#039;re interested in this you already have old item sets. \r\n\r\nMode and type I&#039;d recommend just keep as is. AssociatedChampions I&#039;d also keep as is. Champion changes according to what champion the set is for. I&#039;d keep associatedMaps empty because I don&#039;t know what can go in there. Priority means it&#039;s set as the item set when you first open the shop I believe, can be true or false. Blocks beings to define what different rows are in the item sets and MUST start with a [ and end with ]. When first defining a new block being with { and end with }. &quot;type&quot; is the name of the block, so &quot;type&quot;:&quot;starting&quot; names it as starting. &quot;items&quot; means that the following section is the items within the block. That must also have a [ and { at the start and } ] to end it. &quot;ID&quot; is the item in question whereas count is for potions and whatnot. http://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/tool/ is where you can find item ID&#039;s. \r\n\r\nHope this helps anyone who wants to make items sets, I apologize if I explained poorly.","replies":[]}
