Of all the things to nerf or touch on her kit, you&#039;re removing what I&#039;d argue to be probably the healthiest part of her kit? It&#039;s easy to counterplay against, it can be difficult to set up right, and when you knock one off, it feels satisfying. Why, of all the things you could change, you remove this? Do you want her to be an ultbot?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-02-23T06:19:18.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you see this?

They gave lethality a tiny buff and it becomes strong. Instead of toning it down to 50-50 instead of 60-40 or something, they nerf every single one of Talons core item (7.4), then in 7.5 they directly nerf talon, then nerf his core items again. what the hell is rito's idea of balancing. Half the reason for lethality buff was because talon was weak, nerfing him and all his items isnt going to help.\n\nWe're gonna have an old rengar situation aren't we. Nerf him useless, then buff him op, then nerf him useless then buff him op then nerf him useless yadda yadda etc etc.\n\nTotally forgot. They nerfed 12 of his masteries pretty heavily too.","replies":[]}]}
