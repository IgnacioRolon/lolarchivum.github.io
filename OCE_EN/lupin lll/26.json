He&#039;s meant to be fighter/tank for use in top lane. The numbers certainly aren&#039;t definite yet, meet Gandri.\r\n\r\n**Drunkenness**: Gandri&rsquo;s energy pool. It is restored by _Take a Swig!_.. \r\n**Abilities**\r\n_Passive:_\r\nTake a Swig! - After being hit by an enemy champion attack or spell, a 10 second timer is set. If the timer is already ticking, it is reset. Once the timer hits 0, Gandri restores 10% of maximum health and 25% drunkenness.\r\n_Q_\r\nSmack em&#039; - Gandri strikes to deal true damage equal to 75/100/125/150/175 damage (+40% AD), Energy: 5, CD 5\r\n_W_\r\nYer&#039; fight like me granny! - The target is taunted for .3/.5/.7/.9/1.1 seconds, Energy: 25, CD 10/12/14/14/14\r\n_E_\r\nHeadbutt - The target is headbutted in the shins slowing them for 20%/25%/30%/35%/40% 2 seconds, Energy: 10, CD 5\r\n_R_\r\nWhirl em&#039; round - The target is spun around over Gandri&#039;s head 3/4/5 times once per 0.5 seconds dealing 100/200/300 (+40% AD) to enemies hit and the 1/2 to the target being spun for every champion hit.. Damage to the champion is ONLY applied if they hit an allied champion. Gandri may reactivate this ability to throw the target as a linear skillshot dealing the same amount of damage. After all spins are completed, Gandri has one second to throw the target else they are dropped. CD: 100\r\n\r\nPros\r\nGandri is good in team fights, effectively disabling someone he gets into range with and zoning that area.\r\nGandri is good at trading in lane with his passive.\r\nExtremely good at initiating if he gets into range of someone \r\nBuilding tank along side with AD can still allow him to deal out damage with his Q\r\n\r\nCons\r\nGandri is slow and has no quick initiation tools. This makes him easy to kite/avoid with ranged attacks.\r\nGoing all in on Gandri can negate the use of his passive majorly. Don&#039;t try to have small trades with him.\r\n\r\nPlaying against\r\nGandri is slow and melee reliant. Stay out of his range and he won&#039;t be giving you trouble.\r\nWhile he is spinning someone during his ult, avoid him. He will deal no damage to the victim nor to you.\r\nGandri&#039;s only form of chase is his W and E.\r\nHe can only restore drunkenness by _Take a Swig!_. So keep on the pressure and he will run out, at which point he is vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Lore**\r\nGandri grew up like a standard dwarf child, until he reached the age at which all dwarf boys are tested for martial proficiency, by far and away the best natural axeman his teachers had ever seen they set about training him to become the ultimate dwarven warrior and general. He earned his axe on the field during the runeterra wars, leading a mixed force of Dwarfs and Yordles to triumph. \r\n\r\nAfter the war he was appointed warden of the tunnels, a very prestigious position in Dwarven society that required him to lead the dwarven armies into battle and oversee the dwarven underground exploration, seeing the need for a reliable scout Gandri befriended the  Cryophoenix Anivina, who would warn him of approaching forces in return for protecting her nest. This was the beginning of a friendship that persist through to the present day.\r\n\r\nOne day while overseeing the construction of these tunnels he and his group of miners broke through into a sealed cavern overflowing with ornate weapons and armour. Unable to resist such beautiful artifacts Gandri claimed a set for himself, and as he was buckling on the armour a gateway from the Void shimmered into existence before his eyes, and a Voidborn clawed it&rsquo;s way through. As the rift snapped close behind him the beast set upon everyone in the room, only Gandri was quick enough to block its attack and instead of fighting back the beast moved on squeezing through the hole made by the miners, caving the entrance in before Gandri could reach it. \r\n\r\nBy the time Gandri broke through the rubble the Voidborn had disappeared, slaughtering the entire dwarven city on his way out. Now gandri is shunned by the dwarves, blamed for causing the cataclysm that destroyed their capital he was cast adrift wearing only the ornate armour that had first caught his eye, and a matching great-axe. forced into mercenary work to survive he wandered for years, searching for the creature that destroyed his reputation when one day he spotted it prancing about the fields of Judgement, On that very day he vowed to join the League of Legends and exact his vengeance upon the Voidborn&hellip; Cho&rsquo;Gath.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You best be apologising for how yer&rsquo; acted last time we met or I&rsquo;ll bash yer&rsquo; wee head in&rdquo;\r\nGandri&rsquo;s Opening line upon seeing Cho&rsquo;Gath at the League of Legends \r\n\r\n_Credits go to:_\r\n**ForwardSkies**\r\n**Armies Of Me**","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-06-13T11:24:53.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ForwardSkies,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=cIWFxAvN,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-06-12T13:35:27.365+0000)\n> \n> **Drunkenness**: Gandri&rsquo;s energy pool.

Once he gets into a team fight, he's screwed because we wont ever be able to regenerate his only resource. You don't list the cap on this, but assuming this functions like Energy, Fury, or Heat, this goes up to 100.\n\n> _Q_\n> Smack em&#039; - Gandri strikes to deal true damage equal to 75/100/125/150/175 damage (+40% AD), Energy: 5, CD 5\n\nHigh amounts of true damage on a 5 second cooldown will never happen.\n\n> _W_\n> Yer&#039; fight like me granny! - The target is taunted for .3/.5/.7/.9/1.1 seconds, Energy: 25, CD 10/12/14/14/14\n\nSo, the cost of taunting your enemy for 1.1 second at max level is an estimated 1/4 of your resource? I'd also like to remind you that taunting an enemy brings them into to attack you, meaning it would reset the cooldown on his passive. Why would you ever cast this?\n\n> _E_\n> Headbutt - The target is headbutted in the shins slowing them for 20%/25%/30%/35%/40% 2 seconds, Energy: 10, CD 5\n\nHeadbutted...in the shins...\nGo try and headbutt someone in the shins. Tell me how that goes.\n\n> _R_\n> Whirl em&#039; round - The target is spun around over Gandri&#039;s head 3/4/5 times once per 0.5 seconds dealing 100/200/300 (+40% AD) to enemies hit and the 1/2 to the target being spun for every champion hit.. Damage to the champion is ONLY applied if they hit an allied champion. Gandri may reactivate this ability to throw the target as a linear skillshot dealing the same amount of damage. After all spins are completed, Gandri has one second to throw the target else they are dropped. CD: 100\n\nNow THIS, actually, is an interesting concept. It makes absolutely no sense with his kit, but the idea of hitting an enemy champ into other enemy champions is interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-06-13T15:15:33.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback! \nPassive: I know what you mean. I was trying to go for some interesting mechanic annnnddddd while it would be a cool mechanic IMO, I'm not certain on the numbers. Kinda wanted a balance between the laning phase and teamfights, buuuttt as you said\nThe shins thing was rather a joke between me and my friend :P. Forgot to change it. \nThe Q... Well, comparative to Irelia's W isn't that bad. Sure, she does really low amounts, however, she can spam attacks with high AS and deal greater damage in shorter periods. \nThe W, yeah I see what you mean. Main reason for this was he needs some sort of way to get at someone and then out buuuttt.... Hmmm... Maybe fear them instead?","replies":[]}]}]}
