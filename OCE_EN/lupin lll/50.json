I use cable internet. The lobby screen popped up for a moment and then disappeared. It's definitely an issue to do with displaying the lobby screen. I could chat with people just fine on the client. If I'm really getting notable lag, there's a delay on my messages. I can assure you, it's not connection, but an issue with displaying/rendering the lobby screen for whatever reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
