I absolutely despise the LeaverBuster system. Everytime I have had to leave a game has never been of my own volition or 4tehtrolls and I have to leave quite often. This is about the third time I've been put on a god damn 20 minute queue and they are ridiculous. I want to enjoy a game of LoL? Wait 20 minutes. When I'm not on the queue something happens out of my control. Two games in a row, the LoL loading screen after the lobby appeared after a prolonged time.  Those two times, the game started without me and I get put on these fucking queues. I think LeaverBuster should be removed and replaced with AFK reports entirely since all they do is grieve players who want to enjoy your game.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-14T05:12:46.777+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is your fault if you can't check if you have something coming up within the next hour.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-03-14T05:35:56.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That doesn't help if 1.

How the f\\*ck do you get something \"unexpected\" come up often enough to get punished by leavebuster so often? It's just not possible for it to happen as often as you claim **and** be something you can't ignore **every single time**. Even if that is the case it's still your responsibility, after all you are the one who chooses to play an online game despite these \"unexpected\" things occurring so often that you have no time to play.\n\n> My computer fucks up within that time\n\nWell... That's your fault actually. It's stated in both the [TOU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) and [EULA](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/eula) that you **MUST** ensure your computer is capable of running league, with a stable connection, before you play. By not meeting that requirement you've broken your agreement with Riot and have actually forfeited your right (or rather privilege) of playing.\nAnd I quote:\n>  In order to participate in the Game, you must also: ... meet the hardware and connection requirements published on the Site. These requirements may change as the Game evolves.  You are wholly responsible for the cost of all internet connection fees, along with all equipment, servicing, or repair costs necessary to allow you access to the Game.\n\n*TLDR* It's solely your responsibility to ensure you have the time and meet the hardware/connection requirements to play. Based on your description of the situation, it's also solely your fault.","replies":[]}]}
