But I improved and I try to help others improve from the mistakes they make so they hopefully don't do it again.\n\n> In a land where duo top happens all the time, most of the time they don't care about vision or anything about that.\n\nThese Summoners Aren't in the meta. Because, their basically bronze players. (expect they might have potential after they learn more) But like come on man these people don't care about vision because they don't know what a jungler is other lanes don't roam to then baron/dragon jungle camps are just frozen minions till you hit em.\n\n> She's just going to get stomped by basically every other starter champ that can click you for kill.\n\nYeah well you are going to get stomped very first game of norms if you have a bunch of new people against some smurfs. (because there are a lot of gold+ smurfs in low levels) so you get better at playing Ashe then evolve into playing other marksman or another play style. These new Summoners aren't going to be acing Sivir or Corki or Varus. until they learn the basics of ADC then they an evolve into trying more advanced champions Like Sivir, Lucian or Vayne.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T17:20:31.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the slow on her long aa is perfect for teaching a fundamentally basic mechanic orb walking/kiting in lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"lil dang","date":"2015-12-18T07:48:51.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No mate, Yi shouldn't be a starter champion","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-12-16T02:35:43.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:22}} should be starter champion as she takes no skill.....slows for days","replies":[]}]}
