Some people have played 1000s of games with the same champion and still suck at that champion. For example, [this guy](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/br/4743952) has 561 Zilean games this season and he's still a Bronze IV player.\n\nThe best way to judge whether someone is good at a champ is by looking at their win rate and rank. Someone in Diamond with a 55% win rate and 50 games is good at a champion. Someone in Bronze with a 70% win rate and 1000 games still sucks at that champion.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-08-04T10:07:11.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/OC1/201329207?champion=26&matchType=1\n\nMajority of these look alright to me","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T10:18:50.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't see normal games on that site unless I'm your friend, but normal games really don't mean anything, nor do games in Bronze Elo. I'm assuming you're showing games with high KDA or something.\n\nFor instance, I'm awful at ADCs. In my Elo (it's not even that high, ~Plat 1 Elo), if I pick ADC, I often go 0/6 and shit like that. When I play ADC on my mid-Gold smurf, though, I go like 15/2 almost every game. This doesn't mean I'm good at ADCs, it just means that the players are awful in my smurf's Elo so it's easy to beat them even though I suck.\n\nIt's the same story with your Zilean games. You're playing against bottom-tier players, so it'd not hard to pick up easy kills.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-08-04T10:26:00.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let the Zilean touch your heart child, for you are of the misinformed sheep.","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T13:10:26.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Misinformed sheep, or bitter veteran? I've gone from Bronze V to Plat I and I know in detail how each tier of player plays - the skills they lack, the cold hard truths.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that if you're mid Silver or below, you don't know the basics of the game. At all. I didn't know these basics either when I was at that level.\n\nHow can you claim to be good at a champ if you don't even know the basics?","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-08-04T13:32:52.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao. I know the basics. I've only played 12-14 ranked games. If I cared enough, I'd climb. Hell, at the time of doing ranked my PC was terribad and disconnected a tonne. I know about wards. Not put it in your lanes bush and you're done, but I go to the shop and buy that shit. I don't even know what you define as the basics since it's a fairly wide concept sooo... Anyway, this is obviously a le maymay post so calm yo titties. On another note though, I pick ZIlean since he is a fairly safe pick irrelevant of how well you do in lane. He basically gives your carry two lives and a tonne of utility thanks to his E and stun. Whereas a Yasuo or Katarina become basically useless if they do bad. ofc I play him on normies rift for the allahu akbah type stuff tho'","replies":[{"poster":"Strat","date":"2015-08-04T15:40:18.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If I cared enough, I'd climb. \n\nSaid every Bronze player ever. Look, if you didn't belong in Bronze, you wouldn't be matched up with Bronze players in your normal games.

The main thing is that you need to recognise that you're inexperienced and may not know as much as you think you do about the game.\n\n>don't even know what you define as the basics since it's a fairly wide concept sooo\n\nSimple, things like ability to trade effectively in lane - not just going in at random times and saying \"now I will use my skills,\" actually considering the situation in full (there are many factors and the ones people do badly depend on the person).
