Generally, he goes top thanks to his massive sustain, however he could work as a support at the bottom lane thanks to his defensive capabilties and crowd control.\n\n**Lore**\nAn ancient empire of Yordles once held their place in the Ironspike mountains. They were a proud race who developed their wealth and safety by mining into the heart of the mountains. When the Rune Wars occured, great quakes destroyed most of the nation causing the most of them to flee to other developing Yordle cities. Few remain true to their roots, however Gandri might as well be the Representative of the people. He embodies  their core concepts, which happen to be fine mead, mighty beards, and a lust for battle. \n\n**Social**\n\n_Taunt_\nRaise his axe in the air\n&quot;YER&#039; FIGHT LIKE ME GRANNY!&quot;\n&quot;YER A PANSY MILK DRINKER LAD/LASS?!&quot;\n&quot;YER&#039;VE A MIGHTY FINE WEAPON, BUT YER BEARD SAYS NOTHIN&#039;!&quot;\n\n_Joke_\nRaises a cup of mead which is filled depending Gandri&#039;s current cup\n&quot;Where&#039;d all me brew go?&quot; (&lt; 1/4 cup)\n&quot;Needing more from the tap!&quot; (&lt; 1/2 cup)\n&quot;Me cup is half full lad!&quot; (&lt; 3/4 cup)\n&quot;Only needin&#039; to be takin&#039; a swig!&quot; (&gt;3/4)\n\n_Dance_\n\nPlaces a table on the ground and does a jolly ol&#039; jig ontop with his cup of mead\n\n**Abilities**\n_Passive:_\nTake a Swig! - After being hit by an enemy champion attack or spell, a 10 second timer is set. If the timer is already ticking, it is reset. Once the timer hits 0, Gandri restores 10% of maximum health and gains cup. At 100 cup, Gandri becomes drunk and loses 5 cup/second. While drunk, abilities spend cup, otherwise they restore cup.\n\n_Q_ CD: 15/13/11/9/7 Cup: 30 \n\nMountain Strike - Gandri swings his hammer in a 180o arc taking 1 second to complete the swing . The first target suffers 90/110/140/170/200 + (.5 AD) and is stunned for swing time * 1/1.5/2/2.5/3/3.5 seconds. While drunk, this swing affects all targets and sends them flying ??? units in the direction of the swing.\n\n_W_ CD: 20/18/16/14/12 Cup: 10\nWarden&#039;s Watch - Marks a nearby ally unit with 100/200/300/400/500 range. If an enemy champion hits that target, Gandri may reactivate to jump to the target dealing 40/50/60/70/80 + (1 AD). While drunk, this deals double damage and stuns for .5/.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds.\n\n_E_ CD: 15/13/11/9/7 Cup: 40\nWarden&#039;s Grasp - Gandris grabs onto a target, if they move outside of Gandri&#039;s attack range for more than 1 second, they are stunned for .75/1/1.25/1.5/1.75 seconds. If the target moves away rapidly more than 2x Gandri&#039;s range before 1 second, they are not stunned. While drunk, Gandri insteads grabs the target for 2 seconds, during this time Gandri may throw them ??? units as a linear skillshot. \n\n_R_ CD: ??? Cup: 0\nWhirl em&#039; round - The target is spun around over Gandri&#039;s head 3/4/5 times once per second dealing 80/160/240 + (.2/.3/.4 AD) to enemies hit and the 1/2 to the target being spun. Damage to the champion is ONLY applied if they hit an allied champion. Gandri may reactivate this ability to throw the target as a linear skillshot dealing the same amount of damage. After all spins are completed, Gandri has one second to throw the target else they are dropped.","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-12-10T03:45:41.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds good yo","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-12-10T04:52:34.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any reasons why it's good?","replies":[{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2015-12-10T05:53:00.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ForwardSkies,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=pGEEtW5A,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-12-10T04:52:34.197+0000)\n>\n> Any reasons why it's good?\n\nhe sounds funny/fun to play","replies":[]}]}]}]}
