This is fine, my fault for that not riot&#039;s. Not complaining about that. The issue is, ingame it WILL not reconnect. No matter how long I wait once it is connected again. If I try to rejoin the game it refuses to. Yes sir, I did check my internet connection as shown here. It&#039;s my fault it disconnects, it&#039;s not my fault it won&#039;t reconnect once my internet connection is once again secured, ingame and out of game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T02:23:33.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be that the cache used to store the connection is wiped when your internet cuts out, meaning you'd also have to clear your DNS cache to reconnect as well (or reset your computer if you don't know how).
