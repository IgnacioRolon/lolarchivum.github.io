I&#039;m using SDL with C++ to make it. I am working with a talented graphics artists to make it look really nice! \r\n\r\nThe game is a 2D sidescroller set in an infinite scrolling &quot;level&quot; which is generated as you go. As of this post, there are two enemy types. Melees and archers, there are a large number of melees and much less regular archers. While mounted on Skaarl you have 4 Hit Points, while dismounted you have 2. While mounted you have the ability to dash, which knocks enemies away. While dismounted, you have access to Kled&#039;s pocket pistol, which has 2 bullets that regenerate over time. Kled is also able to duck enemy projectiles, causing them to hit enemies if he does. Killing 20 enemies causes Skaarl to dash to Kled, upon contact you remount and all HP is restored. Caves are randomly generated as you go along. Bosses are planned and are currently working on being implemented, along with rewards for the caves! If you have any ideas for new enemy types, mechanics, cave interactions, or anything else I&#039;m absolutely interested in hearing! \r\n\r\nIf anyone would like what I&#039;ve currently got, you&#039;ll have to directly message me.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-04-18T13:37:42.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
