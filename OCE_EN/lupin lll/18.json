Auriel wields her bow, using it&#039;s power to bestow hope to her allies, and despair to those who challenge her.\r\n\r\nIngame she provides a some very niche utilities other supports don&#039;t have access to. She can grant allies opportunities for allies to land abilites while granting protection from them. She can also allow her adc to have access to arcing damage, hitting multiple targets (for reduced damage to the arced targets). She pays for these with being hard to use effectively, her healing and poke being a skillshot, while the other abilities require setup and smart use to be helpful. \r\n\r\n_Passive - Arcing Wrath_\r\nHitting enemies with spells/basic attacks marks them for 2 seconds. If an ally attacks a marked target, the attack arcs to the closest enemy within 200 units dealing 25% of the damage to the new target. If the arc strikes a marked target, they also arc dealing 25% of the ORIGINAL attack, it does not reduce the damage by a further 25%. Enemies can only be arced to once. \r\n\r\nThis ability could lead to some very interesting interactions occuring and gives some extra poke in lane.\r\n\r\n_Q - Arrow of Cleansing_\r\nFire a bolt in a straight. If it strikes allies, it heals for 90/120/150/180/210  (+.5% AP). Enemies struck suffer 60/100/140/180/220 + (1 AD)\r\n\r\nThe bread and butter spell. It would have a fairly low cooldown at high levels. It&#039;s simple as it needs to be.\r\n\r\n_W - Field of Hope_\r\nCreates a field of floating lights around Auriel. Allies inside this field or those that enter gain a shield equal to 80/120/160/200/240 + (.75 AP) (.5 AD) for 2 \r\nseconds. Allies who fire abilities or basic attacksinto this zone also are granted the shield. (Katarina Q, Ashe W, Zilean Q, Annie W would grant the shield, abilities\r\nsimply need to pass into the zone, not be cast in the zone. If Nidalee throws a spear from the other side of the wall and hits the field, she would get the shield) \r\nEnemies caught in the field suffer 10/20/30/40/50 + (.1 AP) damage every time it grants a shield along with a 10/15/20/25/30% slow. Auriel may activate this while _Arrow of Cleansing_ is travelling to create the zone around the arrow, rather than around Auriel. \r\n\r\nThis is probably one her most interesting abilites. Allies want to aim at the field to get the shield while dealing extra damage when they do manage to gain the shield. It would be an awkward ability, if it weren&#039;t able to be cast around the _Arrow of Cleansing_ which lends more to this ability. \r\n\r\n_E - Rift of time_\r\nCreates a rift of time in a cylinder shape ahead of Auriel. Ally and enemy abilites that hit the rift appear on the other side, while spells cast in the rift appear on the opposite side of the rift from which they exited. You can effectively increase the range of abilites using this spell. Higher levels increases duration and lower\r\nCD/mana costs.\r\n\r\nExample: Nidalee is inside of the field and throws a spear straight ahead. It strikes the the end of the rift. The spear would appear again at the start of the rift. Her spear would still be at the travel time that it was at when it hit the end of the rift, and would stil disappear at the same time if it were thrown anywhere else. The uses of this spell are dramatic. Allies inside of the rift are effectively immune to any abilities from outside. Abilities inside the rift... I can&#039;t even describe. It can be used negatively however and cause allies to miss.\r\n\r\n_R - Angelic Touch_\r\nA target within 200/800/1400 units is put in stasis for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple and reliable spell, since the rest of her kit is so unreliable yet potentially game altering. It can be used on allies and enemies. I honestly thought of something more complex, but she doesn&#039;t need more complexity.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-07-05T06:06:15.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably wanna rethink the name.\n\nAuriel being a deity in The Elders Scrolls and their holy relic even being Auriel's Bow.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2017-07-05T09:43:59.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point.
