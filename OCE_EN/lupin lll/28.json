This guy&#039;s definitely not based off warhammer beastmen. \n_Passive - Fury of The Forest_\nWithin the Jungle, Gore gains 25 movement speed. When leaving the jungle, this bonus is increased to 80 for 5 seconds. Beast Paths also count as jungle for the sake of this passive.\n_Q - Carnage_ CD: 7 from when it ends.\nGore sacrifices the ability to use Basic Attacks for the next 5/5/6/6/7 seconds in return to use Q. He swings his greataxe in a cone, dealing damage to all enemies, applying on hit effects to the closest target. This counts as a basic attack for all intents and purposes including critical strikes. The swings have the same cooldown as time between basic attacks. The swing deal base attack damage + (40/60/80/120/140) physical damage. These sweeps slow the target by 30/35/40/45/50% for 1 second. If the attack critically strikes, they are slowed for 2 seconds. He may use this attack 3/3/4/4/5 times. After all the casts have been used, he may use Basic Attacks. He restores 50% of damage dealt with these attacks, 25% against minions.\n_W - Omens of Terror_ (Huge Range. Cast from the jungle behind a wall range) Lasts 15/20/25/30/35/40 seconds. 60 second CD. \nPassive - Every 3rd basic (OHNO3HITPASSIVE, but this works with his Q, so I think that leaves some interesting options) attack terrifies the target for 1 second.Stacks can&#039;t be applied for another 2 seconds after the fear. \nActive - The target is given horrific visions of their demise. Every 5-10 (random)seconds, an hallucination of Gore charging the target appears. They appear to deal damage, however the damage is not actually applied. Gore always comes from outside of the targets vision, and will open real Beast Paths to make it to the target. Everytime a new hallucination appears however, the previous Beast Path is closed. \n_E - Beast path_\nCreates a clearing through wall, which allies and enemies may walk through for 10 seconds. Enemies suffer a 5/8/11/14/18% slow inside, while allies gain the same % amount. Anyone caught when it closes is pushed to the nearest exit of the wall.\n_R - Horn of the Herd_\nGore blows his horn, signalling his allies to strike. Gore marks opponents he strikes for the next 5 seconds. Allies gain 30/35/40% movement speed when moving towards the target. Furthermore, Gore may reactivate to have 1/2/3 Beasts charge from the jungle to marked targets. The first strike, these beasts leap on the target stunning them for .5 seconds \n\nGore is designed for the jungle. His kit is based around scaring opponents. His _Omens of Terror_ can put really scare an opponent, with the constant barrage of hallucinations. When Gore eventually\ncharges the opponent might not even realise it really is Gore ramming an axe up their **redacted**. His Q counts as a basic attack for the purposes of his W, meaning if he can swing accurately, he\nhas the potential to land entire team fears, while that&#039;s a scary proposition, the enemy team would really have to line themselves up for it. If you can ward the enemy jungle, you can even have the\nenemy jungler crying as the hallucinations put their jungle clearing off with the imagined lost hit points. His W also leaves real Beast Paths, meaning that if Gore were to stalk the enemy jungler\nfor some time, he might just see an opening, ripe for charging through. It should be noted, W doesn&#039;t grant vision of the target from the hallucinations, that&#039;s dumb. His ultimate isn&#039;t too unique\nfor the movemnt speed, though that&#039;s why Gore has to mark targets before they gain the speed. The beasts charge towards the nearest target, unless that target has already been targeted by a beast, \nat which point they go for a different target. Unless of course, there is no other target. When Gore ganks a target, he plays with their mind, up until the point beasts rip the victim to shreds. \nGore can help control a teamfight. The beasts stunning opponents, the movement speed towards opponents, and the threat of teamwide fears give him a nice presence. He doesn&#039;t protect people as well\nas tanks, nor does he eliminate single targets effectively. He contributes utility to the team that is valuable for the ally. \n\nThis champion may or may not be inspired by Warhammer Beastmen. \nBeast images: https://www.games-workshop.com/en-AU/Beastmen-Razorgor?_requestid=3794198)\nGore image: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammerfb/images/7/79/Bestigor_Herd_(4).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160716093845","replies":[]}
