They utilise Blood as the main component in their rituals, though sometimes they use body parts which are often acquired in ways one doesn&#039;t want to think about it.\r\n\r\nPassive - Prophecy of Pain.\r\nDamage isn&#039;t applied instantly to enemy champions via spells. Instead, a marker is set on their health. After 4 seconds, the target is reduced to the marker. \r\nLifesteal and other such effects do NOT cancel the damage that is applied. \r\nExample: If Ashe lifesteals 500HP while at max HP and is inflicted by 600 points of _Prophecy of Pain_, she suffers 600 damage. If she were at 200 HP and were to steal\r\n500 HP, she would have 100 HP after _Phophecy of Pain_ activates. Shields work as usual.\r\n\r\nThis brings alot of counterplay. It allows for heals and invulnerabilities to save the target.\r\n\r\nQ - Blast of Pain\r\nFires a blast of Voodoo energy. It deals 90/110/130/150/170 + (.5 AP) damage to the first target hit. If the target is afflicted by _Prophecy of Pain_ they also \r\nsuffer the effects of _Rune of Death_. CD: 9/8/7/6/5\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a skill shot. If two shots land in quick succession, it applies the root and extra damage from Rune of Death. Damage isn&#039;t too insane for a spammable ability IMO.\r\nThe snare makes the ability more rewarding to land.\r\n\r\nW - Pull the Pin\r\nAll markers set on targets explode damaging nearby enemies as well. This deals 120/135/150/165/180 + (.75 AP) damage and instantly detonates their marker. This ability \r\nmay be cast while dead. CD: 14/13/12/11/10\r\n\r\nAllows Gizzul to interact with his opponents. Could be a bit toxic, but considering there is a big YOU WILL DIE MARKER, I think it&#039;ll be forgivable. \r\n\r\nE - Rune of Death \r\nLays a rune on the ground. Targets that walk over it cause it to explode.Enemies are rooted for 1/1.1/1.3/1.4/1.6 seconds and suffer 80/110/140/170/200 + (1 AP) \r\ndamage. Runes last 90 seconds and take .5 seconds to arm. CD: 10\r\n\r\nA visible rune on the ground that lasts on the ground for a considerable amount of time. They have a fairly low arming time. Slapping a rune on someone after landing \r\nblast of pain can be devastating.\r\n\r\nR - Blood Channel\r\nPassive - Abilities that hit an enemy champion have a 50/65/80% cooldown reduction\r\nActive: A target is marked under the curse of Doovoo. If the cursed target dies within 5/7/10 seconds, Gizzul restores 20/35/50% of max HP. If Gizzul is dead, he come\r\ns back to life with 20/35/50% max HP. If the ability is recast, Gizzul instead steals all _Prophecy of Pain_ damage +(1/1.5/2 AP) from the target. If the target has no\r\n_Prophecy of Pain_ damage, they instead suffer 100/175/250 + (1 AP) magic damage. This has a global range.\r\n\r\nThe passive is probably the scariest thing about this ability, but it is very defining. This makes him powerful against burst champions. Anyone thinking about engaging\r\nwill quickly soon come to regret it. It should be mentioned also, that by &quot;Steals all _Prophecy of Pain_ damage, it means setting them to the marker and healing Gizzul\r\nfor the amount, NOT dealing the AP ratio as extra damage to the target. If the target has no _Prophecy of Pain_ damage, the target instead suffers the damage described.\r\n\r\nPros\r\nStrong Poke in lane\r\nCan counter the burst of assassin champions using _Blood Channel_\r\nHigh AOE damage and zone with _Rune of Death_ and _Pull the Pin_\r\nLow cooldowns allow for bursting enemy champions with the passive of _Blood Channel_\r\n\r\nCons\r\nMissing _Blast of Pain_ can be devastating\r\n_Rune of Death_ is visible to enemies and thus can easily be avoided.\r\n_Pull the Pin_ Requires a target to be affected by _Prophecy of Pain_\r\n_Phophecy of Pain_ can be countered by heals and invulnerability. It can hurt untargetable targets however","replies":[]}
