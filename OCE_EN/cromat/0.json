So basically the ban is justified if multiple people report a person because they get angry because one of their team mates died a lot? Well, if that's how you suggest it's working. It seems like we have to re-define intentional feeding. Those statistics can be very helpful, even the ones we cannot see, and maybe it's the ones that we cannot see along with chat logs to help determine intentional feeding before banning a player for 14 days, not just take the untrained and unprofessional opinion of other players. You say you haven't heard of a false intent feeding ban.

Over the past few days i've had inters blatantly inting and then typing in chat to the enemy team saying their \"learning\" a new champ and of course they get banned because they really aren't learning anything.\n\nSadly only Riot/Support are the only ones that know for sure whether or not a person is inting or not.

In fact, if a player is tilted then they shouldn't be playing at all, it's not just your game you're ruining its 9 others as well.\n\nAs I said, its for Riot to determine and verify who and who isn't feeding and im sure the ban was justified.","replies":[{"poster":"The Dark Lörd","date":"2017-10-12T05:11:23.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not supporting inting by any means, indeed it should be banned. My concern is that inting needs to be determined correctly before banning someone. I agree that players should not be playing if they are tilted, but it's not uncommon for players to enter a game feeling OK and then get tilted halfway through. It does not mean they are inting, it just means they are having a bad game, and players should not be banned for just having a bad game.\n\nIndeed it is up to Riot, but If you're so sure the ban is justified, maybe you can back that up before making those sorts of statements? It's offensive to make assumptive accusations, otherwise. It would be fairer to remain neutral to the situation. He's already come back advising us that he has had his ban lifted.
