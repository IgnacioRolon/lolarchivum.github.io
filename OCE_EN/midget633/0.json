But this goes both ways, a laner needs to read how confident the jungler is too, and sometimes taking a leap of faith is better than abandoning the jungler to his doom.\n\nHowever, there are some champs you just don't gank, illoai is one of those _(well, post 6 anyway)_.  In mid you'd be surprised how many junglers try to gank Heim, I warn them, and tell them to go away, and every time they're like _\"Nah bro i got thi........ WTF! WTF WAS THAT?\"_. The first hundred or so times I used to go in as well _(being a team game and all)_. Now I'm much wiser and just sit under tower and pop the 'goodbye friend' emote.\nI can deal with Heim, especially as Azir. But no matter who you are, its a careful, drawn out process, it cant be rushed, going ham on him is the quickest way to a grey screen.","replies":[{"poster":"MIDGET633","date":"2018-04-05T10:36:28.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You make many good points.\nBut when he comes back not a minute later and wants to go in when the enemy jg has just ganked (unsuccessful ) and he wants to go in whilst im half hp and illaoi still has double buffs and enemy jg is full hp. i pinged him away and he said next time you ping me like that \"your loosing a wave\" and as nasus thats just wrong and i told him to please not come top again and then he says in all chat \"report nasus for not playing with team\" which i then told them that he literally walked into my lane at lvl 3 and gave illaoi double buffs then wanted to go in again. after that i just muted all and continued to play and stack my q which i hadnt been able to stack properly because of the jg.","replies":[]}]}]}
