After a harrowing 9 losses in 10 games it puts me in Silver III.  I just wanna come home from work and play a game of league without getting brutalized. It feels like my account is ruined and I have to make a smurf (with none of the skins and champions)","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-25T18:13:31.234+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"According to op.gg,  Your MMR is quite a bit higher than average. 1,443 MMR\nA baseline MMR has been changed by the latest Riot patch. (2016/2/20)\nThe Average MMR for this league is 1,309.\n\nThis is why you still placed in Silver III. So tell me, how did you improve your MMR so much since you were Silver 3 in Season 4? Did you transfer to OCE from another server or something? Or do normals affect your placement MMR?\n\nWell, you have two options: play normals for fun after work. Or keep playing ranked, you'll be bronze in no time. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \n\nBut really, silver is the new bronze, so I wouldn't worry about your rank at all. Imagine if you'd won 5/10 placement matches and made Gold or something!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-25T23:10:38.363+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I won 9 out of 10.

My mechanical skill has never been up there, I just sort of get carried through games on good map awareness. Normals are okayish but (I feel like I lose a hell of a lot more than I win).\n\nThe placement matches however felt like a farce. 1st I picked 'Fill' for all 10 matches and naturally was assigned Support. 5 of those games were a multi lane stomp that snowballed out of control before the laning phase even finished up. 4 of those games (I felt) were lost because I was a shitty support. The whole placement process felt gross and unfair. AND THEN to be placed so high. Like wtf.\n\nEdit: Question- does normal play effect ranked play??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-25T13:51:33.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't believe what I'm reading haha, never seen a post like this before","replies":[]}]}
