When i look at the time counter for my friends games, they always show up with absurdly large numbers (1000+ minutes of game time.) This is similar for the featured games of the day, displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the main window. When in a game (playing or spectating) the time counter displays the correct time.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Scythian","date":"2015-03-23T22:23:46.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wondering if you ever found a fix.

Basically, look in the time and date section of your PC and ensure that the time zone is set correctly. Mine was set to an American time zone, but I had edited the time to the correct Australian time. This meant that my game, thinking it was american from my online time, saw everyone else in the same area as me approximately 10 hours ahead of me.\n\nHope this makes sense (I tend to ramble)\nHow it works out for you.\nScobster007 (l Torchic l)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Scythian","date":"2015-03-29T04:32:20.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This ended up being my problem as well.
