The problem is, he is complete and utter garbage. He wants to become an Azir main but cannot hit his ultimate or simply have a good KDA in ANY games, he&#039;s really trash. My friends and I decided we should make him learn the core game mechanics of a midlaner by making him play Annie, as he cannot do simple things such as CSing. He sucks ass. He can&#039;t hit his annie ultimate, watch his stun or even CS with Annie q. Is there any way he can stop?
