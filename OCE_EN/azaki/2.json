I forged the PROJECT: Ekko icon, and reading it&#039;s description it stated that it also comes with the loading border for the skin.\r\nI don&#039;t have the skin yet, but when I do get it, will the loading border still be available?\r\nJust curious about this, thanks for any help. :]","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-16T06:12:31.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have unlocked the loading screen border, I am fairly sure you will have it even if you buy the skin after the event.","replies":[{"poster":"azaki","date":"2016-08-16T06:16:45.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, okay then, thank you very much!","replies":[{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-17T05:37:43.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Azakii,\n\nUnfortunately you'll have to own both the skin, and have unlocked the icon to have the first strike border. \n\n> [Click here](http://imgur.com/a/OkAP2)\n\nIf you purchase the skin after the promotional period, you'll unfortunately not receive the border (which is limited edition, and currently Riot have no plans to bring them back).","replies":[{"poster":"azaki","date":"2016-08-23T20:37:05.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Star, thanks for the information.
