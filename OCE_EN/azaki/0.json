I mainly play fighters and own a couple of mages/marksmen.\nI&#039;ve always wanted to play an assassin, preferably one that dashes/blinks (I love dashing). I looked through all the assassins and narrowed my options down to, coincidentally, Kha&#039;Zix and Rengar, with the ongoing rivalry between them.\nThey&#039;re both assassins that can burst down a target easily, also complete with leaps (yay!).\nI&#039;ve read through a few forums, but still having trouble deciding. Rengar appears to be the more fun, safer pick, being tankier and having more sustain but requiring more skill, while Kha&#039;Zix is burstier+has a better gap closer and more unique with his evolution.\nI like both of their kits (tried them out in free champ rotations), and already own Rengar. I&#039;m also quite unsure about Rengar, with his upcoming rework (I shed a tear). I&#039;m planning to buy both, but just want to know the pros and cons of both.\nSorry for the long read. Tips?\n\n**EDIT**;; Thanks for the info, everyone!

Khazix is much harder to play, squishier, slightly higher burst than rengar, has more outplay potential, more options depending on hit ult order (though usually you upgrade his ult, then q then e), has better multiple target assassination potential with leap and stealth resets and can carry very hard if he gets ahead.\n\nEssentially rengar is more a bruiser fighter whereas khazix is more of a pure assassin. In their current states, rengar might be better for soloq and is easier to pick up and have fun with, but in terms or rewards for mastering and having fun trying to reach that high skill ceiling, Kha'zix offers better carry/climbing potential.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-30T01:00:13.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"khazix is probably harder than rengar honestly. also more fun tbh, learn to doublejump its great","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-29T23:47:26.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play them both a lot. They are both super fun and have extremly similar play styles, and if you could, I would just get both.\n\nBUT, if I absolutely had to choose one I'd easily go Rengar. He's just that much more fun, and you have to play a lot of him to be good with him. Don't get me wrong, khazix is fun, but Rengar just offers so much more.\n\nEssentially they both have the exact same role. Go invisible, delete some squishy and just get out. It's just that it's not as fun however when you play khazix.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2016-08-29T23:08:14.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play too much Rengar, Kha'Zix is super fun and is relatively easy to play (that said I'm still mediocre with him but can manage to carry). If you want to be able to delete a single person in the game play Rengar, if you want to go in and out of stealth and potentially kill multiple (due to E resets) play Kha'Zix.","replies":[]}]}
