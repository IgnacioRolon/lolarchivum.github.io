Whenever I open the launcher and click \"Launch\" I wait for a minute or so but the log-in client never shows up. Every now and then I can get to the log-in part after I try starting the client 50 odd times with a combination of Task Manager/terminating multiple client processes. I don't know if that has anything to do with getting the log-in client up but it seems to be the only thing to work. Unfortunately now, for two days, nothing I do gets the log-in client up.\r\n\r\nIf I do manage to get the log-in client up it's fine from then on. I have no problems logging in or playing the game. Just getting to the log-in client is the struggle. I've never had any other technical issues with the game before this. I've tried repairing from the launcher client and just recently reinstalled the game, yet I still can't get in. Help would be mostly appreciated, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"RequieM 1 ","date":"2014-12-17T03:28:28.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm getting a very similar problem, once I click 'Launch' it just has a loading circle next to cursor for 3 seconds then nothing... in processes it says its running.

I found rebooting helps, I can usually launch the game once, but if I close and reopen the launch bug happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Epic Sasa","date":"2015-01-03T15:14:10.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After I press the launch the login comes up but when i login it says logging in forever then it says connection error","replies":[]},{"poster":"thunderwulf","date":"2014-12-28T02:12:59.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"navy69","date":"2014-12-25T17:16:14.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i cant log on my profile too","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T04:03:31.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've reinstalled the game, so that means there is something stuffing up with the way your PC is connecting to the League login servers.
