How do teams scout players? Do they spectate games in challenger solo queue, inquire with familiar faces, or is there another method?\r\n2. What&#039;s it like juggling education, work and pro gaming? Do players find difficulty balancing priorities? What do they do to resolve this?\r\n3. How does a player become involved in the Oceanic Pro League?","replies":[{"poster":"Chief Swip3rR","date":"2016-01-07T08:58:09.664+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate ill help you where i can,\nFor the most part the main players are already in the scene so people just rotate lineups and take players from others. But a few examples (Chippys, Rhomya, Zero) Are all really good solo q players who have gotten known from that instead of getting picked up through the scene. So you can  get picked up through being  successful Soloq.\n\nIt is quite easily to balance League (OCE) with real life and its pretty much a part time job at the moment, This year will be more serious but for the most hard its not really hard to balance real life commitments.\n\nTo get involved as a player the best way at the moment is to get known and respected in soloq, for a coaching or analyst position plenty of people on twitter tend to go there to pick up / trial people.\n\nBest of luck mate hope i helped somehow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chief Sangy","date":"2016-01-07T05:35:21.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Toph, \n\nGood to hear you're more keen on the competitive scene here in Oceania! I'll do my best to cover off some of your questions, though I'm sure others would have better insight than me.\n\nQ1. Mostly teams scout players through a couple ways. The first one is the obvious one, which is solo queue. A number of competitive players have made a name for themselves in the Oceanic solo queue ladder since it's inception, such as RYmeister. One of the best mechanical players on the server and has since had a very successful start to his competitive player originated through making plays and doing well in solo queue. Other methods are word of mouth, players who have performed exceptionally in other tournaments. People have since stepped it up a notch, as seen by Hellions directly recruiting players from overseas to join the league, which is always exciting!\n\nQ2. I feel the players will answer that best, but having been among them for so long as well as juggling my own studies (though my work definitely hasn't been as strenuous as progaming). A lot of them work very hard, playing League out of passion. However, it's never easy juggling your responsibilities in life. An example we always use is Raydere, who studies commerce and law at UNSW full time whilst maintaining his position as one of the best players in Oceania. You can read a little bit more insight on how he does it here: http://www.gq.com.au/entertainment/tech/esports+inside+the+billion+dollar+gaming+industry,39587\n\nI know all of our players, and indeed many players from the scene, juggle a number of commitments from work, relationships, schooling and family. The answer is really just age old hard work, good work ethic and time management. Something that myself and Jish are trying hard to promote within our culture.\n\nQ3. Riot's recent announcement of the tournament structures means that you can quality for the OCS through the OOL, and subsequently the OPL, or be scouted directly onto an OPL team. I believe the OOL -> OCS structure is really good in building grassroots talent, as teams will need commitment and dedication to fight through those two gauntlets to get to the pinnacle of OCE competition. I guess it would be up to you to decide whether or not you want to grind it out and make it on your own through getting noticed in solo queue or by putting together a team and battling your way up the ladder. Either way, you get a lot of good competitive experience under your belt and from what I've heard, it's a lot of fun too.\n\nThere are other ways you can get involved, such as through substitute roles, analysis work or just by supporting the teams as much as you can. I know my boys definitely appreciate all the fan love they get. Thanks for being interested in the scene! Hope to see you at the split 2 finals if we qualify :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freyä","date":"2016-01-07T12:00:17.693+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice Swip3rR, I'll keep that in mind :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freyä","date":"2016-01-07T06:49:47.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much for putting time into answering my questions Chief Sangy, much appreciated!","replies":[]}]}
