Can someone gimme tips on how to avoid team feeding and influence other lanes with my lead without falling behind. \r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2019-07-14T09:48:12.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take this as tips from someone who had 6 accounts and can easily escape silver on them:\n1- Your mechanics don't mean much at low ELO. Map awareness and understanding where to be is much more important.\n2- Depending on the champion you play, you can either:\na- Roam bot after pushing your lane when you see the enemy bot overextended and low.\nb- Never help your team and just focus on farm and counter jungle, then split push.\nNote: I rarely do a.\n\nI think of it this way: If a lane is losing, they are bad and won't be able to carry even if I help them. If a lane is winning, they don't need my help. Best thing is to shut down the enemy mid (and possibly jungler) to make it a 5v4 or 5v3.\n\nAlso, from my experience, the following champions can't solo carry because they can't 1v5:\n{{champion:103}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:25}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-07-14T08:39:36.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Mid lane:**\n\nI'm a mid laner, so I have more experience here than in jungle, but I'll do my best to answer both as best I can.  I play a lot of roaming champions to help with this issue. Like Aurelion Sol, and Taliyah.  Because these champs have kits that allow them to roam so quickly, there's a lot less time wasted.  Running Teleport also is an option so you're able to return to your own lane quickly _(although personally I prefer other spells)_.  Talking the water-walking rune can be extremely helpful when you're placing an emphasis on roaming too.\n\nAll these things just help reduce the time you spend not doing anything (ie walking between lanes). So you can maintain your lead while assisting other lanes.\n\nAlso, I recommend roaming bot over top _(if the situation allows)_, theres just more to be gained, and the champions are often less slippery too.\n\nOften I will roam bot, even if we dont get any kills, Ill stay just help with pushing the tower instead of going straight back mid.  If they're not doing well in lane.  Ending the lane can be a big stressor gone for the whole team.\n\n\n**Jungle:**\n\nObviously ganking is a great help, but you can't be in all places at once.\nSo if a lane isn't doing so hot, or is getting ganked a lot.  Get a control ward and use it and your trinkets in the surrounding area.  Prioritising scuttle near lanes that you expect to be ganked (or expect to tank yourself).  Giving buffs to laners is always helpful if you're ahead and don't need it.  Perhaps give the buff to a lane that is doing well, so you don't have to worry about them as much, and can focus your efforts on other lanes that need you more.\n\n**Champ picks:**\n\nPicking the right champions can be a huge boon for aiding the team.\nIf you're confident in your own skill, its easy to pick carry champs and go off and start wrecking by yourself.  But often theres not a lot Yi or Zed can actually do to help other players _(usually you just end up starving them of kills and compounding the issue)_.\n\nPicking roaming champs is good, or champs like Shen/Panth/GP/Karthus who can respond quickly to problems in other lanes.\n\nMost Karthus' save their ults for kills, but if you use it mid fight, or even at the beginning, it is a huge morale boost to your team, and a massive stressor for the enemy.  You won't get the glory of the kill, but it often helps a lot more than trying to snipe kills _(also it's more efficient for damage output)._","replies":[]}]}
