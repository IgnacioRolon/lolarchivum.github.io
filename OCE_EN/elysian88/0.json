Playing inting Sion into a decent Fiora is straight up inting with no towers or pressure, and a very fed Fiora.\n\nOther champs with better waveclear (so Sion can't get the minions close enough to towers to significantly reduce their resistances) or with %HP damage also hard counter him. So Tryndamere and Vayne.\n\nAny sort of lane bully (like Jayce or Panth), while won't complete get rid of his threat, can put him super far behind and make him irrelevant.\n\nHope this helps :)\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordsky","date":"2018-11-12T01:16:26.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Group 5v4 mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-11-09T04:42:36.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was in a game where the enemy Sion did this strategy. It's frustrating because after advising my team what to do against it, they didn't listen, and the 4-16 Sion won the game basically, so I can understand your frustration. The strategy basically takes advantage of monkeys with no macro understanding, and therefore quite good in low elo.\nIn my game Sion did this vs an Kayn, and we had a Jax jungle. The problem was the Jax jungle didn't pay attention to the Sion before he got close to the tower, and went off splitpushing himself because he was clueless. I was trying to advise him on how to counter, but he didn't listen. Another case of that one player in a team costing the team the game. Eventually the split-pushing Jax in the bot lane lost baron of course, as you get with these types of players (Udyr is another common one). As usual, splitpushing is either misunderstood at low elos, or players just have no balls and do that as a way to silent int. In my game there was a time where myself (support), and mid lane Diana were in base and Sion is coming in the top lane, and the Diana just walked mid and ignored him. I'm pinging them over and they just ignore. Low elo monkeys.\n\nI see that in your game you managed to win at least with your bronze 3 top laner. Not too bad to get a result there. The other good news is that now Riot realises that they made a mistake all of those patches ago, making towers too easy to kill (looking at you bot tower #1) and are changing this for preseason. We will have longer games again, with more strategy, instead of a quick hose with animals running around looking for meat.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-11-10T09:33:00.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: I had a think about this and decided to counter it with Lulu support.

Some important distinctions to be made are that \"inting Sion\" is an objective focused strategy, designed around taking advantage of Sion's innate tankiness, passive ability and the Demolish rune, and that, to the best of my knowledge, it typically involves removing the opposing laner from the equation (either by killing them or causing them to recall) *before* engaging the turret, usually resulting in the Sion being executed, therefor not giving gold/xp to their opponents. If performed correctly, the opposing jungler (and possibly other laners) should *have* to give the lane significant attention in order to prevent the strategy from working effectively.","replies":[]}]}
