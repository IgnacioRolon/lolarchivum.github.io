(MID TAKEN)","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"*UPDATE* ROSTER FULL, OUR PLAYERS MAY LEAVE ANYTIME THOUGH, BE SURE TO LEAVE DETAILS IN CASE SOMEONE LEAVES AND I'LL PICK YOU UP, MAKES THINGS EASIER.\nSUBS ALSO WANTED, JUST IN YOUR APPLICATION TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE WILLING TO BE A SUB\nHi, I am currently looking to build a serious team to play in the ranked teams ladder soon or as quick as possible. If you want to understand where I'm coming from on such a serious matter Is that I too was part of a ranked team with people that would  never play ranked teams and very inconsistent games.\nSo here I am, looking for a bunch of new versatile laners to make one hell of a team.\nThe Roles That will needed to make this happen are.\nTOP - milkybarkid1\nJungle - Lexhanatin\nMid - Junior\nADC - H4X\nSupport - KawaiiiPanda\n\nI currently play Mid Primarily, My favorite champions in the current meta are {{champion:238}} {{champion:7}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:61}} \nI can however play the following champions to an understandable level {{champion:268}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:127}} \n\nI am currently 15 years of age and are looking for people from various ages (I'm not picky), consistent people that take this game to somewhat of a serious level. I hope you know the basics of csing and switching to sweepers, etc. Silver may seem like a low standard, but with enough teamwork, we can reach much further. Team name has not been decided yet. \n\nIf interested, be sure to just provide your IGN, Age, champion pool, role, and means of communication, I prefer someone with skype but we can always make do. Please note, this post will be open to anyone who gets the basis of this game to a above average level. I will hope to be primarily the shotcaller of the team and help us win our games. \n\nThanks for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Statscowski","date":"2015-01-21T01:55:28.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you not accept my friend invite?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draeneroth","date":"2015-01-19T09:49:14.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gold elo, can top / adc or jungle\n\nign : draeneroth\n\ntop - irelia, nasus, mao\nadc - ezreal, cait, corki\njungle - vi, xin, lee","replies":[]},{"poster":"Statscowski","date":"2015-01-18T23:52:34.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I'm happy to be a sub for this team, since I can generally play all the lanes except jungle.
