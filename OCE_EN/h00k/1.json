The champion would be an AP caster and originate from the shadow isles. He would be male which is obvious from the title &#039;King&#039;. I haven&#039;t yet thought of a name for this champion so feel free to elaborate or spread your ideas ;). The souls in this idea will have the same appearance like {{champion:420}}&#039;s souls.\r\n\r\nPassive: Champions that die spawn souls. These souls are imitations of the champions they emerged from but will slowly travel back to the appropriate base at a pace so that they will reach the summoning platform when the champion re-spawns. These souls can be consumed by The King of Souls for bonus AP. These souls also react with The King of Soul&#039;s abilities.\r\nI know this sounds a lot like {{champion:412}}&#039;s passive but the main difference is that these souls will move towards the base of the champion it came from and also The King of Souls can interact with them via his abilities.\r\n\r\nQ Ability: The King of Souls extracts the soul of an enemy champion dealing magic damage to that champion. TKS holds this soul and is able to re-cast the ability, propelling the soul to a target location dealing AOE magic damage. A champion soul is created in that target location but will dissipate within 5 seconds.\r\nSo basically TKS will take the soul and throw it somewhere else where it will stay for 5 seconds without moving.\r\n\r\nW Ability: TKS briefly roots himself and releases his soul as a skill shot in a line which will do magic damage to the first enemy champion hit. The soul will travel until coming into contact with a minion/monster or a set distance before returning to TKS. The soul will not deal damage to champions or minions/monsters on it&#039;s way back to TKS. \r\nThis would look close to {{champion:223}}&#039;s Q Ability bit the soul will not show any attachments to TKS except for when returning to him when a line will appear to suck the soul back in.\r\n\r\nE Ability: TKS uses a champion&#039;s soul as a vessel and blinks to that soul gaining extra movement speed if the soul is an enemies&#039; for a small period of time. \r\nThis is the main ability that interacts with TKS&#039;s passive, being able to quickly blink to a soul within range. But the main use of this ability would be with the Q Ability, this combo would effectively provide mobility and also the chance to close in on your target.\r\n\r\nR Ability: TKS&#039;s soul leaves his body behind and becomes invisible for 4 seconds gaining the ability to travel through walls. When the body returns to the soul, the next ability cast will deal double damage. While invisible, TKS&#039;s body remains in the spot where cast but is still able to take damage.\r\nThis may seem a little overpowered because of the invisibility and the passing through walls but he is still able to take damage will his soul is free. Without the passing through walls and the damage taken this ability would just be a {{champion:62}} W. Which would just be silly because it&#039;s just been made into an ult. This ability would have a smaller cool down to most Ultimate&#039;s, with maybe about a minute. This ability is also very useful for assassinating targets especially with the possible art of surprise and the extra damage when the body appears in the invisible soul&#039;s place.\r\n\r\nLore: The King of Souls devoted all his time to the serving of his masters and their many needs. Instructed to learn more of warlocks and the properties of their magic for themselves to use, he ventured far away from his homeland. Supplied but only with one warlock to conduct experiments, he began testing on the physical properties of the man. The King of Souls soon found that he had the useful ability to heal any wounds. The experiments that followed were extremely gruesome, aiming to developing an understanding of the magic around the healing. \r\n\r\nAfter a major break-through in his research, The King of Souls felt confident he could imitate the ritual that activated the raw sorcery in the man. But it was a long night and he needed to sleep, so before contacting the order of his findings he fell asleep and was contacted by a mysterious dark figure in his dreams. This figure convinced him to keep his findings to himself and that his masters care only for the power they can achieve. The King of Souls awoke with a new identity and the lust for power himself. \r\n\r\nFinished with the warlock, The King of Souls sent him back to the order reporting unsuccessful in his research and that he may continue to conduct experiments if the warlock is kept safe. He then set out to recreate the ritual and become immortal. \r\n\r\nHaving everything he needed, he begun the procedure for immortality. Driven by his sudden lust for power, he attempted to amplify the routine which led to his quick and agonizing death. Although it wasn&#039;t quite death. By overloading the ritual of too much raw magic, he became un-dead but still had the thirst for power. He quenched this thirst by consuming live people. He tried to consume the dead but found they were unable to fuel his desire. \r\n\r\nMany tests confirmed his theory that the main difference from the living and the dead was the lack of souls. In time he adapted the ability to extract the souls of the living and consume them to add to his ever-growing power.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, TKS originates from the same &#039;order&#039; as Thresh and has a direct link to him being the one to first &#039;work&#039; with the warlock that was soon transferred into Thresh&#039;s custody. The abilities and/or definitely need some work seeing as though no stats are present for the champion. Hope you enjoyed this idea and feel free to speak you thoughts on it :).","replies":[]}
