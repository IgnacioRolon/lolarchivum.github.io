For my idea we will focus on abilities and the ranges of those particular abilities. I feel it would be interesting if there were a game mode where all skill shot ranges were doubled. This would impact many abilities, skill shot or point and click. For example: Blitzcrank pulls will be twice the range same as Thresh hooks. Twisted Fate&#039;s ultimate would pretty much be global, the same as Tahm Kenches. It may seem a bit far fetched but then both teams will have the ability to chose champs they think would benefit from the buff. There would be a draft pick followed by a blind pick to prevent some over powered champs (maybe like Ezreal) into the match. This is just a thought and I feel like some abilities would have a reduced buff like cone abilities. Riven&#039;s ult goes far enough as it is and if it&#039;s doubled then it will go very far.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-01-09T02:00:37.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:7}} fun","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-08T18:40:55.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that sounds like fun but its too impractical. pretty much you could only pick someone with a skill shot or an ability that had range at all. anyone else like tryndamere would get destroyed through kiting even harder so riot might as well remove him warwick darius shaco shyvana etc. maybe not double the range of everyones abilities but making it further to whatever riot chooses, otherwise xerath will shit on everyone. riven, na i think the overextension of her Q can be a downside, unless its just her 3rd cast, so she can jump over more walls","replies":[]}]}
