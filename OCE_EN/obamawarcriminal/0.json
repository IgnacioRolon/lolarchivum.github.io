It&#039;s barely worth playing anymore.\r\nThey&#039;re immediately obvious, unchanged summoners, names that consist and random numbers and letters like someone bashed the keyboard, the way the just constantly push forward auto attacking, the way they all backoff to stand in specific parts of the map when they&#039;re not in combat.\r\nYet everytime they&#039;re reported Rito claim they&#039;re just new players not bots.\r\n\r\nRito will never ban aram bots. People bot aram to level accounts to sell on ebay. Most people who buy ebay accounts are younger kids. It&#039;s no coincidence the people who buy the most skins are also younger players. See there&#039;s the problem, bots create accounts to be sold, purchased accounts buy skins. Bots = money in ritos pocket.\r\n\r\nSince Rito will never do anything about it, except probably delete this thread, what can we as a player base do about it?\r\nBoycott aram? afk games with bots? there has to be some way we can abuse aram in a way that makes it not profitable for botters to use aram to level accounts","replies":[{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2018-02-15T07:46:59.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use arams to get easy chest lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-15T07:34:16.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, there is no action any of us can take, it is all on riot to fix it.\n\nLet's say all the real people boycotted aram's, then no players would ever play with the bots sure, BUT it would also mean that the bots never get reported AND get better games for bots.\n\nAs for afking, that only ends up getting you the punishment instead of the bot.\n\nThere is no player side solution to boting, it's unfortunate, but it is the case.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ObamaWarCriminal","date":"2018-02-15T07:09:52.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to be clear I'm not saying afking is the best solution. The purpose of this thread is for players to brainstorm their thoughts on how we can deal with them in one easy place rather than everyone starting their own thread with their idea. That way hopefully someone can come up with an idea a lot of people agree on","replies":[]}]}
