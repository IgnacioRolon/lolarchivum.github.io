It gave me 20 minute game restrictions for apparently dodging queues I wasn&#039;t even in.\r\n\r\nNow I&#039;m just stuck in this loop where it says I have to wait 20 minutes before playing a game, then the timer counts down from 20:00 to zero, then as soon as the countdown is finished it pops up with a box saying I&#039;ve been put in a low priority queue for 5 games, then the 20 minute count down starts again. I&#039;ve been trying to queue for over 3 hours now. I&#039;ve watched the 20 to 0 countdown 4 times in a row now but it keeps telling me I&#039;ve got 5 games left of restrictions then just starts the 20 minutes again without ever letting me queue a game. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve submitted 3 support tickets but no reply.\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced this before or have any idea how I can fix it?\r\nI&#039;ve restarted the client, restarted my computer and restarted my router","replies":[{"poster":"ObamaWarCriminal","date":"2017-11-13T10:02:36.570+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://uploads.im/5tcPx.jpg\n\nAgain waited another 20 minutes, the countdown has finished but it doesn't queue for games.
