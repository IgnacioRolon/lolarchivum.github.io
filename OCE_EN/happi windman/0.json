One guy asked in English: can I jg? And he received no response from jg. Then I joined their talking in Chinese because I wanted to get the swap done quickly using my first langue, and the jungler seems  not willing to swap so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.\r\nThen in the game the jg begin inting, trolling and trash talking. I told him he to stop trolling otherwise get 4x report and he replied like: So surprised you actually speak English!\r\nI&rsquo;ve experienced similar cases, so can anyone pls tell me does speaking another language in the game hurt other&rsquo;s feeling?

Cantonese or Mandarin please, they are different things. This is like saying 'American' is a language.\n\n2) OCE is an Oceanic server, not Australian (although that is where it is based). There are many languages spoken in the Oceanic region. There is no such thing as an 'English language OCE server', so stop using that as a point of debate. I know people from all over the world, that speak many different languages, just on my street alone.\n\n3) I've been the 5th on a premade of 4 Chinese (people, not language... see argument #1). I just say, \"speak English or I mute you all\". Problem solved.
