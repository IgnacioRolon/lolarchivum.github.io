Same thing applies to guys, hence Riot now isn't just releasing all males to be muscle freaks like how they used to for nearly every guy champ.\n\nVarying things up a bit is always fun to have.\n\nPlus we have Ezreal and Taric (and a bunch of yordles), can't really hurt to have some female champs who don't match the social expectations can it?\n\nNot to mention your examples, one is pretty much a banshee of some sort and the other isn't even close to being a human, no reason to specifically use human standards.\n\nWho says females can't be badarse, hateful, or whatever though? Well in real world there are some factors that limit these options, but this is a fantasy world we're talking about, so it really shouldn't matter.
