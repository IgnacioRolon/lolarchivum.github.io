You can't just mindlessly build tank, if you don't EFFICIENTLY build tanky, your opponents will just build one or two anti tank items and counter you.

Replace tank with damage and you get the exact same thing.\n\nOr just like playing literally any champ in this game?\n\nYou do realise this type of game has more do it than just pressing buttons right? It's due to people like you who thinks the definition of having skills here is pressing buttons and the fact Riot have no opinions for themselves that the game has been heading down the wrong path for a good long time. \n\nIf you like pressing buttons fast, there is already a genre for that, it's called fighting games.\n\nDon't like tanks doing damage when they build both damage and sustain? How about you build some offense items that have defense instead?\n\nIt's ridiculous to suggest that squishies should be able to survive and live to see another day when running absolutely 0 defense constantly every game like they always do.\n\nAlso most tank items for whatever reason have really subpar gold efficiencies in this game, hence you can't just stack them over and over while expecting some results, it just doesn't work that way. Since 1. the enemy will simply ignore you as you have no presence besides a glorious HP bar and some cc, and 2. your build will just be less than someone who is equally fed and building damage.","replies":[]}]}
