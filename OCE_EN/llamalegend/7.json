We all had exactly 500ms (we were talking over discord so we could talk to each other), our internet was fine, we thought maybe the entire league server had dropped. Me and my other friend left the game to attempt to reconnect but, we were just sent back to the main client screen, the game no longer existed. It wasn&#039;t in our match history either. What happened to this game??","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-06-21T02:58:13.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The server probably had an issue and everyone was DC'd.
