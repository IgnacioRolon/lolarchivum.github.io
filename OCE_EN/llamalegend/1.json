The early game was going pretty fine and all, then our Lucian disconnected. So our thresh requested help so I went down to bot and he went ad thresh and I supported. Our illaoi started telling me &quot;why would you play Ivern hes useless..&quot; which confused me because I thought in a NORMAL game you had the right to play whatever you want heck, a few games ago I went ad Azir and my team was fine with it. Then they started telling the enemy team &quot;report ivern for playing ivern and trolling&quot;, which I wasn&#039;t trolling. Then the rest of the team ganged up on me and tldr, we lost the game. It disturbs me how these people got up me for playing a champ whos apparently useless, which I guess Ivern isn&#039;t that great at the moment but like I said before its a NORMAL game.
