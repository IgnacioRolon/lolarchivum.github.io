I was finally having a good kindred game for once in my life, I was getting ahead doing really well, I was the only one who could fight their fed Kat, anyways, the game is getting real intense and fun, then all the sudden &quot;2000ms&quot;, &quot;attempting to reconnect&quot;, I try quitting and reconnecting, It doesn&#039;t help, then the game crashes so I reconnect again, it crashes again, and by the time It finally started working and I reconnected smoothly, they had just finished of killing our nexus and I was way to behind in levels to do anything, This lost me and my team a very winnable game, and tilted me because the one time I get to play kindred jungle and do well, this just has to happen. :C","replies":[]}
