But for some reason, if I ever want to play my favourite champion, bard in a ranked game, everything falls to pieces. Is it because im a bad bard player? In my more recent bard games, I have vsed a challenger jungle smurf in my gold game so we obviously got stomped. Then in a game our mid laner dced, I had to keep telling the team not to give up because I thought he might come back. I was playing well winning fights with my ults and stuns. Then our mid laner reconnected.\r\n\r\nThats when I proceeded to have long lag spikes (15 seconds) (usually during teamfights) of about 1800ms throughout the rest of the game.\r\nWhen can I play my favourite chimey boy without lag or challenger smurfs?","replies":[]}
