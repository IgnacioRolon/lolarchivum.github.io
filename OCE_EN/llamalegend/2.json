I resawpn after that ending, same thing happens, over and over. I try quitting league the reconnecting, at first I get &quot;unable to connect please check your internet connection and try again&quot; even though my internet was perfectly fine. Eventually I reconnected but the same thing kept repeating, I couldn&#039;t do anything. Finally it stopped after ages of this and at that point, my team surrendered. What is this problem, why is it happening? Am I just really unlucky or is there something wrong with my perfectly fine internet connection? \r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Lumos","date":"2017-03-12T16:44:26.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you have Steam also, worth checking to see if this drops at the same time as this has been happening to myself and flatmates recently","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kamakuzi","date":"2017-03-12T08:05:35.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have been through the same thing, help!","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-03-11T01:23:40.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[{"poster":"LlamaLegend","date":"2017-03-12T05:26:39.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SephirothSG,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=f6h5LrLd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-03-11T01:23:40.149+0000)\n>\n> Hey there,\n> \n> Are you still experiencing this issue?\n\nNo, not at the moment, my last couple of games have been fine.","replies":[]}]}]}
