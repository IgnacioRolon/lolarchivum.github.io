This happened to my friend this morning and he uninstalled league and restarted his PC and it worked, I would try that but my computer is a kettle that im surprised can even run league and it took a long time to install, should I just reinstall overnight or is their a fix?","replies":[{"poster":"Big Mak","date":"2017-09-23T10:14:44.392+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Turn off your discord overlay (settings - overlay) and it fixes.","replies":[{"poster":"Hiverax","date":"2017-09-23T11:29:37.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This indeed seems to fix it, thanks!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miscellania","date":"2017-09-23T19:23:36.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fixed the issue for me as well.
