You can find out more about why from the latest news post:\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/new-client-rollout-phase-2\n\nIf you're experiencing performance issues with the new client, try running it in \"Low spec mode\" which can be enabled from the settings menu.","replies":[]}]}
