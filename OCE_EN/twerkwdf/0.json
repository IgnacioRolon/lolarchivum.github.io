Without them, there isn't much in the way of specifics anyone can give you. \n\nUnless your ticket response came from BlitzBot you are speaking to a human. Tier 1 (first contact) support will often use macro (pre-written) responses if they fit your scenario, though sometimes they don't fully answer your query. Second response will pretty much always be customised.\n\nAs for your actual punishments, the majority of punishments are driven by the Instant Feedback System, which is a [complex automated learning system](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Ifb0rpEJ-riot-should-just-make-a-list-of-banned-words-and-how-not-to-be-condescending). It is in essence a bot, but the false punishment rate (which includes punishments being too harsh or not harsh enough) is extremely low at [just 0.01% of *penalties*](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/oEpXvoXZ-i-typed-these-6-sentences-to-a-raging-adc-and-i-got-banned-for-2-weeks-for-verbal-abuse-riot?comment=00140000000000000001).\n\nSubmitting a ticket report (or appeal) will see a given case manually reviewed, but the automated system has a minuscule inaccuracy rate.\n\nWhat you consider banter, may be well past the line of what other people consider to be such. Given that this is clearly not your first punishment, it should have been made more than clear to you that (whatever your own feelings on the matter) the behaviour you were demonstrating was not acceptable under the community rules. \n\nChat restrictions in particular, are designed as a warning that your behaviour has become problematic, and you need to tone it back or risk further punishment. Even 14-day bans are a warning, just a strong and final one. I can't comment on the behaviour of others, but in the case of your behaviour, what prompted you to ignore these warnings?","replies":[{"poster":"TwerkWDF","date":"2019-05-29T05:43:47.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know people that have legit given it to peoples lives multiple times in game and took the time to add them and trash talk.. they always get hit with a 10 game chat ban or something like that. i got hit with an instant 14 day ban for stuff that isnt honestly worth getting a 10 day chat ban for.. it sucks how soft fairies have the power to ban someone... and i was speaking to BlitzBot.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-29T05:47:11.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you got an instant 14-day ban then it's because you used no tolerance language. The like of racism, homophobia, suicide encouragement, etc.\n\nI would think it would be obvious that such language does not in any form qualify as 'banter'.\n\nBlitzBot tends to only respond in cut and dry cases, like \"I'd like to report this player\" and the bot will respond with \"you already reported this player in post-game\".

Often in the form of jest and joke, used in a friendly manner.\n\nIf you are claiming that your bantering was in the spirit of fun and goes no further than teasing. Why can't you post your chat log, and give explanation as to which negative comment directed at: who, why, and the intention behind it??\n\nShow the people those words that landed you the **TWO **permanent suspension, was indeed jokes, dark humor, ETC... \n\nWhy do you run and run, and insisted on a 1 on 1 conversation privately?

They will only respond once they have come up with a decision and can take anything from a day to a week. Verbal abuse is almost always going to stay as a ban if you are a repeat offender. However ive been banned by a bot in the past for \"inting\" when i just got reported 7 games in the past 20 for playing yuumi and after requesting help i was unbanned in 6 days.","replies":[{"poster":"TwerkWDF","date":"2019-05-29T05:45:55.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have requested to speak to a human for 2 tickets and both cases have been \"solved\". i one game i got reported by 3 of my teammates was a game i accidently banned the champion one of my teammates wanted to play. they abused the crap out of me but im not one to report. i made the mistake, i said \"oh shit mb man\" and i wanted to move on but they kept going. petty things like that are the reason i got banned and its stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-05-29T07:26:14.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You only have 1 ticket open at a time thats why they may have closed it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-05-29T07:03:12.699+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Post your chat log.
