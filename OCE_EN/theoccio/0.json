I'm looking for a clash team who needs a jungle main. Currently I'm Silver 2, but I've only played like 14 ranked games this season.  I ended last season/pre season at high Gold (gold 1 or gold 2). I have a pretty flexible pool, am good natured and a team player. If need be, I could fill support as it is my secondary role. \r\n\r\nIGN: Theoccio\r\nAdd me if you have any questions or think I might be a good fit.","replies":[{"poster":"Dusk","date":"2020-02-21T23:24:02.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shot you an add","replies":[]}]}
