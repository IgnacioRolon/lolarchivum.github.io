I have 2 supports at level 7 but I find its not consistent here&#039;s a few examples:\r\n\r\nS+ with Sona: KDA: 5/5/31 CS: 7 Wards placed: 22 Destroyed: 4 Pinks: 3\r\n\r\nS with Sona: KDA: 0/1/31 CS: 8 Wards placed: 18.

Comparing champions to each other is pointless, as the average Sona player may constantly get worse scores than the average Lulu player, hence you are more likely to get a better rank for Sona than you are for Lulu, even if both the scores were similar.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tìna","date":"2017-04-16T01:59:36.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your main focus should just be assisting your adc and making sure bot lane is healthy, kda should not be important if you are able to achieve objectives such as turrets and dragons. I would say obtaining victories and kill participation scores of above 50% is enough to secure you S. There are different standards for each elo, as what I was told as long as your team performance is better than the enemy team, you should get higher grading.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-04-15T17:02:30.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The S+ Sona game probably lasted less time than the S game, so the two scores, while similar, would be totally different if you consider how they're spread out over the time period. i.e. 22 wards placed in a 25 minute game is better than 18 wards placed in a 30 minute game.\n\nThe easiest way to get more wards is to spam the ward button (provided you have sightstone) whenever you get to base (the wards will instantly refill, so it's not a waste) and at the end of the game. This will easily skew the factors to make it look like you placed 50+ wards in 25 minutes. Of course, you would still need a decent average KDA per minute for that S+.","replies":[]},{"poster":"UndyingBlade","date":"2017-04-15T11:43:08.614+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Destroying wards, warding a lot, getting plenty of assists, if you are an enchanter/heal mitigating a lot of damage from your team/saving their lives (e.g Lulu ulting them when they would have died.) Roaming when necessary will increase the odds, as well as assisting tower kills and epic monsters (?) it can be a bit fickle to get S on supports, it may also rely on your laners kda and how well they went. [Edit, I usually get S on Lulu around 19 assists; 1-3 deaths.]","replies":[{"poster":"A Corpse","date":"2017-04-15T12:04:47.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm doing all that... as my example shows... and yet no s...

Like Aidan said, Lulu is one of the top supports at the moment so the scores you will need to achieve will have inflated greatly. \n\nThat being said, [support grading metric will be changed soon](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2017/04/intro-to-midseason-2017.html#more) with a bunch of new exciting support features!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-04-15T12:06:55.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lulu is pretty strong at the moment so the average performance on lulu is probably better.
