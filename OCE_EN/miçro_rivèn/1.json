This allows player to communicate and disgust strategies when there&#039;s not enough time in the champ select such as talking about an invade.\r\n\r\nAnd Riot, please add a mute player button in champion select as well. A lot of people will also flames and abuse you in the champion select as well. I really hope Riot take those 2 of my suggestions and I believe it will make League a better game.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-22T11:36:19.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"might make it too lagy, could be cool to cover over abilities and keystones in load screen as well maybe even heroes, could make it an option for higher end machines, matchmaking should also take that as a consideration","replies":[{"poster":"Miçro Rivèn","date":"2018-08-02T10:02:45.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"asking riot....","replies":[]}]}]}
