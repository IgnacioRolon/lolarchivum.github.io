I feel one of the things junglers, such as I, in low elo struggle with is knowledge of enemy win conditions or just general matchups and knowledge. \r\nTherefore I feel It would be beneficial to create a document detailing all aspects of each and every champion in terms of their ability when played in a jungling role (yes even the non-meta ones.) I’ve already compiled a list of aspects which I feel are important however am not sure of whether they are all relevant or whether I’m missing other aspects and also I am unsure of what structure/order I should place these things in.\r\nThe list is provided below:\r\n \r\nSusceptibility to counter jungling       \r\nDuelling potential                       \r\nSplit pushing ability\t            \r\nAbility to counter jungle\t         \r\nObjective control                        \r\nDamage output                            \r\nClear speed                              \r\nCrowd control                            \r\nSustain in jungle                        \r\nSusceptibility to wards                  \r\nPre-6 ganking ability                    \r\nWave clear                               \r\nCooldowns                                \r\nMana costs                               \r\nSurvivability                            \r\nBurst                                   \r\nDPS                                      \r\nTeam fight ability                       \r\nEarly game strength                      \r\nMid game strength                        \r\nLate game strength                       \r\nMobility out of combat                   \r\nMobility in combat                       \r\nPopularity in solo queue\r\n          \r\n \r\n                   \r\nI plan to do a fair bit of research regarding these things but if anyone feels they have a fair understanding of any of these aspects in regards to even a single champion perhaps just post and I will add it to the document. \r\nI will also be posting every now and then so that others can see what there is so far and maybe even review for me.\r\nAlso if I’m talking nonsense here and nobody really gives a **** I’m sorry >.>\r\nOh, and any help will be greatly appreciated\r\nThanks :D","replies":[]}
