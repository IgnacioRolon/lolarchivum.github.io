This is because just from the animation videos alone, they tell a story. Imagine a whole movie dedicated just to League?\r\n\r\nThe story line would be really cool to see our favourite characters battle it out or see how there stories link together and to just see in general the lore be exploited. I can already think of really cool movies with my favourite characters and there stories combining together to make one amazing adventure especially with the graphics.","replies":[{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-27T06:39:24.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i reckon they should make it an anime like naruto and one piece so it can be super long and do heaps of different stories. make the main character poppy or smth cause she goes all over runterra looking for the hero to wield the hammer","replies":[{"poster":"gmAXE1001","date":"2018-08-19T21:44:07.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-11T01:38:37.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a lot of different ways that a movie or series could work for LoL. You could have it as Wanderer suggested, and follow a specific character that's been all across Runeterra, or you could have each season dedicated to a specific character, group of characters or faction. You could even have each episode be a short story about an important event in a specific character's life (for example, Quinn losing Caleb and meeting Valor, or Xayah and Rakan meeting for the first time).\n\nAs a movie, it wouldn't necessarily have to try \"cramming in\" all the characters, that would just make it bloated. Rather, it could focus on a specific event that had a large impact on Runterra, such as a conflict between Demacia and Noxus, the War for the Freljord, the Vastayan \"Rebellion\", or the Harrowing (just for example, from my understanding of the lore). There's many possibilities to make it work.\n\nThat said, I honestly don't think something like that would be a good idea with the current state of the lore/game. They need to have their priorities, and at this point that should be making the game better and fleshing out the lore, not trying to put together a movie/show for the sake of \"fan service\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-07-10T13:48:01.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't get how you could tell a story with 130+ different champions, from like 8 different regions, in one movie.\n\nIt's cool in theory, but not on paper. An animated series would work better - but I doubt it'll ever happen.","replies":[]}]}
