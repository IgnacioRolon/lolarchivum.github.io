I used to main support back in my NA days, but since going to OCE I've had to brave solo queues and whatnot, so I transitioned from support to jungle. Last season I was stuck in silver 2 for most of my time. Right now I'm currently in s3, up for my s2 promos. The problem that I'm having is that I'm consistently going positive, yet I'm still losing many of my games. I try so hard to try and rank up but it never seems to happen. I have played games with players in higher ranks and they definitely do play the game differently to the way that I and people in my division do. You're unable to learn to do anything different when you're in games where the same thing keeps happening. By this I mean if I was placed in diamond, I would eventually learn how to play like a diamond player. I've been placed in silver and I can't get out, so I want to know how do I get this ball rolling? \r\n\r\nThanks. Additionally, if a higher ranked player was willing to give me tips and play some games with me I'd greatly appreciate that :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lika SunRyze","date":"2015-03-21T05:04:43.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One way you can improve is to watch the pros and there commentators they sometimes give you some handy tips. Otherwise just get a replay software and watch your matches again, find your mistakes and improve on them","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T17:35:43.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to be the game changer...change is always good.. like mutation and evolution.. even if you loose or fail at something new you will learn something .. but if you keep doing the same thing then you will just be the same :) \n\nIt is worth to try new things and fail then to be stuck in same place","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-03-22T01:25:53.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing with getting better about league is most people don't understand how to get better, people think \"if I master this champion  I'll win games\" yeah sick mate, no you won't. You need to understand how the map works, you need to understand how objectives work, how item leads work, when can you fight, when do you play defensive, where do I ward, when can I close out a game, what is my win condition, where is the jungler on the map, where can I push the next tower, etc etc, there is so much more to this game than just controlling the champion you're playing, I play a mechanically very simple champion and I can win most of my game simply by playing the map mechanically, not my champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daen","date":"2015-03-20T20:29:47.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny.  From my experience, once you have a solid grasp of mechanics and knowledge, it's actually a little easier to play against high level opponents than it is to play against lower ranks.  Higher level players are more consistent and more predictable, so it's easier to take advantage of certain things.  You never have any idea what the hell people are going to do in lower levels, and it definitely makes for a more...volatile experience.\n\nI would honestly say that playing with people both way better *and way worse* than you is really helpful.  Better is self-explanatory, obviously, but when you play with people less skilled you really have to get into a carry mindset.  A lot of solo queue is about hard carrying your team, and one way to work on that is in games where you are consistently and intentionally outmatched.  \n\nTo clarify this:  I mean play with people *on your team* that are worse than you.  Ideally, the other team would be equal to or higher than your skill level so it's a real struggle.  I don't recommend stomping low level games, because you won't learn anything.\n\nI completely agree that it's tough to improve when you're constantly playing with people of your exact skill level.  You have to get out of the comfort zone ranked play forces you into and really grind through a bunch of edge case scenarios.  Watch streams and montages with your favorite champions, try to watch replays of yourself, do whatever you can to remove yourself from the \"everyone is the same level as me\" mindset.\n\nI don't play on OCE at the moment due to the whole living in North America thing, unfortunately, but I'd play with you if I did.  I hope someone else offers!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-21T02:45:58.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You never have any idea what the hell people are going to do in lower levels, and it definitely makes for a more...volatile experience.\n\nYeah there are so many times i'm like \"Is this guy baiting me or just retarded?\" whereas in higher play i could probably assume i'm being baited (or the baiting won't be so obvious.\n\nI'm not higher ranked *currently* (9 win streak in ranked and 4LP off a promo to S2) but i'd still be willing to play a few games, i just don't duo because it tends to make the game stupidly harder unless you know for sure that you and the duo could carry people against people several divisions up.","replies":[]}]}]}
