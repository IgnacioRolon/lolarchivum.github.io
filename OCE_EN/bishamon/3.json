Im having the same issue, i can not connect to your game, your \"download game\" link, OR your ticket link. Its something to do with not being able to connect with the maestro.. or something?\nIt says its a firewall/antivirus/not connected to internet issue, thats not right though. Iv turned off firewall and antivirus, still just brought me to the unable to connect page. I have 12.6 mbps internet and every other web page loads perfectly. I think its something to do with a DNS port being closed to rito or something to do with the new patch. I have no idea how to fix it though, iv had the same problem for 3 days (since new patch came out).","replies":[{"poster":"Respect Women","date":"2015-01-19T06:35:46.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually it says something more to do with an encryption file but this is what it showed this time.

Either your PC, router, or ISP's DNS server is caching old records for longer than usually acceptable and this makes it impossible for you to connect to any of our domain names.\n\nThere are solutions for each, but the easiest is to configure your PC or router to use Google DNS. Instructions [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4).\n\nOtherwise, if you know how, you can lower the TTL of the DNS records on your router or run a /flushdns on your PC, but these will only work if either of them is the source of the issue respectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Respect Women","date":"2015-01-21T10:23:54.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Btw heres that other SS.
