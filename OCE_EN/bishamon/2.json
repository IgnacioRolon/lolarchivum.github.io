It happened to these guys [here](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/ZmXXeh4W-placedhigher-than-i-ended-last-season). But it completely depends on what games you win, and the MMR of the players in those games. Just winning 8/10 placements doesn't guarantee anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Bishamon","date":"2018-01-17T14:08:28.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea i mean i'd do good too on my placements haha \nthank you :) i thought riot would remove the mmr stuff and still force and give u lower rank","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nibleggi","date":"2018-01-28T12:01:46.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got placed in to gold 4 in flex and I was barely gold 5 last season.
