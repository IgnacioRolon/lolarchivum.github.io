They have made this entire game a wet noodle slapping contest where there are long boring farming periods and then you have team fights that last minutes. This game just isn&#039;t fun any more, especially with the community. Now ranking isn&#039;t about having a good time and competing to try and rank up, it&#039;s just entering the game and getting flamed at for missing minions. I cannot win any more because the way that people play and people tilt because of people who just flame. It doesn&#039;t actually help anyone and the game is already boring enough. Playing league is almost asking to get flamed at for playing a game. Not only is the community rotten, we have no way of stopping them either since its just a bunch of stuck up kids, which we cannot ban because we have no tribunal. I&#039;m starting to believe that OCE does not have a tribunal purely because of the fact that we would lose over half our player base because of bans once it is released. Riot. Please change the meta back to when it took skill to play. That&#039;s when this game was fun. Right now you&#039;re just focusing too much on how you guys can make money and everything sounds good to you. So you just change it to suit the people who make the money for you. Think of the general player base too. Don&#039;t just change the meta based on what pro players play. But still, thank you for releasing possibly one of the best games I&#039;ve played in my life. Therefore please make it the best game again because I&#039;m sure that right now, there are definitely better games out there.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-04-09T15:07:23.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is not a single server at all with a Tribunal because they took it away in order to develop the new Tribunal.\nIt was also announced that OCE along with every other server will be getting the new Tribunal all at the same time.\n\nRiot have no influence on the meta directly, you know what controls the meta? What champions become popular at the time.\nRemember when everyone was complaining about Morgana last year? Yeah, you know why she became popular?\n\nBECAUSE OF LEONA! And Leona because popular because of Thresh.\n\nThe meta shifts and changes all the time based on what champions counter what champions. At the moment there is a lot of champions running around that do % health based damage and have super strong kiting potential. This is because of the recent tank hype.\nI don't know about you, but I've missed seeing consistent tank play. I've barely seen any tanks played in League since season 2. It's great that they are finally back.\n\n\n\nThe meta is driven by the community, and what the community makes popular. You want a game without meta? Go play HoS.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iNoob","date":"2015-04-09T15:34:23.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who says you follow the meta?
