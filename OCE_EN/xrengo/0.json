Had a shit day and someone triggered \r\nme pretty awfully tbh. Then to randomly see I got perma banned is pretty crappy, I was expecting a 2 week or something suspension when i randomly got Dc&#039;d. We all have bad days. \r\n\r\nI really want an Riot employee to properly review the logs and see how hard the aggressor triggered myself and my other team mates. \r\nAs a Law Student, I wrote an essay about the lack of an appeals process in League of Legends both for amateur and professional level. To see money etc,\r\ngo to waste without being at least able to justify some things and give context is pretty crappy.\r\n\r\nI know im going to get memed pretty hard lol, but just hoping someone actually helps out here. \r\n\r\nACC: xRengo","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-23T11:00:55.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a couple options here, you can either post your chat logs from your reform card here on the boards for us to look at, or you can appeal the ban through support [HERE](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nTo explain a little, rarely will you be perma banned for a single offense. Punishment is typically done in 4 steps:\n\n10 game chat restriction\n25 game chat restriction\n14 day account ban\nPermanent account ban\n\nExcept in extreme cases such as hate speech and death threats (or consistent gameplay abuse or cheating) you will receive them in order. It takes 3 months to drop one tier.\n\nBe aware though that a punishment won't be revoked unless it is done in error.\n\nYou can find more info about the systems in place here, maybe it'll help some:\n- [Player Behaviour FAQ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback)\n- [Reportable Behaviour](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q1)\n- [Bans Without Warnings](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/nu6A0TNn-perma-banned?comment=0003)\n- [Intent Feeding and Extreme Cases](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/oH6zB1eg-detecting-and-banning-extreme-intentional-feeders)","replies":[{"poster":"xRengo","date":"2016-03-23T11:24:00.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So permanent is only 3 months?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-23T11:36:37.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perma ban is permanent. For the three months, if you are where your next punishment will be a 14 day ban (so you've just had a 25 game chat rest) then if you demonstrate good behaviour for three months your next punishment will be a 25 game chat restriction, hence the dropping a tier.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
