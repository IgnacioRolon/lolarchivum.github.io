This build burns mana fast but he does so much damage and he kites even better than his blue build like this.\n\nHis ap build is kinda fun in midlane too, taking the classic midlane mage runes: ap quints, magic pen reds, scaling hp yellows, 3 flat magic resist and 6 scaling cdr blues:\n{{item:3100}} {{item:3116}} {{item:3285}} {{item:3115}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3020}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-01T00:09:14.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remove BT imo.
