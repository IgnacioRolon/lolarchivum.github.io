From what has been observed, if Talk has three stacks on an enemy and an ally uses their ultimate on them, but Talm Kench trys to devour the enemy, everyone gets disconnected and cannot resume play for a while.\r\n\r\nDuring our first game, Malzahar was suppressing a Darius, and I attempted to Devour the Darius. He died before i could eat him, but the game decided to walk me up to their fountain and upon arrival everyone was Disconnected. We could not resume the game as &quot;The client is unable to connect to the Server&quot; I was only able to reconnect during the post game results screen.\r\n\r\nDuring the second game, a Zyra had used her Ultimate, however a Yasuo had managed to knock her up and was in the process of using his Ultimate. I attempted to devour her midair and the attempt failed. Talm just stood there and did nothing, followed by our party being Disconnected.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-19T23:20:31.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat definitely sounds like a serious bug if its reproducible, however you've posted it on the wrong board.
