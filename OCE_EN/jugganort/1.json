I am guessing that English is not their first language, as the English in this post is atrocious. \n\nWe could send the author on a top tier ESL (English as a second Language) to help the author out. Maybe if we had some money left over we could buy an electronic dictionary for the author, as well as computer training in the use of MS Word and it&#039;s features in terms of both spell checking and Grammar.\n\nAnyway it was just a thought. I would hate for the author to continue to embarrass themselves any further.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-10-15T03:48:04.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any specific feedback on the article that you'd like me to pass forward to the team?","replies":[]}]}
