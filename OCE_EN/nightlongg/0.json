Cause I can&#039;t seem to find it and there doesn&#039;t seem to be anything about it on the open beta FAQ page. If it&#039;s not, approximately when will it be updated? Cause I might just stick with legacy client if that&#039;s the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-13T01:05:35.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Short answer, no.\n\nLong answer, no specific ETAs on features that haven't yet been introduced to the new client, we will simply have to wait and see. That said, we will more than likely be updated once a new feature is being/is about to be pushed through.","replies":[]}]}
