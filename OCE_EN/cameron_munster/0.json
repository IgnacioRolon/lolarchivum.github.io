We know it was sold because 3 of us were on our account spamming the account and he (or she) said he bought it over pay pal for 100 NZD and didnt know it was stolen. He then back pedaled and was saying that he bought it off a friend and was just joking.... If Riot are able to go through chat logs they can go through and read it all. The owner jumped on and had a few words to him so you cant really blame him for saying a few nasty things lol... \r\nThe owner has tried to open a ticket but gets the same error every time \r\n&quot;NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION&quot; \r\nSummoner! We will do our very best to recover you account, but we need you to provide us with a few extra details in this form. Please fill out what you can to the best of your ability. Any information is better than none in this case :) \r\nHe has tried making 5 tickets now even on different computers and gets the same error every time even though he is filling out ALL the available questions. If any riot employees could help ASAP he said to get in contact with this account. Can provide 2 other accounts that will be able to help with information \r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-05-24T03:11:12.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I talked with the team that manages this website and they're certain that if your friend had entered information in all the available fields then the ticket would have been submitted successfully.\nIf you're still having trouble submitting the ticket, could you please send a screenshot of the completed submission page to ocelivereports@riotgames.com and I'll take a look.","replies":[{"poster":"Cameron Munster","date":"2016-05-24T08:27:18.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man sorry I made a comment but not a reply, first time poster so I'm a forum noob..

This is the owner of the account that got hacked, I'm just borrowing my room mates account to post this comment. I ended up trying to submit a ticket on my phone and praise the lord it actually worked. But for some reason wasn't working on 3 computers last night...? I answered the questions short and quick thinking it wouldn't work but surely there is enough evidence that the account has been hacked. The person on the account has talked to 5 people on my friends list explaining that he has bought the account and didn't know it was a stolen account (but still refuses to give it back.) My ticket number is #2180636 if that helps with anything. \nCheers again for your help :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-24T03:18:16.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support is his best bet with this kind of issue. Submitting more tickets WILL NOT HELP HIS CASE. It will in fact hurt it. Submitting more tickets, or adding more info before receiving a reply will bump the ticket back to the bottom of the queue and it will only take longer to get responses. \n\nAny information that is not found by looking at the account is useful, e.g First skins he bought, the value of his first RP transaction, first champion/s bought a specific date you bought x skin, paypal or bank transaction statements they still have. Any information of this kind they can give to support is useful, the questions support gives are guides, and you don't strictly have to answer all of them, just enough that support has good faith in the true ownership of the account.\n\nAnything the person who stole or the person who bought the account can find is NOT HELPFUL, e.g anything in the 30 day purchase history, champions/skins owned, masteries obtained. \n\nIf support is saying not enough information it's safe to say they don't have enough information to verify ownership of the account, and they need more.","replies":[]}]}
