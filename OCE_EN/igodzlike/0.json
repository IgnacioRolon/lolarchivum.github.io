In Queensland we have a law called \" Life of purchase \" meaning if you spent money on your account. You paid money with a idea of how long you will have access to that item and so on.\n\nCheck the laws and contact the support with the law and actions you want to happen. If they do not do as requested you have the right to take it even higher by contacting the ombudsman.\n\nAfter that you can take it even higher by contacting the minister for ACCC to have the issue resolved. After which you should contact a lawyer about legal rights you have and and so on. \n\nHope this helps. Remember if you live in Aus. ACCC PROTECTS YOU FROM STUFF LIKE THIS!\n\nP.S\n\nEULA/ToS\n\nCan be by passed by the feeling of paying money for a item. Meaning you will always agree to them because you have invested money into it.\n\nP.SS\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1a1ojlgyJQ&index=2&list=PLm9MoTQ-chADxF9-jt-2N38wDrirNdv03\n\nPlayed list for ACCC laws.

I understand what you are trying to say. The idea of the programmer was just a point of reference. \n\nThe ToS and so on become pointless once the need out weights the rational thinking. So with this in mind.\nThey will always click Yes no matter what due to the financial investment they have made. So this will fall under Undue Influence and Duress. \nSince both imply a pending doom for a out come. The customer will feel the need to retain some kind of control. \n\nPlease do not get me wrong here. What happen on his/her account and so on. That is on him / her.\n\nBut the facts still stand. \n\nOnce a investment has been made. The time of that investment is to be up held. I buy a skin today to customize my champion that I play. I expect the availability of this skin to be available until either I choose never to play this game again or the company Riot has chosen to close the game servers down for ever.\n\nOnce this is not met... I am left with the idea of not having service delivered to me by the company and/or the sellers of the item { in this case. Customized skin for my champion }\nSo at this point. \n\nThey have fallen in breach of  \n\" Non-delivery of products & services \"  \n\" Misleading claims & advertising \" \n\" Consumer guarantees \"\n\" Compensation for damages & loss \"\n\" Repair, replace, refund \"\n\" Consumer protection \"\n\" Warranties \"\n\" 'No refund' signs and expired warranties \"\n\nJust to name a few. The bylaws that can be found once looking further into them. Will allow anyone to say \" I clicked Yes to ToS and EuA because I have invested a lot of time and money into this \"\n\nI am not a lawyer. I am not claiming to be one. I am just someone that has gone down this road with bigger companies than Riot. \nThis is why I know you can go down this path way.\n\n\nBut as I said before I will say again.\n\nCall your local member, Call the Ombudsman, Call the ACCC and contact a lawyer. It is a lot easier then you think. \nPeople that live in AUSTRALIA have rights.
