Sweat drenched the clothing of the team of men as they laboured on the jungle edge hacking and slashing the underbrush, while two men with axes where dismembering a newly felled tree. The rhythmic timing of their axe falls making short work of it. The now manageable portions of the tree  being dragged and loaded into a series of wagons with the aid of a shaggy old donkey.  Overseeing the whole operation from the back of a wagon sitting atop the haphazardly loaded timbers was one man. A wide brimmed straw hat atop his head. As the last length of trunk was being loaded into his wagon one the men with an axe walked over and while crouching in the shade of the wagon addressed the man sitting atop. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Which one next boss?&rdquo; he said with laboured breath while wiping his brow. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;That big thick one that jerry and Adam are clearing around now&rdquo; he said pointing over in the trees direction.  \r\n\r\nThe crouching man nodded in acknowledgement \r\n\r\n&ldquo;How much are we looking to take for today?&rdquo; he asked\r\n\r\n&ldquo;When we have all the wagons full we&rsquo;ll call it a day&rdquo; \r\n\r\nFrom his crouched position he could see two more wagons still to be filled and groaned while having a second attempt at mopping the sweat from his face. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I know bobby&rdquo; said the man from atop the wagon. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like working at the ass end of the world any more than you do, But where getting paid to clear this jungle back and at the same time I&rsquo;ve got craftsman in Demacia, Noxus, hell even Ionia who are really interested in working with these exotic southern jungle timbers. So we are gonna be making really nice coin here, and as far as I can see there no shortage of jungle so we could have a really good thing going here&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nStanding back up bobby nodded his head in agreement \r\n\r\n&ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for this dam heat it would be easy money&rdquo; he hefted his axe and started trotting off to the next tree. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Wait a second&rdquo; said his boss gesturing him back. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;When did you last see tom, he&rsquo;s supposed to be helping clear the underbrush with the others but I can&rsquo;t see him&rdquo; \r\n\r\nBobby thought for a moment \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen tom for over an hour boss, not since he went to go get some water for Betsy&rdquo; said bobby pointing over to the donkey.  \r\n\r\nThe bosses face darkened like a thunder cloud\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I told that boy that if I caught him slacking off one more time he would regret it. \r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Get a few of the boy&rsquo;s together bobby for a little break. Well go find tom and he&rsquo;d wanna be working hard when we find him, and not asleep under a shady tree somewhere or he&rsquo;s gonna get a rough awakening&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe prospect of a break from the sweltering sun was an easy sell and it didn&rsquo;t take long before bobby had recruited jerry, Adam and the other axe man Shaun to the bosses search party\r\n\r\nGrouped on the jungles edge he addressed the small party.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Bobby you stay here and keep the rest of the guys on task ok. The rest of you spread out a little and move quietly ok? I wanna catch tom red handed slacking off. That way we can show him what happens when you put your work on the rest of the crew.&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe boys nodded in agreement, spread out a few metres and ducked into the jungle. \r\n\r\nUnder the high canopy of the jungle roof the sun was absent making it far cooler than outside and the band of men made quick progress into the jungle towards the small stream. All manner of strange plants filled the jungle interior, flowers and ferns of all colours and shapes to thick vines and towering trees that reached tall into the sky soaking up the sunlight greedily. The deeper the men pushed the more bizarre the flora became, tho there were none of the colourful birds that squawked and fought with each other incessantly like on the jungle edge, even the low constant hum of a thousand unseen insects was gone. Tho none of the men could put their finger on it, the eerie calm accept for the breeze in the leaves was off putting.   \r\n\r\nThe soft trickle of running water helped the search party locate the direction of the stream. The tight jungle interior devoid of any meaningful land marks had left the party of men wandering aimlessly for a while. Exactly how long was difficult to say under the gloom of the high jungle canopy. As the party grew close to the stream the boss caught their attention with silent hand gesture bringing them all to a stop fanned out on either side of him. It only took a moment for them to realise why. A wicked grin splitting his face he held up a bucket, wiggling it ever so slightly back and forward he pointed through the dense under growth towards the stream.  The men closed the last few metres like a hunting wolf pack, slow and carefully creeping in the underbrush to get a look at their quarry without startling it. A few metres spacing between each of them allowed them to cover a large swathe of jungle as to trap there target whichever way he might try to escape.  \r\n\r\nIn the small clearing a figure was sitting on the stream edge, their feet dangling in the cool water. Even in the poor light tho it was evident that it was not tom but a woman.  She appeared to be naked if not for the leaves and vines that hugged her form and wreathed her body snugly. A mess of wild red hair cascaded down her back halting just above the ground trailing in the wild flowers that sprung up throughout the clearing.  \r\n\r\nBaffled by the turn of events Shaun moved his weight in an attempt to get a better view in the poor light. A soft crunch under his foot tho drew his attention. The tiny skeleton of a bird lay engulfed on the jungle floor. He looked at it for a moment before spreading his gaze of around the immediate jungle.  It suddenly became so clear to him, all around them the jungle was growing so strong and so thick he hadn&#039;t even realised the change, now tho he saw the skeletons. Hundreds of skeletons of all shapes and sizes some bearing talons and fangs that could only be from ferocious tiger like beasts, others the likes of which he had never seen nor could he imagine what they would have looked like had they not been stripped of all flesh and fur and skin.  The skeletons suddenly stuck out like grizzly trophies hanging all around them and the deathly silence of the jungle closed in on him from all sides.  He turned his gaze back to the woman at the streams edge, suddenly breaking out into a cold sweat despite the humid conditions. \r\n\r\n &ldquo;Something is wrong here&rdquo; dominated his stricken thoughts  \r\n\r\nHe began to ease back out of the undergrowth not daring to, and perhaps unable to tare his gaze from the lone woman. His blood froze in his veins as she spoke suddenly, her words filled the clearing and carried beyond, but she wasn&rsquo;t addressing the band of men.  She seemed to address a crowd and an intimate friend at the same time tho he could spot no one else.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, he did say more would come to find him&rdquo; she said still dangling her feet in the cool stream with her back to the men. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Such a feast is rare now days, tho leave me one, good conversation is so hard to find.&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nUnable to bear another word Shaun broke free of the undergrowth and made for the logging grounds but barley a handful of steps into his escape the forest floor gave way to a giant spongy leaf. The leaf contracted swooping him off his feet and into the mouth of colossal flute shaped plant. The mouth clamped down on the top half of his body leaving his flailing legs kicking futilely out the top.    \r\n\r\nThis time it was the boss&rsquo;s turn to burst out from the undergrowth. Seeing the entire spectacle of Shaun&rsquo;s escape he rushed to his aid drawing his machete as he ran.  The jungle burst into life around him as he ran, vines surged from all directions. Swinging his machete desperately he tried to fight his way to Shaun his kicking legs beginning to slow, but to no avail the vines twisted around his arms and legs pulling him into the air effortlessly. The tangle of vines now holding their boss aloft began pulling in all directions, before his cries of pain reached their gory crescendo the two remaining men, jerry and Adam made a break for their lives. Jerry ran under the suspended taut body of his still screaming boss while the vines where busy with him. Adam ran directly away from the concluding madness deeper into the jungle but only made a few metres when the spines of a tall thin tree ruptured out like shrapnel as he brushed past it. His eyes and face swelling and froth forming at his mouth, he fell onto the soft jungle earth writhing in pain, tho the toxins stopped his heart mercifully quick. \r\n\r\nJerry didn&rsquo;t look back as he charged through the jungle the cries of his friends swallowed up by the beating of his heart and rapid breathes. He punched through a leafy shrub at full speed only to feel his body sliced at the very touch of the shrubs razer like leaves, he fell heavily onto the ground on the other side blood streaming from his ruined arms and torso. He lay there for a moment, the pain wrestling the adrenaline for control over his body.  That&rsquo;s when he heard it, the rustling in the fallen leaves. He glanced back towards the stream and saw the thick vines snaking towards him, wrapping around his legs they dragged him back towards the sound of the stream. The pain of his shredded arms and torso fled from his mind as he flipped over onto his stomach in a desperate attempt to hold his ground, but he couldn&rsquo;t break free of the vines grip, his fingers leaving little furrows in the soft dirt as he struggled.  \r\n\r\nBob looked up at the sun, it had moved considerably since the boss and the others had left to find tom.  He looked around; the remaining men had worked well. It wouldn&rsquo;t be long before the last cart would be full and they could head back to camp.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Probably got lost on their way back from the stream&rdquo; he thought  \r\n\r\nA few minutes later he had gathered the remaining men to him on the jungle edge.\r\n \r\n&ldquo;Ok boys seems like the boss and the others got lost in there&rdquo; bobby paused, the chuckles and laughs of the other workmen interrupting him.\r\n&ldquo;once we find them we are good to head back to camp and two days rest while the boss meets up with his market connections, so spread out a little bit and keep your eyes and ears open. Ok?&rdquo; \r\n\r\n The men all nodded and murmured in agreement, spread out a few metres, and ducked into the jungle.","replies":[]}
