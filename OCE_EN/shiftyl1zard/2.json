The doors slid open, and a man exited smoothly. His high boots rasped on the hard polished floors as he strode through the foyer to the next room. The door stood ajar, the flickering and flashing of lights could be seen through the threshold accompanied by hushed voices and a hectic commotion.  \r\n\r\nA solid crack brought the room to a standstill as the new comer brought a great, vaguely hammer like instrument to rest behind him onto the hard floor, a soft crackling escaping from within. Even with several flash-lights the large room was gloomy almost empty and unimportant if it wasn&#039;t for an enormous steel vault door that took up the entire wall. The new comer stood admiring the work of the frozen men for a painfully long moment before speaking. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yea I don&rsquo;t think this is going to cut it guys&rdquo; he spoke engaging the entire group before him, his even voice rolling through the silent room like thunder.\r\n\r\n &ldquo;Literally, I really doubt you&rsquo;re going to be able to cut through that with four, what I&rsquo;m going to assume are explosive devices. Tho id agree those are the weakest points on the door, but you&rsquo;re going to need a whole lot of bang to get through it&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe men shot nervous glances to each other in confusion.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You&#039;ve got 4 devices of obviously Zaunish origin, so there&rsquo;s no standardisation or uniformity.&rdquo; a wry smile split his chiselled features as he stated this fact clearly unimpressed. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Which makes it really hard for me to calculate how much energy they could generate, but if you give me a second, I can probably give you a rough idea off the top of my head. Usually id need paper and pen for this, so give me a second.  \r\n\r\nThe crew remained frozen, none daring make a sound or sudden movement as if it might cause the unexpected interloper to pounce. A few where giving each other nervous looks, unsure of what was happening, but most simply stood dumbfounded at the stranger&rsquo;s bravado and apparent lack of concern for the whole situation. \r\n\r\nTrue to his word the interloper began muttering to himself quietly while counting on his hands slowly. Convoluted and intricate phrases bordering on nonsensical such as &ldquo;polar energy distribution&rdquo;, &ldquo;crystal energy fragmentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;theoretical flux load&rdquo; escaped the strangers in-depth analysis. \r\n\r\nA tall wiry gangster with an irksome look on his face pushed effortlessly to front of the group, tho his boots made almost no sound on the floor when he walked; the long leather coat he wore gave off the stink of oil, grease and a multitude of acrid but unknowable scents that preceded him. \r\n\r\nHe cleared his throat in an attempt to gain the attention of the solo figure before him, whom was now lost in calculations and shaped charge explosive theory, to no avail. His patience now wore through and he spoke loud and menacingly. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe stranger looked up like a scuttle crab in a light binding. A little taken aback by being so forcibly addressed, as if he forgot about the group of men shuffling uncomfortably in front of him, he straitened back to his full considerable height while tucking a tiny yellow notebook that only a moment before he had been hunched over struggling to read in the poor light back into his fur lined coat. \r\nThe lead gangster maintained his momentum speaking in his direction again. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Why are you here right now?&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nHolding the gangsters gaze steadily he spoke with simple assurance. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to making a citizen&rsquo;s arrest&rdquo; he withdrew a bundle of heavy zip ties from his belt as he spoke. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;If you could direct your men to kneel with their hands behind their back so I can secure their hands and feet peacefully, I would really appreciate it&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe strangers every passing word caused visible irritation for the head mobster. They held each other&rsquo;s stare for a moment before he responded. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Alright boys, let&rsquo;s put him down fast we don&rsquo;t have time for this&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe call for violence returned the other gangsters confidence, as they quickly armed themselves with all manner of weapons they had concealed on them. Daggers and knifes of a multitude of wicked designs and shapes where slipped from belts and boots, knuckle dusters where pulled from pockets, one gangster unleashed his belt which turned out to be a length of heavy chain, another revealed a section of heavy metal piping that he had picked up somewhere. \r\n\r\nWithout flinching the lone stranger reached one hand back grasping the long shaft of his hammer. In a single smooth motion he brought it spinning around him in a tight arc coming to rest in front of him in a two handed grip. With a slight flick of his wrist the head of the hammer burst into action sliding and rotating swiftly to reconfigure, revealing a crackling energy core.  \r\n\r\nThe gangsters arrayed in a semi circle facing the newly armed stranger where completely surprised by the newly revealed weapon, with none of them willing to step forward to start the impending brawl.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who are you man?&rdquo; managed one awed gangster.\r\n\r\n &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been doing a lot of this sort of thing lately, so that&rsquo;s a valid question.&rdquo; He responded utterly calm and confidently.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jayce, and you&rsquo;re all under arrest&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nThe gang surged forward at some silent command or hidden signal preparing to surround the outnumbered Jayce and bludgeon him, if he was lucky into unconsciousness.  A trilogy of shots issued forth from the crackling core flooring the closest gangsters heavily. With another flick of the wrist jayce&rsquo;s weapon seamlessly collapsed back to its original hammer form ready for melee. \r\n\r\nThe first gangster came in fast with the pipe ready to strike, utilising the hammers reach jayce unleashed a massive two handed strike that plucked the attacker off his feet and sailing into the vault door with a hollow metallic thud. A moment later jayce was mobbed by the thugs. One at a time he flattened and parried them away using not only the heavy head of his hammer but also deftly using the long shaft just as effectively to revere strike anyone coming from behind. One last remaining thug came into to attack, this one swinging a length of chain. Jayce brought his hammer in low and fast, extending it in a one handed grip using the moment of the strike to keep it controlled, and swept the gangsters legs out from underneath him, regaining his hammer into his two handed grip he brought the shaft down into him ribs to finish him off.  He spun slowly checking to see if any threats remained and found the wiry leader standing opposite him across the room, they stood in silence eyeing each other up. Jayce spun his hammer in his hands slowly waiting to see the mobsters move.  Suddenly the gang leader plunged his hand into his long coat. Jayce&rsquo;s reaction was immediate, throwing the weight of his hammer skywards and driving upwards into a huge leap, he covered the distance to the lead gangster rapidly and as he brought his hammer down from over his head in a decisive blow, he saw the strange glowing gun being drawn from beneath his opponents filthy coat, but the weapons length made it awkward to draw quickly and the end snagged momentarily in his coat. It was the only moment jayce needed and he brought his hammer down, smashing him fair in the chest sending him sliding across the polished floor unconscious. The green glowing weapon sliding out of his hand and onto the floor, where it sat humming softly. \r\n\r\n All around jayce mobster&rsquo;s where regaining their feet and weapons, preparing for round two. They received a solid beating but these men where no strangers to brawling. A flick of the wrist transitioned the hammer back open revealing the crackling core again. He spun the head up into the air and drove the shaft down into the floor. Looping arcs of electricity surged from the core unchecked lashing everything around him in a blinding display of the hammers potential.  \r\n\r\nThe ding of the elevator heralded the arrival of the handling officer for this case, as she stepped out a junior officer with a clipboard immediately greeted her.\r\n  \r\n&ldquo;officer Vi everything is going smoothly here we should be done in no time&rdquo;  he seemed confident but his profuse sweating despite the chilled air inside spoke otherwise, not a detail that Vi missed in the single moment she had been there. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Give me the details&rdquo; she barked, not breaking stride she continued on through the foyer towards the crime scene, ducking under the police tape at the door.  \r\n\r\nThe junior officer matching her pace began summarising from the clipboard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Seems to be an attempted robbery, upon reaching the scene officers found the 8 would be thief&rsquo;s kneeling in the room there hands and feet zip tied&rdquo; \r\n\r\nVi surveyed the scene quickly as she pondered what she had just heard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So they surrendered themselves?&rdquo; she asked unconvinced \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Not quite&rdquo; the junior officer replied leafing through the clipboard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;They claim that they were attacked and over powered by a mystery assailant who then detained them and contacted the police&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;hmm that&rsquo;s an interesting story, it was just a single person?&rdquo; replied Vi a cheeky grin working its way onto her face. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, a man with a...&rdquo; the junior officer hesitated for a moment.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hammer cannon&rdquo; he finished sounding less than convinced as he quoted the report.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well then if we have the entire gang accounted for and spread between lock up and the hospital, what are you so nervous about?&rdquo;  Probed Vi \r\n\r\n&ldquo;we are still waiting for an expert to arrive to de-arm the explosives on the vault, there definitely some sort of Zaunish contraptions by the look of them, I&rsquo;m just a little nervous being so close&rdquo;  stammered the officer trying not to look at the blinking haphazard domes clamped to the vault door. \r\n\r\nVi considered this for a moment before responding\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Alright evacuate the building, I don&rsquo;t want any one in or out until that expert has a look, tho I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they turn out to be nothing but garbage on the inside. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for Zaun to sell fake and counterfeit tech to each other&rdquo;   \r\n\r\nAs Vi and the last group of police where  exiting the front of the tower she saw sheriff Caitlin arriving onto the scene and bee lined to her no doubt she would want to hear her report.  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What happened&rdquo; asked Caitlin \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Jayce is back in the game&rdquo; stated Vi cheekily \r\n\r\n&ldquo;So reckless that man, mark my words he will get himself killed one day, He should leave this to the professionals. What&rsquo;s going on then, why is everyone out front? Sounds like this should be an open and shut case? &rdquo; asked Caitlin \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Waiting on the explosive expert to arrive and deactivate the vault busters that they strapped to the door, I wouldn&#039;t worry tho, they got some Zaunish garbage. Probably couldn&#039;t open a paper ba...&rdquo; \r\n\r\nVi couldn&rsquo;t finish the sentence tho as a massive explosion rocked the entire block, she gazed skyward when she found her footing again to see the tower now windowless with a small crater in the side where she estimated floor 29 used to be. Fire was beginning to take hold and the police began pulling everyone back even further. \r\n\r\nVi tho couldn&#039;t help but stare a little dumbfounded, as money rained down. Gold coins bounced and clattered off the side walk all around her and singed and still burning notes drifted down on the breeze like a strange parody of snow. She reached out her gauntlet letting a smoking note come to rest in it; she looked at it for a moment before letting it fall to ground, and with a sigh set off towards the police line to find Caitlin. She had a feeling a lot of paperwork was going to be waiting for her back at the station after this.","replies":[]}
