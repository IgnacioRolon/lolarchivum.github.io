The bandit patrol had been caught far between their well protected Demacian garrisons, by the encroaching mist. Soon after the unerring strikes of a chain-link scythe had quickly whittled there number down to a pair. Back to back, they rotated slowly in a small clearing within the mist. Their eyes strained to penetrate past the fog and shadow .The scythe returned silently through the mist connecting with a soldiers shoulder, he had barely ushered a cry before he was hauled across the threshold and into the oblivion beyond. The single remaining solider stood waiting, shield raised high he peered around it through the opening of his helm, but the mist remained solid.  He eased into some basic sword movements to loosen his muscles, calm his mind and control his breathing.  The soft clinking of chain and a chuckle escaped the wall of mist, from what direction it had come, the lone soldier couldn&rsquo;t be sure. He pivoted quickly, shield still raised to check as many directions has he could. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Alone at last&rdquo; the echoing drawl assaulted from all direction and caused the skin to crawl.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yes, you are the one I&rsquo;ve been looking for. Look at you, Are you even afraid? I can&rsquo;t tell from here. \r\n\r\nThe scythe stuck from the mist tearing into the soldier&rsquo;s leg. He cried out in pain while spinning to face his attacker, shield still in combat position, but the mist betrayed no movement from within.   \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what you&rsquo;re made of then shall we?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nAgain the scythe struck. This time from behind him tearing into the softer armour of his back, again the lone combatant spun to meet his attacker but empty mist was all he found. Rattling chains and cackling laughter poured forth from the mist now. The scythe returned, this time with little pause, striking again and again from beyond the mist.  The soldier&rsquo;s wounds were taking their toll and with no tangible enemy to fight, he at last could no longer bear the weight of his shield, dropping it to the ground beside him. Finally the time had come. Once more the scythe struck from cover, this time opening a gaping wound in the front of his plate armour. Defeated he sunk to his knees head bowed; his consciousness began to slur, only the pain of his wounds anchoring him awake.    \r\n\r\n&ldquo;hmm I thought you would be a little tougher than this, how disappointing after coming all this way&rdquo; \r\n\r\n The soldier could only manage to raise his head in response. This time tho the mist issued forth a wraith wreathed in chains, bearing a bloodied chained scythe and a lantern that hung loosely beneath his hand, radiating a pale green glow. A blazing fiendish skull where his head should have been and smouldering emerald voids for eyes, within which, if the wounded soldier could still have gazed, he surely would have been driven mad.    \r\n&ldquo;I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter, it always ends the same way&rdquo; the wraith raised his scythe for one last back handed slash to the soldier&rsquo;s neck.  The wounded soldier could only stare vacantly upwards in acknowledgement. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Do not fear the dark mortal&rdquo; The words snaked from within the mist, a strange melody bearing them aloft.  Now it was the wraith who stood silently scanning the mist, scythe still raised across his body.\r\n\r\n &ldquo;For it will hide you, as surely as it does your enemies&rdquo;\r\n\r\n  A whistling arrow stirred the mist slightly as it launched from within, striking the wraith hard in the chest. He roared as he staggered backwards clutching at the missile, only to find the incorporeal bolt dispersing to mist at his touch.   \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Step forward&rdquo; the wraith called menacingly into the swirling mists. He raised his lantern in front of him; its pale light dancing and flickering from within.\r\n\r\nThe lantern released a pulse of energy that drove the fog around them back in a perfect circle revealing his assailant. A slender, pure white furred creature, a black mask in the visage of a wolf inscribed with a faintly glowing curved rune on its forehead covered its face. She stood with indifference to his anger, an intricate meandering bow covered in faintly glowing runes hanging lazily at her side. An inky black smoke formed a second creature this one donning a flawless white mask in the likeness of a lamb, a dark glowing rune also inscribed on its forehead tho this one an inverted and reversed portrayal of the first. The smoke creature moved with predatory guile, flanking the white creature head to toe in ceaseless circles, as if eager to be released from an invisible bond, but for now was content to pace back and forward eyeing up his prey. Tho the black creature possessed no weapon to be seen he did have a great ghostly maw filled with formless flowing stygian fangs.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;See, even the feared thresh carries a lantern to reveal his enemies&rdquo; the white creature chimed. The smoke like creature chuckled heartily at this, as if she had spoken an intimate joke just for him. \r\n\r\nThresh spat at the sight of the two \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This one is mine kindred, there is nothing you can do for him&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;He is a noble and righteous warrior; he deserves to be free of your chains&rdquo; \r\n\r\n&ldquo;His soul is mine!&rdquo;  Threatened thresh, tightening his grip on his scythe and lantern.  \r\n\r\nThe kindred spirits paid no attention to thresh&rsquo;s retort tho, instead turning their attention to the still kneeling soldier, a small pool of blood beginning to form beneath him, his face pale and clammy beneath his helm.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Mortal, the merciful arrow is not what you would want, take up your weapons. Fight now with all you have left. Feel the blood surge in your veins once more, feel the hammering of your heart in your chest, fill your ears with the heaving of your breath.  Prove your valour and courage beyond reproach. &ldquo;  \r\n\r\nThe pleading voice of the slender masked figure seemed to resonate deeply within the soldier. His eyes regained their focus, he forced strength once more into his limbs, he ushered the pain from his mind and in one movement took up his sword and shield, while grunting hard pushed himself to his feet.  With great effort He took up his combat stance, shield held before him ready to fight.  \r\n\r\nSeeing his quarry rise once again infuriated thresh. With a snarl he unleashed the scythe from his grip swinging it in a tight circle alongside him, building up speed with each rotation. With deft aim he hurled it at the soldier snagging his shield with its razor sharp edge. With a triumphant cry he tore the shield from the soldier&rsquo;s bloody grip causing it to fly into the air, scythe still imbedded within it. The solider clung to his shield no more tho, abandoning it with zeal as he felt it wrestled from his grip. He instead took up his sword in a two handed grip. Without the weight of his shield he was unleashed and leapt into the air sword over head to deal a colossal strike to thresh. Thresh&rsquo;s  triumphant cry died in his throat as the soldier bore down on him, his first sword strike landing squarely down his chest. The soldier pushed his advantage raining blows onto thresh the likes that would have easily slain any mortal man. Thresh struggled to retrieve his scythe fast enough to defend himself and instead punched the lantern out in front of him releasing a burst of energy staggering the fatigued  soldier away from him.  \r\n\r\nBlood still streamed from the soldiers wounds and across his armour as he steadied himself on his sword, watching thresh warily from barley a few metres away, but it seemed like both combatants where content with calling a truce. \r\n\r\nBattered and outnumbered thresh began retreating back into the mist slowly, his gaze lingered hungrily for a moment on the weary soldier before tearing it away to give one last look past him to the masked creatures who stood silently watching. His eyes burned brightly as he called to them. \r\n&ldquo;Careful primal spirits, over our long aeon&rsquo;s even death may die, and there&rsquo;s always room for two more&rdquo; he tapped his lantern with his scythe and was swallowed by the swirling fog. \r\n\r\nThe soldier collapsed to his hands and knees, blood trickled down his armour slowly. With one finale huge gasp he tore his helmet off tossing it with abandon and collapsed to the ground, fighting till the end.  \r\n\r\n The howl of a triumphant wolf in the distance was the only sound that split the eerie calm as the mists retreated once more to whence they came, leaving the bloodied corpses of the patrol strewn around where they were slain.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-28T07:51:49.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is really cool!
