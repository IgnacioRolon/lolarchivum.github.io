In one of these shadows extending from a small mountain, bounded a small creature, a yordle. In one hand he wielded an appropriately sized staff and in his other he possessed a wickedly large gauntlet, he was clad in dark wizard robes and a wide pointy hat, but it was shifting darkness so deep that it hid his face from view that betrayed his potential.    \r\n\r\nWith a boundless energy he hopped from foot to foot battling invisible enemies, which upon defeating he would claim victory over in drawn out monologues. It was in the middle of one such monologue that his attention was drawn to a scurrying in the dirt. A lizard no larger than the palm of a man was bee-lining for its home, a rocky our crop not 15 metres behind the shadowy figure.  As it drew level with the lone combatant his eyes flared from under the darkness and he screeched for all to hear in a high pitched almost squeaky voice.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Beast! You dare travel across my domain?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe lizard mostly uninterested in the allegations continued on his journey. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;my subjects shall rejoice to hear of your defeat mighty fiend!&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nStretching out his staff a blast of energy tore from the crystal suspended at its end and struck only centimetres above the lizard. The lizard now aware of the mortal danger being brought upon it began to zig zag and dodge with all the speed it little legs could muster. The shadowy assailant only laughed madly as he poured dark bolts at the lizard but to his chagrin the lizard avoided harm. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I see you have skill! But none are truly a match for the mighty Veigar!&rdquo;   \r\n\r\nThe reptile uninterested in his decrees scampered for the safety of rocky ground close by.  \r\n\r\nVeigar plunged the butt of his staff into the ground, never ceasing in his verbal assault on his enemy. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;no one can hide from my power!&rdquo;  \r\n\r\nWith this a field of crackling energy encircled the tiny reptile in a large ring, it probed the barrier searching a way through but to no avail. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Witness the power of Veigar!&rdquo; he screeched. \r\n\r\nThis time he spun, gesturing to a massive craggy boulder.  A shake of his staff unleashing the bonds of gravity from the boulder, a gesture from his gauntlet sending it sailing through the air. Even Veigar didn&rsquo;t know if it was a hop of joy that escaped his body or simply the force with which he brought down the mighty boulder that lifted him briefly from the ground, regardless he cried out in victory.  The shimmering field dispersed and veigar tossed the boulder down the mountain so he could gloat over the body of his enemy. From underneath his hat his little eyes flared in disbelief as the tiny lizard appeared unscathed and found protection under a small group of rocks.   \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This ends here beast!&rdquo; he roared as the crystal in his staff began to hum and crackle \r\n\r\n&ldquo;This is your end!&rdquo; his staff now crackling and bucking in his hands as it summoned all its strength.\r\n\r\n His over sized gauntlet rolled the rock away but before he could plunge his staff in the crevice and annihilate his scaly opponents fortress the lizard came springing out landing flat on his face and bit down into his nose hidden in the dark. Caught by surprise veigar fell backwards onto the ground swatting his face wildly his staff now forgotten, lying on the ground beside him.  Pleased with its assault the lizard dislodged its self  and plopped onto the ground.  This time its journey to its rocky home was unimpeded. Veigar rolled over onto his stomach breathing hard. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Truly a worthy opponent, be free mighty drake the likes of us where never meant to be tamed. Return when you are fully grown and perhaps we shall battle again to see who is more powerful or perhaps...&rdquo; \r\n\r\nHe sighed ever so lightly; one would have mistaken it for the wind\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Perhaps we shall be majestic allies&rdquo; \r\n\r\nHe rolled onto his back and gazed up into the encroaching twilight. He lay there a while until the distant clank of armour caused him to sit bolt \r\nupright.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Some one dares cross into my empire&rdquo; he thought  \r\n\r\n&ldquo;the borders of which are clearly marked&rdquo; \r\n\r\n he gazed out from the top of his mountain, even in the failing light he could spot  his haphazard line of picket signs pushed into the ground as far as he could see. The word &ldquo;doom&rdquo; incorrectly sprawled over them with far too many &ldquo;O&rdquo;s and &ldquo;M&rdquo;s. He bounded to his feet and hurtled himself down the mountain to the source of the noise. Laughter began tickling his throat once more and he let loose a mighty cry into the descending twilight. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;King of the mountain today! Tomorrow the world!&rdquo;","replies":[]}
