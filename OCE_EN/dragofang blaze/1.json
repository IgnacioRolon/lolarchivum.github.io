She thought back to the looks and gossips of fear and disgust sent in her direction by the soldiers and townspeople of Demacia. Everywhere she went, she was feared and hunted due to her dual heritage. She tried to shake it off by defending Demacia from its enemies and fighting for victory in the Fields of Justice.\r\nShe was proud to be a half-dragon. Her father, a celestial dragon, had protected her from many perils and taught her to grow into a powerful, honourable and loyal ally to whoever she chose to fight for. Never fighting for glory or wealth and only fighting to become stronger than her current state as well as protecting the people.\r\nAfter her refreshing bath, she slipped on a red, velvet dress and laid on the large, soft bed in her room, her long, blood red hair and crimson pupils shimmering in the light of the fireplace which illuminated the dark room. She slowly drifted off to sleep, the moon gave light to the city&rsquo;s inhabitants.\r\nSomewhere beyond the dead forest, a malevolent energy erupted into the night sky as hundreds of malevolent vine-like dragons hatched from their respective eggs. The vile creatures simultaneously surrounded and bowed their heads at the figure sitting on the throne in the middle of the room, its face masked by the eerie abyss and the ghastly flames. The unknown figure sets its gaze upon the boy chained by vines to the eastern wall and strode towards him. The mysterious figure began muttering chants and soon the child erupted into a scream of agony. The figure howled in excitement as the boy continued to scream. The unbearable pain knocked him unconscious as he collapsed onto the figure&rsquo;s lap.\r\nThe scream jolted Shyvana awake. Sweating and panting, she placed a hand on her forehead.\r\n&ldquo;What was that,&rdquo; she wondered as her head throbbed in pain.\r\nShe looked at the clock beside her bed. Midnight. Her enhanced senses picked up a sinister force coming from the south of the city. She immediately strapped on her armour and exited her house for the battlefield. No one in this city has senses as sharp as her and her instincts never failed her. The loud sound of wood against iron rang through the city. Quinn and her loyal bird, Valor, must&rsquo;ve spotted the incoming forces and sounded the alarm.\r\nThe cries of fear erupted from the city as large purple vines simultaneously erupted from the earth and began crushing the houses as if they were ants. The ground beneath her shook as small, purple, vine-like dragons erupted from beneath and began releasing small flames from their small jaws as well as clawing at her armour and face. Shyvana bellowed in rage as she covered her body in flames.\r\nLarge, sharp talons shot out of the blazing wall and ripped the enemies in half. Fire erupted from the wall scorching every in its line of fire. Yellow eyes glowed from within the forcefield of flames. With a thunderous roar Shyvana erupted from the flames as a ferocious dragon, the transformation doubling her strength. She began to take down the adult dragons landing on the broken earth, the shield of flame expanded into a circular wave of fire and burning any enemy within its range. \r\nShe crushed the creatures with ease while the Dragonslayers, Prince Jarvan IV, Braum, Pantheon, Vayne and Xin Zhao, worked on taking down the rest of the evil plaguing their sector of the city while the other warriors focused on getting the townspeople to safety.\r\nAnother wave of purple dragons approached, standing on top of the wave stood the source of this evil. Shyvana looked up to see the Queen of Thorns marvelling the destruction.\r\n&ldquo;Zyra!&rdquo; Shyvana roared.\r\nAlso titled the Rise of the Thorns, Zyra is known for being the last surviving member of an ancient species of plants and by absorbing a powerful sorceress gave her a body and immense magic power. But now by infusing dragons with her magic she can bend them against her will and make them stronger. Now she is known as the Dragon Sorceress.\r\n&ldquo;By drinking the blood of a celestial dragon, I have gained much more power,&rdquo; Zyra cackled. &ldquo;But this is only a fragment of my army. BEHOLD!&rdquo;\r\nShe stepped backwards to reveal a vessel made from her deadly vines. The vines slowly began to unwrap, revealing a boy of about 10 years old. He had small, dragon wings and dragon scale covered forearms and claws. His right arm was as red as Shyvana&rsquo;s eyes while his left arm was as blue as Sona&rsquo;s hair. He was a half-dragon, just like her. Looking closely, she noticed multiple burn marks scattered over his young body. Enraged by the injuries upon the boy, she teared through the large horde of dragons and flew at the skimpily dressed sorceress. Vines shot out from Zyra&rsquo;s arms and wrapped around Shyvana causing her to return to her human form.\r\n&ldquo;Where did you get him,&rdquo; she snarled.\r\n&ldquo;Fool, he is my child,&rdquo; answered Zyra. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, I seduced a celestial dragon into mating with me and after becoming pregnant, I slayed him and drank his blood. Now I am even more powerful! But now with his genes combined with my genes, the most powerful creation of all is born. Such a cute little boy, it&rsquo;s too bad he will become a weapon of mass destruction. Now then I will need some of your precious half-dragon blood.&rdquo;\r\nZyra summoned another thorny vine and slashed it against Shyvana&rsquo;s cheek. She winced in pain as red liquid began to ooze out of the new wound. She snarled at the malevolent sorceress as the older being began chanting. The blood on the half-dragon&rsquo;s face disappeared as the young boy&rsquo;s eyes flickered open. His left eye was amber coloured while his right was as red as Shyvana&rsquo;s own. The two grown females watched as the boy jumped off Zyra&rsquo;s ship of vines and with amazing speed he clashed against Xin Zhao&rsquo;s spear.\r\nXin Zhao had cleared his section of the city from the vile creatures thanks to some support from Sona and Master Yi. Shocked by the child&rsquo;s assault on him he used the butt of his spear to knock the kid backwards. On the rooftop surveying the war, Sona sensed the heated auras the two battlers were giving off and flashed to their direction. She stood there watching the battle and ready to support Xin Zhao.\r\nXin Zhao and the boy glared at each other, watching the other&rsquo;s every move, preparing for the first strike and unfazed by the age difference. Xin Zhao knew not to underestimate children since his first encounter on the Fields of Justice with Annie and if he must defend the kingdom by killing a child, then so be it.\r\nThe Seneschal of Demacia charged at the boy, spear ready to slash open his barely armoured body. Suddenly, the boy grabbed the spear with his right hand and formed a fist with his left as it began to crackle with electric energy. Xin Zhao was unable to defend as the boy collided his armoured fist into the Seneschal&rsquo;s armoured stomach sending him flying.\r\nXin Zhao stabbed his spear into the ground allowing him to re-stand while Sona used her soothing songs to heal his injuries and give him strength. Xin Zhao striked again, this time circling around the kid in order to catch him by surprise. But instead the boy disappeared and reappeared again in front of Sona as he began his assault on the voiceless maiden.\r\nAbove in the sky, the battle rages on between Shyvana and Zyra as they battled for the freedom of the boy. Shyvana, realising Zyra had enchanted her son to obey her every command, had mercilessly teared apart her bindings and lashed out Zyra. Their bodies now filled with bruises, slash marks and burns. \r\n&ldquo;Release your hold on the boy!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Zyra replied.\r\nTheir battle was close with both beings at their limits. One final blow and that was it. With one final charge their fists collided against each other&rsquo;s face causing them to collapse onto the ground.\r\nWith the last of her strength Zyra reached out her arm and tried to call someone but was unable to mutter a sound as she loss conscious. Realising their defeat, the drake army retreated with their master.\r\nRemembering the boy, Shyvana ran towards where she had last seen him. Upon arrival, she saw an unconscious Xin Zhao and a blood-stained boy rested upon Sona&rsquo;s lap. Shyvana stroked the boy&rsquo;s cheek causing him to stir. He looked around.\r\n&ldquo;W-where&rsquo;s mommy?&rdquo; he asked with a worried expression.\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, she is gone but safe,&rdquo; comforted Shyvana. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m Blaze,&rdquo; answered the boy.**\r\n\r\nIts 1499 words and i would really appreciate if you guys could give me some feedback on this.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-24T04:09:10.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also where is the quinn and shyvana ship","replies":[{"poster":"DragoFang Blaze","date":"2017-03-25T01:28:02.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh is that a thing?

Apart from what ZVCKK mentioned, I found a few flaws particularly in your sentence structure. This part was full of grammatical mistakes:\n\n_\"Shyvana, realising Zyra had enchanted her son to obey her every command, had mercilessly teared apart her bindings and lashed out Zyra. Their bodies now filled with bruises, slash marks and burns.\n“Release your hold on the boy!”\n“Never!” Zyra replied.\nTheir battle was close with both beings at their limits.

Realising their defeat, the drake army retreated with their master.\"_\n\n1. The second part of your first sentence doesn't really make sense. \"had mercilessly teared apart her bindings and lashed out Zyra.\" I think you might want to replace it with something like this. _\"Shyvana, realising Zyra had enchanted her son to obey her every command, screamed with rage and broke free of her bindings. Her fury overwhelmed her and she leapt at the dragon sorceress, feeling a transformation ripple through her body. As her flesh contorted and her bones reformed, she launched a furious assault on Zyra, severely wounding the witch.\"_\n\n2. After they fought and the \"battle was close with both beings at their limits\", things start to go wrong. The word final is repeated too much, try using \"ending\" or \"one more blow.\"\n\n3. The final line suggests Zyra retreated. Maybe try using, \"sensing their masters demise/defeat, the dragons screamed in pain, before retreating from the battle field. Alternatively, you could suggest that the dragons die without Zyra's influence, \"As their master lost consciousness, her malevolent will faded from the battlefield. Without her sustaining power, the dragons collapsed in the dirt, defeated.\n\nThere are other areas that need touching up as well, so make sure to proof read it and check the comments.\nGood Luck!","replies":[{"poster":"DragoFang Blaze","date":"2017-03-16T23:35:35.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks I will try to fix it up with your feedback.
