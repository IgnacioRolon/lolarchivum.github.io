They won't. Reasons. \n\n- Changing whole map from Day to Night\n- Changing Shadows (Champions, Environment and Buildings) \n- Changing Champion Appearance \n- Changing Champion Effects\n- Making the Bots have over powered abilities (To be used constantly)\n- To have good AI on the Bots\n\nI really loved this but we only got this Game Mode once, which was on the Old Rift. I heard Riot saying they had to do all these Effect changes and I really think they just don't want to do it anymore. I think it was only a one time thing.","replies":[]}]}
