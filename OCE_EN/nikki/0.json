The instant feedback system is superb at catching people who simply dont care about what they say, for example saying &quot;neck yourself&quot; or &quot;Kill yourself&quot; will probably net them a temp ban if not a mute, But using a region specific term like &quot;Pakeha&quot; which is of the maori language in New Zealand(Pakeha means white pig, its what a black person calls a white person when they want to be racist, the reverse of \"%%%%%%\") where I am from, I would be willing to bet &quot;pakeha&quot; isnt on the blacklist for the bot to detect and issue a punishment, I would also be willing to bet terms like &quot;Cao ni ma&quot; are not in the blacklist for the english client, either. People constantly say things like SB in my games which means &quot;you are a son of a bitch&quot; and of course this doesnt get detected because it is an abbreviation, Same deal with &quot;Fk&quot; everyone says &quot;Fk you&quot; because they know theyll walk away from that game untouched.\n\nThe &quot;blacklist&quot; that the instant feedback bot is programmed with, needs to increase. We need to be adding more phrases to the list of words the bot will ban for. this is the first solution.\nSecondly, entry boxes need to have the same Blacklist so that players cannot make the name and &quot;Get away&quot; with using a profane name for a duration of time before a rioter has to waste their valuable time investigating something that this bot(should) already be culling in the game.\n\nThis is a MOBA and the genre naturally tends to be very toxic. having a bad game can make you emotionally charged while chatting with your team(or the enemy one) and tensions are high, This is totally understandable, so long as players keep their comments to the game. Telling someone you&#039;re pissed off they ganked you is okay, telling them youll kill their mother isnt. and you should definitely be punished for that.\n\nI know people will simply say &quot;Grow a thicker skin, mute all&quot; but that is a band-aid solution for a much larger issue, one that CAN be dealt with. and should.\n\nAnother consideration would be to merge blacklists from other countries, so that one cannot google translate their insults into korean and post it in the english client, thus avoiding the filter. Keep in mind I am no Riot employee, and it may not even work this way. I am just taking as educated a guess as I can as to how the system currently detects profanity in game as we can never really know how regional differences are impacting reports. All i know is Foreigners that insult me give me a lot less instant feedback notifications post-game than people who insult me in english, on the OCE client.\n\nI am posting this thread by advisory from a riot support agent who told me they cannot contact any of the devs or management of Riot games directly, I am expecting this thread to get downvoted a bunch and get told &quot;grow a thicker skin&quot; etc but that isnt going to stop me trying. I want this game to be enjoyable for people who start playing it, The most common complaint i have from friends trying to get into LoL is that the community is frightening. I want to do my part to clean up this game that i so much enjoy, Let&#039;s defeat toxicity together!\n\nPlease share your thoughts on the system, my suggestions and if you have any great ideas for the instant feedback system by all means share it! im sure riot would love any insight they can get. Thank you for reading.","replies":[]}
