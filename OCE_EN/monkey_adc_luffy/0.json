If it started off by giving you a twenty-minute low priority queue, then something's terribly off. Either you've been punished in the past or there was a genuine glitch in the system, not the mention the fact that this is apparently the first game you've left (leaving one game will not punish you; you're right about that).\n\nMake a support ticket and ask Riot to review your case.
