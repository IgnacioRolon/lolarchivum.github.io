There is a custom one but It's moves are not different. I think it would be awesome if you guys could bring a Goku Skin out for Lee Sin so that way everybody can see it and have the moves different so he actually seems like he has super sayain powers! I'm sure a lot of people would love this idea also.\r\n\r\n{{champion:64}} \r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Occidere","date":"2014-12-05T23:41:44.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can get a custom one. Its not too hard to install only thing is that your the only one who can see it.\nPlus if they made it a goku skin, they would be infringing on copyrights.{{champion:64}}","replies":[{"poster":"U JustGot Ganked","date":"2014-12-05T23:44:38.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did mentioned that I already knew there was a custom one :P Yeah I know, maybe they could pay them or ask them to use it.
