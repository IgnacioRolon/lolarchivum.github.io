The guy messaged me today and asked if I wish to &quot;trade&quot; skins, naturally I didn&#039;t trust him at first and said we will discuss about this after I finish my game. The person was pretty patient and waited for more than 40 mins, as soon as I finished he asked if we could do the trade (BTW, he wanted a 975 RP trade), I thought about it and 975 is just too much, so I replied to him and said I don&#039;t have 975, but I can do 490. So we started the trade, I gifted a mystery skin and he just deleted me off the friend list. Again before you guys judge me, like I stated before, I still have hope for this humanity race and there are some good people out there, but just not this one I suppose. After the scam, I sat there and tried to figure out a valid way to counter scamming in League, and I was wondering if riot can do a system where you are able to refund your gift but only within transactions that happened in the last hour. Again, this post is not me wailing and crying about my lost RP, I also have no intention of getting my RP back as I understand this current system doesn&#039;t have this kind of capability yet, but i just want to stop negativity within this community and give a better experience for players in the Field of Justice.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-24T08:23:40.909+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair play man. Your best bet is create a good relationship with someone before you trust them which takes time. The only person I've swapped skins with is my cousin who I am very close to. BUT in Riots side, they can create a swap system... Or just give us solo mystery skin options all the time","replies":[{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-09-24T08:37:48.271+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably why I only trade skins with people I know IRL","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-24T09:46:20.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't even trade with Summoners that I'm friends with IRL I just give them 5 or 10 dollars and they buy what eve","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FallenDawn","date":"2015-09-24T08:33:12.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I agree, they should create a swap system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-09-24T11:39:10.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a system.\nit's called don't be fucking retarded lmao.","replies":[]},{"poster":"a√Ædan","date":"2015-09-24T11:37:45.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem with your solution, is that some people would take advantage of it, refunding their mystery skin over and over again, until they get the one they desire.
