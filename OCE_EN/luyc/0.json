I left the one hextech chest there for a long time already without intent to open (planning to mass open once i accumulate more) and i realise now it&#039;s gone.. Honestly do not remember opening it at all since I have no new skin shards, emotes and pretty much all the champ shards I have are from levelling up.  However, it could be my fault and i accidentally opened it myself, but I hope you could still look into it for me. Thankyou!\r\n(If this helps, 99.9% sure I got the chest from Graves a bit ago)","replies":[{"poster":"moneycyrus","date":"2018-09-23T13:40:35.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"hope u never find it{{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[{"poster":"moneycyrus","date":"2018-09-23T13:44:06.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just kidding! godspeed my child. just have to play the waiting game! hahaha! {{sticker:galio-happy}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-09-23T14:11:29.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your best bet will be to submit a support ticket: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThey'll be able to nail down when you opened your last chest etc etc. :)","replies":[{"poster":"luyc","date":"2018-09-24T06:32:34.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou so much!
