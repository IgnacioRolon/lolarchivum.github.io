The chores you put off all week, your dry cleaning, your washing, spending time with your friends/partner.. your skills decay soo fast. I assume i'd pick them up if I get some more time to play, but I don't get that time.\n\nIt's like you're watching yourself play just as you hit 30, only you know all the mistakes you're making and are constantly calling yourself a moron the entire game, wish i could mute my brain.\n\nsads.","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2014-12-08T12:51:34.454+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know the feeling man, selling Rav's Magic Red Drinkâ„¢ is some hard work.
