I love Riot and their work ethic and how often they&#039;re able to pump out awesome new stuff like the Nunu rework and the High Noon skins that recently came out, but Hail of Blades, in many ways, has made me question some of Riot&#039;s game design choices more than ever.  Here&#039;s why I think Hail of Blades has failed:\r\n\r\n**1.  Boring**\r\n\r\nThe Runes Reforged was a massive success in a multitude of ways, but mostly by giving players lots of viable options and choices for what they wanted to run on their champion that could impact the game in a big way, unlike the one-dimension of most champions with the old Masteries system (i.e. fervor on Lucian, courage of colossus on Thresh, etc) There are so many interesting and unique options now.  Kleptomancy is a great option for champions like Gangplank and Ezreal, for example.  But they aren&#039;t required to take it to get fed.  They could go Grasp of the Undying on Gangplank, or Press the Attack on Ezreal.  I currently think all the Keystones are very unique, active, and exciting to play with, and can alter your playstyle massively - with the exception of one.  Hail of Blades is just a 3-hit Attack Speed steroid that lets you go over the limit of 2.5 attacks per second.  Lethal Tempo already does this and actually feels active - you go in, do a bit of damage, activate it, and then go crazy.  If you want it to last longer, stay in combat.  Hail of Blades just isn&#039;t as exciting and doesn&#039;t meet the standard of Riot&#039;s other Keystones.\r\n\r\n**2.   It doesn&#039;t  fit**\r\n\r\nRiot has done an awesome job creating and maintaining the themes of the various Rune trees.  Inspiration isn&#039;t directly for combat, but gives you options such as waveclear, movement speed, CDR, slows, and other non-direct-damage options that&#039;re still really useful.  Resolve is a more sustain/tank-based, with runes offering a Doran&#039;s Shield-like passive, permanent % armor and magic resist gain, health, and other options.  And these are just two of the five.  Again, the trees offer awesome and very different options for game play and have a very set niche that defines what does and doesn&#039;t belong in the given tree.  Hail of Blades doesn&#039;t belong in the Domination tree, if anywhere at all.  I don&#039;t like Hail of Blades at all, but if they were going to add a new keystone like this they should NOT have put it in Domination.  Domination is for burst and target elimination, as you can clearly see by the OTHER keystones it offers.  Electrocute grants you extra burst for doing a combo, Predator is a move speed buff that gives your next damaging attack burst, and Dark Harvest makes your next basic attack hit harder depending on how many stacks you&#039;ve received from it so far.  Hail of Blades doesn&#039;t actually give you any damage, just an attack speed steroid for 3 attacks.  \r\n\r\n**3.  Lethal Tempo exists**\r\n\r\nAs I briefly mentioned in my first point, Lethal Tempo is just a better-made keystone that belongs in Precision - the tree that it&#039;s in.  Precision is based on extended combat and fighting, and Lethal Tempo promotes this style perfectly.  After entering champion combat, after a delay you receive a massive attack speed steroid.  Staying in combat doubles the duration of the steroid, and while it&#039;s active you can go over 2.5 attacks per second.  Hail of Blades is just a more boring version that you&#039;ll barely see in games, albeit on Jhin, which I&#039;m sure wasn&#039;t the intention of its use in the first place.  Actually,  I take that back, I&#039;m not sure what the intention of its users were, all I know is that there&#039;s a better, more exciting, and better placed version of Hail of Blades that&#039;s \r\n been out there since the launch of Runes Reforged.  \r\n\r\n**4.  Champions that could have used it don&#039;t**\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard about this keystone, I was a little bit horrified at the simplicity and poor design of Hail of Blades.  However, I figured it might be good on a few champions, and that maybe they would keep it from going totally unused.  Now here we are, months later, and it is almost solely used on Jhin for early AD burst on auto attacks.  Champions that I thought would have abused the three-hit attack speed steroid - in theory - were Shen, Kindred, Xin Zhao, Pyke, Kled, Darius, Tahm Kench, Vayne, Graves, and Kai&#039;sa.  None of these champions use it.  Ever.  Apart from the forgettable launch of Hail of Blades on June 1st, it was accompanied with the release of Pyke, an incredibly exciting support, and a Bilgewater event.  So, even though it had just been released, it was still barely used - people would much rather play a new breed of support and play the awesomely designed and beautiful-looking Bilgewater ARAM.  However, that was - apart from the current Hail of Blades Jhin option - the only time these champions used it.  Why? Simply because there were better choices available.  Shen runs Grasp of the Undying, Press the Attack, and Conquerer incredibly well.  Grasp of the Undying  gives him damage while he builds full tank, Press the Attack empowers his all in to do shocking amounts of damage, and Conquerer allows him to not only dish mixed damage, but also 20% true damage.  Kindred runs Fleet Footwork, Lethal Tempo, and Dark harvest better, and Hail of Blades only purpose on her would be her E.  However, since it does missing health damage and the keystone requires you to exit combat to refresh, she would mostly blow the steroid on basic attacks anyway.   Xin Zhao can run almost any keystone better, and his early jungle dueling doesn&#039;t need the attack speed.  Pyke just has many better options, including Electrocute if he wants burst.  Kled runs it terribly since Conquerer and Press the Attack make him unstoppable and Hail of Blades doesn&#039;t work well when his W is down.  It works semi-well on Darius in lane but it scales awfully outside of lane.  Tahm Kench becomes very squishy and even easier  to kite without a resolve or inspiration keystone.  Vayne has better options.  Graves has better options.  Kai&#039;sa has better options.  All of these champions just have better options than Hail of Blades.  The lesson? Don&#039;t use it, unless you like it on Jhin.  There&#039;s probably a better choice for whoever you&#039;re playing.\r\n\r\n**5.  More Interesting Domination Options**\r\n\r\nDomination tree is one of my favorites, since it has a lot of interesting stuff.  There were so many better things they could have done with a Keystone addition to the tree, and it&#039;s honestly really disappointing that they wasted their second Keystone addition since Runes Reforged on something like Hail of Blades.  Due to Riot&#039;s work ethic, it&#039;s also quite likely that they won&#039;t return to update this tree for quite a long time; as they usually don&#039;t like giving the same sort of thing an update twice - no two Jungle champions reworked twice in a row, no two top laners added back-to-back, etc.  This means that most likely they&#039;ll have added at least 1 Keystone to every tree before they return to the Domination path.  While this is just speculation, based on their past decisions and how they design changes, it&#039;s also fairly likely.  They could have done something very interesting with a new Keystone for domination - a support keystone that, upon stunning an enemy champion, marks them.  The next ally that damages that champion (apart from the one who put the mark on them) consumes it and does adaptive max health damage.  It could have been another interesting burst option.  There&#039;s so many other, more interesting things that could have been done with a Domination Keystone and it&#039;s really sad to see creativity and time wasted on the mess that is Hail of Blades.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my rant on why I think Hail of Blades was a failure.
