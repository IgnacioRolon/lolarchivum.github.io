I had a great idea of buffing his [W] by making it a slow or stun. This would make it more appealing to the League of Legends Community by making him used. Lucian&#039;s [W] usually is only good for farming and double shotting, with this change it would be useful in so may ways. If buffing his [W] is to OP, you can nerf the double shot, for example, when you use the [W] you will not get a double shot ability. Without this change Lucian will continue being squishy.\r\n\r\n**Sincerely, iKnowWhoYouAm**\r\n*PS. Why did you have not nerf Fizz :&#039;(*","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-01T22:40:40.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian's W is both utility, a reset and extra damage in one.

His W doesn't need a buff, because he is extremely mobile already and plus the damage you can do after you W is insane.
