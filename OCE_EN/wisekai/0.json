For the most part, costs of RP will remain more or less the same, relatively speaking, when compared to other servers. All Riot is doing is changing the prices a bit to compensate for tax, which *literally everyone* who provides goods/services does.\n\nSo far as the changes from 4 years ago, that was intended to bring various regions in-line with each other (providing a relatively equal $ to RP ratio, considering exchange rates), and just about every other region (and even NZ) that experienced those changes got hit *harder* than Aus/OCE. Even *after* that change, we were still getting better $ to RP ratios than NA (considering exchange rates).","replies":[]}]}
