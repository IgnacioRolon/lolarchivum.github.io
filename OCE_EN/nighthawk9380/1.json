Nine times out of ten this leads to a nerf the next patch followed by some tweaking over the next few patches until they get it right. \r\n\r\nBut Ekko.\r\n\r\nThe most OP champ I&#039;ve seen released yet. I&#039;ve been playing ranked, hexakill, anything to ban him away. He&#039;s a mage that I&#039;ve seen stick around for 3 consecutive team fights in our base with 0 mana regen items and yet still have enough mana to spam his OP skills. His stun nukes me as Ahri for 90% of my health and let&#039;s not even start talking about his ulti bs.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was mad. Why Riot, why? Don&#039;t you have beta testing to sort this **** out?? But then I had a revelation. \r\n\r\nRiot didn&#039;t nerf him because they couldn&#039;t.\r\n\r\nEkko is Jessy Perring&#039;s son.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-03T06:19:15.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's understandable that a newly released champ can be out of the balanced zone, even though they already have the public testing realm for that purpose called PBE, but whatever I can forgive that.\n\nIs Ekko balanced? I can not say and tbh, I don't really care if he is or not.\n\nThe problem I have with is his kit's design direction and philosophy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-03T06:37:50.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"i His stun nukes me as Ahri for 90% of my health and let's not even start talking about his ulti bs.\"\n\nIf you are playing ahri and cant dodge his ult,slow or stun you are shit no questions","replies":[]}]}
