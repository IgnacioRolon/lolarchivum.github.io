There seem to be a few developments emerging but there's conflicted opinion in game about it, so I wanted to ask it here.\r\n\r\nIs it better to start at buff or golems/frog (can't remember their new names)?\r\n\r\nIf you counter jungle and smite an enemy's monster camp without killing it (taking it's unique smite triggered ability) does that mean that if the enemy jungler later tries to smite clear that camp, they don't receive the smite triggered ability?\r\n\r\nIf so (if not, skip this bit), is it better to smite and not clear a crucial camp (say wraiths or golems) and make the enemy jungler waste their smite on it or is better to clear it as normal and leave one small minion behind?\r\n\r\nAlso, about the hunters knife upgrades - do the enchantments retain the originals ability? eg, when upgrading trailblazer to devourer does the ability 'jungler' with its health regen remain or is it not available with the enchantment? I'm asking because the enchantment doesn't have a description including the jungle items abilities but I realise that may just be because riot doesn't think it's feasible to incorporate all 16 types of end-jungle items with the unique abilities as opposed to just 4 (4 enchantments x 4 jungle items).\r\n\r\nOn another note, I've experimented with stalker's and skirmishers (mainly on jarvan) but found it difficult to manage a 60 second cooldown with ganking smite and staying alive in your own jungle and receiving monster-smite rewards (eg; wraiths oracle). Poacher's I don't like, mainly because the wolves is too deep to counter jungle unless your very confident, there's no point in taking frog as you can't leave a small minion and golems leaves you oh so open to bot lane, you might as well gank. Which means for me atleast, poachers lets you take enemy wraiths only (atleast early game) which can be done without poachers and the movement speed escape after smiting them is not worth trading another jungle item for.\r\n\r\nI've ranted long enough, stopping now.","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2014-11-27T08:53:09.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2014-11-27T12:39:49.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo any jungler that has no inbuilt sustain cant even gank after 1st clear, even if you start frog and have a good leash. I use shaco, stack boxes at blue, get leash on gromp (smite, take small damage), clear blue (taking no damage), wolves, SKIP BIRDS, smite red and STILL NOT ENOUGH HP!!\n\nThis is ridiculous. (btw I dont usually use this path on shaco I will lvl 2 gank this was a test)\n\nAnd I was looking oh so forward to poachers on shaco, then it turned out to be terribad.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-27T08:48:49.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people like to start Gromp (frog) because it lets you clear faster.\n\nYes if you smite but don't clear, your enemy doesnt receive the buff, HOWEVER, I'm pretty sure the buff refreshes itself if the jungle camp is not cleared by a certain time.\nAlways better to atleast take the bigger monster to deny gold, not just the small buff. with 100s respawn timers, counter jungling is super effective\n\nI personally take Ranger's on almost everyone. Its just really good. I can see how Stalkers could be good on certain champs that want to slow, but if you already have a champ with a gap closer and CC, theres no real point imo.\nPoachers is for solid counter-junglers, not for maybe i can go into their jungle once or twice. Its for champs like Nunu, Shaco, etc who have the ability to live in their opponents jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-27T08:08:20.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Hey,\n> \n> So I know there jungle has changed, I've read all (most) of the notes and played a few games.
