Does League have a system in place where it locks your account after a certain number of tries? Or did they somehow succeed? Anyway, it doesn&#039;t look like they have done anything whilst on it, and since then I have changed my password and the email address associated with the account. Sorry for the post, just wanted to get it out there, see if anybody else has had a similar issue.","replies":[]}
