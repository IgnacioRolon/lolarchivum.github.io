And tbh honor capsules shouldn't drop champion shards I hate that I have gotten only champion shards from 2 capsules they gave me.{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-10-08T21:09:09.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I believe keys now drop semi-'randomly', so as long as you play a game or two a day, Riot says that you should get the same amount of keys... That doesn't seem to be happening (at least in my experience), back when I was actually getting a few capsules, even though I was only getting champ shards, was the only reason I was getting enough keys. I mean, at least champ shards are better than nothing....
