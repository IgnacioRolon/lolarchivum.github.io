Suffice to say that game was lost. (I **was** trying not to die as I was sitting under tower and not leaving it, but their burst was too strong anyway).\n\nEnough of Game 1....\nGame 2: Normal game, get off role, finally get a good team, have a fun game where we win (It was pretty close though)\nGame 3: Fairly okay game, we should have lost, I was playing pretty terrible, adc kept flaming because I was trying to make stuff happen around the map and he was always overextending. Excluding that it was a pretty decent game.\nAnd then Game 4: Mundo jungle pick in champ select, WHOO! He never ganks.... at all. His first participation in a kill was well after 10 minutes. All the while top is getting destroyed (slightly counterpicked, mainly because of the 5 jungle ganks by 10 minutes [they&#039;d also gone mid twice by this point too]). Zed is now very far behind mid too, etc, etc. Eventually Mundo, Zed and the adc (who has now fallen quite far behind because they keep getting caught by their by now super-fed jungler whenever I&#039;m not there often after I&#039;d just recalled, they cancelled theirs to poke the enemy down) are now all flaming everyone else and calling for surrender. However you know NEVER GIVE UP, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE, but no, we were gone. They then open mid and ask the enemy team to ban the top for *insert various things that they didn&#039;t actually do* but the enemy has no proof of this so they&#039;re more likely to believe the 3 accusors instead of the 1 accused. So we lose...\nHaven&#039;t done Game 5 yet because still cooling off.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} \nSorry for the wall of text\n\nTl;dr: Terrible teammates in ranked promos again. Ruin the game. Always accuse people who didn&#039;t do anything wrong. Waiting on game 5.\nSorry, just wanted to rant","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-10T13:36:42.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rule no.1: never tell anyone it's your promo series.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-02-10T23:20:26.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=GhRIjQIo,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-02-10T13:36:42.235+0000)\n>\n> rule no.1: never tell anyone it&#x27;s your promo series.\n\nSummies just look you up either way.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheNwMasterbosch","date":"2017-02-10T11:42:02.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After a 6 ranked win streak at at 81lp I get a pretty bad feeding team. \n\nSo i play ranked again to a champ select that greets me with a yi support who says he aint gonna support the adc but actually support the jng... we all rage at him whilst he gets toxic all the while saying he is plat and helping some friend... So we get into loading screen all normal we all hit 100% when all of a sudden... \"You have lost internet connection\" pop up comes up on the loading screen and i try my hardest to get the internet on and i did but 1 minute too late... IT COST ME over 20LP emphasis on the \"20\".\n\nSo mate i feel you. Just play some music on the last game of your's and try your hardest to carry your team and be as supportive as possible to make your team win :D","replies":[]}]}
