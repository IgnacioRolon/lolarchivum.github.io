I'm going to take a look into this from our end, to see if there is anything we can do, but I'd definitely suggest getting in touch with TPG yourselves to see if there is anything funny going on with their network.\n\nI was also able to find a discussion [on whirlpool](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2434627) with TPG users talking about similar symptoms for many other online services.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"ocquat","date":"2015-08-04T07:29:10.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same, i'm in melbourne and usually have 1500 ping for the first half of the game (occasionally going down to 200 or so for  a few seconds) but then back to around 40 ping for the last half of the game.. not sure if the fact that i only had issues for the first half of the game is of any relevance though\n\neveryone in my game said they were having ping issues too\n\nand i'm with iinet btw\n\nedit: whoops posted from my na account ><","replies":[]},{"poster":"ResolveAKR","date":"2015-08-02T10:41:01.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nI've been having this exact same issue, also with TPG and residing in ADL. One theory reading on the forums is that the new windows 10 updates is overloading servers and causing high ping at primetime hours. For some reason the connection is going from Sydney back to Adelaide not the other way round causing the ping. \n\nAnyone having an issue, please post on the TPG forums.
