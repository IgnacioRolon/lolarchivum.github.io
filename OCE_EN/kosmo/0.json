Im concerned the riot balance team is pigeon holing my champion into a very specific play-style, that of a tank. It&#039;s becoming apparent to me that no one on the balance team shares my views on this champion (a champion ive spent 3 years playing). If tank Sion is the issue, i think the nerfs to tank Sion are causing far to much collateral damage to his other play styles. When i play ap Sion jg i have to build 98.6 ap, just to break even with what last patches e was doing. In patch 8.8 when riot acknowledged that tank Sion was an issue, they cited that his e was the reason for his lane dominance...and so proceeded to nerf his q. As stated by riot this was their attempt to get players to max q first. These changes worry me as a long time Sion player. these nerfs make me very nervous for the future of my champion. How long will it be before the champion i fell in love with is reduced to a knuckle dragging tank, with no depth or diverse play styles. \r\n\r\np.s can you just give us back storm raiders surge. no one likes phase rush.","replies":[{"poster":"Dyzon","date":"2018-05-16T10:40:27.008+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is so true, it seems that riot recently is trying to restrict players into playing champions a very specific way, with very little encouragement for players to search for new, fun and interesting ways to play the champions they love.

It'd kinda screw with your build and game-perception huh? How are you supposed to counter pick that?\nChamps have a purpose that they were originally designed for, most champs have some degree of variation _(I.e Glass cannon Karthus or sustained DPS Karthus.)_, but for one champ to have the choice between being full AP, full AD or full Tank is too much. It provides too much safety for bad picking decisions.\n\nWhy would you pick a champ like LB who can only do one thing, and build one way, when you can just pick Sion and build however the f*ck you want whenever the mood suits, and perform just as well? Hardly fair to LB's team.\n\nI'm sorry the champ you like happens to be a Tank, I really am.

In fact the only similarities between Ekko and Sion are that of a champion that had multiple playstyles, 1 of which was overpowered. where they continue to differ is that riot carefully nerfed tank Ekko so that his other play styles wouldn't have to suffer.\n\nI don't think im asking for a lot, all im asking for is for riot to be nerfing his tank builds while avoiding gutting his other more enjoyable builds.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-05-17T00:58:03.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're taking this wayyy too literally.\nIt has nothing to do with who is mobile and who has AP scalings.

The point was: That if you had the instant reaction of \"Ewww\" when a champ is playing something they weren't intended for, why is it okay for Sion to do the same?\n\n\n_____________________\n\nYes many champs have found a niche elsewhere, such as Graves Jungle, or Brand Support. however this new niche usually comes at the price of their intended purpose. I.e. You don't see Graves ADC anymore, and like you said with Naught, he is now played predominately Support or Top, NOT Jungle anymore.\nAnd thats fine when that kind of change happens, but when Graves is still top-tier ADC as well as a really good jungler, thats when things get unbalanced.\n\n\n_____________________\n\nAgain with Yasuo, you've completely missed the point entirely.\nThe whole point of a comparison is to point out the differences in two things.\nWhy would I compare someone exactly like Sion to Sion? Im trying to show that what Sion does isn't healthy, so why would I compare it to someone that does exactly the same thing?\nThe point here, is that it wouldn't seem right for Yasuo, a high mobility hyper carry, to build in different ways, does it? So if other champions have to be restricted to certain play styles, why should Sion be able to do whatever he wants?\n\n______________________\n\nCounter-picking isn't just about lane counters you know.\nThe ADC might see the enemy pick Sion and think _\"Ok I need someone who can deal with tanks.\"_ So they pick Kog'Maw, and proceed to get annihilated by the bursty full AP Sion. Mid lane might think, _\"Ok they picked Sion, ill pick someone who can easily take out burst champs.\"_ and then find themselves completely useless against full tank Sion. Even your own team might pick wrong because of it. You might pick Sion, and the jungler thinks _\"Ok Sweet we have a tank, I can go Fiddlesticks then.\"_ and now your team has too much AP and no tank. \n\nThe game needs a certain degree of clarity, if you see a leona getting picked, you have a rough idea of what to expect and can start to make plans for that. If your champ can go one of any 3 completely different play styles, it offers nothing but confusion.\nYou can't press tab to check items until you get into game, and by than you've already chosen your champ, and unlike Sion your champ cant be built in a number of different ways.\n\nAlso you can change builds during the game. Say you're Sion jungle, VS a Shaco, you're building full AD so you can fight Shaco when you meet in the jungle, and so you have some sick damage when you gank lanes _(cos in early game tanks are kinda useless, so why wouldn't you build full AD)_. Then when it gets into late game, Shaco _(either AP or AD)_ has fallen off, and isn't very useful anymore, and you just sell all your AD Items and suddenly you're a brick wall no one can touch _(and tanks are OP AF late game)_.\n\nShaco doesn't have the option of suddenly switching builds. He made the decision to pick an early game champ and tried to snowball, and it didn't work and now he has to live with that. He took a risk picking his champ, and it didn't pay off. Why should Sion not have to take risks the same way?\n\n_________________________\n\nIm not comparing LB's kit to Sions kit.... \n\nI'm saying, some champs HAVE to be built and play a certain way, or else they just don't exist. So if you have champs that can build in any number of ways and still be effective, why would you pick champs that are railroaded into one playstyle? Therefore, in the interest of fairness, if you pick a tank, you should be expected to have to build somewhat healthily, and if you pick a carry, you should be expected to build some form of damage. Its not fair to build attack-speed crit Shen and be just as effective as an ADC, likewise its not fair to Kalista to build full tank and be just as effective as Leona. So why is it fair that you pick a tank like Sion, and then have a crazy amount of AP burst?\n\nUhhhhhhh what? I never compared anything to AP mid lane mage Kindred? Did you even read it?\nOP said (and I'm paraphrasing): _\"I like Sion, but I don't like him being a tank, because I like playing damage.\"_\nand I said (and I'm paraphrasing): _\"I like Kindred, but I would prefer that she was an AP Mage, instead of an ADC jungler, because I'm a mid laner, and Its annoying that I have to play Jungle to play one of my favourite champs.\"_\nAbsolutely nothing I said even remotely suggests that you can or should play Kindred AP in mid lane....\nAnd I certainly wasn't comparing its effectiveness with Sion's...\n\n__________________________\n\nIm not wrong about Sion being a tank pre-rework, he has always been a tank.\nYes he has AP scalings _(but so does Ashe)_. People built him AP the same way they built Ezreal and Kog AP. \nIt was pretty strong in a few select circumstances, but it was hardly the 'meta playstyle'. It was more akin to your example of some Korean streamer one-tricking it up to diamond. He was never a reliable AP champ the same way Vlad or Ryze were.\nYes if you played 100 games, you might do really well in 20 of them, does that make him not a tank? No.\n\n___________________________\n\nYes the hulk is also Bruce Banner.\nYes he is intelligent, _(most superheros are, Batman has a higher IQ than Iron Man. 'Genius' is more often than not, a tab they slap on any superhero without powers to make them seem less inferior to the powered ones.)_  but you'll notice that Einstein isn't in the Avengers, neither is Stephen Hawking. And Bruce Banner wouldn't be either if he wasn't a giant green monster that can put gods on their backs.\n\nYea he wears Iron-mans suit in infinity war, _(so technically isn't that just Tony Stark carrying his sorry ass?)_ \nDespite being a Genius he still couldn't operate the suit very well, and that STILL managed to be his most useful moment in the whole film.\nNot to mention his IQ is partially what caused the problem of Ultron in the first place.\n\nSo if bruce banner is AP sion, it doesn't seem like a very strong case to me.\nYes he has his useful moments, but as shown by Thor in Ragnarok, and the avengers in Infinity War, his team _(just like in league)_ really want him to stop farting around with Rabadons Deathcap and just turn into the Hulk.","replies":[{"poster":"Kosmo","date":"2018-05-17T03:18:58.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"My initial thought wasn't \"Ewww why would you even think to play Nami anything other than squishy support?...\". my thought was why is he comparing this to Sion as if this its some smoking gun?

As a fairly new player to League, it's disappointing to see that Riot seem to enjoy choke holding play styles and removing the adaptability that Sion offered to many players. As Kosmo stated, players who play with the intention of dealing immense damage have been nothing but hindered in recent patches (8.8 and 8.10). For example, in patch 8.8, Sion's Q ability gained a base damage increase at earlier ranks. I assume this was an attempt to direct players into maxing their Q before any other ability, again, this is a prime example of how Riot have subtly managed to force players into a specific play style. When I began playing league, I was given the impression that due to the games (now former) fifth freedom aspect, players could effectively utilise any champion's abilities to play in any lane, in any role.
