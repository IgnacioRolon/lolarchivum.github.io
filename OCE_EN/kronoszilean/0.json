The system MUST find evidence of you harassing other players to punish you. People simply reporting you for no reason is not enough to trigger punishment. The system needs evidence.\n\n I totally get that people threatening to perma-ban your account can suck though. That's why Riot has made that kind of behaviour reportable and punishable, so next time you see it make sure to mute them and file a report at the end of the game.\n\n> _\"Players that cause problems in the game with their gameplay by not helping or not assisting causing other players to die\"_\n\n+ Yeah this has been a long standing problem in League. Mainly because it's very hard to detect these players :( \n\n Riot's working on better solutions, but in the meantime the best option is to report it normally or to send in a report directly to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). The more reports the system gets the better it gets at detecting bad behaviour.\n\nI hope that helped a bit, lemme know if you have any other questions :D","replies":[]}]}
