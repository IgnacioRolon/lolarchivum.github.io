Just wanted to come here asking why is it you're more likely to get perma ban for telling a blatant inter too go kill himself where as he gets a pass cause he only fucked the game for everyone on our team..... I get that you guys have very broad \"morals\" and \"rules\" on what passes as banable seeing as most of the people i check up on that have inted my games are still unbanned. This frustration i'm venting tipped at the point of a xin running down bot lvl 1 giving the very fun spam mid lane support mage a blue buff then spamming emotes all game while flash smiting his camps we tried too take cause he wasnt gonna take them anyway, which then my adc decided too afk and me also afking under my nexus turrets cause we got sick of the lane spam abuse (also so i could bm the fuck face that fucked the game for everyone) I get that it's a team game but being positive too people like that xin never works nor does being negative but i'd much rather tell him \"you're shit\" rather than \"bad luck\" seeing as shit talking in chat never changed the out come of the game just whether im aloud to play another.... with all that said all i wanna know is why can i get banned for being frustrated at \"video game\" in chat because of another person inting and get banned where as he may get a slap on the wrist with a 14 day ban....","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-20T09:11:36.501+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":">why is it you're more likely to get perma ban for telling a blatant inter too go kill himself where as he gets a pass cause he only fucked the game for everyone on our team\n\nNeither gets a pass in that scenario, but there are a few factors to consider. Telling someone to end their lives is a lot more clean-cut obvious than the intent behind a certain play. The result is, that while both break the rules and both are punishable, gameplay punishments tend to be slower than most would like, to ensure that people aren't being banned just for playing badly in a given game. \n\nIf you feel there was intentional griefing going on and that the system has failed to act, then you can submit a manual report through player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new. Do note though that manual reviews are a slow process, and that support cannot give you *any* information about another players account (privacy regulations), be it explicit or implicit, so you will get a generic \"thanks for the report\" type response.\n\nIt's also worth noting, that there is a wide spectrum on both sides of that argument. There are those that would argue that no chat should be punished because the mute option exists and that gameplay offences are much worse because you have no protection from them beyond afking. On the other hand, there are those that feel gameplay punishments aren't as serious because they only affect the game, whereas chat like \"kys\" has real-world meaning and real-world consequences and so should be treated much more harshly than gameplay.\n\nRiot has to land somewhere in the middle. It's an M rated game so there has to be some degree of chat moderation as an absolute minimum, especially when it comes to people being cavalier about something so permanent as *death* or things like racism/sexism/etcism. They also have to protect players from trolls, griefers, revenge feeders etc. In other words, both are important.\n\n>I get that it's a team game but being positive too people like that xin never works nor does being negative but i'd much rather tell him \"you're shit\" rather than \"bad luck\" seeing as shit talking in chat never changed the out come of the game\n\nExcept it does. A negative game experience is, if nothing else, distracting. No-one is playing their best in that game, least of all those directly involved.\n\n>why can i get banned for being frustrated at \"video game\" in chat because of another person inting and get banned where as he may get a slap on the wrist with a 14 day ban....\n\nIt sounds like you got perma'd if you're saying a 14-day is a slap on the wrist. If that's the case, then you got perma'd and not chat restricted/14-day banned (depending on the severity of the offence) because you have faced punishment before and not improved your behaviour. It explicitly warns you in the 14-day reform- card that any further offences will result in a permanent suspension, so this should not have been a surprise.\n\nAny other players brushing with the system will follow the same escalation path, generally 2 chat restrictions, a 14-day, then permanent. Gameplay offences or severe chat offences skip the two chat restrictions, but you will always receive that 14-day as a final warning (there are exceptions that to that, but for things like cheating not behavioural offences).","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-21T01:15:41.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"> Neither gets a pass in that scenario, but there are a few factors to consider.\n\nFalse, the troll will get the pass and continue to ruin the game, while this guy gets punished. \nDon't give false hope.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OutrageouslyGood","date":"2019-08-20T10:30:08.859+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"go ask telstra for help","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ooftman","date":"2019-08-19T21:51:33.691+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you do not see what you did wrong, i do not think the internet is the place for you.\n\nYou literally told someone to go kill themselves, for all you know that person is already suicidal and could harm themselves after that game because of the way you spoke to him, as much as griefing and inting is frustrating, telling someone to kill themselves will never been considered acceptable under any circumstance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-08-20T05:32:20.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"\"he may get a slap on the wrist with a 14 day ban\"\nHe won't even get that. \n\nUnfortunantly though, while i agree with you on the other part (solely because that kind of player is ridiculously common for me), because youve said something that falls under offensive, youve gotten punished.","replies":[]}]}
