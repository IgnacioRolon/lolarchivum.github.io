The slow on you would end, and the chase/fight would resume. Now, if you live long enough for the slow to end, you're doing well!\n\nBecause of how little time it takes a champion to kill you these days, slows _(as a separate form of CC)_ these days are pointless, they're basically snares that allow you to dash.\n\nRiot **HAS TO** ease back on the overall damage of the game, or it will very quickly reach a point where people just get sick of it and leave.\nAlready people are sick of it, its only a matter of time _(from what i see at least)_, before this issue causes league to nose dive. Many people seem to be playing the game out of habit now, not genuine enthusiasm, _(and I must admit, the score of recent changes appear to be pushing me towards that end as well.)_ Something needs to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"DrunkenMasterYi","date":"2018-04-12T11:10:30.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what your saying about the slow and the damge output, that hasted to be changed , unfortunately I doubt riot will look into slows,  they rather make or change a champ and give them 5000 dashes .\n\n Somthing elss that really annoys me but not related to this subject is,  one of my favourite champions that deserve visual update but don’t get it because rito wants to be cheap and make people buy  {{champion:77}} ultimate skin. Dear rito , I know udyr is a tad harder due to his 4 different models for his ability’s , you even mentioned it previously on a post but you know what, ever since that post on August 7, 2013  YOU ONLY HAD TIME SINCE THEN TO MAKE IT and it’s still not here. It’s not that you guys at design and in-game modeling crew can’t do it , it’s that you’re to lazy to do so","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-04-12T12:15:13.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Udyr will get a VU, that is inevitable, _(his particles are little cartoon animals that pop up above his head.... like come on.)_\nHis ultimate skin was a delay on that VU, but it will be coming eventually, _(probably with a gameplay rework as well though)_.\n\nThe only question is how important is he on Riot's list, obviously Akali and Nunu are next, how far Udyr is behind them, I cant say.\nBut unless Riot are living on Mars, they must be aware that little cartoon animal popups do not cut it in a game where complex and particle heavy champs like Aurelion Sol and Zoe exist.\n\nSo it _will_ come, but we cant be sure _when_ it will come.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-04-17T13:44:54.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yvfmIoTl,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2018-04-12T12:15:13.160+0000)\n>\n> Udyr will get a VU, that is inevitable, _(his particles are little cartoon animals that pop up above his head.... like come on.)_\n> His ultimate skin was a delay on that VU, but it will be coming eventually, _(probably with a gameplay rework as well though)_.\n> \n> The only question is how important is he on Riot&#x27;s list, obviously Akali and Nunu are next, how far Udyr is behind them, I cant say.\n> But unless Riot are living on Mars, they must be aware that little cartoon animal popups do not cut it in a game where complex and particle heavy champs like Aurelion Sol and Zoe exist.\n> \n> So it _will_ come, but we cant be sure _when_ it will come.\n\nThey better not touch my Akali.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
