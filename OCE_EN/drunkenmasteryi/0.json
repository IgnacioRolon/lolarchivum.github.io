Good to excellent chance he didn't call before you as, historically in my experience, players like this simply instalock their chosen champ and don't care about anything or anyone else except themselves and what *they* want. Even in his winning games he has a shitaweful KDA. This guy is **not** the norm and thankfully a minority in our community. Report him and then forget about him. Next game is a new game.","replies":[{"poster":"DrunkenMasterYi","date":"2016-10-18T12:06:17.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":D","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DrunkenMasterYi","date":"2016-10-10T06:31:20.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ChallengerYl,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=1WmM9Iki,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-09T13:11:06.341+0000)\n>\n> Have you ever just wanted to play your last game of the day ?
