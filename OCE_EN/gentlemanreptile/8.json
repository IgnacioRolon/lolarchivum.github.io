You just have to play accounting for what you lost. It's not a 'slim' chance.\n\nBut, I think this is a brilliant idea. If someone just does not connect to the game at any point, loss prevent should be enabled for that team if they do lose. Buuuuut, then you'd run into the wall of the team just not attempting to play in the first place because they know they'll get a loss prevented.\n\nPros and cons.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-21T02:26:07.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So easy to abuse, that's why.
