Join DeTox!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":9,"down_votes":0,"body":"After copping a 14 day ban for losing my marbles at our troll Kayle jungle (\"lel cant wait to lose\", walks into 5 enemies), I think I&#039;m finally exhausted with having typed screaming matches against bullcrap that is out of my control. \n\nWhat I would like to do, is create some kind of group or...community...thing...called DeTox. Something that can encourage behavior reform without the need for crawling out, mangled from underneath a banhammer. Something BY the LoL community, FOR the LoL community. Something where previously toxic asshole players can come forward, speak with groups of similar players, and talk about better things to do.\n\nI'm not sure how to structure it though. \n\nAnyone wanna help with this?","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-17T00:33:12.433+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a great idea, would love to hear about how it goes!

In all likelihood I'll just palm the idea of to someone with the resources to manage it. Whether it becomes a dinky little website in a dusty corner of the internet that a few dozen people visit once in a while, or a glossy new tentacle sprouting from the pulsating mass that is the ever growing Riot Games, is irrelevant to me. I just want to be helpful is some way.\n\nSo for now, ideas shall continue to be kicked around.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-19T00:10:10.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thoughts on creating a closed/private facebook group?

I wouldn't ever expect anyone to apologize for venting, it's just that in-game is the wrong place to do it. \n\nThink of your average League of Legends game as a dinner table. You've got ten people sitting at it, and they are all scrambling and cutting and slurping and snarfing down delicious turkey. During this meal (game match) there is occasionally gonna be some unpleasant drooling onto the fancy tablecloth by an unruly attendant. It might not be that bad, hell it might not even really be their fault...they may have been provoked or tricked or whatever...and now their filthy unwanted runoff and half chewed steak gristle (game abuse) is all over the table that everyone is trying to enjoy their meal on. \n\nNow if there were a garbage bin right next to the table to safely DISCARD all this unwanted junk in, the dinner would continue on much more smoothly. That is what I think League sorely lacks, a garbage bin for garbage attitude, because right now, it's got nowhere to go but all over the table.","replies":[{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2015-08-19T12:45:30.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://youtu.be/5o-503t8U3s","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-18T05:01:49.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is the \"other people\" are seeking a response, if you give them what they want of course they are going to continue.

The way I see it, it would be better if people had the option to join entirely anonymously (not having to reveal their LoL username or real life details, but still have the option to do so), be able to post in a forums/boards style environment describing their situation and get advice from other people on how they can become more positive (effectively changing their attitude). The problem with that, though, is you would need a few dedicated people to monitor, moderate and maintain the website as well as someone willing to make it (I have a friend who ***might*** be willing to help). Personally I think using Facebook would be a worse idea than using the LoL boards (for example), simply because it's revealing the identities of who people are in real life (even if they make no mention of their LoL username[s]).","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-08-18T14:24:34.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, but unfortunately its a frigging miracle I can even turn my computer ON, let alone build and manage a website.
