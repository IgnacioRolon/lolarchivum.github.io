Suffice to say this champion would have stats similar to someone like Talon or Wukong....high damage output in bursts with a bit of tank potential but not a sustained shredder like Riven or Fiora and certainly not a heavy brawler like Darius or Cho'Gath. My field is more the storytelling and descriptive parts of the character, so here's my idea for a new champion, Raxis: The Putrid Scavenger. \n\nBroken, welted skin, frayed stinking feathers and eyes red like demons blood, Raxis has long haunted the skies of Runeterra...his aching wail piercing the stagnant air of his surroundings as he searches constantly for leftover flesh to rake from the bone. Raxis is a tall, thin monstrosity, with bony arms and legs complete with long grasping talons, feathered wings like curtains torn straight from the blackness of midnight and a cursed hunger that never allows him to feel completely full. Raxis and his flock of fetid vultures have long performed cleanup duties for the endless slaughters that take place on Runeterra, but he has now invaded the League of Legends with hopes of an endless supply of gore to satiate his agonizing hunger. \n\nGameplay:\n\nRaxis is an assasin/fighter hybrid, excelling at separating high priority targets from mobs of adversaries while surveying the landscape for the dead and dying. \n\n\n\nPassive:  Gore Hunger\nNearby death excites Raxis, and encourages him to seek more. Every minion and monster that dies within his vicinity leaves behind a flesh pile, which can be collected up to a stack of 20. At 20 stacks, Raxis' basic attacks and abilities are empowered with a damage over time effect that decays after a short while. Raxis can also smell the deaths of large monsters in a vast area around him. \n\n\nQ:    Bone Break       12 second cooldown (activation window of 3 seconds, effect duration of 3 seconds, renewed for each successful bite)\nRaxis empowers his next four basic attacks to shatter his preys bones, reducing their basic attack damage by a significant amount for a short time. The more times Raxis lands his bites, the more oppressive the damage reduction. \n\n\nW:    Victimize     9 second cooldown\nRaxis launches himself at an enemy champion, monster or minion, driving them to the ground and mauling them for 1 second rendering them unable to attack or move. \n\n\nE:      Wing Blast      10 second cooldown\nRaxis flaps his putrid wings hard, launching himself  backward and knocking back any enemy champions who stand near him. If Raxis has a target Victimised, he will carry the target with him, which can be used to increase the duration of the maul to 1.5 seconds.\n\n\nR (Ultimate): Prey on the Helpless     90 second cooldown\nPassive: All enemies below 35% health are visible to Raxis and his allies.\nActive: Raxis leaps into the air and glides menacingly, reducing the vision and fearing anyone he glides over. Raxis is immune to basic attacks while gliding, but not abilities.\n\n\nThrives against: Vayne, Katarina, Aatrox, Nidalee, Teemo, Zed, Master Yi, Kallista\n\nAgile champions that rely on their evasion to stay alive and dish out damage in a duel are going to have a tough time against Raxis. His Victimization combo (activate Q, attack with W, seperate with E) makes him an excellent counter to some of the leagues more slippery glass cannons and immobile mages. \n\nStruggles against: Lissandra, Leona, Mordekaiser, Trundle, Riven, Alistair, Amumu, Fiddlesticks\n\nChampions such as these love nothing more than for their opponents to make it personal and get in close. Given the nature of Raxis' abilities, he will have a very difficult time dealing with champions who excel at creating their own battlefield and radiating powerful AOE disruption.

I wanted his Q to be some sort of debilitating attack that serves to cripple enemies he victimizes and carries off, but I also needed him to be able to survive somewhat in a duel so he doesn't just get blown up. And honestly I couldn't even think of an ult, I just wanted some sort of gliding mechanic that looks cool. I still cant think of one that synergises well. ","replies":[]}]}]}
