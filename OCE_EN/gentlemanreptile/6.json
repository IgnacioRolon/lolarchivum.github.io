Hell, you can even solo the dragon at lvl 2, just start blue, take Q + W and proceed to stomp dragon pre 4 minutes. Once you have both your buffs, around lvl 3/4 there isn't a jungler in the game (except maybe leesin) that can beat you in a 1v1. You then scale into lategame as an unkillable tank that still puts out decent damage because of spamming Q and true damage on E.\nThe only problem with olaf jung (and olaf in general really) is that in exchange for his incredibly strong early game, you fall off hard late as you just get kited super hard, especially with all the \"meta\" champs having some sort of dash(es) or cc to throw at you, and your ult isnt going to be up all the time to stop it.\n\nTLDR: Olaf jung only really works with/vs a specific kind of team, either your team needs plenty of cc (liss top , ahri mid , any adc + leona/thresh etc as an example), or they need to be relatively immobile ({{champion:222}} ,{{champion:61}} ,{{champion:1}} ,{{champion:96}} ,{{champion:16}} ,etc) and olaf will work well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-03-17T00:17:06.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at one point he had the fastest clear speed of any jungle. and could negate the enemy jungler by destroying their camps WHILE 1vs1 and 1vs2ing in their jungle.\nthen he got what is known as olafed. which was a massive nerf/rework that hurt him in such a way that he couldnt do anything well.\n\natm his jungling is decently strong and fast, but not fast enough to give him a massive level advantage from fast farming. his ganks are fine if you can land a slow, his damage is huge and he can become really tanky. but if you cant land skill shots...you can get kited easily.\noverall, its the player....\nlike vi, extremely simple and easy...but people still fail miserably as her in the jungle.","replies":[]}]}
