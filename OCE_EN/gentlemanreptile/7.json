The one time he did group with us was for a few seconds, just as he left the enemy ganked us, killed us and did you know where he was?\n\nWe were in the inhibitor tower bot lane just outside their base, he was in the same place in mid, while we were being ganked, while I was constantly pinging him and after I died typing for him to help, he ignored us like he did for the entire game and lo and behold, blamed us for the lose.\n\nEvery time I looked at the map he was in a lane with no enemies, in the jungle, running away or doing something to not help us, but no, according to him it was our fault for losing.\n\nLike you, I started nicely asking for him to group, but some 20 minutes later I was not so nice. After this game being in a long line of very similar games I like many others finally came to the conclusion, fuck it, no matter what you do there will always be that one ass monger who cares more about his own existence than anything else on earth and will inevitably end up in your game to just ruin it.\n\nAll you can do is try your best, report them and move on. The quicker you can discern that type of player means the faster you will notice if they are in your game, try your best to win, and simply brace yourself for the lose, it hurts less that way.","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-26T12:37:25.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You know what the most tragic part is?\n\nReporting the selfish afk ass nugget for refusal to communicate/negative attitude and so on means absolutely nothing to the banning system. From what I've seen, literally the only thing that matters is triggering curse word sensors and report volume. You can behave HOWEVER you like so long as you don't actually swear.\n\nThis is the kind of thing Dunkey griped about in his \"last\" League vid. \n\n\"Now, there is so much wrong with this. First, why am I being banned for talking shit in a videogame? I can understand being banned for cheating, or going afk a bunch of times, or picking Orianna ad carry or feeding on purpose, but talking shit to some guy that is a total dumbass? What is this? Fucking pussy ass baby pre-school time?\" I might as well just play the bots if you want people to act like robots Riot.\"\n\nAnd he's right. Hell just look at the comments on that video...people get banned for swearing in a full pre-made team, but toxic douchebags who go out of their way to screw with people get virtually zero punishment whatsoever. Riot is hilariously amateur and naive when it comes to this sort of thing. They don't look at the support tickets you send them properly (I had my account permabanned because I asked for help regarding other players who were THREATENING ME WITH MY PERSONAL DETAILS, and it took them three days and me asking them what they hell they've done to realize they fucked up), they don't take individual games into account, they dont own up to any mistakes they've made, they cant be bothered to get off their ass and fix peoples unfair bans when their servers go down...they just go by this blanket program that indiscriminately punishes people for swearing. And as we all know, swearing in a videogame makes you Super-Hitler.\n\nThey are trying their best to \"PG-ify\" their game using an indiscriminate and unfair banning system and it just aint gonna happen. \n\nThink of League of Legends as a nice dinner in a fancy house. Everything is well presented, was worked hard on can be enjoyed by anyone who sits at the table. Unfortunately, people tend to be messy eaters. They drool, drop things on the floor, spill their drink and fart noisily. You are NOT going to change this happening by kicking everyone who does it (intentionally or otherwise) out of the house...you are just going to look like an elitist asshole. \n\nIf League is a fancy dinner in a nice house, what it lacks is a refuse basket...where guests can appropriately offhand all their feral uneaten scraps and partially chewed napkins into something that isn't part of the proper table. Because right now, all that shit is getting spread out in-front of everyone and getting on the fine china..making the host uncomfortable and embarrassing him infront of his snooty neighbor. \n\nPut simply, League needs a dumping ground for the inherent anger and frustration it tends to cause. A forum, a website, a Facebook page.....SOMETHING. Just somewhere people can collectively offload their League related rage in a completely safe and consequence free zone.
