The player did however, lose both his lane turrets by the TEN MINUTE MARK at this point, so even if I was directing it at him (which I wasn&#039;t) it would have been more than justified. When I say &quot;ff please, bad team is bad, fucking 4v5 again&quot; It&#039;s because...in typical fashion...our Naut jungle has dc&#039;d.....so tell me why this shouldn&#039;t frustrate me? Or anyone for that matter? Of course I&#039;m gonna say my team is bad when our top laner has lost both his turrets within 12 minutes and our jungler has dc&#039;d. It&#039;s not even specifically directed at anyone...it&#039;s just frustration. Riot do you have a problem with frustration in general? What the hell is wrong with you people?\n\nThis to me, is proof that the banning system IS NOT actually read over by a person, but by an automated system. You cannot seriously tell me...that the Olaf who told me hes going to rape my mother and hopes she dies....that I&#039;m the one who gets a frigging permaban? \n\nLIKE REALLY RIOT?\n\nI want a Rioter to comment on this with a serious justification as to why this pathetic little transcript is worth you people making off with the $150 bucks PLUS ive spent on my account. I mean really...really ask yourselves....is this worth killing a persons account for? This? Really? \n\nStop letting a program do your work for you Riot, you should be judging this on an individual basis and actually reading the transcript yourselves....not just allowing unwarranted reports to be piled up on an account (because believe it or not, people will just report for the hell of it). You say at the top of the ban that it was the result of an &quot;extensive in-game audit&quot;. \n\nWell tell me this, how the hell is it an extensive audit when the ban was handed down twenty seconds after I left the lobby? You aren&#039;t doing extensive audits, you are just letting your stupid program hand out punishments and this is completely undeserved.\n\nOh and lets not forget those server issues you were having a few weeks ago....those issues which caused me to cop an unfair leaverbuster penalty you outright refused to do anything about.

You'd just have been a d!ck if you were directing it at the player, which I'm going to assume is the case because you're a generally toxic player.\n\n> so tell me why this shouldn't frustrate me?

Why should other people have to put up with your sh!t attitude just because someone is doing something you don't like, regardless whether they're bad at the game or not?\n\n> It's not even specifically directed at anyone...\n\nI guess that's proven by you constantly calling your team bad and generally insulting them...

You've mad the experience terrible for other players. Accept the consequences and get over yourself, you're not that special.\n\n> Stop letting a program do your work for you Riot, you should be judging this on an individual basis and actually reading the transcript yourselves\n\n**News flash**: Riot employees actually look over the cases up for bans.

MY TEAM WERE LAUGHING ABOUT IT WITH ME! AS WELL AS THE ENEMY TEAM!\nSee those '^' marks? Couple of them in a row. They were both from teammates commenting on the shlttiness of the team in EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER. But oh no...I'm a menace that needs to be stopped yeah?\n\n\"Yes. You've mad the experience terrible for other players. Accept the consequences and get over yourself, you're not that special.\"\n\nNot that special? Couldn't agree more. Terrible experience for other players? If your idea of a terrible experience is someone swearing at you over the internet, then you might as well just lock yourself in a steel room and never talk to anyone for the rest of your life. Riot are trying to breed this absurd idea that being told off during a videogame is the end of the world. This is cotton-wooling, and it makes them look like aan overprotective mother trying to shield little Timmy from the other boys on the playground who do horrible evil things like fart and play with bugs. \n\n\"News flash: Riot employees actually look over the cases up for bans. Serious punishment calls for serious attention, they wont let an automated system give someone a ban without looking over the case first.\"\n\nHAHAHAHA no they don't. I'm actually glad you brought this up. About a month ago, a pair of players had somehow (I have no idea how) tracked down my personal details, including my real name and address, and were threatening me with it in game. I sent an assistance ticket to Riot, who then proceeded to BAN MY ACCOUNT because they didn't read the request properly. It took them almost a full day and multiple emails from me before they realized what they had done, and they didn't even apologize. \nPh and ontop of that, remember those server issues they were having a few weeks back? Where people could not connect properly and were getting dropped from games? Yeah I copped a leaverbuster penalty for that and they refused to do anything about it. \nThey DO NOT take this stuff seriously at all.\n\n\"And they get marked as false reporters, meaning their reports do nothing.\"\n\nThis is a myth. The reports themselves might be empty, but the program Riot uses remembers every one that is assigned to an account. Meaning if enough duds go through, it will WILL the odds against you. \n\n\"Because this behavior has existed for a series of games, not just one. If you consistently break the rules expect to be banned, it's really that simple.\"\n\nLook when all is said and done, I am fully aware that I'm not always a pleasant teammate. I can get cranky and call people dumbasses...but does that make me the second coming of Hitler? A menace that needs to be stopped? Yeah I don't think so. Out of all the abusive, wretched assholes I've met on this game, I would never EVER tell any single one of them that they don't have the right to play just because they want to run their mouth. I can understand banning people for breaking the mechanical rules of the game (scripting, hacking other, basically cheating), and I can understand banning people who constantly go out of their way to try and lose the game by running down lane and feeding a tonne of kills....but banning people who call other people a dumbass? What kind of sooky pre-school naughty corner bullcrap is that?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-11-09T11:14:18.773+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youve had plenty of warnings, I think that fact alone and that you've made very little effort to change your ways warrants a permaban.","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-11-09T11:21:26.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a matter of fact, I've made plenty of strides in the right direction.\n\nFive months ago, I would have told this Olaf to choke on a dick and shit sandwich.\n\nThree months ago, I would have told him to take his ass back to bots and stay there.\n\nToday? \n\n-bg, hyper bad olaf player and his awful champion\n-is this about my mother?\n-ok...what else?\n-do you have something to add? or was that it? yawn* anything else?\n-report olaf pls\n\nWanna take a few guesses as to how he was speaking to me there?\n\nThat's the problem with Riots stupid automated program.
