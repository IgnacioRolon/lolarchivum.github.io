What is NOT fine and dandy is people who are so pathetic that they take enjoyment in actively ruining someone elses fun by being terrible. \n\nYeah of course we all make mistakes. I happen to learn that %%%% as a five year old too, funnily enough. What I'm sick to death of is the mistakes of others ruining the effort I have put in. \n\nThe part you are forgetting is that I'm only one player....and no matter how much I improve my skills I'm still not going to be able to carry a team that feeds ten %%%%ing kills in five %%%%ing minutes and loses two towers and a dragon before the fifteen minutes mark. \n\nSometimes...it IS just genuinely a crap team and it's their fault.
