From what I&#039;ve seen, literally the only thing that matters is triggering curse word sensors and report volume. You can behave HOWEVER you like so long as you don&#039;t actually swear.\n\nThis is the kind of thing Dunkey griped about in his &quot;last&quot; League vid. \n\n&quot;Now, there is so much wrong with this. First, why am I being banned for talking shit in a videogame? I can understand being banned for cheating, or going afk a bunch of times, or picking Orianna ad carry or feeding on purpose, but talking shit to some guy that is a total dumbass? What is this? Fucking pussy ass baby pre-school time?&quot; I might as well just play the bots if you want people to act like robots Riot.&quot;\n\nAnd he&#039;s right. Hell just look at the comments on that video...people get banned for swearing in a full pre-made team, but toxic douchebags who go out of their way to screw with people get virtually zero punishment whatsoever. Riot is hilariously amateur and naive when it comes to this sort of thing. They don&#039;t look at the support tickets you send them properly (I had my account permabanned because I asked for help regarding other players who were THREATENING ME WITH MY PERSONAL DETAILS, and it took them three days and me asking them what they hell they&#039;ve done to realize they fucked up, and they still didn&#039;t fix what I asked them to), they don&#039;t take individual games into account, they don&#039;t own up to any mistakes they&#039;ve made, they cant be bothered to get off their ass and fix peoples unfair bans when their servers go down...they just go by this blanket program that indiscriminately punishes people for swearing. And as we all know, swearing in a videogame makes you Super-Hitler.\n\nThey are trying their best to &quot;PG-ify&quot; their game using an indiscriminate and unfair banning system and it just aint gonna happen. The reason Graves cant have a cigar is the same reason you and I cant tell the player who just tried and failed for the 4th consecutive time to take on the entire enemy team what a giant unrelenting dumbass he is.\n\nThink of League of Legends as a nice dinner in a fancy house. Everything is very well presented, was worked hard on can potentially be enjoyed by anyone who sits at the table. Unfortunately, people tend to be messy eaters. They drool, drop things on the floor, spill their drink and fart noisily. You are NOT going to change this happening by kicking everyone who does it (intentionally or otherwise) out of the house...you are just going to look like an elitist asshole and throw away potential customers. \n\nIf League is a fancy dinner in a nice house, what it lacks is a refuse basket...where guests can appropriately offhand all their feral uneaten scraps and partially chewed napkins into something that isn&#039;t part of the proper table. Because right now, all that shit is getting spread out in-front of everyone and getting on the fine china..making the host uncomfortable and embarrassing him in front of his snooty neighbors. \n\nPut simply, League needs a dumping ground for the inherent anger and frustration it tends to cause. A forum, a website, a Facebook page.....SOMETHING. Just somewhere people can collectively offload their League related rage in a completely safe and consequence free zone. \n\nBoilers have steam release valves. High end computers have water cooling. Fireplaces have chimneys. Washing machines have dump tubes. Coal trains have smoke stacks. Virgins have Sonic fanfiction. League needs its own pressure release mechanism. \n\nBecause THIS.....all of THIS whats happening now....it aint working sunshine. There are moba games with voice chat and they don&#039;t have half the perceived toxicity problem League has...and I believe a good portion of that is because Riot are trying to wrap everything in cotton wool and turn their game environment into widdle babies safe fluffy playpen where everyone draws pictures of rainbows and smiles all the time and joins hands to sing kumbaya. \n\nWell guess what Riot? Cotton wool burns pretty damn easily, and you are trying to wrap some pretty fiery people in it. If you don&#039;t bring that waste paper basket to your lovely dinner table or at least put in a chimney to relieve all the smoke from the burning cotton wool, your whole damn house is going to be burnt to cinders.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-26T20:34:58.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why didn't you just put Dunkey's video up on when he said that.( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzgbZL12VI ) and I quote with proof even as a supporter to Dunkey(meatwadsprite) \"Malphite you are a f♥♥♥ing worthless braindead scumf♥♥♥ bast♥♥♥ pile of trash mental d♥♥♥face that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate you are.\"\n\nI don't mind a little bit of toxic behavior, but Dunkey's toxicness was way over the line, I do believe Dunkey should have been banned to chat for a while. But, I also know that Malphite should have bans to for feeding purposely and his MMR should be shot down a lot.\n\nP.S. also upset that Dunkey quit League.:(","replies":[{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-27T04:00:47.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didnt put the whole video up because there was only one part of it I wanted to reference.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"nononotorious","date":"2015-10-27T00:12:02.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well spoke cuzzing.","replies":[]}]}
