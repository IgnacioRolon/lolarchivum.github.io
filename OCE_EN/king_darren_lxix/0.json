Her 'Vulnerable' proc is clearly marked on the enemy yet when I auto them, it only does auto damage and leaves the mark on them. I am not sure if a second auto will proc it as it has only happened while harassing and after the auto I've walked away. This has happened to me maybe 20 times over the hundred or so games I've played with her so it is a rare occurrence though still quite annoying in-game.\r\n\r\nThere doesn't appear to be a clear circumstance for this (although possibly walking out of auto range?) so I can't give much information in that area. I do only remembering it happening to Yasuo, (in 3 recent games) but could have been other champs though it was to long ago to remember.\r\n\r\nTo put it basically. Very rarely Quinn will not proc her Vulnerable mark but WILL still deal normal auto-attack damage implying a hit was still made and not just a visual bug or cancelled auto. Her Vulnerable mark still remained after the auto-attack.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions I will answer to my best ability. Have a nice day :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T01:00:22.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is this a recent thing?
