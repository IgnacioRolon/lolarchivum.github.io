When it comes down to it, whether it was said jokingly or not is not the issue, it's more about whether this was said in team chat during a match where your were with strangers. Quite simply, exhibiting such behaviour, even jokingly, is not only very risky in \"public\" situations, but generally someone is going to take offence and submit a report (and it only takes one report to trigger a review).\n\nIf you want to engage in such \"activities\" in \"private\" scenarios (such as being in a pre-made of 5, where you're sure no one present will take offence), that's not (so much of) an issue and most people wont care if you do so (more than a few people do the same kind of thing). Just keep in mind not to \"joke\" with reports in those kinds of situations, as that can also trigger punishments. The bottom line here, however, is that you (presumably) did so in a \"public\" scenario, took the risk, offended someone (whether that was your intention or not) and subsequently got reported and punished (it's important to note that \"homophobia\" is right up there with other \"high severity\" offences like racism and suicide encouragement).\n\nIn regards to the severity of the punishment, that may or may not be appropriate to the situation (again, more information regarding the case and your \"punishment history\" would help determine that). If you believe the punishment was made in error, or that you received a more severe punishment than you deserve, you can appeal the suspension by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) and they will go through the appeal process with you. Keep in mind, the chances of them doing anything because \"it was a joke\" is negligible, at *best*, especially if it did occur in a \"public\" scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-22T13:17:02.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The word used was a variation of the homophobic slur like you guessed. You pretty much covered everything :) Whether OP's friend (and the friend part is questionable from the log) takes offence or not isn't the issue, it's ultimately still a slur used in a public setting. \n\nIt was likely an instant 14 day ban which given the context *might* have a very *slim* chance of being reduced to a chat restriction via Support, but either way the no tolerance policy holds here and some punishment will remain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-08-22T07:08:32.630+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, if suicide encouragement is a \"high severity\" offense then why have i been told to kill myself countless times, i always report the player (its at least 10+ players at this point) and never have a single one of them been even chat restricted?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-22T08:16:43.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm curious as to how you would actually know if they've been chat restricted, as there's literally no systems (Riot official or third party) that would give such an indication on other players (it's a bit different with bans as various third party sites can allow you to view a players match history, which may or may not give an indication of a ban depending on gaps in play).\n\nSo far as how often it occurs in-game, it can differ greatly from player to player. Personally, I rarely, if ever, see such severe offences in-game. When I do encounter toxicity, it's usually some pretty mild stuff, and I know a few people who have similar experiences. That said, I also encounter plenty of people such as yourself that seem/claim to have what is effectively the opposite experience, where they encounter much more severe toxicity much more frequently. Honestly, I don't have any logical explanation for it, outside of the possibility of some secret \"prisoner's island\" system existing within the game, though Riot has previously stated they don't want to use such a system.","replies":[{"poster":"Cortez","date":"2018-08-23T09:12:16.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally all they have to do is misspell one word or miss a letter and nothing ever happens, stuff like this is whats wrong with the league community, is the game competitive yes, is it frustrating at times yes but that doesn't mean that people should be getting away with telling people to commit suicide or using racial/sexual slurs. I encounter at least two cases of this a week. I report them every time and still nothing ever happens. Out of the massive amount of reports i have sent i have only ever received one notif back which said they got a warning for inting. I think it would be much better if riot had people to check chat related reports so that people get away with simply by saying 'yoself' instead of 'yourself'.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-23T11:08:37.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you bring up the IFS notifications, I feel it's prudent to mention that those notifications seem to be largely unreliable in regards to how they *should* work. To clarify, it seems that the notification will typically only notify the most recent reporter when action is taken, only notifying more than one reporter on occasion (which seems to be rather rare, from what I can gather), and it may even fail to notify *anyone* at times. For a while after it's initial release, back when they would only notify the most recent reporter, the IFS notifications seemed to be rather reliable, but more recently it seems Riot has *attempted* to expand that without much luck, which may be causing the notifications to become more unreliable. Hopefully the situation improves, but I wouldn't expect it.\n\nAs for this \"misspelling abuse\" thing, you can try using the \"comment\" option when submitting reports in such cases, simply stating that the offending player \"may be intentionally misspelling abuse/insults to avoid punishment\" (or something along those lines), which may improve the chances of them getting picked up by the system and/or being manually reviewed. I honestly don't think it would *guarantee* to avoid punishment, as seems to be the implication with your statements, but I can definitely understand the concern about it improving the chances of them avoiding punishment, and the best way to combat that may be proper use of the \"report comments\" feature when submitting reports.\n\nIf it comes to it, and you feel like the post-game reports aren't enough in such situations, you can also try submitting a ticket directly to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us), though you'll likely just receive a \"generic copy-paste response\" and wont be informed if the player receives a punishment (not even via IFS, when done via tickets).\n\nBeyond that, I can't really think of anything else that may improve the chances of such players being picked up by the system and subsequently punished, though if you have more concerns about it you can feel free to voice them (others may have further advice to give, and it's possible, however unlikely it may be, that one of the Rioters may take notice and bring attention to those concerns internally).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asurine","date":"2018-08-25T11:32:40.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea tbh riot should punish the player for doing shit like that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Siv HA","date":"2018-08-23T00:54:21.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LMAO F","replies":[]}]}
