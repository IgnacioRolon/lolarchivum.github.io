I will click the league icon on my desktop and the patcher and launcher opens fine. When I click on the launch button it doesn't open the client the first couple of times. I then either have to re-open the patcher and it will close it or I can open task manager and close it from there. It shows that the program is running however I don't get the window pop-up. Is there anybody else having this issue or any way I can resolve it? \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T03:27:44.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your screen resolution?","replies":[]}]}
