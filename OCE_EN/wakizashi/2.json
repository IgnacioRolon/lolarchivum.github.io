When I&#039;m tabbed out of league while searching for a match, I&#039;ll quite often hear the &quot;Match Found&quot; sound, but even if I tab back to league within about half a second it tells me I&#039;ve failed to respond (and sometimes if I click accept it comes up with &quot;Active Game Not Found&quot;).  Occasionally when I actually tab over fast enough to see the timer itself, I can see it cancel itself and bring up the failed to respond popup, even when the timer hasn&#039;t even reached the halfway mark.  Used to not be so bad, but recently it feels like it&#039;s gotten worse and the client has started telling me I&#039;ll be punished if I keep failing to respond, which forces me to do nothing but sit and stare at the client for up to 5 minutes while waiting for a game.\r\n\r\nAnyone else had this?","replies":[]}
