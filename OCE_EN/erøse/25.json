AD carries are getting stronger and stronger and they nerf the assassin who has one of the most counterplay (Zhonyas,QSS).How are you suppose to burst down an AD carry with that amount of speed for your q.It is easily dodgeable right now.This patch I can make the case that zed is probably one of the weakest AD assassin and probably the less feared AD mid laner.Played against a zed in lane and he barely made any q's on me because it was so easily dodgeable.Rip zed :( Enjoyed playing you when you were still fun.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-12T19:31:43.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"can u pls stop he is literally not even that bad...","replies":[{"poster":"Jakonatore","date":"2015-11-12T22:04:50.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-11-13T06:43:01.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For what it's worth, I was S5 just yesterday, though I've been dcing a lot as of late since my net has fucked up and has plummeted my MMR.\n\nI was never arguing that Zed was in a good spot, I think he's stronger now than he was before, by a LOT, his itemisation options are excellent. I've only played one Zed game this patch but he is FINE. Playability-wise tjat is. Viability? Probably not very good since there are just too many ways to counter Zed right now. \n\nZed does have a lot more over other champions than just a stronger laning phase though, he's a great split pusher and has near unrivalled 1v1 if played correctly. \n\nHe also did see a fair bit of pro play in Season 5 just so you know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-11-13T04:21:49.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jakonatore,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=b3Yifd2r,comment-id=00010000000000000000000000010000,timestamp=2015-11-12T22:04:50.270+0000)\n>\n> Please, you're bronze 1.

so affected by the q speed.My last game zed was horrible..I keep forgetting the changes and just ult out knowing that my q would hit their adc bunt unforunately due to the speed of the q I make far
