I&#039;ve been seeing so much post lately about players getting banned without any reason. Some players are getting banned over the use of a HARMLESS 3rd party program and some players are getting banned because they are getting reported by trolls. I had a friend who quit league cause he was banned for &quot;scripting&quot; even though he just practiced at side stepping and dodging skill shots. He sent riot a support ticket and 2 weeks later, no reply. I really see no excuses why rioters are unable to reply to post, if they do not have enough people simply just hire more people. While we are on this topic, I really feel like league of legends is dying slowly, season 4 was the last time league of legends was really fun without all those nerf and bs buff. I really liked it when league of legends was a fun and simple game where it was just dragon and baron and champions were not that bs and they were really fun. Now what do we have? Rift herald, elemental dragons, BS champions likes garen who goes full tank and can delete an adc, Zed who can fk an adc cause QSS has been changed( I love zed but I really liked it when the game was fair and simple to play) and fizz who can fk anyone up late game. Also the skins, many champions have not received a skin for over 2-3 years now and champions like katarina and nidalee are getting shit tons of skins. League of legends season 1-4 was no doubt the peak of league of legends if I had to say, many would disagree but this is my opinion. Based on riot they are trying to make the game fair but yet we have a yasuo who just needs 2 items to get 100% crit and the other items can be lifesteal so he is really hard to kill, we have tanks who builds full tank and kill an adc in a blink of an eye. I would not be surprised if there are many league of legends who would quit sooner or later, many of my friends have already quit the game. I miss season 1-4 so much. It was so fun and now it&#039;s turning into... idk.\n\n\n\nIt&#039;s my opinion, if you disagree then feel free to.  \n\n\nMuch love &lt;3\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-05-24T05:03:08.117+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"If 3rd party programs are \"harmless\" then why use them at all?

If you don't enjoy the changes, don't play like many have decided. If you do enjoy the changes and direction the game is going then continue to play.\n\nAll that matters is what you do, enjoy playing the game, provide ( constructive ) feedback or don't and play other games, it's not the end of the world.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-24T09:23:57.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, i'm stating my opinion.

The last two seasons, Riot has constantly been changing things rapidly. So that if you played in January 2016, and took a break until March, the game would be different, and then you took another break until May, the game would again be different. Back in season 4 there were 21 patches, but only the last one was when they introduced a new map and huge changes, the rest were just small balance adjustments. Wish it were like that again.\n\nJust an example of how silly all of these recent changes have been... since 5.22 the marksman items have been nerfed so much that we are back in a tank meta. 5.22 was great, the closest to season 4 when the carries and not the stupids like tank EKKO or FIZZ actually did the most damage on the team.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=trolledallmylife,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=PdAhexwe,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-24T07:48:18.057+0000)\n>\n> Riot will never change as long as they are making money!\n> \n> This is FACT!\n> \n> They will change when they start losing money like all stupid companies!\n\nUnfortunately true. What \"stupid companies\" don't realise is that to keep their playerbase happy, they should listen to them, otherwise they are short term, and could have been so much longer term.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Z3npachi,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=PdAhexwe,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-24T05:03:08.117+0000)\n>\n> If 3rd party programs are &quot;harmless&quot; then why use them at all? \n\nHarmless does not mean useless. Even Sneaky uses third party programs to show him the players, their runes and masteries, etc, before the game begins. It's more convenient than looking them up on a website. Harmless and doesn't give him any special advantages in game, but more convenient.\n\nI think Riot already reversed a few faulty bans on players for this however, which is good.

Dynamic queue is a joke. Here are some more absolute catastrophes that I spectated recently:\n\n[3 games of unbalanced teams in dynamic queue](http://imgur.com/a/Fgm4c)\n\nRemember solo queue when you could not duo with anyone more than a tier above or below you?\n\nP.S. In the first game, LGC Carbon got absolutely stomped... three Platinums cannot compete with three Diamonds on a team. Game was so retarded. To his credit though, Carbon didn't say anything back when people were bm-ing him during the game.\nIn the second game, apparently Challengers can be placed with Golds and Platinums now. And in the last game, well you work it out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-05-24T07:48:18.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot will never change as long as they are making money!\n\nThis is FACT!\n\nThey will change when they start losing money like all stupid companies!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-05-24T07:38:04.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let me get this out there, again.\n\n_**Riot gives no shits for those who do not premake teams, nor do they care for low ranked players.**_\n\nRiot needs to change how the reward systems work for EVERYONE and allow solo, low ranked players get rewarded for THEIR OWN EFFORT and not those of anyone else.\n\nNow let me explain in detail.\n\n* There is a scorecard system, this allows you to gain rank based not on how well YOU play that specific champion, but how well you play that champion in relation to all other players in your region who also play that same champion.\n* There is also the IP reward system that gives you IP for how well you play.\n* You also have a win/lose counter that shows your wins and loses.\n* Than the most important is the LP gain and lose for ranked games, that is tied in with the wins and loses.\n\nFor all four of those rewards, they are very closely tied to premade teams, that is if you play solo you have less IP gain as teams get a bonus, but you also have more chance of getting bad players on your team and therefore less chance to actually win the game.\n\nIt has been proven time and time again, that no matter how well you play individually, sometimes you simply cannot win, ever. I refer back to my best game I have ever played, ranked with Yi in the jungle. I got close to 1 million damage and 250K player damage, over 40 kills and yet still lost no thanks to my team getting something like 5 kills combined and almost no assists.\n\nWhat did I get for that lose? The same LP lose that the rest of my team got. Yeh I may have gotten and S score, but that is the only benefit I got out of that game. I kept my team in it for almost an hour for nothing and if I had of known how it would have turned out I would have given up and let the enemy win, the end result would have been no different.\n\nWhat I have been suggesting since the start of S6 is to implement a personal scoring system, this will not only benefit those who play well and lose since it should still give them a +score and some LP gain, but also place those who troll and purposely make life hard for others while reporting for no reason and therefore getting players banned who don't deserve it, it will also place those who can actually play, regardless if they are premade or not, into a higher rank/MMR and therefore against players who actually know what skill is, rather than simply assuming they are hacking.\n\nThis will fix a few problems we are currently facing:\n1. Players who are actually bad, not just premade good and solo bad, will end up being at the bottom of the trash pile and can NEVER be carried to a higher rank. This not only fixes the 'high ranked' players who are not high rank, but stops elo boosting services.\n2. Players who report and blame for no reason, will only be able to do so against those who are bad and deserve reporting. This means those who are actually good and can 'script' without scripting will be seen as skillful and not just \"OMG you are a bot\".\n3. Players who are genuinely good, not just premade good, will rise in rank regardless of ANY REASON other than their own skill.\n4. It will give players a real reason to try to the end of the game, not just give up when the game is over and therefore gain more LP, IP, MMR and a better scorecard to show that they are actually good, and not just getting lucky.\n\nThere can be nothing bad gained from implementing a personal scorecard system, there never can be. if a player decides he is going to play for themselves and not help the team, just because they can play well and don't care for the win, yeh they may gain SOME bonuses, but that will only get them so far. If a good player was to play for the team, their own score can only get better and get them to a much higher rank where it actually matters that you play as a team.\n\nThey also need to implement how premades are matched, that is if a platinum player was to group with a bronze, the bronze player has to suffer and play with platinum players in all queues. It is not fair that it averages out and matches a high ranked player with a lower rank giving the even lower rank an almost free win and free rank gains.","replies":[]}]}
