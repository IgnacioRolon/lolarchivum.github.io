Are you kidding me? A new passive for malzhar?? He is broken enough already and now he gets a shield that reduces damage output from enemies? Malzhar ults our adc and that&#039;s it she is dead. Meanwhile our ad assassins are nerfed talon,zed. 20 second cooldown on zed&#039;s w and reduced damage? Omy riot, you guys really love mages and hate ad assassins.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant just kinda pissed how they always give the mages the upperhand.\r\n\r\nI might be wrong","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-20T00:54:28.008+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is reworking each class of champions. \n\nStarted with the[ juggernaut update](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/gameplay-update-juggernauts) last year, [marksman update](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html) during preseason and now the mage update. Another class rework is rumoured to be happening at the end of the year, and [assassins are looking like a strong choice for that round.](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Ht0BVKL6-meddler-if-i-may-ask?comment=000200010000)\n\nMages haven't always had the upper hand, infact, they are pretty under appreciated compared to their AD counterparts (zed/talon/yasuo almost every game). The new ability changes and items will allow them to better fit the meta and stand up to champions that they currently struggle against (i.e everyone more mobile than them).\n\n Like the beginning of all new class reworks, they are probably going to be quite strong for a couple of patches while Riot monitor the community response and win rate.","replies":[]}]}
