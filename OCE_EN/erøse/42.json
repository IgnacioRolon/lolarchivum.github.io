KEEP IT UP!\n\n\n\nDarius:\nDarius cuts enemies he attacks, causing them to bleed. Hemorrhage can stack up to five times.\n\n[New] Bloodrage: Whenever Darius executes an enemy with Noxian Guillotine or fully stacks Hemorrhage on a target, he gains Bloodrage for a few seconds. While under the effects of Bloodrage, Darius deals greatly increased physical damage and applies max Hemorrhage stacks to all enemies he hits.\n\nSo now he gets 5 stacks on one enemy champion and that stack would \"infect\" other champions.Darius is already strong asf but rito decided to make him stronger. Love it\n\n\nGaren:\n[NEW] Passive: Garen identifies the enemy champion with the most recent kills as the enemy team&rsquo;s Villain. Judgment ticks and basic attacks on the Villain deal an additional 1% of their max Health as true damage.\n\nActive: Garen calls upon the might of Demacia to deal a finishing blow to a targeted enemy. The more health they&rsquo;re missing, the more damage Demacian Justice will deal. [NEW] Demacian Justice deals true damage to the enemy team&rsquo;s Villain.\n\n \nSo basically if you have the most recent kills and you&#039;re low asf you&#039;re screwed cause garen is coming for you.Garen isn&#039;t that strong before but now his buff is making him way more than strong but rather op.\n\n\nSkarner:\nNah he isn&#039;t that op so I have no complains really.\n\n\nMordekaiser:\nWhenever he deals damage specifically to the dragon, Mordekaiser curses it &ndash; if his team&rsquo;s then able to kill it, Morde summons a specter of dragon that follows him around and fights for him. If you&rsquo;ve ever thought about watching dragon and Baron duke it out&hellip; well&hellip; now you can.\n\nEveryone knows how strong he can get.A simple flash+e can already get you a triple kill.He&#039;s not op is agree but rito said \"Lets buff him so he&#039;s broken\" and now he can carry a fking dragon around with him! How annoying can that be...\"Oh look im losing lane imma go get me a dragon and help me win my lane\" Good job rito....\n\n\nbut yet they decided to nerf champions that are not even that op\n\nAzir: His e doesn&#039;t give a knockup anymore and so does his shield.......now he&#039;s really easy to beat with someone like katarina since he has no CC whatsoever/\n\n\nNidalee:\nYes,she can get really annyoing and be a pain in the ass but I don&#039;t think they should nerf her this much...First they nerf her ad then her health now this:\n\nQ - Javelin Toss\nMAXIMUM SPEAR DAMAGE 150/225/300/375/450 &rArr; 150/210/270/330/390MAXIMUM SPEAR DAMAGE\n\n\n\nW - Bushwhack\nVISION RADIUS ON CAST 1200 for 0.5 seconds &rArr; 400 for 0.5 seconds\n\n\nSivir:\nShe&#039;s only OP if she has enough farm and has enough kills but if she is shutdown early game as far as I&#039;m concerned she isnt that op and someone who has enough burst etc:\nTalon,Zed can kill her that quick.\n\n\nINITIAL MOVEMENT SPEED 60% at all ranks &rArr; 40/50/60%\n\nNot big nerf but still....\n\n\nZed:\nZed is only op if played right.As a zed main i&#039;m kinda upset by the 1 sec cooldown that rito applied for zed.(I&#039;m kinda bias x3)\n\nTalon:\nTalon is still good but not as good anymore.Even katarina can beat the pulp out of talon now since his e(silence) has been removed(I don&#039;t remember which patch)\n\n\n\nSkins:\nAs far as skins go.Rito is not really doing a good job in my opinion.I mean look at\n Annie, Gragas, Jax, Ryze, Twisted Fate and Veigar,Alistar, Amumu, Blitzcrank, Corki, Dr. Mundo, Ezreal, Fiddlesticks, Katarina, Kayle, Kog&#039;Maw, Miss Fortune, Teemo and Warwick.\n\nThese champions have more than 7+ skins.\n\nand now they are making a fizz skin,fizz has 5 skins atm.\n\nbut they don&#039;t show any love to zed and only make a chroma pack.Zed only has 1 skins(Shockblade Zed) and yes the skt skin doesn&#039;t count since that is a championship skin and it was a MUST-MAKE skin since skt won that championship.\n\n\nBut I doubt rito won&#039;t read such post like this because let&#039;s be real here,rito doesn&#039;t really care about the community.","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-08-06T11:20:43.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh did he just say teemo is op? and late game?

tell.\nSecond of all they just got released so we cant say how they go in high level play which is all that matters because in low level play any champion can be 'op' cause all you need to do is know how to play them to get fed.\n\nAlso they are being more creative and enlarging the viable picks because admit it or not all those champions were weak, you can say darius was strong but if you know how to play vs him he was weak as piss.\n\nNidalee's spear damage btw isnt the reason she is even broken in the jungle (her most played role), because for one its the speed/mobility/function of her form change and no cost/cd of her q/w/e in her changed form combined with her mark, so to stop the #1 jungle from completely ruining the game they need to make changes to her which in my case wont even bother her as much as damage goes seeing as she doesnt even need max range q's to 1 hit a target.\n\nAlso azir.. hmmm what to say, his still op... the onlything taking his shield and adding attack speed to his w do was lower his earlygme pressure and increase his lategame hypercarry mode, not to mention katarina... all you have to do is if she jumps on you is ult her back then continue to kite her with rylias which is enough to stop her from 1 hitting you.\n\nReading all of your rants shows me how little you know about these champions, how they are meant to be played and what rito is trying to do with the game, please get your facts straight before jumping to conclusions on every champ.\n\nBtw show me one person that doesnt think the addition of mord and his (how to train a dragon) ability isnt cool...\n\nAll the champions you just mentioned for skins as well, they are probably the 19 oldest champions in the game...\n\nPlease take your salt lvl down from ocean to

to stop them for a second without ulting","replies":[{"poster":"Master Namer","date":"2015-08-07T05:27:16.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ye but he has more attack speed now lategame
