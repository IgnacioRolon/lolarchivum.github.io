They make skins for very popular champs that is how yasuo got a second skin already. Zac is not a very popular champ I haven't seen him being played by anyone for a while. So riot won't be making a skin for him for a while since no on plays him. It all about the money.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-03-12T09:48:23.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isnt zed popular.Like 7/10 games you will see a zed in mid/top.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2015-03-09T10:53:02.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well,if this post gets more than enough views for rito to see this maybe just maybe they will realise how badly zed users want a new skin.","replies":[]}]}
