In my opinion, Ekko is really cancerous, he can build full tank and have 42 ap and still demolish anyone in a 1 v 1. I was in a game against a Ekko top and he had only 42 ap, he ulted back and  hit our adc which her healthbar went straight away half. He can dive people and get away without a scratch because he does so much for a tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-21T12:26:54.287+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Any champ becomes cancerous if they are played a lot, because people just are sick to death of playing against them.\n\nBut yes, Ekko is approaching Yasuo's level of terminal cancer.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-22T12:11:06.665+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=eEZyvU3F,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-08-21T12:26:54.287+0000)\n>\n> Any champ becomes cancerous if they are played a lot, because people just are sick to death of playing against them.\n> \n> But yes, Ekko is approaching Yasuo&#x27;s level of terminal cancer.\n\nKeyword \"approaching\"\n\nEkko doesn't even get close to the amount of terminal cancer Yasuo gives me.\n\nK, now I must prepare myself for the Talon12 roast.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-22T13:38:48.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everything you said there is true!","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-23T07:08:04.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Soon he would be.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-08-22T13:00:21.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"All I have to say is yes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-21T21:33:27.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as i fucking hate the term \"cancerous\" yes...

Just watching him split push with near immunity in Pro play, depending on the match up of course, makes me think that it will be incredibly difficult to balance him.
