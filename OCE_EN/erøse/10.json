Each time a champion wins a poll, the champion is not in the next poll until every single champion has a skin. After every champion has a skin then the poll resets. I thought this was a good idea to make it fair. Kindred is getting another skin while champions like yorick, volibear ,thresh, zed, kennen barely or does not even get a skin. It took riot 5 years to make a new kennen skin, it took riot 3 years to make a new zed skin and last time yorick got a skin was 2011. Meanwhile nidalee,katarina and draven get sh*t tons of skin.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-10T14:41:35.117+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I agree some more community input on skins would be great, it kinda ignores a lot of the artistic process/inspiration and doesn't account for things like mechanical viability (is it possible with the current tech to do a particular idea justice) and resource management (what price tiers do you put them in/how many resources do you dedicate to them etc) which are all accounted for in the current process.\n\nLike you can't just say, \"ok Sejuani is going to get a skin\", and expect the art teams to suddenly have the inspiration for something that will make it through the rigors of their selection processes. That's just not how it works.\n\nIt's been proven in the past that if someone or a few people on the art teams decide they really like a community idea then they'll push it through and keep pushing till it's good enough (SP Fiddle, Void Fizz, Gravelord Azir etc). Just saying x champ needs a skin is easier said than done.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-11T06:13:28.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, they can just say after a champion wins it would take 3-5 weeks to make a skin etc","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-11T06:46:29.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be a lot longer than 3-5 weeks....

A better 'fair' would be taking more community input/feedback from PBE and implementing it, but there hasn't really been any skins that made it onto PBE that the majority felt were dissatisfying in some way. \n\nIf they wanted to take more community skin ideas they could, but they'd have to make it VERY clear that once you post it on boards/send it to them the idea basically belongs to them, and they aren't obliged to give credit and cannot give payment of any kind. That whole legal thing muddies the water quite a bit on that one which is part of why they do it so rarely in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-12T06:26:14.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"meh the whole game isn't even fair lol","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-14T02:43:34.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-10T21:48:01.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"id rather riot release whatever skins they want whenever they want and i get excited and surprised with what they can come up with, like the super galaxy skins, especially fizz. i dont wanna see all the concepts and know that i might not see them anyway cos some edgy school kids want as many riven skins as their mums allowance can get them\n\nall of the champions you mentioned, if i were riot, i wouldnt care about skins for them, id probably make another volibear skin similar to what hes got but i guess thematically different still, but then again all of his skins are available in the store, i think, and considering hes just a bear, and not an assassin that edgy schoolkids would like to main, hes probably not up for a new skin, if riot plays it smart\n\nyoricks not getting a skin until his rework, if he does, can we all hound riot for crazy cat lady yorick, thats the best splash art ive seen and the way it shows him and his abilities is so genius","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-11T06:14:41.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's depressing how popular champions like nidalee,katarina and teemo gets like 3 skins every year.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-10T09:35:01.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kennen just got blood moon.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-10T10:28:11.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"it took Riot 5 years to make a new Kennen skin\"\n\nHe knows.

But i understand your point.\n\nHowever i do agree, champions like Karthus/Kennen/Swain etc do seem to receive little love. \nRiot did officially state that Yorick, Poppy and Evelynn, wouldn't get any new skins until their updates.... However they then shortly afterwards released a skin for Eve without an update, and STILL haven't given poppy a new one.\nAlso Evelynn, Karthus, Twitch and Yorick (and Sion until recently) have no skins that change their particle effects whatsoever, (every other champion in the game has at least one skin that even slightly changes the particle effects) so TBH i think priority should be given to those champs. \n\nMy personal view is that priority should be given:\n\n- First to the champs that have no particle changes like Karthus.\n\n- Second to all the new champs that only have 1 skin like Illoai/Aurelion Sol. (so that players can have some choice, and not just the 1 release skin) \n\n- Thirdly to older champs that have many or few skins but are outdated and need a fresh look. (like Malzahar/Swain etc) \n\n- Then to everyone else, like Kat/Ezreal/teemo and the rest that draw the skin lottery a little too many times. \n\nI agree that it isn't fair to skip champions, to give champs several skins in a year or two, and then wait 5 years to give different champ a skin. \nBut going in a rotation of champs like you say also has its problems, for example, once your champ gets a skin, you know for certain that it will be another 3 years before your champ gets a skin again, and when you know that, its a little depressing (awww man this is the last skin for X champ for 3 years... and it was a shitty pink one...) ect etc, its a little more exiting when you have absolutely no idea what champion is going to get a skin until 2 weeks before it comes out, and it could be anyone! it gives everyone a little hope that it could be their champ. \n\nThe quality of skins would have to be regulated too, for example if i wanted an Azir skin, i wait 3 years for it, get a average 750 skin, and have to wait another 3 years for the next one, where Zed might get a 1350 skin, and waits the same amount of time till his next one. \n\nAlso if there was a rotation, how would you treat Legacy and Limited Edition skins? It wouldn't be fair for some champs to get permanent skins, and others to get limited ones. But inversely it also wouldn't be fair for a champ to get a permanent skin AND a limited one in the same time frame that other champs just get 1 skin. Then what about the Championship/Victorious/Wiining-Team, skins? Riot doesn't have a lot of choice when it comes to those, and neither would the community, would those skins count as that champions skin for the next 3 years? or wold they be extra? If it did count as the skin for that champion, how is it fair for the people who play them? They get a shitty as Skt T1 skin for X champ, while someone else gets an epic PROJECT: skin for Y champ. But if it was extra, how is it fair to everyone else, who only get 1 skin, while this champ gets 2?\n\nA rotation is Fair, but not practical, firstly champions like Urgot will get the same number of skins and at the same frequency as Lee, even though Lee is 20 times as popular as Urgot and will make 20x more people happy when he gets a skin. Sure Urgot should get some skins, thats only fair, but practically Lee should get more than Urgot and more frequently, as more people will be happier and Riot will make more money to fund even more skins. \n\nSo while I disagree that there should be a rotation of which champion gets a skin or not, i DO think there needs to be some kind of assurance that champions will get a new skin within a certain time frame of their last skin (its possible that 4 skins could be released in that time frame for a specific champ, but you need to be _guaranteed_ at least 1) That way, there is still that \"ohh i hope its my champ this patch\" feeling, as well as the possibility to make more skins for more popular champions, but still being sure to give less popular champs some love too. \n\nBut i agree it is a little sad to compare Yorick/Urgot's pathetic number of skins to Ezreal/Teemo's... like its **Crazy** how many skins those little shits have.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-11T06:12:25.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, how many skins does katarina and nidalee need holy fk","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-10T09:07:13.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could get behing this. \n\nOnly exception being when a new champ is realised i suppose.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-05-11T06:10:37.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-05-10T06:26:17.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yorick's rework is scheduled to come out by the end of the year, and will more than likely be released with a new skin (like GP was).\n\nI agree that some champions do get overlooked for skins while Riot seems to favour others. But there are a lot of factors. Rather than say,\n\"Hey dudes, this week make a Syndra skin, k bye\". Riot says \"guys, think of cool skins for whoever you want and we will see what cool ideas you come up with\".\n\nThe best skins come from freedom of exprerssion and idea creation rather than being forced to make new skins.\n\nOtherwise you end up with garbage like the Beast Hunter skins LOL\n\nBut i think it would be cool to simply have a contest for the community. \"Make your own skin\" comp.
