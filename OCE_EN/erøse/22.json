So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-04-24T09:33:39.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know its based off of everyone else does in the server but I personally think\n\na KDA with Nautilus of 6/0/19 is worth more then an A+.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-04-23T09:36:34.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-23T06:41:03.218+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because you're a Zed, if you went 100/0/0 then you miiiight get an S+ the system realises BS when it sees it.\nSo it wont reward you for getting lots of kills with a BS champ because thats expected.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-04-23T06:55:33.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-04-23T09:35:08.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love your hate for zed hahaa","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-24T04:36:01.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember you are being measured against other Zed mids.
