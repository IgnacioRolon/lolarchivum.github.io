I also have arcade miss fortune and I wanna perm skin it, i&#039;m a decent yasuo player and wanna buy that skin. What do you guys reckon?","replies":[{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-07T22:51:28.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd reccomend bloodmoon yasuo, SKT zed is rare although it will come back every year and doesnt have any new particle effects. Arcade mf is a skin that you would use rarely and you wouldnt get your monies worth and blood moon yas has all particle changes and yasuo is always decent in the meta.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-05-08T08:17:43.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SKT Zed feels so clunky, it just looks like every skill isn't the same compared to PROJECT or Shockblade.","replies":[]}]}
