Like I bought 2 runes and i should only have  31 ip. My ip remained the same and after I finished 1 game, I got the first win of the day bonus and my ip was 1.1k so it clearly did not deduct the ip.\n\n\nEdit 1:\nGoing back to the shop fixes it apparently but whenever I do that I get disconnected from the client itself.\n\nEdit 2:\nJust to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion. Even though it showed 1.1k ip on my screen, I actually could not spend the ip on something  that is less than that amount and thats because the only glitch part is the numbers that are showing but the data still registers your ip as the ORIGINAL amount that you should have.\n\nEdit 3:\nLast time I had this problem the only fix was relogging to your account but now it does not even work.","replies":[{"poster":"Nothing bots","date":"2016-08-03T01:37:18.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it happened to me when i bought lee sin with ip after i finished a game it was still like that even if i relog but the next day i fixed","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-03T04:51:08.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hopefully they would fix it soon","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-08-02T09:59:02.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you can't use that ip can you\n\nrelogging then going straight to shop usually sets it right though","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-03T04:50:10.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's just annoying :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-02T08:34:30.799+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha yeah it works the same for rp too. You can't purchase something higher than your actual rp or ip though and it generally fixes in a few days since the issue sometimes persist with subsequent logins on the same day.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-02T09:51:25.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Relogging doesn't even fix it now wtf-","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-02T07:29:40.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"are you trying to cheat :l","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-02T09:49:22.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dude have you read what I just typed?","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-08-02T21:06:10.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes, it might be your cookie settings???","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-08-02T07:36:26.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it happened to me as well.
