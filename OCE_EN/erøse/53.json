Even if mid died twice and your JG can safely push with you... Personally i'd rather it not, it creates to deep a pocket of doom for me.... think about how unprotected middle is without both enemy and your turret up and being there for the objectives. Had way too many games where i've dominated (well 2-3 kills) and pushed turret quickly, only to find my map positioning really sucks and i dont want to spend too much time roaming compared to downing waves and getting farm up.\n\nMuch <3 for unerstanding both sides of the fence iAkeno","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-27T11:17:51.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You really made good points there and I would ensure to apply this to my next jungle gameplay.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Human Ryze","date":"2016-07-25T01:37:50.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freaking GST.
