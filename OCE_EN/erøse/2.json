Every single time you lose, instead of raging at how some stupid thing some random did lost you the game, calm down, and think about the mistakes YOU made that game. Then fix them. Fix every little mistake you can find in your own play instead of finding all the mistakes of others, and I guarantee you will begin to climb rapidly. Because as you fix your mistakes, you get better in lane, you start winning your lanes. HARD. Then you can carry extremely easily. That's the most basic thing that will get you to climb in rank.\n\nThe other thing that will make life in any rank easier is to play champions that aren't difficult, but still have massive impacts on the game. Examples: Annie, Leona, Malphite. They all have easy to hit, massive CC that even if behind, can swing teamfights massively in your favour and if ahead, literally just snowball your team out of control. Examples of champions to avoid: Lee Sin, Yasuo, Kalista, VAYNE. Any champion that requires either very good positioning, overall mechanics or hitting skillshots to set up combos that have big impacts are simply going to get you destroyed in lower ranks, and not always because of a lack of skill of the person playing them, its the fact that you're in a lower tier of play, people simply don't react as quickly and correctly to complex plays. The more simple things are, the less skill is required to pull something off, the higher chance it has of working. Simple really. \n\ntl;dr\nStop caring about what other people screw up +\nFind and fix your own mistakes +\nPlay simple champions with big impacts +\nAvoid difficult champions +\n= climb","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-24T12:30:10.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was gonna say hard carries, because that's how I basically climbed from Bronze 5 to Gold 5.
