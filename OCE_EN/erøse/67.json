For Sivir you should be able to clear cs easier in the beginning and even easier later with your W and as well as after purchasing items like {{item:3031}} or  {{item:3087}}  you can aim to reach 170-180cs by the 20 minute mark. And don't forgot ur Q as well, it can be useful if u deal enough damage with it.\n\nAlthough enemies may be a problem with cs, just keep a clear head during ganks and try and dodge poke and engages from the enemy team, from champs like {{champion:53}}, {{champion:412}} or {{champion:89}} . Keep calm and keep up the csing! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-11T01:08:18.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was against a blitzcrank and a ashe so I had to play really carefully.","replies":[]}]}]}
