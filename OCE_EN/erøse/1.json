Had a game against a taric, sejuani and mundo. They all built full tank items but did so much damage. Sejuani&#039;s combo could erase our adc literally (our adc tried to 1 v 1 her). Later on ahri 1 v 1&#039;ed taric ( ahri won because of team help later on) and she barely survived. Mundo is no question really annoying. He has so much damage on his E and can basically just ULT to full health.","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2016-01-19T08:10:59.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Mundo use Ignite and grevious wounds items?\nand rhe last whisper upgrade","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-20T05:14:11.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was jungler so I did not take ignite lol.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Proxima Solaris","date":"2016-01-20T01:27:42.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the tanks you just need to do what's always been required to take them down: cc them and shred their armor/mr to take them down. If you see a lot of hp building tanks, get yourself a bork over bt & get dominks regards. Also, if you don't have a tank line, don't 5v5 - look for picks. For Mundo/Vlad/Trundle/Illaoi and any other massively healing tanks, ignite, morellos & mortal reminder are the way to go, plus cc. You gotta have the cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-20T05:15:15.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but then they start grouping and we are forced to defend.
