I say that because they are the ones with 100+ champs. But what about new level 30's? I know that when I first hit level 30 I only owned about 20 - 25 champs. \n\nMaybe it would be a good idea if it was only a thing in platinum (or gold) and up, because the majority of people in those tiers are experienced and have been playing the game a while, thus they will have a much bigger champ pool.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-22T13:37:46.324+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats a good idea bit often Its bronze and silver that have major issues with more champions though.\n\nPlus what it'll mean is that new players will need to play more before starting ranked (which in turn means there will be less bronze players) which is a good thing, cos no one wants to be in bronze.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-22T03:39:06.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a great idea, the 6 bans just don't work for the number of champions that we have currently. Theres always at least 4 champs that need to be permabanned at any one time, and then that leaves 1 tactical ban per team, which just isn't enough.\n\nIts highly unlikely that all 10 bans will be on the same role, but if it does happen then isn't that just a tactic in itself? (no different to 4 man ganking a lane, it isn't fair.. but its a tactic.)\n\nIt'll only really affect one trick ponies if they are playing really hated champs like Yasuo or Zed, but those two are banned most of the time anyway, so adding more bans wouldn't really do much. (one trick ponies aren't technically played the game as its supposed to be played anyway)\n\nAnyway, i have over 10 champs that i can play in mid, and over 10 i can play in top in ranked with no problems at all. And I'm only in silver, so if i can do it, theres no reason why anyone else shouldn't be able to. \n\nIn dynamic queue you only have to play 2 roles anyway.\nBack in the old system you needed to know 36 champions, which is over 7 champions for all 5 roles (cos theres 6 bans and the enemy team could pick before you)\nwith the new system, you'd only need to know 22 champions. So its still way less champs to learn than before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-08-23T09:26:22.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game desperately needs more bans. Half the reason picks become stale is because you can't ban out all the best champs. Ten bans will open up the next tier and make the game hella more exciting and unpredictable. Also, there will be bans available for common one trick champs (like kha'zix) so we don't have to worry about those anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-08-21T12:51:14.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well the 6-ban system was implemented when there was only 60 or so champions.\nI think 8-10 bans is warranted given there is over 130 champions.\n\nThat being said, if a 5-man Dynamic que decided to be \"smart\" (dicks) and say, ban out 5 junglers or ADCs, you could really mess up the enemy team.\n\nDOTA has 10 bans (and 110 or so heroes) but a different format. They go, ban - ban - ban - ban - pick - pick - pick - pick - ban - ban etc... so you ban the 4 \"OPs\" then each team gets a shot at picking up 2 champs each before more bans.\nMaybe something similar to this would prevent someone getting banned out.","replies":[{"poster":"ErÃ¸se","date":"2016-08-23T07:06:08.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play DOTA and boy that game is so much harder than league haha","replies":[]}]}]}
