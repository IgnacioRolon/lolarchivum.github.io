Zed got struck in the eye in which in my opinion refers to the &quot;Eye Of Twilight&quot;,as you all know that in zed&#039;s lore while zed and shen were still in the temple, zed could not beat shen and their father always complimented shen while zed was always being looked down on and so he used the forbidden shadow thingy. Now we all know that zed wanted to live up to his master&#039;s expectation and become the Eye Of Twilight. For sona she got shot in the throat and we know in her lore she was mute and was unable to speak,she was living in a adoption house and she probably wanted to speak like all the other humans around her but couldn&#039;t. For garen he got shot in the chest and we all know that he wants love but is fighting the person he loves,he is unable to love katarina since they are enemies.However for vi it seems a little difficult since the teaser shows us that she has been released from her hextech gaunlets and shows her arms, I don&#039;t really know where she got shot but it seems like she wanted to be released from her gaunlet but feared of being useless if she does release the hextech gaunlets,without the gaunlets she could have not saved the miners. So all the champions that got involved had a goal but has a obstacle that they can&#039;t overcome. So I think that jhin is helping them reach their goals but in exchange have their souls. Also notice that Zed=3...Sona=4...Garen=5...Vi (In roman numerals) = 6.  Also that Zed Mid,Vi Jungle,Garen Top,Sona Support. In the teaser it sounds like a gunshot and it is easily makes sense that adcs always use guns. It also might be a skin line just like the Bloodmoon,Headhunter,Vandal,Project,Debonair series.\n\n\nEdit 1:\nA video teaser has been released and it looks like Deadeye is not the second name for Jhin but infact a skin line.\nIn the teaser it shows all the elements:\n\nVi - Fire\nGaren - Water\nZed - Earth\nSona - Air\n\nSo i'm assuming that \nJhin's full name would be something like\n\n\"Jhin - Master Of Elements\"\n\nJhin also seems to be like a female and is confirmed that jhin is an adc since he/she uses a gun.\n\nIf you look at the teaser again near the ending jhin's eyebrows seems to be a really female type of eyebrows. Jhin's eyeshape also seems to suit a female more.\n\nAs I mentioned before the 4 champions that got involved makes a perfect team\n\nSona - Support\nGaren - Top\nZed - Mid\nVi - Jungle\n\nMaking this more convincing that jhin is infact an adc.
