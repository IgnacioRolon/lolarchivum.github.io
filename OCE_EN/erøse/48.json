There was also plays where he could have used flash to save himself but instead he keeps it. Any ideas why high elo players do this?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-07-19T23:11:16.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Usually it's to maximise value for later events.

Being in higher elo means they need to concentrate more things than just kda objectives and team fight. Before using any ss they have to think ahead of just that moment, they have to think if they save it and die here they might make more of an impact in flashing in and grabbing someone and getting a pick for your team hence winning you the team fight, that takes priority than surviving 1 death and not be able to help the team after. Just like the silence, if they know it's a guaranteed kill there is no need to use any big abilities on them, it's much safer i'm assuming by your description to chase a guaranteed kill and using the least amount of abilities for later on when it is really needed. Just like if a high elo players buy a GA, they would take priority over the GA than going in and trying to make a play cause like ss and ults, GA has a cool down and could turn a team fight around unexpectedly. So basically, a high elo player don't only look at the situation they are in at the time, they look ahead of them and think about all the possibilities that a play they make now and how it would or would not effect the future of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-19T02:07:42.791+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you save it until its nessasary","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-19T02:35:37.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was necessary to flash though since it would have saved his life if he flashed","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-19T06:21:00.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=iAkeno,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=P5GYMQX2,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-07-19T02:35:37.280+0000)\n>\n> It was necessary to flash though since it would have saved his life if he flashed\n\nbecause maybe they are better off saving it to win a team fight than wasting it then dying straight up in the teamfight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-19T03:41:41.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have a link to the clip?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-19T05:18:19.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on the context.
