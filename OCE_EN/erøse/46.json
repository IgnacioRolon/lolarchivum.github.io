I&#039;m pretty sure that RIOT gets a thousand of reports about a toxic player everyday and once a player gets more than a certain reports for being toxic then that player would be classified as a toxic player. Now how this works is that if a player is identified as a toxic player then he only gets queues with toxic players while the non-toxic players get a separate queue. This way the toxic people can battle it out on who can be more toxic XD.\r\n\r\nBut anyway I made this post because I had a game where it was 40min + long and everyone didn&#039;t flame or trash talk or any stuff like that and the only things that the 2 teams wanted was to win the game and after the game there was no &quot;GG EZ&quot; but rather there was only  &quot;It was a tough game&quot; \r\n&quot;Had fun playing with you guys&quot; and I was really mesmerized by this. So if we separate the toxic players and the non-toxic players the chances of the players having a undelightful experience is lower.","replies":[{"poster":"DonkeyWhisperer","date":"2016-09-01T13:10:54.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"would be nice but the whats to stop lets say a 4 man group reporting you when they all toxic towards ya? even when your in the right","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-09-01T23:41:02.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk implement the system for a Rioter to actually check the footage lol","replies":[{"poster":"DonkeyWhisperer","date":"2016-09-16T07:29:48.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mate ive goten chat restrictions from return abuse to 4 man groups it shows u what you said only.....thier system doesnt work so well","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-31T10:16:47.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You might be interested in Lyte's [Prisoner's Island](http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=4796564&page=2#post49503485) discussion then :D","replies":[]}]}
