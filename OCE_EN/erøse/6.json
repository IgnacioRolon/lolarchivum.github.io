If they want him balanced they need to remove his AOE and ranged Q. If he is going to have a free attack block even in combat with the ability to build 1 + 1/4 item to get 100% crit and then have complete freedom in his build, he shouldn't be able to wave clear with one E-Q and then have any range at all.\n\nHe has a suppress on his ult. He has knocks up every few seconds further on. He has almost unlimited mobility, synergising with a passive that doesn't really fit his play style, plus having built in crits and a windwall that completely blocks anything in the game on his W.\n\nNow you might be thinking, why delete him and not just nerf him or rework him? Because however many Yasuo mains their are, since I see one in every 2-3 games, would start complaining and come up with some excuse on why he shouldn't, and start making rants about him.\n\nHe doesn't have enough counter play. Believe it or not, I actually think Riot will nerf him but in professional play he isn't broken so they are waiting until after worlds. He dominates everywhere Bronze to Challenger, but he just slowly becomes less popular as you get higher ELO. In high ELO he has a 49.6% win rate for mid, and a 52% win rate for top, with a 30% ban rate, and close to 10% pick rate. \n\nIn low ELO that pick rate has to be a lot more.\n\nTo be honest no champion deserves to be \"deleted\". Especially not Ekko. He is by far the most unique and counter play-able assassin. You can see exactly where he will go, exactly what he is planning, yet he still has the ability to out play. In lane he has a good poke with Q but you can easily dodge his passive.\n\nThe problem with Ekko (which incidentally is the same problem with Yasuo) is that his core is easily attainable without having to sacrifice build. Obviously a full AP Ekko will do more damage than a Tri Force tank Ekko, but he still has AOE stuns and survivability with some decent slows and damage.\n\nEkko is fine right now, the numbers could use some fine tuning if you want to be picky as base damage on his passive is pretty strong.\n\nLe'Blanc is getting reworked soon, so that eliminates that.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-08-23T13:04:28.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anything to say about riven?","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-24T09:18:21.096+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven is not that cancer.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2016-08-24T05:51:51.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't want to see a champion deleted, and I highly doubt that Riot would delete any champions.\nInstead of deleting a champion because he/she is too OP, nerf them instead.\nWhen I played as Irelia or Garen against teemo, I didn't manage to counter him, maybe I will be able to counter him later, also, Kennen is another champion that I could not counter the last time I played against him using Irelia, but hopefully I will be able to counter him in a future game.\nThere was once I used Irelia against Akali, and I keep on getting killed by her, but the second time I used Irelia against Akali, I had managed to beat her quite a few times even though I didn't win the game.\nLearn from your mistakes.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-24T06:19:12.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahahha","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-24T07:10:33.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would delete Yas.

You can just farm or push her lane but she can just max W and farm most the minions without getting hurt or even slightly in danger. \n\nIt is near impossible to gank her lane as a jungler unless you are a hyper mobile jungler. She has strong escape once level 6, sure it puts her ult on CD or W but if maxing it and going the normal build for LB she will have it off CD pretty fast. One item is enough to make your combo obliterate anything under 1200 hp even at level 6-7. So anything that isn't going healthy or MR she blows up in a second. You can harrass her or sure early but that means minion aggro and her diving on you to dodge your skillshot and all the while doing massive damage to you. She forces you to pick certain champions and punishes you if you don't, same with items, if you don't rush a Abys you will most likely feed here even under tower. If you don't call her MIA constantly every time she goes missing for 1 second your team can end up getting surprise instant buttsecks then yell at you. Even if you call it and ping over their head RUN AWAY they can still get killed by her if she dives the tower as most likely your ADC or supp will be super soft or already damaged from their lane foes. \n\nALSO her fucking passive is aids. Seriously it breaks your auto attacks and then you have to decide which is real. It has a short as heck cool down and she is invisible for a short time meaning she gets a head start to get away. Really.. 1 second of stealth is a ton of time to set up an escape.. imagine if twitch could instantly go into stealth. Actually Shaco can do this, and it also jumps him a distance away, and it is the thing people hate most about the champ. But this bitch gets it as a passive. I know the CD is static 1 minute (60 seconds) but that is enough to back, heal up, come back into lane and play passive for 30 or so seconds, she has it EVERY FIGHT unless she is stupid. It makes passives like Voli or Anivia look tame. Never before have i seen an more imbalanced passive..\n\nThe only real way i found to beat her is as i said picking certain champions which means you have to see her being picked first which is rare. Or to just make her get bored of farming and try gank your other lanes giving you a chance to actually farm. Though most expect you to follow her.. so its still a lose lose. \n\nReally she is the ONLY mid i have no clue how to hard counter with my main (Annie, Ahri and Sol.) without making my team really mad. Annie i have an easier time with, as i tend to just Q farm and stay at range constantly and run like a little girl when she even postures near me, but that just means she can stand on my side and just AA farm the minions if she is smart (most are that smart..)\n\nSo yeah i would love her removed from the game. As most don't know how to counter her, most blame me for her snowballing as there is near no way stopping that. And if i don't play mid.. and someone else vs's her 99% of the time they will lose and make the game 100% harder to play as i secondary jungle/ADC. So either i can't gank her or i camp mid and force her away from CS for my mid, or i am an ADC who gets blown up every second by her. I am not normally an angry or violent man but if i ever met the person who designed her i would punch or strangle the person... no one should have that much mobility and damage in one kit, along with a passive that makes it NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to finish her off some times. I mean the fact that her biggest threats are Diana, Fizz, Yas and Galio really tells you that \"just damage her real fast and have mobility(or be an assassin) or be a guy who just builds MR\" is really fucking stupid. Not to mention i read on a site \"buy a banshee\" as one of her counters.. seriously i have to buy an expensive no damage item to counter her.. one that just someone else's crappy ability can break and it will be on CD for like 40 seconds... 40 seconds is a longer CD than her fucking ult is at level 1 wtf. \n\n\nReally most just say \"oh a rework could fix their kit\" but i disagree on this one, the only way you can make her more balanced is to gut or remove one of the crazy aspects of her kit. Remove the extra damage from her Q on proc, remove or increase the cool down or instant tele back on her W, Decrease the damage on her E or increase the CD on her ult for early levels of it (60/45/25 at 6/11/16) just to decrease her dual or gank presence early on and make her rely more on cunning to land early kills. Because right now she is a one man army and doesn't even need jungle presence to help her out ever. \n\nOverall she is just a pain in the ass. And later in game (mid game) she can blow up targets with a burst of close to 2.5k with MR. Or if you do dodge at least one ability (chains) you will have to back anyway. Speaking of back, no point getting TP against her as you can TP back and she just has to poke with a combo and you are back to half or less health so you have to back straight away or you are an easy kill for her... making her even harder to kill and denying you farm. You can point out to me she has a low win rate all you like, because i know why she has a low winrate already. She is a 1v1 bomb champion, meaning she kills one target for you and then she is on CD so she becomes useless in team fights if peel or good positioning is present. But she is also one of the most banned champions and that is also why she has a bad winrate, as when she isn't banned she is very likely picked fast and a lot pick her but don't OTP her as it is hard to OTP her with how much she gets banned so you can go into a game rusty as hell and lose it because you take time to get her timing down. But that is mainly in high ELO... Lower ELO she is a nightmare for me @_@ as this account is my ADC account and she is always picked if no banned making my life hell as she appears out of no where an POPS ME LIKE A BALLOON!\n\n/end rant\n\nSorry for that.. i just... i just really hate her so damn much. So so so so so damn much. I hate champs like Fizz, but not at the levels i hate LB. I would get a tattoo of her and just put cigarettes out on the tattoo and i don't even smoke, that is how much i hate her. I know she isn't that strong but when my main picks are her tasty snacks you can't, not hate her.","replies":[{"poster":"Frag","date":"2016-08-24T09:32:39.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone's salty PogChamp","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-08-24T14:39:52.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah take it how you wish.

Even in higher ELO i see people struggle to beat her some times, not all but enough to the point you just see her constantly get banned.
