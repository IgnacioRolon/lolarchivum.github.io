If you stand in the jungle or in her ult and fight her, you're gonna have a bad time. Solution? Don't do that.\n\nDarius is not the man he once was, he's not too bad anymore. Kiteable as hell and counterplay now so it's all g.\n\nTHIS IS THE GUY THAT NEEDS A NERF ----> {{champion:54}} \n\nUnlike Darius or Illaoi, he doesn't need any damage items to one shot squishies, and unlike Darius and Illaoi, he's not really kiteable, well, not when he has ult up anyway.
