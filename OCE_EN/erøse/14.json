Taric just doesn't feel like taric.

I don't like the vladimir but would have to play a few games first.\n\nIt's just like, why??

That's how I feel like and i'm glad that i'm not the only who feels like this. Malzhar is gonna be overused in casual and ranked now. The mages got heavy buff meanwhile the AD assassins got nerfed. Zed's w is now 20 second cooldown and his ad got reduced. Next thing you know Zed's q and e is 10 seconds cd XD","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-21T03:38:56.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why are you complaining about his passive when it's Malz's new W that is broken LOL\nHIs passive just makes him not worthless.\n\nMalz is not OP. In fact atm he is a pretty bad champion. Like Warwick. Point and click supressions which only work when your team mates have the reactions of a slug.\n\nIt's not all nerfs for AD Assassins. They are removing the ability to QSS Zed ult.\n\nFor the majority of people, this game is over 5 years old. Its revamps and reworks such as these that keep the game interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-04-21T04:26:30.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wew wew wait.
