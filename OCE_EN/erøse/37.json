So the chat went like this:\nJ (Jinx) Z(Zed)\nJ: That spacebar working well aye zed\nZ: Huh why?\nJ: Ur evading everything\nZ: Evade?\nJ: What&#039;s evading?!?!?\nZ: I&#039;m not scripting lol\n......\n\nToo many to put in here.She accused me of scripting till the end of the game and also claimed to work with Riot Company.\nJinx said they recruited her!
