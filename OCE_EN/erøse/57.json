TIps please!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Last season I was silver 3 and now I am silver 5. I try my best, I really do and I play jungle instead of mid because I&#039;ve seen some silver players who  don&#039;t see the opening and don&#039;t gank, so I decided that I would jungle and sometimes when I see an opening I ping like 5 times to my laner to  go in since the enemy&#039;s spells are on cd and he/she is so open but they don&#039;t go in and later if they get ganked they blame me for being such a shit jungler. I also noticed shit tons of feeder every game and they seem to be on my team all the time and when you give them tips they don&#039;t listen and continue doing what they were doing. Like for example, I was playing with this zed last game and ahri was ahead of him with 3 kills and instead of playing passively and building defensively, he builds youmus instead of maws and he goes in 1 v 3. Like what am I suppose to do? Should I go back to playing mid only and start carrying ( What I did last season after I got placed at bronze 2, climbed all the way to silver 3) Honestly, silver is worse than bronze. Not trying to be toxic I just want some advice. I also noticed that silver elo DO NOT ward and they just overextend.","replies":[{"poster":"Z1nc","date":"2016-07-02T16:30:54.489+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess my tip is to play whatever you prefer. If it's jungle always think what path you'll take and when/how to gank, eg start blue and end up red = gank mid/bot if possible (If all lanes are pushed then farm), note where the enemy jungler is and secure something thats useful (counter gank, get herald or gank another lane opposite side) and make sure you ward objectives/certain areas. Also it's not always necessary to give kills to your laner, sometimes you'll find yourself carrying than the actual person in lane due to some you know, pathetic reason.\nMid can be sort of complex (laning basically is complex), if you're a good laner always find opportunities to roam and gank lanes. If you're behind dont bother unless you're willing to risk it. Silver is easy, you just need a good mindset and positive thinking.  You'll pass it, just beleaf ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-02T23:35:49.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tips!

Always try to play with communication and if you were to play jungle. Play champions you can actually play and do well with. Some easy champions for E.g. {{champion:106}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:32}} {{champion:77}}. These champions have high lane pressure and contribute a lot to the game. I am stuck with this situation right now, so I attempt to duo or 5 man rather then solo queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-02T13:09:44.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play all of them except amumu and I was wondering whether I should just go back to playing mid as I have beaten multiple gold 2+ in mid lane.","replies":[{"poster":"Łeader","date":"2016-07-03T02:58:31.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are so confident in mid, why don't you just play mid from now on since it is a good role to carry as","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-03T07:13:01.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always put mid as my main role but I never get it","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-02T11:36:45.630+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. Don't bother trying to give tips, you are likely just wasting your time, and likelihood is your not the first to try.\n2. If someone doesn't respond to a gank, don't bother ganking them unless you can get the kill solo\n3. Try to snowball your snowbally laners, and stop snowbally laners from getting ahead.\n4. Immobile Laners are easy as fuck ganks.\n5. Don't gank a losing lane.\n\nSome of these suck that they have to be used, but it's just the case for ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-02T13:08:25.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3 is definitely helpful, however I argue with 5, I mean what do you do with a losing lane?

Most times, if the losing lane is losing by a fair margin, its safe to say helping them catch up wont change anything since they lost when they started on even terms.\n\nAlso, it is safer for you to not gank the losing lane. Even if you are 3v2, you might end up just be swapping a kill for a kill, or if their jungler comes by as well, you will definitely lose a 3v3. Go camp top lane if they camp bot lane. Much better return on investment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-02T13:26:44.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave them be, fact is they aren't going to do much, and have already shown they are worse then their laner, and if you gank them your likely to just feed 2 kills and get that laner further ahead.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-02T23:35:11.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks guys!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-07-02T13:15:17.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"play when the little twelve yearolds cant.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-02T23:36:19.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hard","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-07-02T11:35:22.471+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would suggest playing junglers who can gank alot early.

Yes, they will cause you to drop the odd game, but there's not enough of them to bring your win rate down below 50%. Basically, if your overall win rate is even 51%, you will climb, albeit slowly. \n\nFor us mortals, there is but one secret.\n\nAs boring yet effective as hack-a-Shaq in the NBA, spam-a-champ works. Just find one champ that you find easy and just spam it. Not only are you good with it to start with, you'll get better as you face different match-ups and better players.\n\nI personally refuse to do it because it's not fun. I did it when I dropped from S1 to S3 and was really pissed and just spammed. It worked, but that got really lame really fast.\n\nI used to blame trolls and whatnot as well. Sorry to break it to you, but it's not trolls and afkers - as fuckin' annoying as they are - it's you.","replies":[]}]}
