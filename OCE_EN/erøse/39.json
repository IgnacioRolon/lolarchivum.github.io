I went jungle last 2 games and botlane feeds and blames me. It&#039;s just so annoying cause i&#039;m trying my best to win this game and botlane just goes on blaming me and saying &quot;Well if you are so worried come gank us&quot; I gank them and guess what happens.......they help me after I die..... when I pinged so much that i was going in. Late game is where everything just got f**ked. Instead of the support sticking with the adc to protect her while she farms, the support roams all the way top and the adc pushes without any ward and so. How do I win promos?","replies":[{"poster":"tutfrr","date":"2016-06-11T12:12:37.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha, this happened on me so many times as well. I went 12-2-19 as Lee in my promotion game just now and my team still lost. i swear i did everthing i could out there but our ad carry was just stupid.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-12T00:26:07.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahhha I thought I was the only one","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-06-11T11:00:23.720+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it's weird. I just try to play during the times school kids won't be on the most  and team up with friends that are good. Maybe it's something in the  system? e.g  players in promos are put with other players in promos???? I don't know, I just sort of quit rank and play aram the most really. I've already gotten gold 5 and silver twice on na then played on and off 7 times over 5  years and switching to oce. You can vs challengers rarely in aram, plats aren't hard to find sometimes. I'm not sure if the aram ranking counts much because I get paired up with plats vs bronze but then my plat allies play like bronzes. LOL, So I always go tanky, even making a tank Vayne if my team's fed too much for me to go damage build so I can deter dives whenever were dive-able under the turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-06-12T00:53:47.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But if you put with players that were also in promos, wouldn't you have a better chance if winning?\n\nP.S.

Gold trim profile picture, not the gold border. It feels weird how they clear rank wins now if you don't play for a long time.

Oh and it's sort of annoying how rank use to only have like 5 ranks now they've added platinum and master lol.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-06-12T05:46:16.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apparently the rank resets after every season.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-12T10:38:58.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why players give up on ranked.
