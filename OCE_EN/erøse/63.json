(Used To Be Stuck)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently I was stuck in bronze but then after these simple things I bared in mind,I made it out and currently am silver 4 with 69 lp making my way up to s3 :D\n\n\n1. Believe it or not but raging/flaming is one of the MAJOR causes you lose games, trust me the more you stay calm and focus on your own game,the more you will likely win. I once had a game where riven was 0/5 but then ended up 15/7/13. Why? Because no one flamed her and blamed her therefore she isn&#039;t pressured by her team and can realise her own mistakes more.In other words don&#039;t cause your teamates to tilt and do more horribly than they are doing.\n\n2. Warding. Warding is something that most bronze/silver players barely do. It seems that no one realizes how important warding is and how much it can affect your gameplay. Put it this way, if you didn&#039;t ward at least one side of the bushes in mid lane would you see a gank coming? The answer is absolutely NO, you have no vision of that bush which is basically a free treat for the enemy jungler to gank you and force you to burn a summoner or even worse slay you which would then lead to the enemy having a advantage over you. Now if you put a ward in that bush and saw the jungler, you would already have backed off and if the enemy jungler stays there then good since your other lanes would be able to go more agro and also gives time for your jungler to gank other lanes or countergank. Remember when  you ward one side of the bush in mid lane you always want to stay at that side since you have vision on that.\n\n3. Posistioning. Posistioning is what can win games, there were alot of scenarios where my adc is in the frontline while the tank is all the way back which gives the enemy assassin an easy pick off the adc since there would be no peel.Unless you&#039;re the tank, you always want to stay back and wait for all the cc to be burned on your tank before you engage.\n\n4.  Advantage. I have seen so many post like &quot;Omg I&#039;m done with ranked, I do so well but my team does shit&quot;. Understand that some games are just uncarriable but also if you are highly skilled or have overall better game understanding you will eventualy get out of that elo. What most bronze/silver players do when they get ahead is mostly push out their lane and waste their time trying to kill the enemy laner who is too afraid to even farm and waste their time on that instead of helping other lanes get ahead. You guys have to understand that if you get other lanes ahead you will not be the only threat but your other laners as well.\n\n5. Objectives. The thing about objectives is that you have to read the situation before taking a certain objective but for me I usually go \n1st tier turrets(Nexus turrets)&gt;Inhibs&gt;Baron&gt;Turrets&gt;Dragon&gt;Kills. Most bronzies like to think that if they ace the enemy it&#039;s a call for a baron but don&#039;t realise if they push mid right now it can be a potentially game ending push. I had many games in bronze where my team would chase a 50hp enemy instead of taking HIGHER objectives, the time they spent chasing the enemy could have gotten at least inhib turrets or get baron to half health. Apparently dragon is like the objective MUST here in low elo. I have a personal experience where we had a lee jungler and xin zhao enemy jungler.I warded dragon and we saw xin going there and lee wanted to contest it so I told him to get baron instead. When xin zhao finished drag the baron was quarter health and was definetely ours. My point here is that you have to read the situation before deciding on what objective to take.\n\n6. Score. To low elo, score seems like is what decides games. Let me tell you it is not the score but what you do for the team. I had a game where I was yasuo and went 4/10/4 but what did I do to make up for my deaths? I took turrets I warded for my team ALOT and that&#039;s what I did for the whole game. Take objectives and ward. We won the game eventually since the wave started building up all the lanes and while they were busy defending the wave we took baron and ended.\n\n7. Counters. MOST low elo players think that just because this guy pick zed I must pick kayle to counter him. NO! It does not work that way, it&#039;s not about who counters who but it&#039;s about your mechanics on that champion. Not convinced? Let&#039;s put redmercy agaist a newbie kayle. Will redmercy lose against the newbie kayle? Never since redmercy&#039;s mechanics with zed is really good he would overcome the &quot;counter&quot; but will redmercy lose against a skilled kayle? Possibly,it would all come down to who has the better mechanics. Note: Redmercy is a awesome diamond zed main,check him out :D.\n\n8. GG FF@20. OMG DO YOU KNOW HOW ANNOYING THAT IS!! Not only are you bringing down the team but you&#039;re being a little b1tch. Think about it, does saying &quot;GG FF@20&quot; help the team and get you a fking pentakill? No it doesn&#039;t so just shutup and play the godamn game. If you ever have a guy like this just mute him instantly.\n\n9. When to take a break. If you are on a 3 game losing streak, that&#039;s when you have to take a break, the more you play the more you tilt the more you lose. I learned that the hard way.\n\n10. MOST IMPORTANTLY.........Have fun! Remember it&#039;s just a game,unless you&#039;re trying to get to challenger (you would not be even looking at this post if you are) then just have fun. Be goofy and enjoy the game. This game was not meant to be something you have to get frustrated over at. Games are made for one to relax and have fun.\n\n\nEdit 1: Finally Silver 3. Just be positive and learn from your mistakes. You'll eventually climb :D","replies":[{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-01-04T08:09:19.667+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess in bronze, many outcomes in games were already dictated during match ups. Keeping in mind that keeping your win/lose in positive is very important. Don't be afraid to dodge some games when you are clearly seeing the levels in communication, bans, and champion's combination are not gelling at champions select. \n\nI made the mistake of carelessly playing out each and every game last season and ends up in elo hell! Not saying it was not my fault but just trying to saying that I could have manage it better to avoid some of the sure loses.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-04T11:41:01.106+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.

Whenever I decide not to give a fuck I do notice things improving. The games run smoother and I win games I did not expect to win with the people on my team. Actually knowing when to stop being half arsed about my performance is honesty why I'm still Bronze something tbh. Even when trying a part of me doesn't give a fuck and things only go to shit when I forcibly flick that switch off because EVERYTHING that goes wrong suddenly becomes a problem that throws me off.\n\n2. Wards are really important but it is also one of the worst parts of League when it comes to binding the team together. If everyone on the team brought at least one pink ward that would make things easier but, especially at low levels of play where csing is shithouse and people are ignorant of vision people don't buy them. If a player is behind they see more value in saving up for that item they need rather than buying a pink. Flip that on its head and players dominating lanes don't mind splashing out on some pinks wards. I do that and it makes me realise that success essentially buys you vision.\n\n3. My main is a squishy, immobile mage so I know all about positioning and how it can get you killed. Overlaps with warding because part of positioning is awareness of where everything is and respecting what champions can do. This is why many are in bronze, they don't \"get\" this, they don't think about it they don't want to damn well know about it. Maybe those players should try other games, like chess, that slow down the process of positioning pieces. Sure in League without team VC no one is going to do as you say MOST OF THE TIME and so you are only in control of one piece but if you play enough games you should be able to work out how you should react to a situation by risking yourself or not.\n\n4. Been seeing this more outside of ranked tbh. Some people just don't want games to end, or they want their champion to hit their late game power spike so ignored the team. Depending on team comp a team can knock down towers really easy or take other objectives. Kills might not be worth objectives early but late game when people are dead for 45+ seconds it makes the difference, providing you are in a position to retaliate, which some players don't know about because they usually don't carry. If they normally do this is where I see some issues because hurt egos will stop some players from caring about wins because they were not the hero and saviour of the team.\n\n5. Goes into 4. Leave that Nasus alone and your team will be in trouble. His team might have just been killed but while that was going on, he was knocking down turrets and no one came to stop him. I have been on teams being stomped but it still took 20 minutes for the dominating team to get their first dragon. They had the ability to have 3 or even 4 by then but they didn't take it. They didn't need it but the fact was that they should have taken it by then.  \n\n6. Go shit, win game. Everyone has this happen to them at some point. EVERYONE.  There will always be those that just scream SCORE SCORE SCORE, KDA KDA, I VAPE ON YOUR MUM'S ****, but everyone knows that the game can be turned around. Team comp plays a big part in this just as much as a team's willingness to try. Sometimes there IS nothing you can do. People should accept it but in low elo that is all everyone thinks about. \"How did we win this game?\" is not a sarcastic remark, some players genuinely don't know, maybe because they got carried but the thing is they had already given up at some point.\n\n7. New players have next to nothing to complain about from counters. You are shit. Your opponent is shit. Sure some champions make winning easier against other champions but they will make mistakes you can work on to beat them. Low elo players give up when they think they are hard countered and just roll over when they get stomped because they expect to lose.\n\n8. /mute\n\n9. Whiny, shitty kids? Time for break.\n\n10. see 1.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-01-04T07:36:54.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so if you want bronze do everything that dianagotswag said if you want out of bronze listen to ikeno\n\nand Diana to mute someone its not /mute its /mute (summoner name) or hold tab and click on the speaker next to the avatar you want muted.\n\nand people you hope not to meat in bronze is people like this diana.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-04T11:39:54.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=mutley,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=FozPsFYZ,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-01-04T07:36:54.559+0000)\n>\n> Okay so if you want bronze do everything that dianagotswag said if you want out of bronze listen to ikeno\n> \n> and Diana to mute someone its not /mute its /mute (summoner name) or hold tab and click on the speaker next to the avatar you want muted.\n> \n> and people you hope not to meat in bronze is people like this diana.\n\nhahaha made me laugh","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-04T13:25:32.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">1st tier turrets(Nexus turrets)>Inhibs>Baron>Turrets>Dragon>Kills\n\nI'm going to re-order these into a better order for most low elo players.\n\nNexus>5th Dragon>Baron>Nexus Turrets>Inhibs>Inhib Towers>4th/3rd Dragon>2nd/1st Tier Towers>2nd/1st Dragon>Kills\n\nReasoning for these are as follows;\nDragons are overrated in a lot of cases, their stats aren't high enough to actually exceed the use of getting towers, unless you are close to getting 5th dragon, then don't bother, take a tower instead, unless the tower is an impossibility and you still have the numbers advantage.\n\nDoing baron without an inhib down is stupid, in low elo someone will check it unless there are minions to farm, someone still might check it with an inhib down but it's less likely.\n\n5th Dragon is a better buff then Baron, so that obviously takes priority, but try to work out if you have time to down the nexus, downing only the nexus turrets isn't worth it.\n\nInhib towers are worth a lot more than 2nd or 1st tier towers, and should be treated as such, they are also generally better than downing an inhib due to the fact that it opens the chance to down another inhib next won fight, though this depends on circumstance of whether you want the enemy team in their base for a baron/dragon.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-01-07T00:41:08.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Objectives are all about situation tbh.
