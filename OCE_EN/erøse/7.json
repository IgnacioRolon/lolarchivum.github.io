What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-20T04:42:59.247+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of these are pretty good ideas actually. In fact, **Riot** already had a similar system to your \"player reviewed reports\" idea. They called it the [Tribunal](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tribunal).\n\nThe Tribunal is essentially a report system where players act as a jury and vote on punishments. **Riot** took down the old tribunal a while back, but now they've started work on the [updated tribunal](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/mEIlagLk-when-is-the-tribunal-coming-back?comment=0006).","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-07-20T13:44:53.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Tribunal system sucked ass, giving players the ability to spam whatever they want just to get the rewards they 'earned' was the dumbest idea since the dynamic queue changes.\n\nThe rewards you got, if you can even call it that, was not enough to justify spending the right amount of time per case to actually review the chat correctly and make an informed decision, therefore players would just spam whatever they wanted, get through their 20 cases in 20 minutes and get the same IP you would if you had just played some games, but with less stress than actually playing.\n\nUnless you get the right people who actually care and want to make this game better, regardless of pay or rewards, you may actually get somewhere, too bad there are just too many who want nothing more than to punish everyone since it makes them fell like a big man.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-21T00:13:01.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought the tribunal was actually really cool.

You could see how many players you helped ban, toxic days prevented... etc.\n\nI'd imagine most of the points you brought up, are a large reason why the Tribunal was taken down for a rework though.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-20T04:54:31.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hopefully the will update it soon because i'm sick of toxic players being toxic and getting away with it and they end up doing it all over again. I don't care if they are toxic to me because I can handle it, I just want the community to be close to a toxic-free community :P","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-20T08:53:57.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what image you have of the current system, but the[ Instant Feedback](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) system we have now is working really well. I'm not saying it is absolutely perfect, but it definitely deserves far more credit than it's given.\n\nI see people coming to the forums all the time asking how to reform. I see people being banned on here frequently as well. I talk with Player Support specialists who also tell me the same thing. Instant Feedback is banning toxic players as we speak.\n\n> _But wait, if Instant Feedback is working so well, why do I still see toxic players in the community?_\n> \n> + A lot of the toxicity you see in-game is actually from good players. These people are usually positive, but every now and then they'll have an off-day. The average League player is like this.\n> \n>  Your average League player might go toxic and receive a chat restriction, but then they won't become toxic for the next 6 months. But since there are so many of them it's actually fairly likely you'll run into a few during a week of play. **Riot** says these people account for [77%](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbYQ0AVVBGU&feature=youtu.be&t=4m34s) of all toxicity in League (which is massive).\n> \n> + The other reason is that toxic players still exist in League. The system is not perfect.\n> \n>  One of the system's faults is it gives people time to reform. This is a good feature for most players, but really toxic players are given the benefit of the doubt by the system, when really they should be perma-banned instantly.\n> \n> + [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias) also plays a big role in this. Essentially, people tend to remember negative events more than positive ones.\n> \n>  You can actually track how this affects you in your games. **Seras** has a great exercise for that [here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/xvZeJNIU-riot-please-try-to-fix-your-community?comment=000100000000).\n\nI absolutely understand where you're coming from. Let me be clear, I'm not saying _\"toxicity doesn't exist in League\"_, it's definitely there and still far too prominent. We need to put pressure on **Riot** to fix this.\n\nIt saddens me though when players think **Riot** doesn't care/does nothing. They really are trying! But this is a massive issue which might never actually be completely solved.\n\nThanks for reading such a long post :D","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Prince Smashy","date":"2016-07-22T01:20:43.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what should be punishable is the enemy players saying \"Honouring Anviva\", when Anviva is intentionally feeding.
