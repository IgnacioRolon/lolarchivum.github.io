Those mentioned champions are not universally strong to any player. Like I said though, if you know enough of builds and the champions limits they are all on the higher side of the unbalanced scale.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-11T17:25:17.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't unbalanced, to use something out of the recent rito podcast on the state of the game, a tank is deemed balanced at around a 52% win rate, as the fact that you have that champ on your team, means you have a tank, and are probably already at an advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T03:11:34.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well tbh, they can \"define\" it that way if they choose to but in reality when you take into account the amount of champions who are above that ratio and the champions below that ratio the definition of balance is the in between. I hardly think that anything above 52% is balanced. Just imo though.

And if a Zed could burst a tank Shen from 100-0 then THAT would be the biggest problem of all.\nHow the Shen managed to fucking catch the Zed in order to kill him tho... is a mystery.\n\nBut you're right about the others, Voli might as well be an assassin himself he does so much damage.\n\ntheres no point building damage anymore, If you build Full AD darius, you get around 300/400 AD and are really squishy, if you build tank Darius, you get around 300 AD and 4000 more HP (I don't have a fucking clue how that works, but it does and its fucked)","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-07-11T04:00:23.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like this ekko built full tank and dove our whole team and didnt die but ended up killing our adc in the process","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-07-11T02:04:27.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to say this but Zed got killed by the class of champions that are supposed to function best again him.","replies":[]}]}
