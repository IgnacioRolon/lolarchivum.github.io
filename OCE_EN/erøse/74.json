Great move rito,really great move.\r\n\r\nHere is his new passive:\r\nCamouflage (Passive) - several changes:\r\n&quot;If Teemo stands still for 1.5 seconds, he becomes stealthed. \r\nWhile in brush: Teemo sets up his camouflage twice as fast and can move around without breaking his stealth. \r\nUpon breaking camouflage by attacking or moving, Teemo gains the Element of Surprise, increasing his attack speed by (10 + [5 per level])% for 3 seconds.&quot; \r\n[NEW EFFECT] Teemo camouflage&#039;s twice as fast in brush &amp; can move in brush without breaking his stealth \r\nTime to stealth Stealth reduced to 1.5 seconds from 2 seconds. \r\nAttack Speed bonus changed to (10 + [5 x level])% from 40%\r\n\r\nHis mushrooms can also be bounced now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdk whats happening to the balancing team but the few recent patches,I feel like at least 25% of the chanes are not required.","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-28T05:08:42.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know, but this seems interesting. As annoying Teemo is, it is relatively hard to carry with Teemo because of his lack of actual burst, plus he is really squishy. As long as you play safe in lane he can't do anything. These changes are aimed at giving him more reign in the niche role he fills. His shrooms won't be able to burst in your face since they need to be on the ground to arm, so don't expect to be killed by a shroom to the face. However, he is a more dangerous ambusher now, which is the niche role I was talking about.","replies":[]}]}
