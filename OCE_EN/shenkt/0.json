IF the relic is taken by another person immediately, bots do not realize and will circle the relic point trying to get a heal that will never come.\r\n5) Grouped BOTS will often disconnect at the same time due to low resources used on the BOT machines.\r\n6) Name creation that is trying 'too hard' to look legit. The days of Dfhkxljeijwse being a bot name are over. JosephQlwdr are the more recent constructions. So the botters got smarter and now mash a real word/name with some garbage. \r\n\r\nhttps://puu.sh/CtOsO.png\r\nhttps://puu.sh/CtOsu.png\r\n\r\nIn the first image, there were at least 4 out of 5 bots on the Blue Team. This is the quality of the RIOT MATCHMAKING; put a whole team of real players up against a team of bots. Snowball+Exhaust+Stupid Stupid Name.\r\n\r\nSecond image, 2 on each team, and of course, equipped with Snowball + Exhaust.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter?   Because ARAM is a perma map, and should get the same protections that SR is given; be that in detection or just complaint/report handling. The bots do tend to come into the Draw Pool around at 8pm AEDST, so any of your 'valued' players, get a consistently horrible experience for the remainder of the night - The whole player base at that time of night has their experience trashed.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do when your draw 4 bots on your team vs a 5 man real team?  FEELSBADMAN\r\n\r\nEvery time a bot is put into a match, it ruins the experience for the players. When you put 4-5 of them into a team, it only shows that RIOTS detection of BOTS is not very deep in its' intuition; or challenging at any time, the progress of these bot accounts.\r\n\r\nI don't actually expect a reply from RIOT, because 3 paragraphs of the response will be saying crap like\r\n\r\n1) We appreciate your feedback and thanks    (L)\r\n2) We can not discuss our detection efforts   (O)\r\n3) Please use the report tool in-game-it works (L)\r\n\r\nI just hope they look at two pictures, realize how the BOTS stand out, and DO SOMETHING about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-09T10:22:50.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing that leads people to believe bots don't get detected is the punishment method. Bots aren't banned upon detection, they are banned in waves, specifically to obscure what exactly has been detected. These ban-waves vary in frequency but occur fairly often. I know Gehirn manually bans a lot of bots as well.\n\nLow level/low MMR ARAMs are unfortunately one of the gathering grounds for bots, since ARAM yields better EXP/time and bots don't make good players. There are methods in the works to further (and drastically) reduce the impact bots have, there's been some testing done on EUNE that has been largely successful.\n\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/10/dev-removing-cheaters-from-lol/","replies":[{"poster":"Tallyessin","date":"2019-02-02T07:15:45.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Time for a wave.

Bots are a real annoyance, and it'll be really unfair to completely crush the enemy because your team can get fed off bots. I have experienced a few incidents against them, but they were mainly on SR, and those have (mostly) been fixed. The ones on ARAM were, it seems like, even worse. I've played against a team consisting of 3 bots and 1 new player and it seemed very unfair. The bots were all towerdiving at 3/9 health, and the new player was spamming their abilities trying to be useful...I was actually quite horrified at the prospect of bots returning (I started playing draft to avoid them in blind on SR) and have stopped playing ARAM, though I like it more because it's not as toxic, like you said.","replies":[]}]}
