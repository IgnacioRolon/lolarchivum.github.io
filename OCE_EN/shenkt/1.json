The relevant numbers are in bold. \r\n\r\nThis is data to help enforce that the best conditions to reduce ping are achieved on a fixed or wired connection.\r\n\r\nYou should use in order 1) Direct connection via CAT/Lan cable to Modem/Router 2) Powerline adapters - Ethernet over Power  3) Wifi - all speeds, both frequency ranges.\r\n\r\nIf you must use wifi, ensure that you are using the best channel. This tool for Android works great, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;hl=en.\r\n\r\nNew routers often offer 5GHz as a frequency band. None of my neighbours use it, so see if your wifi card supports it and then choose a channel that is less cluttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n**BEST AVERAGE WORST**\r\n\r\n5Ghz band wifi AC  40/58/188\r\n\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n|                              FASTERHAWK -    0 |   34 |   34 |    0 |    4 |   14 |    5 |\r\n|                           172.18.212.13 -     0 |   34 |   34 |   25 |   46 |  179 |   37 |\r\n|                           172.18.69.149 -     0 |   34 |   34 |   28 |   47 |  181 |   38 |\r\n|bundle-ether4.cha-edge901.bris     0 |   34 |   34 |   29 |   42 |  169 |   32 |\r\n|bundle-ether6.cha-core4.brisbane  0 |   34 |   34 |   28 |   42 |  173 |   32 |\r\n|bundle-ether20.ken-core10.sydney.0 |   34 |   34 |   48 |   68 |  191 |   49 |\r\n|bundle-ether1.ken-edge902.sydne.- 0 |   34 |   34 |   43 |   69 |  197 |   54 |\r\n|               pr01.syd01.riotdirect.net -    0 |   34 |   34 | **  40 |   58 |  188** |   51 |\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider\r\n\r\n\r\nTPLINK POWERLINE ADAPTER (ethernet over power)  43/43/51\r\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\r\n|                       Host              -   %  | Sent | Recv | Best | Avrg | Wrst | Last |\r\n|------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\r\n|                              FASTERHAWK -    0 |   34 |   34 |    2 |    4 |   16 |    3 |\r\n|                           172.18.212.13 -    0 |   34 |   34 |   28 |   39 |   76 |   36 |\r\n|                           172.18.69.145 -    0 |   34 |   34 |   30 |   39 |   72 |   33 |\r\n|bundle-ether4.cha-edge901.brisbane.telstr-    4 |   30 |   29 |    0 |   30 |   34 |   29 |\r\n|bundle-ether6.cha-core4.brisbane.telstra.-    0 |   34 |   34 |   29 |   35 |   72 |   35 |\r\n|bundle-ether20.ken-core10.sydney.telstra.-    0 |   34 |   34 |   44 |   53 |   95 |   52 |\r\n|bundle-ether1.ken-edge902.sydney.telstra.-    0 |   34 |   34 |   42 |   47 |   86 |   44 |\r\n|               pr01.syd01.riotdirect.net -    4 |   30 |   29 |   **  43 |   43 |   51  ** |   45 |\r\n|________________________________________________|______|______|______|______|______|______|\r\n   WinMTR v0.92 GPL V2 by Appnor MSP - Fully Managed Hosting &amp; Cloud Provider","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-26T08:44:07.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What the fuck is this topic?\n\nYeah no shit wired connections are more stable HOWEVER.\n\n>| pr01.syd01.riotdirect.net - 0 | 34 | 34 | 40 | 58 | 188 | 51 |\n\nThis is a showing of you having a bad wifi connection, not a showing of how bad wifi connections in general are.","replies":[{"poster":"Shenkt","date":"2018-02-27T06:28:45.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It show that even a good clean wifi 5G, no competition for frequency, a top line Nighthawk, the wired is still favorable.\n\nThere were two components to this post.

The average ping is still better on a powerline.\n\nNot everyone takes the time to check and provide data on their experiences with things like Powerline adapters.\n\nYou have focused on the Worst result, rather than the averages which is what a normal person would take to be 'normal'.\n\nAll the 188 result did was highlight the crappy Telstra load balancers which I experience daily.\n\nThanks for your input.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-28T12:00:10.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean i'm on Telstra, and only use Wi-Fi.\n\nThe only times i have been having issues, is when telstra itself is having issues (though i mean... that seems like all the time at some points because telstra sucks but you know)\n\nAnd no i wasn't just refering to the \"worst\" category, though that is most likely heavily effecting your thoughts.\n\nConsidering you had a bunch of worst pings that were higher, it's likely your average is off base.\n\nAdd to that, the Best case scenario for the Wifi was actually BETTER then your wired connection, and i'm forced to point out your test wasn't a solid case.\n\nEDIT: this is without even going into the fact that your wired test has packet loss (only 29/30 packets made it), while your wireless doesn't, which is a higher impact on the game then ping increases (playing league with packet loss is terrible)","replies":[{"poster":"Shenkt","date":"2018-03-04T04:52:19.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TCP is not a 100% PL Free protocol, and 1 packet is not a big deal.\n\nBEST / AVERAGE / WORST\n\nTPLINK POWERLINE ADAPTER (ethernet over power) 43/**43**/51\n5Ghz band wifi AC                                                         40/**58**/188\n\nThe average of 43 is 15ms faster, on average, than a 5g  Wifi.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-03-06T05:39:45.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Considering you had a bunch of worst pings that were higher, it's likely your average is off base.\n\nReading is hard.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
