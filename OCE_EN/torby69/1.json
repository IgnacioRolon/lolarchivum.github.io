We lost in 18 minutes and 50 seconds before the 20 minute ff time. I was adc and my support was intentionally feeding. My jungle was afk roaming in the fountain. I decided to afk roam in the fountain with the jungle as it was a 100% loss. Got reported by my team because i was upset with the support. I didnt tell him to kill himself or anything for the ban. I just said &quot;i&#039;ve had enough of these trolling %%%%s almost every game. I was getting grieved by the support and by the mid laner as well.\r\n\r\nSecond game: the next game i had that same mid laner and jg on my team. I was adc yet again and my yasuo support didnt even join the game. It was 4 v 5 the whole time and their blitzcrank and tristana combo kept on killing me in lane. I was feeding unintentionally the majority of the game however there was a few times id afk in lane for a few minutes and die. This game i didn&#039;t swear or say anything stupid, i was just trying to farm. The same mid and jungle kept on grieving me calling me &quot;shit&quot; and going on my history and telling me how bad i was. We ended up winning anyways but the same mid and jungle (the support the game before that was intentionally feeding) kept on grieving me so they reported me. \r\n\r\nRun down: i got a 14 day ban for those 2 games and i find it very unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-12T09:11:42.411+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldn't find any games in your match history that matched your descriptions, so it's a little hard to get the feel for context, linking the match histories or your reform card or both would be extremely helpful to determine why you were banned.\n\nThat said, from your descriptions I'd say the ban was related to your AFKs. In the first game you say you AFKed in fountain, and in the second you said you were AFKing for minutes at a time, multiple times. Now normally you would only face leaver buster for this kind of behaviour, but if it was coupled with toxicity or intentionally feeding, or if it was consistent over many games/in ranked then it is very possible that is what netted you the ban.\n\nWithout the reform card or the match histories there isn't much more I can say as I don't have the context.","replies":[{"poster":"torby69","date":"2016-06-12T13:19:55.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your reply.\n\nFirst Game:\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/136727912/201494236?tab=overview\n\nSecond game: \nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/136745867/201494236?tab=overview\n\nApparently i was banned for flaming. I do agree that yes i was flamming in some regards as to using the \"C***\" word a few times and telling my team that \"i want[ed] to neck myself\" after seeing them not be able to 4 v 1 someone on the enemy team. However isn't that only a chat bannable offence? I believe i've been chat banned on this account once before, perhaps 6 months ago or so, maybe 4 i cant really recall but how does the suspension escalate from a chat ban to a 14 day suspension 4-6 months after that other ban?\n\nI'm also quite disappointed with the fact that the people grieving me and making me flame intentionally will most likely never receive a punishment. What they say and do (e.g. come into your lane and intentionally feed your opponent and then afk and spam their level 5 mastery emote and laugh emote at the fountain and type in chat \"you're shit stop feeding blah blah blah\") is just as bad as someone calling them c**ts and telling them to fuck off. How come people like that are never suspended/banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-13T01:10:20.243+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok I'll try my best to clarify for you. You mention you have received a chat restriction in the past, do you happen to remember if it was a 10 game or a 25 game restriction?\n\n[**Punishments generally follow a basic escalation path:**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-)\n\n** First Offense:** 10 Game Chat Restriction\n**Second Offense:** 25 Game Chat Restriction\n**Third Offense: **Two Week Suspension\n**Fourth Offense: **Permanent Suspension\n\nHowever it is possible to skip to a Two Week or Permanent suspension based on the severity of the behaviour in the game.\n\nAlso, [3 months of good behaviour will normally drop you a tier](http://(http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/mNBeEEkI/d/p7scKW1K?comment=00050000000000000000), so even if your last punishment was a 25 game chat restriction, if it was 4 months ago then this punishment would normally have been another 25 game chat restriction.\n\nYou do mention you are unsure of the timeline of that restriction though, so it is possible it was just under 3 months ago (though unlikely).\n___\nNow you have noted a few things from your logs which are pretty bad, but probably not bad enough to be escalated a tier in and of itself, without seeing the log though it's hard to say so you'll have to make that judgement yourself. I think likely it was not just your chat, but in game behaviour as well.\n\nIt is worth noting however that intentionally feeding will net you an instant 14 day ban (no point chat restricting an intent feeder). With just match history it's difficult to say when someone is just having a bad game vs intentionally feeding, because even if they have a couple kills/assists it could mean they tilted and fed some way through the game. \n\nThere are some games in you history (the Vayne game you linked included) that could be a little sus, so that is another possible explanation for your 14 day ban, but again I only have limited context on this side. \n___\nNow some advice. I know it's hard to ignore those kind of players, but the very best thing you can do is mute them (or at least ignore them) and move on. Anything and everything you say will be used as fuel for the fire, whether you have valid points or are flaming them back, and by responding with negativity in kind you only open yourself up to punishment.\n\nOf course it's extra frustrating when they are feeding/AFKing and there's nothing you can do about it, but the best advice I can give you is to just focus on improving something instead of on winning. Try focusing on getting as much CS as you can or on your kiting or something like that. It's not an ideal scenario, but ti's better than hanging around for however long until surrender lamenting at the loss and having your experience ruined more and more.\n___\nLast thing I'll say about your punishment is this, if you feel the severity of the punishment was too high for your actions, you can[ submit a support ticket ](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)to appeal the severity. This won't remove your punishment, but if you explain to support why you feel it was too severe (and make it clear you don't feel the punishment in it's entirety was undeserved, because from what you've said I don't think that's complaint) and they MAY drop it to a chat restriction. \n\nThat said, you should be fully prepared to receive a \"No\". However if you are unsure why your received the punishment you did they ought to be able to tell you. Just be polite, and they will be happy to help you.\n___\nI'll try to keep this short but I also wanted to address your second paragraph.\n\n> I'm also quite disappointed with the fact that the people grieving me and making me flame intentionally will most likely never receive a punishment.\n\nIf _**you**_ received a punishment, what makes you think _**they**_ won't? If you reported them in post game then their behaviour will be looked at as well. The behaviour you describe would get them punished very quickly, so I wouldn't worry about that.","replies":[{"poster":"torby69","date":"2016-06-13T04:15:45.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for clarifying in detail to me how the system works and so forth. I've submitted a support ticket but i highly doubt they will reduce the suspension to a chat restriction. And from all i can recall the chat restriction took effect many months before 3 months ago as i stopped playing for quite a while - however the 25 game chat restriction (im positive it was a 25 game one) only lifted once i started playing again on this account a month back. Perhaps this is the cause for the punishment to lift to a 14 day ban? Thank you for your time, ill take note of what to do in situations like this in the future and i hope to reform back into the LoL community.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-13T08:32:49.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm aware the three months would start from when you completed the punishment, so if you hadn't finished the 25 game chat restriction (they are of course game based not time based) until you started playing against recently, then that would put you on third tier (14 day ban) for this punishment and would make sense.\n\nGood luck :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
