However many of us stuck from bronze 5 to silver 4 see a reoccurring pattern of feeders, afks and people who don&#039;t deserve to be anywhere near level 30. I understand that some of us stuck in this &quot;elo hell&quot; may not have the same knowledge or expertise as higher elo players do, however many of us should not be placed within this lower elo bracket when compared to many of the other players in it.\n\nI&#039;ll bring up some ranked games and some outstanding facts as to how i am personally stuck in this elo hell. (I&#039;m not trying to say that i am perfect every game). \n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/138670739/201494236?tab=overview\n\nFor the most recent ranked game i had a 1/17 jax with 5.5k damage in almost 40 minutes.. even our soraka did more damage in that time with 9 k damage.. He intentionally fed and walked to lane and afk&#039;ed to let anyone kill him. This was because he gave up at the 13 minute mark as his score was 1/3 at the time.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/138484949/201494236?tab=overview\n\nThat was 3 ranked games ago. Singed decided to play ranked to show off his augmented singed skin. He refused to participate in the game which is shown through his 0 assists all game. Our adc was flaming all game and also gave up before the 20 minute mark.\n\nThese have been my most recent ranked losses and it is only evident that i have lost LP unfairly due to being paired up with people who do belong in elo hell. I personally did run through a rough time where i did belong in elo hell (which was only a couple of months ago which is shown in my ranked history) but since then ive spent time learning how to be a better player by duoing in norms with higher elo friends in silver and gold.","replies":[{"poster":"JIIMMEH","date":"2016-06-29T05:32:29.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are garbage dude, dont take offence, however.\n\nIm Gold 5, I duo with Plat-Dia RL friends, and sure, sometimes I can keep up, but the reality is my mechanics, awareness and everything are so far behind my friends. If you arent winning, its your fault, not your 0 and 19 jax. Im shit in gold man, just learn, push your lane, kill your lane matchup, make calls, be the one doing something.\n\nOnce again, you're not good, Im not good, dont be offended, just learn.\n\nEdit: if you want to add me, i can make you realise you are bad, and explain in depth exactly how you fix it.

It is really just one big ocean of varying skill and knowledge. Players in diamond-challenger will outclass a lower elo player for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. They have in SOME cases had more experience with the game and looked more extensively into how to play better and crap like that.\n\n2. They have a badge telling them they are really good, basically they get given a stupidly high ego relative to the ranks being played and this gives them immense confidence when playing with players they think they are way better than. I trialed for an analyst position for a challenger team and the 2 games that I watched, they were against a high diamond team(I thought they were like silver-gold initially) and the team I was analysing was a challenger team and looked like they were gold-plat. The second game they vsed a challenger team and for that game they played like they were bronze-silver.\n\nSince they use a 1v1 system for a 5v5 game. NO ONE is where they should be. Therefore the ranks of skill currently perceived is actually an illusion.  In all my time of playing I have literally been told I should be, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond and challenger. In over 4000 games the highest I have been is gold 4, even with the best overall stats in the world for twitch.\n\nDue to this setup, the level of gameplay is actually really low compared to its potential. Riot refuse to change the system even when they have a solo performance indicator almost properly set up for ranked system use. So I personally have quit the pursuit of solo queue and only play when I have a team I am confident can win almost every game.\n\nDo not think of yourself as garbage, think of yourself as always room to improve, you are not better or worse than anyone until proven otherwise.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mid Dumbledore","date":"2016-06-29T05:48:26.312+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To put it bluntly, it really doesn't. For every one troll, afk, or feeder, there is 1000 players who are in your position who want to climb. \n\n1. I was bronze for an extremely long time until I stood back and said, \"I'm really crappy at this game, I need to learn\". I stayed Bronze Division 5 until I said that, admitted it and looked at my mistakes. Just say it. \"I'm bad\". And it's not a shot at you. Definitely not. It's not a shot at anyone. Everyone is bad and everyone has things to learn. It's when you think you're good and you're better than others, that you are truly bad.\n\n2. Once I got rid of the \"It's my Teams Fault\" mindset, I climbed to Gold. I'm Silver now thanks to the trust I bestowed on my Bronze friends I play with, but I do it for the social interaction. The mindset of focusing on what my teams responsibilities are rather than myself, is a very toxic and awkward one to have, and it's looked down upon. Focus on yourself and your duty in whatever role your playing.\n\n      Lets just say your {{champion:84}} is feeding the {{champion:268}} because she is a bit brain dead. You as the 4/0 ADC have to focus on more important things, like the map, your positioning, the wards, your Jungler, the enemy Jungler, the CS, your Support. Not the 0/3 Mid Laner.\n\n3. If you play with your friends who are higher rank than you, you are not learning anything by getting carried from people with more game knowledge. Of course they can teach you. But it's not as effective as ...\n * Every time you die, evaluate.\n * Identify your mistakes.\n * Fix them\n * Get rid of the bad habit. \n * Learn.\n\n  How I got better was every time I died, I would ask \"why did I die\". Turns out I would place a ward down, but not look at the map, making the ward ineffective. Instantly, I would start making a habit of looking at the map every few seconds. Bang, already a better player.\nHowever, Game knowledge is much more important than Skill in my opinion. I bet you had no idea Zac's blobs can be smited or that Shaco's clone can't kill wards, or Nidalee can increase he spear dmg by walking backwards or that Bard's magical journey can't go through player made terrain or reading the patch notes is quite important :P. You could of known all those but you know what I mean.\n\n4. The ranking system has been altered every year, improving as it goes on. Obviously with Dynamic Queue, everything is just shitty. But your rank, fortunately is a great representation of your skill as well as your game knowledge. Tbh, you should be proud to be B1. A huge chuck of league players, and I mean 30-40%, only play Co-Op Vs AI and another good 20-30% are bronze 3-5.\n\n Right now, you're probably saying \"He's missing the point\". What I'm trying to say is, if you truly deserve to get out of bronze, the games where you don't have retards should out weight the ones where there is. For every one troll game, you should win the next 3, if you truly deserve to get out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Professor Chaos","date":"2016-06-29T04:40:51.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is this video from youtube which been posted on here before\nhttps://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Surry","date":"2016-06-29T04:33:05.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel ya dude, I'm in the same boat being a support main.
