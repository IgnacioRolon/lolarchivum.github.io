Because its a natural thing to fight back at things attacking you. Tf was being a &quot;top snob&quot; rubbing everything in with mixed curses just to aggravate and annoy me.  Vayne was being toxic because i died and got 2 of &quot;her cs&quot; when i ganked her. Blitz and yi were just joining vayne and tf for no reason just to attack me as well.\r\nGame 2\r\nRylia: im nub (all)\r\nRylia: be nice plz ;-; (all)\r\nRylia: use used ur stun like 3 times in that fight (all)\r\nRylia: -.- (all)\r\nRylia: i call hacks (all)\r\nRylia: ur aa did 270 (all)\r\nRylia: nah u just haxed (all)\r\nRylia: ty\r\nRylia: blitz god (all)\r\nRylia: i did,\r\nRylia: fking stun\r\nRylia: ur troll\r\nRylia: %%%% \r\nRylia: fuck off i was dead\r\nRylia: guess your job in life is to be a total prickfuck eh?

Only got 2 reports from both games in total. Which i would suspect were malph, noc and the pixie vayne.\r\n\r\nWhy do i get the punishment and they go scott free, seeing as 98% or so of it was caused by them, and no one told me there was a mute button in the game till the end of the second game.","replies":[{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-03-15T12:29:31.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL that is never happen to me\nJUST UNLUCKY MAN","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-15T11:33:53.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The \"he started it\" doesnt work in the real world dude","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-15T11:47:49.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, technically, both parties should be punished if they were causing it.","replies":[]}]}]}
