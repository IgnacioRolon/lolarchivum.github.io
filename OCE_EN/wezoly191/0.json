Thanks for checking in on this. The skin codes should be emailed out by Event in the next couple of days - it's a digital process rather than a physical skin card!\n\n>There are some technical limitations that mean the codes can only be sent out AFTER the viewing - apologies for the confusion, we need to be better about setting expectations here.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/f/6jGZAhT1/d/FO615RxE?comment=0006","replies":[]},{"poster":"Prophit","date":"2018-11-05T02:56:55.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can we get a comment on the streaming service? I think we deserve an explanation, considering a group of 14 of us booked out weeks in advance, to celebrate a tradition of ours to watch worlds and were extremely let down. The viewing would freeze every 3 seconds. Ridiculously impossible to see or follow what was going on. We sacrificed other engagements so that we could attend this night. \n\nMore than half of the booked out cinema had left during early game 2. What happened? It wasn't an internet issue because even YouTube and twitch were running fine on our phones with no lag. These viewing parties are not a new thing, I have been attending them for 4 years now. Some would have understandably little hiccups here and there, but not being able to watch the entirety of the stream?  That is far from a little hiccup. This was ridiculous to the least.\n\nThis coupled with no explanation, as well as no comment on the cosmic ashe skin we were promised (as if riot hoped we would forget) left us with very poor impressions of Riot and Event Cinemas' services. \n\nWe never had this problem with Hoyts.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-05T10:06:32.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you see my pinned comment in this thread or any of the red posts on the issue, the Ashe skin is a digital code and the system in place means they have to be emailed out after the event, and are slated to be done this week.\n\nAs for the viewing issues, if you were at the Albert St viewing I gather their satellite was damaged the night before, more info [HERE](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/community-events/b3Eyejer-bad-viewing-experience-and-false-advertisement?comment=0006). \n\nYou can also follow the Red Tracker for any new information: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/redtracker","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SubHero","date":"2018-11-04T03:36:40.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the same boat","replies":[]}]}
