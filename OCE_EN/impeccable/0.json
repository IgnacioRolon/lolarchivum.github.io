Calm your farm.\n\nThe problem goes both ways, the only way to get players who have good enough mechanics and enough confidence to execute the strats I want are the diamond/master/challenger players, it is just that my account is a statistical anomaly, and that is what I am trying to make people realise so that I can either recruit players who are good enough to execute the strats, or join a team who is good enough not to just lose against everyone higher rank than them.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2017-11-07T09:00:53.331+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay MR PUMA!\n\nHere is what I am going to tell you is probably the best piece of advice anyone is going to give you, so listen well.\n\nYou are shit! If you feel offended by that statement then you are not ready for pro play! Pro play is about criticism, pro play is about not being happy with your performance! Pro play is about doing whatever you can to be the best!\n\nIf you well and truly acknowledge the statement then it will be the road to your salvation! \nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Whitepumah\n\nNow I will tell you what you have to do if you want to be a pro player if not I will still leave this up here for people who actually want to become a pro!\n\nStep One!\nFirst and foremost pick a flipping role! You have played 64 different champions I have no clue what you main but I can assume you play ADC since well you got 600 games on twitch!\nA pro player will only play the champions in his role or if need be the complementary to his role but will dodge if auto-filled into anything else. Some contracts require that too!\nFor an ADC main they must pick primary for Marksman and Secondary as Support! As the knowledge base for both the roles can be correlated to each other. Plus both the roles start the game in bot lane and lane until laning is over so, therefore, having an understanding of the bottom lane would be beneficial\nStop playing flipping JUNGLE AND TOP LANE!\n\nStep Two!\nEvenly distribute your games across all marksman type champions. Each champion brings about a different type of gameplay and understanding to a game! You have had way too many games on twitch and not so much on the others so your understanding is equivalent to one trick! That means you base your strategy off the champion you play the most! in this case, it would be twitch!\n\nPS! One tricks don't work in competitive gameplay as your twitch will be banned against you every game! And you may think Ow I still have other champions I can play well the answer to that is yes you do but you will still lose! Since you have no recollection of how to play a losing matchup with someone like Lucian since you only have had 1 game on him! And died 12 times. \n\nPro players don't play more than one champion just for the fun of it. They do it to understand how lanning phase works into unfavourable and favourable match ups! So they can learn to abuse their laners and their weakness in a role reversal matchup!\n\nStep Three!\nWatch your replays! If you can go through your own replays and watch where you died and pinpoint what you did that lead to that death and how you can avoid it in the near future! That will gain you the ability of an average improving player! If you can pinpoint your deaths and what you could have done instead to take down the enemy nexus without any casualties then you are on your way to pro play!\n\nStep Four!\nWatch competitive gameplay! If you don't watch competitive gameplay and understand why each team is making the decisions they are then you my friend dont deserve to even be considered by any team. Competitive League of Legends and solo queue for ranked are two distinctly different games! If you cant accept this fact then that is further proof of not being ready for pro play!\n\nStep Five!\nGet a higher rank! You may not want to hear this but players in Challenger have also put in multiple hours into champions and the game to get that rank! They have the same dedication and determination as you so why should they be overlooked for your gold rank! You are nothing special! In order to stand out, you need to be at the very top of the game! So make it your mission to become the best otherwise the pro play thing that you keep asking everyone to give you a shot as well just be a distant fantasy!\n\nFollow these guidelines and in no time you will be part of a team! But at the end of the day it is only up to you to make yourself better! If you are not ready to accept and change the way you see things! well then all of this is a waste and you may never get what you want!","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-11-07T09:34:23.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Implosion,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=htiEOmqn,comment-id=0000000300000000,timestamp=2017-11-07T09:00:53.331+0000)\n>\n> Okay MR PUMA!\n> \n> Here is what I am going to tell you is probably the best piece of advice anyone is going to give you, so listen well.\n> \n> You are shit!

You think you have learned something about the Tooth Fairy. But you haven’t. Your data has another explanation, parental behaviour, that you haven’t even considered. You have deceived yourself by trying to do research on something that doesn’t exist.”","replies":[{"poster":"Wolves","date":"2017-11-08T10:18:46.277+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"What are you on about man? You can only hold a non-biased opinion if you have taken up both paths. Whats this tooth fairy stuff have to do with anything. \n\nYou are literally saying I want things to be done my way and I want to be a pro. SO the world will have to change to suit me and give me the opportunity to do so. That's the most arrogant thing I have heard anyone say.\n\nLike the methodology I just described above to you has been done and proven by many players some of which originated in bronze. A lot lower rank than you are currently are sitting at.\n\nLike if you want to be a doctor, you have to get a degree, a medical certificate and have practiced under supervision in real operations. You don't just rock up to a hospital and say I understand how the human body works, now make me a doctor so I can prove it.\n\nSame with athletes. Unless you haven't realised pro players are athletes. They practice several hours to a day to hone their muscle memory and better their decision making against other high calibre players. To simply want to play with pro - semi pro players cause you think you have a unique strategy that players of your rank cant execute is blatantly delusional. \n\nThere is no special treatment to anyone! You want a spot to trial in a pro team you have to work hard to gain that role and their attention. They don't just set goals so anyone could join, only the most dedicated and determined person that won't let anything stop them can be there. \n\nAnd news flash, that's why they are challenger! So get your act together or don't bother doing pitty post and acting all high and mighty thinking your above everyone to get a position to trial. If anything I should get a trial in a pro team over you. I grind so many hours looking at pro play and analysing my game to improve. Heck, I was even diamond 1 two seasons ago. I still remember how hard I worked for that. \n\nSO yea back of the line buddy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-25T19:28:42.442+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=whitePumah,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=htiEOmqn,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-10-25T14:44:59.705+0000)\n>\n> Someone told me they got to challenger in under 500 games from their first game.
