By restricting yourself to diamond 2+, you are literally ignoring 99.74% of potential players who just might be good enough to play in this team you are trying to make, and those players you find who are better might be the difference between making OCS or not. That is real money that can give players the incentive to become better and get a taste at playing professionally. Worst case scenario you end up choosing those players of diamond 2+ because you think they are better and everyone else gets experience at playing with players of higher rank.\n\nA good example I can give would be Blacktown city demons in NSW Premier league, who are semi professional and their 1st grade team get paid to play. When they hold trials, they are completely open trials, anyone who wants a trial regardless of their prior experience gets to have a go. The last time I checked, they were strong contenders for top 4 finshes in their leagues.","replies":[{"poster":"JaydonRynn","date":"2017-06-02T02:35:03.900+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lmao dude chill your gold 4, focus more on soloq and being more active","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-06-02T04:41:02.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have no reason to be active right now, I am waiting for a specific player in my team to get his PC sorted before we get back into flex and solo queue is a roll the dice every game so there is no point playing it.

First of all man you're a joke as I said, No one takes you seriously, The reason why its d2+ is because anyone who's decent is d2+ and everything under including me is trash. You're just making yourself look like a jester in a court of men just trying to get through the Halls of Justice and work there way up.

Probably because they so badly want to believe that the rank they are gaining or have gained is achieved only by them playing well and not by the luck of the RNG.\n\nOnce again humanities biggest downfall is emotion over logic. The act of disregarding logic because it doesn't agree with them.\n\nIn my opinion gaming is about improving and challenging yourself in an enjoyable environment. The win/loss ranking system that was solely designed for 1v1 being used in a 5v5 has negated the representation of comparative progression. So because players cant see any indication of their own progression besides win/loss, false readings start to mislead their development and then you have people building statik shiv and last whisper and thinking its a great combo. So you end up with all this sub optimal strategy taking place and if anyone dare strays from that path, they get flamed and their teammates decide that they should lose the game on purpose to teach them a lesson and intentionally feed the game away.\n\nHow much simpler would this all be if your performance is what gave you or took away LP and MMR. I have already given an untested theoretical solution as well which Riot have already got the foundations for. Then their pretty much won't be an excuse, better players will be practically guaranteed to climb and then you would start to see how truly amazing players and teams can become. There is a reason I watch starcraft 2 professional games and not professional league of legends games, cause relatively what I expect from pro players in starcraft 2 is what they deliver and the same cannot be said for league of legends.","replies":[{"poster":"Mjolnir","date":"2017-06-05T00:27:39.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You talk as if you're speaking logically, You're speaking from anger because you're angry at riots system and you want to completely dis-regard a theorem that works.

You're a hypocrite and a fucking disgrace. If you love star craft 2 so much and think its better, Quit league and uninstall it then.

Show me some maths that overrides my own apparently inferior and basic mathematical evidence.\n\nMathematics can be incomplete, but never misinterpreted, so please use it.\n\nMy reason is that each player is only 20% of his team, therefore his rank is only 20% his own.
