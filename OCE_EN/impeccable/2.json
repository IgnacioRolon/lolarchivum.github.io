These will be held either weekly or a lead up to a monthly. \nMy current aim is to try to fill the slot around where there isn&#039;t much happening in Oceania.\n\nI have setup the brand and got the transition between matches for the stream made. \n\nI am looking for business partners or people who I would give shares to if they join now and are maintaining an active role in this startup.\n\nSo as it stands we would need:\nCasters! (2 Position)\nTournament Admin (2 Position)\nProducer that manages the stream (1 Position)\nGraphic Designer (1 Position)\nSocial Media Person (1 Position)\n\nLet me know in the comments if you are open or chuck me a PM!","replies":[]}
