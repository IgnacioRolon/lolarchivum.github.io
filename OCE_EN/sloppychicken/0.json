It isn&#039;t until we are loading in that i realise that the player who got adc has locked in shaco with ignite and smite. I don&#039;t think too much of it and assume that he&#039;s gonna try some weird funneling strat bot lane. I go to my first buff and my shaco waits until it is low enough and smites it, stealing it and basically fucking up my game from level 1. He then proceeds to follow me to every camp and steals as many camps as he can (which he can easily do on Shaco). The game is literally unplayable for me at this point so I threaten to leave the game, after which players on my team threaten to report me. They all side with the shaco and say I should stop complaining and play (which is impossible at this point as he is still stealing all the camps). The Teemo on my team begins telling the other team to report ME so I assume he&#039;s duo with the shaco (which I later found out hes not, makes no sense). The Shaco just says ??? ignoring anything anyone says to him. My anger is through the roof at this point so I begin saying some admittedly toxic things and leave the game.\r\n\r\nI wake up the next morning to see a 10 day chat restriction (never had any sort of restriction or ban before) with threats of getting a suspension. Meanwhile, I know this shaco will walk away scot-free without any sort of punishment for ruining my game. It angers me that riot would rather ban people for words, rather than trolls who will ruin an entire game, fucking people over and wasting their time. I know this game was normals, but I was already tilted and just wanted to have one proper game before I got off for the night. \r\n\r\nthank you","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-07T03:27:11.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"To me it sounds less like they sided with the Shaco and more they sided against you abandoning them as well. You wouldn't have received a chat restriction for nothing, but without your logs we can only speculate.\n\nIt's pretty clear there is more to the story but we don't get all the info here on boards. If you want feedback on your punishment we can offer it if you post your logs, but we aren't privy to other specifics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-12-07T01:04:26.752+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":3,"body":"Riot don't actually care about banning the actual troublesome players.

The most they focuses on is the developing skins and so fort not the actual gaming experience. If they really do care, they would have came up with an actually strat to combat this issue, but no they continues to develop and releases skins instead. They are a lot of things that are very unfair and un fun about the game but riot just dont give a shit i guess.","replies":[{"poster":"XXDragonForceXX","date":"2018-12-07T10:43:28.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"riot dont care about players, they dont care about banning toxic players, riot only care about money , controlling who wins in ranked, ever noticed how the only champs that get new skins are the popular ones or the ones riot try to push into the meta, riot is corrupt as it comes,","replies":[{"poster":"Shywolf","date":"2018-12-09T02:56:59.367+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit extreme dude and do you really want a new skin for corki or skarner?\n\nWhy would they make skins for champs ppl don't play?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Shywolf","date":"2018-12-09T03:08:30.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When it comes to banning trolls and people that ruin the game Riot really only look into the reports from ranked games. \n\nToxic players from both ranked and normals will be put through a chat scan and if the player said a banned word they get punished. \n\nBUT riot does not ban people for trying out new builds or different picks in lane **IN NORMAL GAMES **(for example someone picking Irelia adc or Shaco support). \nIf you try this in Ranked you better win cause if you get reported most likely Riot will notice and ban you for trolling.\n\nThe best thing for you to do in this situation would have been to just try playing adc and let the Shaco jg. I know it sucks but this was a normal game, what do you expect?\n\nJust /mute all and play the game the best you can, roam, ward and do objectives and hopefully the Shaco wouldn't put your team too far behind. At the end of the game report him, but don't get your hopes up for perma ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Shywolf","date":"2018-12-09T03:15:19.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do however want to say that I am sorry that you had a bad experience, just remember that there will be games like this.

You will very rarely be banned for feeding or for doing something dumb like this Shaco.
