He is a guardian right? Why does he selfishly heal himself when others take damage? I mean every role you look at him he has short comings. Top lane tank he doesn&#039;t have sustained damage and just cannot compete with the current fighters. In mid his early game is strong but building him glass cannon for damage means he falls off fast. And as a support he can only assist properly when his ult is up and his shield really helps himself more than his allies. Here are my thoughts on some things that could help him as a support, which is what I assume he should be.\r\n\r\nPassive: Runic skin\r\n Although I like that he converts magic resist into ability power thats just not really enough anymore. I believe to help him out a bit more he should additionally convert Armor into bonus magic damage on hit. If he is going to be disadvantaged by melee range attacks at least give him some pay off for getting up close.\r\n\r\nQ: Resolute Smite\r\nI think this ability is fairly good as is damage wise and with the slow, but I think adding the new immobilize debuff to this could be a good addition without adding too much power. Its about time there was a supp with a not so easy to land skill shot that can slow down champs like Kalista.\r\n\r\nW: Bulwark\r\nOf all his skills this one makes the least sense. &quot;A guardian is always prepared&quot; to let you die while I get all my health back. Best guardian. I think the shield should still grant the bonus armor and magic resist to allied champions, but instead of always healing Galio let it heal whoever was shielded for a % of the damage taken at the end of the shields duration. Enemies have a chance to kill them while the shield is active but at the end it can shift the fight. It also means Galio in urf can&#039;t just heal eternally and never die.\r\n\r\nE: Righteous Gust\r\nI think just adding some speed isn&#039;t enough anymore. It still should but I think it should have some more oomph. I think a slight knockback to enemies hit is a good move. Galio gains a small disrupt and just that tiny bit of extra cc. Hitting enemies with his q would nullify the knockback thanks to the immobolize thus not making an ult initiate any more difficult.\r\n\r\nR: Idol of Durand\r\nI think his ult is great and really have nothing bad to say about it. The rest of his kit was where I took issue.\r\n\r\nAnyway these are just my thoughts I just want riot to notice that Galio is in need of an update but doesn&#039;t require a full rework.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-05-08T02:24:05.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You mention you think he has no identity, but then you remove his identity and just give him utility buffs. He has always been the anti mage/DOT/bulk ap comp champ. Giving him armor scaling just makes him another walking bunch of free stats. \n\nI think a better idea for his shield would be to remove the heal and the defensive stats and instead give a damage reduction vs DOTs and magic damage. This further solidifies his identity. \n\nI'd like to see his Q have slightly reduced damage and a brief silence. I'll note at this point that galio does not need str8 buffs. So any added utility should be met with compensation..\n\nHis E.... I don't know about his E. Maybe something comparable to Lux shield.\n\nThese changes would certainly destroy his damage and thus kill his full ap mage niche, but give him much more utility and solidify his 'identity'. Perhaps he could have a small buff to his passive if he felt underwhelming but I wouldn't see that necessary considering how devastating he would be in and against the right teams","replies":[{"poster":"Amazing Woody","date":"2016-05-08T08:10:24.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Primarily he is supposed to be a tank and I meant move some damage and focus more on his defensive and disruptive capabilities and put him into a supporting role.

Personally i find it to be a poor interaction.\nAs for having an identity that counters dots, thats a pretty sad identity, it would be like saying nunus identity is to counter pet champs, there are so damn few champs that even have dots that its meaningless to 'counter' it, all it really serves to do is ruin swain and brands day.\n\nAs for what his identity is? i dont think there really is much on his kit that represents his theme, i think there is a disconnect between theme and identity, and i think they should solidify him as a gargoyle, not as an antimage dot champ destroyer\n\nI wouldnt be too opposed to him having a silence, gameplay counter to mages is a fuck ton better than a stat counter.\n\nI have a suggestion for his E\n\nI dont think he should be a high damage poke mage who also just happens to be a tank, so i would feel more than happy to see his damage gutted in order for him to become a utlitiy tank","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-08T13:43:11.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The issue with Galio is that he's an anti-mage tank who scales with magic resist.

Its a crappy interaction, it simply says \"you beat mages\", id like to see something that makes him stronger against mages for gameplay reasons, not just for stat reasons!\n**Runic Bulwark - **When galio is inflicted by a hard CC (polymorph, stun, suppression, charm, fear, knockup/back/pull etc) he instead turns to stone for the same duration and regenerates X hp\n_This kind of keeps with the idea that he counters mages by having a counter to CC, which they have more than most champs, but it does so in a more interesting way. this also ties in his current bulwark ability which could be replaced with something more interesting. Whats more, its thematic, he turns to stone, it changes the way he plays into something alot more risky_\n\nNext i want an ability that uses his wings, and im thinking of a telegraphed macro sort of leap ability that throws him into enemy territory, kind of like zacs slingshot, but a little more obvious,  slow and with no CC, this is just so that he can engage for his ult and doesnt need to rely on flash, adding some unpredictability into his kit since nobody will engage on galio as is, which isnt really much fun. \n**Righteous Gust -** Galio marks an area to fly to, he then braces for 2 seconds before launching himself onto that area, leaving a gust of wind behind him that increases allies movespeed in the direction galio flew. Damage while channeling will interrupt the spell.\n_The speed boost might be a little OP perhaps for team engages, but i think having a long range but unreliable engage tool would do wonders for his kit, it would strictly be used to engage and to throw him into the thick of combat where the enemy would be forced to react to him but would be useless for in combat mobility, making it strictly for engaging and not for safety_\n\nHis bulwark would be baked into his new passive, so that ability could change to something else, he could keep his shield on ally, but i dont personally think its too thematic, or he could just have something that stuns himself, giving him damage reduction and enabling his passive? this would help him survive the initial burst of damage when he launches into the enemy team\n\nResolute smite could also change, but im fine with him having a basic ability on his kit, not everything needs to be amazing, though i would prefer a spell that uses his stone claws.\n\nBeyond that, not sure what else i would want to see on him tbh, Id like to see him directed more towards being a melee champ that dives and whose mere presence causes enemies to panic, also someone who can weather a storm and just be a rock. I do really want him to have that leap though, not just because i want to add mobility onto him or i want to turn him from a warden to a vanguard, but rather abilities like his ult wind up relying on flash, and having some baseline support in his kit would, imo, go a hell of a long way. getting 5 man ults should be galios dream.\n\nJust my opinion though","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-05-08T08:16:26.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Galio's W against Brand\n\ngg.","replies":[]}]}
