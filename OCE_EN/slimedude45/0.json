Or if you haven't Enlisted, you can do so simply by clicking the \"Enlist\" button that's somewhere on the page right below this line \"Oceanic Homeguards, it's time to take action!\" if I'm not wrong.\n\nIf you're Enlisted and logged in, the page should show various current details such as the \"Battle Timer\" (how much time left for a Monster), the Monster's HP bar, battle record against the Monsters, which map is currently on \"bonus\", and how much contribution you've made so far.\n\nEach win in any map besides I think bots and custom mode should win you 1 point, or 2 if you are playing a given map in their respective bonus days (the details for bonus days are at the very end of the webpage).\n\nThe rewards are unlocked in a milestone fashion, with each Monster's defeat serving as milestones. The first 2 rewards are unlocked and benefited by any player regardless of whether or not they are participating, so every player should find the entire champ roster f2p and that they can Mystery Gift themselves in the storefront just fine (self Mystery Gifting should be available in the \"Featured\" section of the storefront, called \"Double Legendary Chance Mystery Gift\"). The all-champ-f2p and self-Mystery-Gift last only til the end of this event.\n\nHowever since the 3rd milestone, with the sole exception of the 4th reward, every other rewards from now on are limited to those who have contributed. The 3rd reward, the Hextech Chest and Key, requires you at least have 4 points of contribution _overall_. So if you haven't Enlisted, or that you haven't earned 4 points so far, I'm afraid you've missed that.\n\nBut do not fret, as long as you complete 20 or more points of contribution by the end of the event, you can still receive 2 sets of Hextech Chest and Keys. 20 point is really easy to earn, you only need 10 wins on the whatever map that's currently in \"bonus\" (and much faster if the said map in bonus is ARAM or TT).\n\nSo good luck.\n\nEDIT: info correction about the 3rd reward.\n\nEDIT2: word swap from \"mode\" to \"map\" for higher accuracy.","replies":[{"poster":"SlimeDude45","date":"2017-01-30T14:48:53.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks so much sadly ive missed the hextech stuff but again thanks for the info cheers Sekai","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-30T15:02:50.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlimeDude45,realm=OCE,application-id=6jGZAhT1,discussion-id=AAU2kQRU,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-30T14:48:53.734+0000)\n>\n> ok thanks so much sadly ive missed the hextech stuff but again thanks for the info cheers Sekai\n\nNo worries.\n\nOh and here is a correction for one of the misinterpreted info from the webpage in my last post: With the 3rd reward, you didn't need to contribute 4 points during the 3rd Monster's fight to be eligible for it, you only need to have at least 4 points _overall_. So if you've got at least 4 points under your belt regardless of where they came from, then your Hextech Chest and Key is coming, it just takes a while for everyone to receive it, but should arrive within 24 hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-31T08:34:12.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick clarification here, it didn't have to be 4 points on that day, but it did have to be 4 points before the end of that day, so he still won't get his chest unfortunately.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-01-31T10:57:23.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is correct.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2017-01-30T16:37:49.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just wanted to say that this is all correct and a extremely good explanation of the event!
