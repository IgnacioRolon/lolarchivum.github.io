I get a solid 25 ms ingame and 60fps locked and yet I still stutter in game and whilst i see the other players moving around I don&#039;t see them actually attacking each other until my champ catches up in real time and all I see is everyone moving in fast forward action. Its like my champ is stuck in time lol and by the time I get control of my champ I&#039;m either dead or somewhere way behind where the fight took place.. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve checked packet loss and I have zero. I&#039;ve also checked speeds and uploads and everythings running the same and Ive reset router and reinstalled league lol.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-11T06:10:44.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nDefinitely does sound like there's some sort of connection issue going on here.\n\nCould you do the following for me;\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
