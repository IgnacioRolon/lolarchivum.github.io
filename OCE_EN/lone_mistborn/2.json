It&#039;s just that since it was brought back during figure fest I was wondering whether that still applied or not. It would be nice to get value from buying the urf figure and getting a random figure but I still don&#039;t know whether that is still valid. I guess that also includes the other stuff you get with the urf figure like when you did during the urf mode time period.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me out that&#039;d be great","replies":[{"poster":"DreamlessDays","date":"2015-12-01T04:31:29.517+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey buddy, cheers for posting about this, I wouldn't have known about the Urf Figure otherwise.
