Can we actually submit our votes in? Because when I go to do so it asks me to log in even though I&#039;m already logged in. Once I click it, it just takes me back to the voting page and when I go to submit it just does it again. It&#039;s really annoying and they said that the voting ends on the 8th? I want to submit my vote now but it&#039;s not letting me.","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-04T01:09:42.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know its annoying, Do it through your league client and it will redirect you ...  they really need to fx this fast","replies":[]}]}
