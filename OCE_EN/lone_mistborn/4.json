It doesn&#039;t happen every game but it happens way more than it should be for myself as it pretty much never happens to me. Has anybody else had the same problem as I have? Just lagging when you know you shouldn&#039;t be? Because it feels like the new patch has been causing it. Somebody I played with in a ranked game before said he seemed to be lagging lately since the new patch came out as well.\r\n\r\nThere was also the time where I was playing ARAM games and when everyone was 100% it would just sit there for a while. Then I close and reconnect to my game and it said something like &quot;Your internet connection is not...&quot; Something to do with the game not being connected to the internet anyway. So I&#039;d relog and it would work. I&#039;d only be around 40 seconds into the game but even then that does not happen. It happened for a few games but then that disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not sure if I can get help or any opinions with this but I&#039;m just putting it out there.","replies":[{"poster":"cakeGG","date":"2016-08-27T06:09:13.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the past 5 or so days I will get random ping that hovers around 150 - 200.

If you can, try restarting your router as this can fix some issues. Otherwise I would try sending in a support ticket if the issue persists","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-08-26T23:42:41.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have gotten lag, even though no one else was using the internet.
