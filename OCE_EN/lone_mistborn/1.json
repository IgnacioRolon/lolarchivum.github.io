When they announced that her W cast was going to be like Viktor&#039;s E and Rumble&#039;s ult I was looking forward to it. However, when I played her now, the W just doesn&#039;t feel right. Either it&#039;s lacking something or I&#039;ve gotten used to her previous W. I think that when using her W she either needs the circle showing where her ability is going to be because when I use her W at the edge of the indicator I can&#039;t tell where my limits are (because it wouldn&#039;t work most of the time). Also when casting it you have to be really quick about it because I want to also click as soon as I cast it (to dodge skillshots and what not) but when I do it cancels it and I find it really annoying.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was just wondering about your thoughts. I know it only came out pretty recently but still I thought it would be a bit easier.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-13T09:03:32.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It feels disgusting.

I feel like that's what they were aiming for as well. It would be easier for newer players to learn Taliyah now with this mechanic but for the people who have played her a fair bit like myself before the change it just doesn't work out properly. I think they could at least included the circle for the W placement like they did pre-change.
