I just thought I'd mention this as I love playing Blitzcrank and I just thought basing that some characters in-game such as Rammus; having the King Rammus title that is also a replica to the Mario Brothers character, Bowser.\r\n\r\nSo maybe this might be an idea to look into if some people think Blitzcrank could use this skin quite effectively to it's potential.\r\n\r\n***Images***\r\nhttp://medialb.ultimedia.com/multi/3sv8x/3kp5vp-L.jpg\r\nhttp://cdn.hitfix.com/photos/5838192/iron_article_story_large.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-13T06:29:52.360+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha that would be interesting, I am looking forward to this movie though.","replies":[{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-13T06:36:45.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Captain pantheon , Iron blitzcrank, hulking mundo,black window elise, hawk eyed ash.  and  now the avengers have assembled","replies":[{"poster":"Holland","date":"2015-01-13T07:28:29.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thor can be Olaf.
