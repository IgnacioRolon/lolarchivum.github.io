Using her magic to get out of trouble, she was able to get away cleanly without consequence from the corrupt law of Noxus. Orphaned and facing life threatening situations on a daily basis, Yuel Barely survived the horrors that shaped the city. Though one night after stealing more food from the local shops, she came across two brothers {{champion:122}} {{champion:119}} the same age as her. But they were weak, cold and near death. Taking it upon herself, she nursed the boys back up to full health and even managed to teach them a trick or two. But one day when she was trying to perform and experience new ways to enhance her abilities, she accidentally became a burst of bright magic hurting one of the boys in the process leaving a permanent white mark on his hair. Horrified and feeling guilt, she fled and went into hiding. Now older and more experienced, Yuel still wonders what happened to the two boys if they survived the horrible and unforgiving city. But as she was wandering the streets, she came across a man in bulking armor. She was about to think no little of it when she she caught the sight of the white streak in his hair. Shocked and overwhelmed that he had survived her magic encounter when they were young, she tailed the man and made a vow to repay what she had done to him.\n\n_\"My strength is to care for others. Do not hinder it...or you will regret it\"    _\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nYuel is in a league of her own away from your usual support choices. While most supports have a shield or a heal to help their team, Yuel puts her own life on the line when it comes to securing kills or fleeing from enemies. Yuel players should note that they shouldn't be afraid to die. It literally comes with the job. But that doesn't mean she's weak either. When played correctly, a good Yuel should know when to initiate a battle and to help her teammates survive. Her whole kit is designed to save your teammates.
