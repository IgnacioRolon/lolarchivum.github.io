How does this happen? \n\nIt happens because you didn't perform to the highest quality of what players in your region in that role played.\n\nVery simple. You have to do better.\n\nFor wards, warding, KP, and all the usual stuff can be improved. It's actually fairly hard to get an S grade on a support in a 20-25 minute game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-11-01T15:04:49.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"because cs u have none so it wont give u an S unless u do better so either take cs or take kills","replies":[{"poster":"Purpl3Jungl3","date":"2016-11-01T20:09:18.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No lol.
