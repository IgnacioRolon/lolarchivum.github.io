A giant hulking mass of a tortoise. it has lots, like lots of health, not armor, very slow movement speed and attack speed. it has an ultimate ability that lets it become momentarily invincible as well as slow down its self for team fights, somewhat like tryndamere&#039;s undying rage ultimate, except you just dont lose any health at all, it has a q ability of a shield, a w ability of hiding in a shell to regenerate health at a slow rate and not be able to move and i dont have an idea for an E ability. although some of these abilities might be impractical so its here on the boards for discussion on an idea for like a turtle, tortoise or a shelled champion. i&#039;d love to hear what you guys have to say\r\n\r\nor for a heal you get like 20% of your unused shield put into health maybe as a passive?","replies":[{"poster":"swiftdestruction","date":"2016-04-03T12:16:06.226+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rammus duh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Thornax11","date":"2016-05-03T08:17:03.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah good idea, just sounds not that fun to play. Maybe if he had a realy nice damage ability, or a passive that interacted with his abilites, giving health etc...","replies":[]},{"poster":"FxH","date":"2016-04-03T14:07:21.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"naw","replies":[]}]}
