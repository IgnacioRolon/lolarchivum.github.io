Your client is a joke. Having to wait a stupid amount of time because the accept icon on the centre of the screen won't go away for the 2nd time tonight? I mean it's only been a problem for the past 20 patches or so. Happens regularly to not only myself but duo partners and friends alike. inb4 \"repair your client see if that fixes it\" been and done it.\r\n\r\nAre we actually going to see the client and game get brought out of a beta stage or do we need to sit here whilst the riot gods punish us for toxicity? Asking for a friend.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\nA rather frustrated pleb.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-20T11:56:53.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate, could I get some more info from you? I hadn't heard of the issue for a while but it seems to be making a resurgence, so any specifics you can give would be appreciated.\n\n2.  Windows or Mac?\n3.  What queue?\n4.  Had you already played a game or was this your first since opening client?\n5.  Define regular. (Once a day, once a week, once a patch etc)\n6. What possible solutions have you tried? (Repair, re-install, etc).","replies":[{"poster":"Grymmix","date":"2019-08-25T03:20:31.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the long reply time, i forget to check these things. It's happened in Draft pick and ranked solo/duo queue. Myself and all of my friends play on windows. Already played multiple games. It's normally once every few days, if i decide to play non stop for an entire day it can happen twice in the same day (seems to be random). I've tried both re install and repair. Haven't tried other regions so idk if it's region based. Any other advise on what i could do would be great. Just a bit of a drag when it happens in ranked queues etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-25T05:30:19.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries :)\n\nSo far I haven't had much luck narrowing down what might cause it (in the hopes of maybe discovering a solution or band-aid). Your best bet at this point is probably to ticket player support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with as much specific info as you can with regards to when it is happening.\n\nEven if they can't offer you a solution straight away (which is possible given this isn't a unique to you issue) it will help them track the issue. The more data the get, the easier it is to track down where the problem is and get it fixed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-08-25T04:13:49.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you using window 7?
