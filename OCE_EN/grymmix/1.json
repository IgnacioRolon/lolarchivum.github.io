Nerfing shit into the ground etc and just release a large scale just big fix patch. This game is legit slowly going back into beta with how buggy it is. I&#039;ve seen pre released games have less ground breaking issues. Thinks like GA not proccing. Thresh hooks going through minions. Hell even launcher related things. Just a generalized fix. IDK I&#039;m one person on the sea of millions but it would stop the steady stream of players leaving for shit like fortnite. I&#039;m curious to see what you guys think.","replies":[]}
