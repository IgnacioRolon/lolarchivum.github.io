I've looked up plenty of guides, however most of which are based in the U.S. Obviously, that means that currency exchange and postage prices have to come into account, making the builds somewhat more demanding in price on my minuscule budget. \r\n\r\nBasically, what I am after is a desktop that call fall under a budget of roughly $400-$500 (Even lower than $400, if able) that is solely built for gaming; to be more specific, League of Legends and some other odd games. I would not be including monitors, a keyboard and mouse in the pricing for this build, but I would be including postage. If someone could plan out a build, suiting my requirements, and link me all the sources for each part, that would be wonderful. If you could also make sure that all the vendors are Australian-based and reliable, that would also be helpful.\r\n\r\nThankyou in advance for helping, and if all goes well and the build runs optimally, I might even pay out some Riot points. ;)\r\n\r\n-Brenton","replies":[{"poster":"Brenton","date":"2015-02-21T16:02:13.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: Guys, would [*THIS*](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm//360628152400?pi=466130)  be a good PC for its price?

I could just link you to the setup I used.\n\nI got [this computer](http://www.centrecom.com.au/centre-com-system-home-basic-i3-intel-core-i3-435036ghz-4gb-ram-1tb-hdd-dvdrw-windows-81-no-windows-disc) and slapped [this graphics card](http://www.centrecom.com.au/msi-geforce-gtx-750ti-2gb-gddr5-gaming-graphics-card) into it. I've yet to find a game that I can't run on max. settings on 1080p that has to drop frames to keep up.\n\nOf course, it's around $650, which is a tad more than $400-$500. You can use [this $300 setup](http://www.centrecom.com.au/centre-com-system-home-budget-intel-celeron-g1840-28ghz2mb-cache-4gb-ram-1tb-hdd-dvdrw-windows-81-no-disc) with [this graphics card](http://www.centrecom.com.au/gigabyte-gt-740-graphics-card-4gb-gddr5-pcie-30) installed, although it won't have as much power it'll surely give you some value.\n\nI suggested Centrecom because they have store fronts in Australia where you can physically go to get the computer constructed. They can even build it for you while you wait (around an hour).\n\nThe computer which you found on eBay is pretty much the same as this, maybe even a bit better. The only downside is that it's eBay. You can't really barge into their offices demanding $500 back for the computer you got which was just a case with the parts drawn in grey-led inside.\n\nUltimately it's your decision. Hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Brenton","date":"2015-02-24T15:37:53.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou, heaps! I'm thinking that I'll go with the cheaper PC and buy the better of the two graphics cards that you linked. Much appreciated.\n\n\nAlso, after looking further at the site, is this supposed to be direct from factory to vendor?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-25T00:47:30.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, when I went in, they had the parts in their store. They buy the parts from manufacturers of the parts. I'm not too sure what you mean by \"direct from factory to vendor\"; I was never really savvy in the business side of things.\n\nOh yeah, make sure you keep the box they give you. *It's really handy.*","replies":[]}]}]}]}
