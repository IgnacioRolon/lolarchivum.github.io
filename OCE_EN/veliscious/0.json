But luckily, before i deleted it, I backed my mac with Time Machine on a Hard Drive (THANK GOODNESS, took a while to remember). Once again thanks though, I'll keep this in mind for future reference :). Also, with the 99% stuck thingy ma-jig. It got stuck again, to just try something different I changed region to North America and it finished! Then I changed back to Oce and all is good. :D\n\nP.S. I also have it on bootcamp, but because I partitioned my windows 8 way too small (so many regrets here), the Mac seems to run out of memory (and causing overheat), but turning down the brightness and capping the FPS really helps. I thought I still might as well install it again on Mac os. So hence this problem. And Windows really is better, gave me quite a lot of extra fps.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-20T05:50:10.123+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not 100% sure but it wasn't because Mac couldn't run .exe files that you couldn't transfer League from Windows onto Mac. As far as the patch notes and server selection is concerned, the only difference is the initial launcher. The game itself is the exact same, lest Mac players wouldn't be able to play with Windows players.\n\nThe game's data, the one that the patcher downloads, is all in a folder called RADS. The default path for this on a Windows OS is \"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\" without quotations. In projects, you have the copy of the game for each region you've downloaded it from. If you just copy those relevant files, you'll be able to have League on your Mac without having to re-download it. In fact, I don't even think you need to copy it to that same folder, as the patcher scans your entire computer to find the game files.\n\nI think, to access the game's files on a Mac, you command click it and select the equivalent of file explorer.\n\nAt the least you'd want to transfer your configuration files and item sets over.\n\ntl dr; If you don't mind doing some technical stuff, it should be possible to not have to re-download it all again.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2015-03-16T11:51:31.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, they definitely do not like running .exe.
