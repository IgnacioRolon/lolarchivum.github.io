They got baron and we were down to just our nexus, with my Bard and Brand literally fighting off a Cait and horde of siege minions. I even had to ult it was so bad. We ended up getting a couple of aces or near-aces and won the game. Look at the match report - our team was still behind in gold when we won, that's how bad it was. Never give up, never surrender.\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/131764702/201230640?tab=overview","replies":[{"poster":"Illidalian","date":"2016-05-03T05:52:38.874+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's such an amazing feat of strength.

I have been a part of a 4v5 under-dog **_WIN_** as well.\n\n [[ Proof is in the pudding -> http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/124868181/200146072?tab=overview ]]\n\nIt's hard to pick..
