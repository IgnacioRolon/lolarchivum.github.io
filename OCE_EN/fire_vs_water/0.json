I have had many accounts banned due to toxicity and i feel like now i have to make a change in the way people get banned. Yes a lot of you agree that people who are toxic deserve their accounts removed and stuff but i feel like its wrong talking from a person who cant control what i say when i try to defend my self. I have a couple ideas that i think will make league amazing, if they just kept going with the chat bans that get longer and longer till you pretty much cant type, better system for blocking out words (minecraft even do better if you have recently played it you would see its hard to swear on it) or have a disclaimer that you use the chat at your own risk LIKE MANY OTHER GAMES, use your own social media to talk to players or just add the voice chat\r\n\r\nAnd by i mean &quot;cant control what i say when i try to defend myself&quot; i mean that if someone wants to rip into me for no reason what happened in my last game my brain needs to defend for it self to not blow up, stress builds up way too much if i mute someone, thinking what they would be saying. it is actually extremely painful from my point of view. i dont know how this board works but people who agree with me somehow share it? i want to keep playing this game as it is my favourite, but i need a new system.\r\n\r\nThanks guys i hope you all agree\r\n\r\noh and one thing think of all the money people have spent on league like my self ( alot of dollars ) ;(","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-10T05:13:55.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as you'd like it to change, the way it is working now is in riots favor, they don't care how much money you've spent on the account and if you've been banned they'll know you've invested too much to not keep playing.\n\nI agree it needs to be changed but that's just wishful thinking.","replies":[{"poster":"Fire Vs Water","date":"2018-03-10T05:47:58.313+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"well said but i good thing riot should consider","replies":[]}]}]}
