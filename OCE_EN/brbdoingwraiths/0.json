It is really strong. Giving you vision anywhere on the map every 60 seconds. You can keep tabs on the enemy jungler for the whole game. You can check if it is safe to go somewhere to ward. Invading at the beginning of the game is really easy. I have to say, it has contributed very well in inning me quite a few games.\r\nSo I was wondering, why is it never taken?","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-25T08:56:20.165+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Summoner,\n\nWhilst I agree that Clairvoyance can be a very, very useful Summoner Spell (SS) most of the time other SS such as Ignite and Exhaust are more preferred due to their usefulness throughout the entirety of the game. The way I see it is the use of Clairvoyance really dies out late game. Apart from being able to spot Dragon and Baron fights it really does scale off in usefulness. This is why the importance of wards and warding is so high. \n\nIn theory. Warding has greater potential then having a summoner with Clairvoyance. Clairvoyance can only provide a small amount of vision/time whilst wards can provide the same amount of vision over a greater amount of time. On top of that. Each player can have a maximum of 3 sight wards at a time which last 180 seconds. Therefore each player has 3 Clairvoyance's which accounts for a maximum total of 15 wards at a time. In addition. Each player is allowed to have one active vision ward at a time. Which provide constant vision until the enemy has cleared the 5 bars of health. Therefore your team can amass 5 Clairvoyance's for theoretically ever.\n\nWhilst you say it's safer to use Clairvoyance before warding. Wards themselves should provide the same safety net. \nDuring the early game, where roaming is minimal besides Junglers and the occasional innovative player you will be able to get wards placed in the common pathways, even the enemy jungle. It is most beneficial if you re-ward the bush warded if you do not wish to relocate a ward before the ward expires. This way you still have the safety net Clairvoyance would provide.\n\nI hope this helps.\nRegards,\nlols =)","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2014-11-26T00:20:15.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why do u make a tldr post over a simple thread / question. .. >.<","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2014-11-26T05:35:50.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Exhaust is 100x better. All Clairvoyance does is give you a small area of vision for a few seconds when you can ward an area for a larger range of vision for longer.\n\n\"But it's global!\" Doesn't matter. A roamer/Jungler can't be everywhere at once so warding and watching the map will always be better than Clairvoyance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-11-25T12:00:28.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i use it on champs with mobility and blinks\nYou dont really need ghost or flash with yi if you know how to use him well, and it allows for some great counterganks","replies":[]}]}
