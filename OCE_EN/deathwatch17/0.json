The ban was due to verbal abuse and i know this player to be relatively toxic, is there any way i can talk to someone at riot regarding my ban, as i was not the one that was playing when this permanent ban has been handed out to the account. ?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2017-07-24T02:14:16.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You took the risk of handing out your account to a questionable person, well, behold the end result. Whether or not it wasnt you, or a lie, dont matter.
