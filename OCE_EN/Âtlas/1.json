And that would be too expensive in case you didn't notice. Furthermore AFKing can be the cause of multiple things not just toxicity therefore it cannot be judged so harshly.\n\n2. Your idea of deleting accounts and placing people into groups is terrible. Honestly it sounds like Hitler's regime on a cyber scale. Deleting accounts is unfair to those who plan to come back (after completing Uni or sorting out their real life). \n\n3. \"_putting the trolls and \"special\" people in another group_\" You think it's that easy to distinguish who's a troll??? If it was we would just ban them. The truth is players just having bad days can look like toxic behaviour a lot of the time. Also what do you mean by \"_special people_\" ? Are you seriously suggesting we place disabled or bad players with trolls? That's so wrong on many levels...\n\n4. \"make it everyone has a 50/50 chance and if they are actually good\" This is already the case. Assuming you are not a troll or AFK, there is a 44% chance that a troll is on your team, and a 56% chance that the enemy has one. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MTO2a7ZFcc) video if you're still confused.\n\nYou have to just take the trolls with a grain of salt and move on from those games. Playing this game to win is a bad attitude, playing this game to improve will get you places.","replies":[{"poster":"Âtlas","date":"2015-09-14T12:18:03.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Too expensive??? how much does Riot make a year on micro transactions, yes i know some goes into people making new champs and what not but when u think about it..... not much in comparison. Like it would be an idea of having a referee for each game, which could see the chat and what not and taking the report system away and let that referee judge like they do with sporting games, \n\n2. Yeh sounds like a bad idea and probably is, but people like me which have 5 lv 30 accounts.... i only mainly use 1 account.\n\n3. \"special people\" i meant trolls taking smite and clairvoyance on Miss Fortune mid, building hybrid tank, losing lane, feeding, and blaming others because they are dying every time they get to lane, or Ekko support taking ignite and barrier, and building Bork, ghost blade and 3 dorans rings and failing then abusing the other team, what i meant was yeh trolls in general not disabled people because how on earth can u tell if they are in fact disabled or have downs or what ever in game, unless they tell you but unlikely, \n\nBut really they need to have a tribunal which works, like if u get reported let it notify you what for, for example i get reported for AFK, give me a 5 min time penalty for the next game you play, or if you get reported for anything else except unskilled, give a ranked ban for a few games, yeh i know people will abuse that, and people will gang up on other parties and what not, but then give the people who get reported something to work towards, like for instance 5 reports, take them out of ranked for how ever long depending on the severity of the reports, give them a bunch of normal games or bot games to get the rage or what ever out of there system, ( i do it in custom games with a tonne of bots i abuse them if i die in all chat, just to get it out of my system) but yeh either a referee or a better more efficient tribunal would be the go i recon, and they should make more ranks, for example, people talk about wood/paper 5 and what not so maybe make it carbon, pewter, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, platinum and whatever else.","replies":[{"poster":"Âtlas","date":"2015-09-14T15:32:40.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and another thing with the LP in ranked, if you lose and its not directly your fault, instead of losing 20 odd LP can it be say 5 LP, lets say your 20/1/10 and you lose because of certain people in your team feeding and what not and u lose 25 LP its kinda annoying when you win only 20 max, yes i know my MMR is rooted but still im trying to turn over a new leaf and getting no help what so ever because people dont communicate and when they do its at the end of the game on the results screen, then its usually abuse and rage because they are sore losers, like my last game had a blitz support, who decided to no talk the whole game, take cs, take kills, not ward after buying a sight stone etc, so more adc then i was and since it was a loss and i didnt do that bad i still lost 19 LP when others fed more had less cs etc","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-15T08:44:29.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it would be too expensive. LOL in early 2014 had 27,000,000 daily players, this has most definitely increased since then, but since we have no more official figures to use, lets go off that.\n\nLets say that 5% of those players are being reported, that means every 2nd game will have one report. If OCE is really as toxic as you say, this shouldn't be an unrealistic figure.\n\n0.05 x 27,000,000 = 1,350,000 reported players\n\nNow that figure is only the number of reported players. So lets say they play again, and 50% of those players get reported again (these are the more toxic players)\n\n1.350.000 x 1.5 = 675000 more reports\n\nThat's 2,025,000 reports total. Assuming they only play 2 games per day.\n\nSay each report took 2.5 minutes on average to look-over/moderate (reading the chat, checking builds...). That would mean that in a 8 hour shift they could check 192 reports per person.\n\n2,025,000 / 192 = 10547 (rounded to nearest whole number)\n\n10,547 staff looking over reports everyday. The cost would be enormous, not to mention they would need to hire more staff during summer holidays in order to not fall behind on reports. You now understand how this is not possible?\n\nThey are working on a automated solution for bans, and I've already heard of many people in OCE being banned now. Sit tight I hear there's also updates to the report system next patch.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-15T08:47:28.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S Your referee system would be even more expensive.
