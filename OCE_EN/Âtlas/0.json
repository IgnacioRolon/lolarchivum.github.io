Why im saying this is because, too many &quot;new&quot; people are getting to level 30 in 2 weeks, buying the 16 champions, then trying ranked out before actually knowing what its about and how to play more then a few champions, and another thing actually deal with the reports, yes i know there will be countless reports from countless of people and yes it would be a huge task but still make it 3 reports and your banned for a day sort of thing, yes i know ill get banned alot but thats when u make it 3 bans and your on perma ban. just saying

up to b4 instantly trolled back to b5, got to b3 once back to b5 a few days later, i was in NA 4 years ago got to gold 4 from provisional's, then OCE opened up came here, instantly b5, anyways no one cares about people who have played this type of game for ages anyways i found out, yeah i do play a fair bit with 5 accounts at level 30, tbh IF the team doesn't rage or feed and actually works together its magical but no one knows how Teamwork OP works any more, even when u mute people it doesn't stop them from typing away anyways abusing others, more typing then playing, anyways about the tribunal it honestly needs to be more stricter, because 127 reports in a week doesn't get you a ban, it doesn't do anything, just gives u a pop up saying pretty much \"aww your been having a few bad games lately, try not to feel bad, cheer up, better luck next time\" as if thats going to stop people from ruining games, they need to do it like, 1 report 1 warning, 3 reports a 1 day ban etc but meh anyways any tips on an OP broken champ who doesn't need much to carry games because this is completely ridiculous, oh yeh i main support because no one actually supports like i use to thats all and it shits me when u have a Lux or who ever building full AP taking CS, not warding, not caring about the adc, THEN bot lane loses lane etc and snowballs from there, (usually happens when im top or mid) like yeh if im supporting an ADC who actually knows how to play its GG easy, but when you get for instance, Vayne 2 games in a row then a crappy jinx who cant land anything cant cs and all that its annoying, then when i adc the support doesnt ward and takes cs anyways then top feeds, i was in 2 ranked games today went support morg, got told by adc to go full AP i didnt because im not selfish like that we lost due to jungle not being able to jungle, next game went braum had Sona full ap mid and Miss Fortune full troll not caring about the game mid as well with smite, the opposite team felt sorry for me in particular because i held lane so well against Jinx and Maokai, but yeh ranted too much starting to get carried away with random shit now, but serious fix tribunal Riot and tbh ban me when u get the chance IF i start raging, abusing, intent feeding, etc because i know i dont abuse people. :) sorry bout that

people because i hate negativity its such a downer, i remember being a super fed veigar once mid lane, everyone else was feeding hard, when i had 35 kills and 1200 ap our adc Jinx said Veigar can you carry, i said can u guys stop feeding i cant do it alone, surprizingly they stopped feeding and listened to me because i had so many kills and what not, the problem with people and myself in bronze is no one wants to listen to the person with most kills or that is trying to save the team from losing, i know how to play, but i cant carry a full team of raging abusing people who like to feed, ive gone 28/4/18 as velkoz mid and people trolled me thats what annoys me more then anything, tbh i know how to play, its just getting people on my level, getting people to shut up, stopping them from abusing people for no reason, stopping people from feeding, like someone else said \"they would feed if i complained this much in a game\", that only makes things worse, i can usually tell in champ select or the first 5 mins of the game if we are going to lose or win, just by what people do and if they are talking to there friends on the other team, but anyways if people work together and what

Especially form people in Silver/Bronze and newer people who think they know better (since unranked accounts are roughly Silver 3 or so MMR level).\n\nI agree there should be more prerequisite in a team game such as this to try and make sure everyone is \"ranked ready\" since clueless people do have a negative impact on others experience.\nThat being said, \"normal wins\" and making it harder to reach ranked level isn't really that good of an idea. I've played and won plenty of normals against trolls and being a troll myself. By troll I mean, playing stupid crap like Yasuo/Maokai bottom.\n\nWith 120+ champions, I think owning the minimum of 16 is a tad low. However with 120+ champions I think only having 6 bans is a little low too. Plenty of things to poke holes at where the game could improve slightly, but you have to think about the bigger picture and how it impacts on people.\nIf you increase the number of champions required, does that mean that even more people will forgo runes in order to buy champions like most new people do?\n\n------------------------------\n\nJust looked you up.

Sometimes you get higher ranked teammates, which is good because the level of dumbness is reduced. The other good thing about it is when you face up with higher ranked players, the opposition side have a \"bronzie\" to compensate for you, your team absolutely stomps them.
