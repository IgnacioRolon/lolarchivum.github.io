It would have 3-4 charges like Rivens Q, make it a skill shot/ aiming shot with minimal movement.\r\n\r\nKeep his ultimate the same, just rework it so it feel like a massive jump across the map like Galio minus the knock up of course. \r\n\r\nHope to hear back from the riot team.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-05T02:49:58.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pantheon seems more like an Athenian than a Spartan to me, or do you not know there is a difference between classical Greek nation states?","replies":[]}]}
