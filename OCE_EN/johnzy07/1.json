That was bad and did indeed hurt the game *although everyone talks about preferring it*.\r\n\r\nNow even if you earn kills, even if you get 20-0, you will still lose provided someone else is doing stupid stuff. This is also bad and hurts the game as you&#039;re basically condemning solo/duo players to a game of league of roulette. Will your team feed this time? Will they help you fight someone when it is an easy kill? Will they ward? This hurts both solo/duo players as well as people that earn kills in game and still lose because the enemy has 4 kills each.\r\n\r\nI am not a god at league or anything, but I can&#039;t count how many times I have pinged for help in an easy fight and people either ignore by choice or just by lack of awareness in general. Sometimes I lose and I die, a lot, which is just unfair to my team, sometimes I get super uber fed and say ok lets grab those 2 inhibs and reset for an easy baron then 2 people continuously dive the only tower left on the enemy team until they catch up and kill us as I am the only one doing damage.\r\n\r\nI use to have a solid strategy with jungle a few years ago, id camp someone and gank everyone else a little bit but focus on that one because after I get them 2 or 3 kills, they roam as well which basically granted my team control of the game, id intentionally feed them at the detriment of my own score. That would work, these days it doesn&#039;t. I get them fed and give them kills, I also get pretty fed from assists and counterjungle killing the enemy jung but we will still lose because even if the mid laner is 12-4 and I am 5-2, we cant duo a team that has a consistent 1-4 kd even if we outplay in every way, more teamwork, more plays and more skill doesn&#039;t make a difference, they just have to slap together a sloppy wombo and because 5 man teams are so focused this season, they will crush us even if they just faceroll the keyboard.\r\n\r\nI think it would really help League have some returning players and a few new ones too, as well as make the current ones happier if we were to make it slightly easier to solo/duo as yes it is a team game but with the random nature of people in general, it tends to not work. This would help solo/duo players as well as 5 man teams if one of their players is better than the others they will be more inclined to protect him. The general idea is, he *can* carry unless the enemy team actually does have decent teamwork. Decent teamwork isn&#039;t grouping mid. Decent teamwork would be teemo blinding the fed yi the sup protecting the adc and the mid laner and jungle assassinating him whilst he cant fight back and is possibly stunned. At the moment it is just group mid and faceroll, no strategy or planning needed so long as the enemy team has atleast 1 player that isn&#039;t working as a team (which 9 times out of 10 they don&#039;t).  \r\n\r\nIt is extremely important to avoid making the game TOO team orientated whilst still keeping a strong sense of teamwork, players that are not 5 man are losing regardless of skill now. It is starting to get to the point where you are punished for going well. When things were broken, at the very least you knew you had to dodge stuff and missing a skillshot was EXTREMELY punishable. Now you can take a few destructive rays of light from lux to the face and walk away which leads to less incentive to get good at dodging skill shots. All in all the balance has passed and it is now just plain weakness, when I can afford to let people land skillshots just to make them get cocky you know they arent hurting as much as they should.\r\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, my point is that if we find some middle ground here, it will encourage skill without letting skill completely dominate the game (even though if they are better they do deserve the win, not to mention matchmaking could fix a fair bit of that etc) it will help solo and duo players earn a win instead of playing Russian roulette with a feeding bot lane and it will bring back some flavour to league, I&#039;m no god at league, but theres no incentive to get good when I go againt someone high tier and he gets crushed because of his team.","replies":[]}
