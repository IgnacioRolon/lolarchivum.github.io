When his passive is activated he would become blobs of all the different flavors of napoleon ice cream and then his  head (chocolate coating with a cherry on it). He could have a unique quote if Leona uses her ult on him \"try it, i don't melt\" and similar ones for brand. \r\ni just thought this would be a cool skin, feedback is appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"Asia","date":"2014-12-22T07:29:00.397+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the idea, he needs a new skin","replies":[]},{"poster":"SuperAthleteRox","date":"2015-01-14T00:21:34.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This may or may not turn me off ice cream forever.\nThanks man.\n\nNah, who could get turned off of ice-cream :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Blood Harvest","date":"2014-12-25T13:29:41.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Candy land zac+candy lane annie","replies":[]},{"poster":"FuyuMoro","date":"2014-12-24T14:04:28.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always though that he should look less creepy and more cute xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2014-12-22T10:09:05.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who's the guy in american ads which goes \"OH YEAH\".\n\nOh wait, Kool Aid right?\n\nSo Kool Aid Zac.\n\nI wanna see that.{{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"ElectricWhipper","date":"2014-12-23T18:59:45.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy %%%% yes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-12-23T14:07:50.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure this has been said 100 times already on the forums section but the board ruined it :l","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2014-12-22T15:56:06.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree on the basis that Zac needs a new skin, and I haven't seen or heard of a better concept than this one\nIce cream {{champion:154}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"LauchieAvilanche","date":"2014-12-23T12:50:39.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think that idea should stay in the freezer...","replies":[]}]}
