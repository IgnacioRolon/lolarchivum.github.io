Just because in some recent games, I've come across people who tilt me - a player who's just trying to climb - and I want to be assured that they are removed from my games so I can climb without any disruption.\r\n\r\nAlso. If a player is inting and someone like myself is tilted, and we show it, we can be put under a suspension because the system believes that I am bad-mouthing a player when in reality, they are making life difficult for me. So, can we gain our honour points back if the person who has reported us ends up being accused correctly on intentionally feeding?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-10-07T06:34:30.705+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it might be best to take a little step back here, to see the picture in a different light.\n\nYou want people who tilt you to be quickly removed from the game. Correct?\nAnd you want this to happen, because you say you are unable to control your own responses to this behaviour.  Because they are the bad guy, and you are not. Correct?\n\nHave you ever considered that something tilted them first?  That they don't just jump into games to int just out of the cruelty of their hearts.\nWhat they do to you, _(annoy you to the point of bad behaviour)_, is probably exactly what has happened to them in the previous game.  They too are probably usually a good player like yourself who was just pushed over the edge.\n\nSo if you want them to be punished immediately without any grace period, you should really expect to be subject to the same penalty for your less-than-upstanding responses, as your behaviour might well trigger the next person in the cycle.\n\nBut you're not a bad guy, and probably neither are they usually.  So should the system not give both of you the benefit of the doubt here?  Isn't it better to judge and punish people on a track record, rather than a couple of anomalous reports made in the heat of the moment? Otherwise most of the community would end up with punishments at some point.\n\n_____________\n\nAnd no, you will not earn your honour points back if someone else gets punished.\nWe shouldn't be excused for bad behaviour just becasue someone else had worse.  The excuse \"But muuuum.. he made me do iiiiit.\" doesn't work when you're 5, and it doesnt work here either.  We all need to be responsible for our own actions, as those actions affect everyone else in the game as well.\n\nIf you know you're prone to retaliation, I would recommend trying techniques to prevent it.\nRiot's 'Tilt Types' are of course mostly novelty and just a bit of fun, but I found it can help you become aware of exactly what sets you off, and give some pointers of how to combat that.\n\nhttps://tilttypes.riotgames.com/en-us/p/1","replies":[]}]}
