Once you run out of the 50k something (which can basically get you like 8 of the newest champs), you&#039;re stuck with the champs you have. \r\n\r\nI got 7 champion shards leveling up to 33, I paid 1850 BE every time I made one of them permanent, and now I&#039;m stuck with the 90 BE ones (Sivir, Kayle) and 270 ones (Trynda, Mundo). Basically I have 720 worth of BE from these 4 shards, and since I already had the 450 and 1350 IP champs from before, I have to pay 3150+ for champs now, that&#039;s like 4 times the BE I get from the 4 shards, which was not the case in the previous system because you can always reroll.\r\n\r\nPlus, considering how slow leveling up is, the rewards seem so little. This just means that Riot is basically saying buy champs with RP if you want them.  I&#039;m pretty sure a lot of newer players would rather just quit the game.\r\n\r\nI know Riot is looking for more gain since it&#039;s a company but this sounds like a failed strategy, this is just gonna make  people quit the game as a lot of people are doing currently. \r\n\r\nBring back the re-roll system or reinstate the BE rewards after each game.
