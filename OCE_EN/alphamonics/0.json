As I go further back into my match history, the number of games I have played on the red side vs the number of games I have played on the blue side is relatively even, even enough that I can&#039;t complain. However, recently, there has been some sort of joke going on in my seemingly &quot;random&quot; blue or red spawnside.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the past 19 out of my 20 games on Summoner&#039;s Rift has been on the red side. 19, out of 20. That&#039;s 95% (for those who like percentages), or simply put &quot;a very large ways off from around 50/50&quot;. And before people start presuming circumstances of this statistics;\r\n\r\n1.  All games were played on the Summoner&#039;s Rift\r\n2. Both Normal games _and_ Ranked games were taken into account\r\n3. Before I started keeping track, I still had a somewhat skewered red side spawn rate (around 60-70%)\r\n* so no, I did not have something like a 10 match blue side to &quot;compensate&quot; for this\r\n4. The past 20 Summoner&#039;s Rift games included games where I was solo-queue&#039;ing, duo&#039;ing, trio&#039;ing, as well as in a party of 5\r\n\r\nA search on the archived forum posts and boards has led me to believe that there is somewhat an attempt to make the spawn rate of any player as close to 50% as possible for blue side or red side, as well as the fact that sometimes people believe that if you have a higher &quot;mmr&quot; than your opposition, you will be spawned on the red side a little more likely than the blue side. Well, here are some numbers I&#039;m going to throw at you;\r\n\r\n1. As stated before, I have a 95% spawn rate on the red side vs the blue side in my last 20 Summoner&#039;s Rift games, and it wasn&#039;t good before that either\r\n2. Purely statistically, without any influence, the possibility of any permutation of spawn-side in 20 games is 1 in over a million (half to the power of 20)\r\n3. I have 10 wins and 9 losses out of these 19 red side games (oh look, around 50%), so being matched against people my skill level doesn&#039;t seem to be an issue (the single blue side game was a loss, for anyone curious)\r\n4. All 20 games were played from the 7th of February to the 11th of February (2016), so an average of 4 games per night, totaling to 20\r\n5. I have played in each role at least once (if that makes any differences)\r\n6. Average red side win time is around 24 minutes, loss time around 33 minutes (again, if it makes any differences)\r\n\r\nSo, to conclude, I used to believe that the spawn side for players was effectively 50/50, with slight variations on either side based on how good your team is perceived to be, as well as how many games you&#039;ve played on a particular side so far (at least recently). After the past few days, I believe this less and less, and probably will just throw this theory I have out the window in the next few days should this keep happening, which, at this rate, might just do so for the kicks and giggles.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I have played the last 19 out of 20 games on Summoner&#039;s Rift on the red side (19 red sides, 1 blue side). I will qq and vent into this board so I don&#039;t release my anger in game and get banned.

No one except a select few a Riot actually know how this works. The algorithms used for these kinds of things are trade secrets, like the Coca Cola recipe.\n\nLets look at this objectively first. \n\n+ It's clear at this point that the chances of you getting Blue or Red side are not **50%**. What you claim just happened has a **0.00191% **chance of happening. You're more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime. \n\n+ Secondly, it would be stupid to assume that **Riot** has changed the chances of getting blue side for certain players with no reason. \n\n They don't profit in any way from this and it would directly impact the player experience.\n\nWith that out of the way, we can now look into what's likely causing you to be red side.\n\n+ Out of the 20 ranked and normal games 16 of these were duo or trio.\n\n+ Your MMR is also very high for silver. Your last 2 games were played at  Low Platinum/ High Gold MMR. Despite this, some games you are playing in 1300 MMR.\n\n_Why would any of this affect red side placement?_\n\nBecause you have an advantage. A very large amount of the community believes that players with higher MMR are matched on red side. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/290cyl/i_have_played_50_ranked_games_in_a_row_on_purple/cigdqfu), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/26v79y/blue_side_red_side_controversy/chut8pi) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/26v79y/blue_side_red_side_controversy/chuui66) are some examples.\n\nThe beleif is that the lower red side win-rate is compensated by placing the higher MMR players there.\n\n**_So here's what happened:_**\n\n+ **You**, **jaws** and **doug** (an abbreviation of their real names for privacy reasons) are playing in 1700+ elo for normals. This is quite high already making it likely that you'll be placed on red side. The system can't split you up to even out MMR, so everyone is going to red side almost all the time.\n\n+ Secondly, you're duo with **Augo** who is level 14. His MMR is likely very low, this means that your average MMR takes a big hit when he is duo with you. \n\n This makes you even **more likely** to be matched on red side, since your MMR is significantly higher than everyone else because of **Augo**. **Augo** was in your party with you for 9 games out of these 20.\n\n+ Thirdly, Riot has been known to treat players in parties differently because of their voice communication advantage. It's likely these players are also placed on red side, for the same reasons as stated before for MMR.\n\nSo there you go. I think it's safe to say we found the root cause of the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-02-13T12:35:20.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> + Your MMR is also very high for silver.

Would that give me and my party a higher chance to be on the 'red' side?\nI just wanna clarify this, cause I think I'm not 100% sure what you mean.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-14T04:53:20.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well there's no official evidence of this, but yes.
