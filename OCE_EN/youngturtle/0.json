I did an internet speed test, ping is at like 8 and download like 50mbs, other services are working without trouble. In game Im not actually seeing the high ping spikes, the game just freezes every minute or so and the freezes for approx 3 seconds then back to normal. Anyone that could help or experiencing same issue, thanks for the help.","replies":[{"poster":"birdistheword","date":"2019-01-03T06:39:03.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am exactly the same, please let me know if you manage to solve this.","replies":[]}]}
