Now i don&#039;t think that is normal? I was on 16 lp then won a game while then network went down, as in after my game ranked went offline (march 1st). Afterwards i was on 9 Lp, so i lost 7 and didn&#039;t get my win which is 16 lp. I played one more game to see if it updated after i logged out then in again, however after a win I was only on 26, (9+ 17). I still dont have my lp from the previous win and lost 7 lp, i should have an extra 23lp!!
