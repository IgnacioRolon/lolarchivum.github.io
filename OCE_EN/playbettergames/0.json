He can potentially sit in lane in near absolute safety and get you to a threshold where he can ult and guarantee a kill. I think Assassin's should be punished when they slip up and forced to play in situations where they will slip up. Poking till threshold health to click r? Not a fan of. In that video well yeah, that happens with assassins who nearly instantly place majority of their burst out. \nEDIT: If he waited in lane, he could of put that w e q burst out consistently without putting himself in danger.

When Tanks and fighters get behind, they can still act as shields, they just don't last as long. and when supports are behind, they can still heal, they just cant heal for as much.\n\nWhen an assassin is behind however, he doesnt have enough damage to completely **kill** the enemy squishies. Which means he can't fulfil his ONLY purpose in the game. Which makes assassins just pure useless if they are behind.\n\nNow obviously you can't have a whole class that is completely useless 50% of the time, thats just stupid.\n\nSo assassins need their damage buffed so that even when behind, they still have a chance at fulfilling their only role. \nOnly the problem now is that when they get ahead _(which is much easier now they have more damage)_, they have so much damage they they completely 1-hit anyone they want, which means there is little-to-no counterplay to them.\nand thats what we see in your video.\n\nThis is why assassins feel so powerful, and why assassin-hybrid champs like assassin-ADC_ (Vayne)_, assassin-tank _(Lee Sin)_, assassin-fighter _(Yasuo)_, are such massive problems.","replies":[]}]}
