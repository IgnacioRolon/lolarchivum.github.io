Also, Bard will be carring an oversized microphone instead of the thing he usually holds.\r\n  - Bard will have completely different quotes, where he acts prestigious and stuff.\r\n  - He will say some stuff to Draven on certain occasions (e.g. if Bard gets a kill and Draven gets an assist on it, Bard will say something like &quot;not today, Draven&quot; and Dravens passive particles will appear on Bard, not Draven (Draven still gets the extra gold from his passive)).\r\n\r\n&bull; Bards Passive:\r\n\r\n  - Bards chimes are now things like books, DVDs, etc.\r\n  - Bards meeps are tiny little paparazzi that carry around mini cameras and take one picture of Bard as soon as they spawn and occasionally take a picture at random times after.\r\n\r\n&bull; Bards Abilities:\r\n\r\n  - Bards Magical journey opens up a walkway instead of a portal that has a red carpet on the floor.\r\n  - Bards ultimate causes Bard to imediately pose dramatically. If his ultimate (which looks like a spotlight) lands on someone, extra Bard meeps will spawn around them to take pictures of them. If it doesn&#039;t hit Bard, he will say something like &quot;guess the spotlights not on me today&quot; but if it does hit him, extra dtar particles will appear around him and he&#039;ll say something like &quot;oh yeah!&quot;\r\n\r\n&bull; Extra Effects:\r\n  \r\n  - There will be an option to to press a button on Bards HUD (This button will be something like the button used to choose Elementalist Luxes form) which will cause Bards meeps to take a picture in Bards current pose. It&#039;ll open up a close up view from one of the meeps, where you can choose how the picture will be taken. Also, when you take a picture, you can choose if you want to save it to your computer.\r\n\r\nAnyway I hope you like my idea of Celebrity Bard!","replies":[{"poster":"Taze","date":"2017-04-30T00:38:04.159+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love this! \n\nThis is such a creative idea!
