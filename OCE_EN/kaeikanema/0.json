So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch. Graves jng especially has pretty high scores, so it'll be harder to get an S+ than with something like Trundle jng which has pretty average scores in jng.","replies":[]}]}
