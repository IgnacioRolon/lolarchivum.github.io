I am looking for things such as:\nChamp win%\nChamp play%\nChamp average k/d/a\nChamp item% and item win%\nDamage dealt / damage received\n\nIs this at all possible? I'm a fairly new player so am trying different champs / builds and it's often hard to tell what's working for me and what isn't. I know it's possible to find most of this stuff in match history but it would be good if we had a running total.","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-19T22:43:07.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Summoner,\n\nIn-Client you can look at your match history. I can't remember to what extent in terms of stats it shows you because I'm not able to access it ATM but the information there is still pretty informative. Other than that you can always look at http://www.op.gg . This site should be able to tell you everything you want to know. \n\nKind Regards,\nlols","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-19T11:10:04.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can in ranked kind of, by clicking \"leagues\" then your name and it says \"see more stats\" in bottom right.\nDoesn't have item stats, but does have K/D/A and towers taken per game etc...\n\nAlso try oce.op.gg\n\n(your stats) http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=ChainWarrior","replies":[{"poster":"ChainWarrior","date":"2014-11-19T21:32:49.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's helpful, thanks!","replies":[]}]}]}
