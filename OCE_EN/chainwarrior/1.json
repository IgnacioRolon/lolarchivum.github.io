Mostly runs fine at 30 fps but will drop to 15 fps if the computer gets hot which is a bit unplayable. Guess I'll have to buy a decent gaming pc when I get the money.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T06:25:01.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was gonna mention about how heat really affects integrated chips more than others, mostly due to the fact that an integrated chip cannot have its own fans to cool it. Have you considered getting a cooling fan? Last I checked they were around $20.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
