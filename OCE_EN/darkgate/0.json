Ihroghaf  terrified that she might hurt the elders or those around her, agreed and was placed under the tutelage of a old sage. \n\nthe sage taught her to use mystical runes to contain her power.  runes, require the greatest of control it took an age but she finally managed to seal most of her power just in time too, the council came to Ionia with the express purpose,  to take Ihroghaf into  custody. to their surprise when they came. Ihroghaf willingly accepted their binding to the League. only to test the strength of their will.\n\nWalking to the docks she released her self imposed bindings,  her power flourished out of the Guardian Sea rose the mighty vessel. torrents of water ascended into the sky shining in the early morning sun. \n\nshe turned to the Summoners from the League and demanded \"If you should bind me, then you must bind me with all your will.\" the summoners agape, she shouldn't have nearly enough power to even move a leaf upon the cobblestone. she continued \"you are incapable of  Restraining me... So take me to the league, perhaps they can control me\" \n\nThe league reached an agreement.  Ihroghaf would maintain a constant binding to a summoner and in return she would act on the league's behalf to restrain \"troublesome\" Individuals. \n\n_\"Beware Her Runes.
