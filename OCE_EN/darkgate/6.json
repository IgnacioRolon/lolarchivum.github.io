But they didn't and that irked him, he lived to set those moments up all the prep work in his shows, sure they called him a mere trickster but they never saw how long he had to set up all the mirrors smoke, magic... he felt strangely drawn to the black rose and simultaneously Disgusted by their inaction.  The war could be, If not won, at least abated by the Black rose stepping in Pulling the strings that they had wound around their fingers.  \n\nA thought struck him, While the Black Rose wound its way into the government's heart, no one knew of them. so no one cared.\nThe populous was more enthralled by the actions of the Champions of the league, despite most battles being held over trivial matters, everyone he knew was inspired by taric's fall and rise. Appalled by Sion's Reanimation, enamored by Ahri's  charm.  Everyone paid attention to champions.  \nhe Rose Doned his Tall hat, long Sparkling cloak, and his Best pair of Polished Boots. \n\"Time, to, put, on, the best Show valoran has ever seen\"\n With a Flash of magic he clasped a fake talisman with a gaudy Black rose Insignia to his cloak,\n \"it's not like anyone knows about them anyway he breathed\" \nHe marched up to the Institute of war, with a furl of his cape he Lied the second greatest lie he ever told.  \n\"The Black Rose Joins the League!\" \n\n-him? oh yeah i never would'a thought he was part'a some cult but ehh what are ya gonna do, He looks good in the league tho. \nDemacian Citizen  \n\nRecomended build \n{{item:3158}} {{item:3285}} \n{{item:3151}} {{item:3027}} \n{{item:3100}} {{item:3089}} \n\nWorks Well With\n{{champion:59}} \nJarvan the 4th has just the right wombo Combo Cataclysm can hold down the enemy team inside Hall of Mirrors. this all but Guarantees that they feel nothing but broken glass and broken bones. \n\n{{champion:53}} \nThe Iron Golem Offers plenty of CC to keep enemy champions in place letting Cimaans line up a barrage of Empowered Flashes.  if they're still standing after that it nothing short of a miracle. \n\n{{champion:432}} \nCimaans lacks any good Initial burst, or the ability to get into position without sacrificing his escape, The Cosmic caretaker lets Cimaans get into position after a roam or even lock them down with an aoe Zhonias. \n\nStruggles Against.\n{{champion:7}} \nAfter the Slander of the Black Rose there's no way Leblanc would let it slide, Leblanc has enough burst and mobility to chase down the Stage magician and make sure he doesn't get up again. \n\n{{champion:63}} \nBrand works best when the Enemy team is grouped up, but what about a team of 1? All of Cimaan's Clones present the perfect kindling to set the world on fire \n\n{{champion:16}} \nSoraka is good at keeping her teammates alive, so when Cimaans is slowly whittling down the enemy team's health for a kill nothing is more frustrating to see them healed back from the brink of death before you can land the killing blow.
