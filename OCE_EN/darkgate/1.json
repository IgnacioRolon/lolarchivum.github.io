Unbeknownst to Azir beneath the shifting sands something woke, Azir Looked down at the base of a nearby dune. a shift of sand... but things don't go unnoticed by the emperor. Sand solders leaped to the base of the dune and thrust their spears deep. \n\nthey retracted their spears looking up at Azir Confused. \nSensing danger Azir Flew to his Desert guards but too late Bones rose from the dune beneath him knocking him aside, the Spearmen flew at the beast as it rose out of the dunes, It sliced them in twain with an Ivory scythe-like limb. Just as Azir called more Guards their Shields surrounding their emperor. the beast was gone only the sand falling through back down to the dunes as evidence that the beast had be there  at all. \n\nThe institute of War sent a band of summoners guarded by {{champion:75}}  to track the Monster down. the band arrived above a fissure in the earth.  Nasus stood resolute, anything that had dared to attack the Emperor would meet his wrath. they descended into the Cleft in the rock no evidence of the beast other than the remains of some unfortunate traders. \n\nNasus stood looking at the tattered clothing strewn around the base of the Ravine, Naught but Bone and blood was strewn here... it was quiet... Too Quiet.\nNasus Rose A Sandstorm Buffing the Frightened summoners, as Nechrouths, Burst through the stone wall Knocking the Caretaker of the Sands down. The Ivory Fiend turned to the startled summoners next Cleaving half the party as he charged. \n\nNasus's eyes blazed Spirt fire Surrounding him as he leap forward striking the Beast's tail, shattering it. Nechrouths Climbed higher leaving the broken Bones behind, Before falling, coiled sharp limbs pining Nasus to the sandy ground. \n\nNasus slammed Nechrouths with his cane buffeting the beast off him again, then setting the ground ablaze with blue fire.  The centipide recoiled then Skittered forth Howling at the Guardian protecting his Prey,  Nasus's ears ringed then he heard the Humming Resonance behind him the fallen bones all howled Together The sound Flinging sand into the air.\n\nThe battle raged Nasus Beating The Titanic Skeleton back before having to knock the Flailing bones aside. \n\nFinally the summoners managed to Contain The Beast withing a makeshift cage of runes. \n\nNasus stood resolute the battle had been hard fought, without the summoners aid they would never stopped fighting in that fissure of Shurima. \n\n**Counter Picks**\n{{champion:67}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:203}}  \n\nNechrouths Is a Titanic wall of health...

He's a centipede that burrows (Rek'sai), but also uses his voice and bones. Where does it come from? What does it want?\n-You need few tweaks on his abilities if you want to keep them that way (e.g. Mana cost on q)\n-Shurima's lore isn't up to date \n\nOverall I think the champion is not viable and does not add anything really unique to the pool, resembling a lot Rek'sai and Skarner. \n\nHOWEVER, there are some very cool ideas you put down, such as the resonating sound amplified by his passive. You might want to try and develop a \"music\" character with a similar ability but focusing on things that other music based characters don't have in league. For example (and it's just an example), someone that plays a drum (or one of those metallic ones) and can throw it as part of his auto attack and then use it to amplify his abilities/voice to deal damage.\n\nOn the other hand you might want to consider focusing only on the \"bone\" monster, keeping his tankiness but maybe reducing his movement speed or utility or damage. \nYou might want to start with his characteristics before diving into the creation, focusing on what makes him different from existing champions.\n\n\nAaanyhow, good luck and congrats again for creating a champion idea :)","replies":[{"poster":"DarkGate","date":"2016-03-31T09:32:07.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feed back :D\ndefinitely some things to consider there, I have to admit the Long Champion idea came from hearing about How Aurileon sol was held back because of his long body, so i though i would make a passive that embraces the difficulties of a long body.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2016-03-31T04:26:06.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I skimmed it and would like to know how you expect the auto attacking from any point on the body would work?
