However soon after it returns to the high 300 ping. I decided to open my game in practise tool and it still has a high ping nearing the 300 mark. \n\nI also tested my internet speed and it seems to be fine, I used terminal to ping the riot oce servers with a 500 bytes as a normal packet would not be an accurate measurement. \nI type in terminal: &gt; ping -s 500 104.160.156.1\n\nAnd I get my normal 30 ping, making me realise that the problem isn&#039;t my internet but the connection from my computer to my game-client, somewhere along the way my internet is acting up. \n\nbut in-game I seem to be lagging for some reason, I also noticed that my league client seems to be lagging a little bit as well, my lock in takes a few seconds longer than usual, opening store takes a longer time. I&#039;ve already tried using the repair tool on the client and the problem is still there. \n\nI want to be able to play league, but 200-300 ping is really really difficult to play with, my normal reaction time + my ping is causing me to be unable to avoid skillshots, and farm even.\n\nUPDATE: Yesterday I was able to play again, my normal ping came back for the entirety  of the game. This was late into the night tho, so i'm thinking evening times is peaking up","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-31T14:56:42.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you in NSW and with Telstra? There's some known issues there but I gather they're more causing disconnects than just high ping.","replies":[]}]}
