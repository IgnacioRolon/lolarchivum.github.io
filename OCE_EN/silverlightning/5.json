Which I think for new players would be difficult, first because we don&#039;t know how many bars is hard, because plainly we can&#039;t see the max number of bars.\r\n\r\nSo it&#039;d be much better if we can see dark lines to show where the remaining bars would be, or a mouseover on difficult will tell you how difficult the champion is.","replies":[]}
