It&#039;d be much more unique for each player if instead of just most played champ, it&#039;d be most played champ + most-played champ skin. Like for example you could main Ahri and your favourite and most used skin is Pop Star Ahri or Challenger Ahri. It&#039;d be cool if your profile showed your most favourite champion with your most favourite skin. Right now the only skins that actually are for the background are the Ultimate skins. Since there are only 3 ultimates for only 3 champions, the feature would only be available for summoners who main those champions and have those skins.","replies":[{"poster":"SHANTO","date":"2016-08-01T05:35:13.221+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be a cool idea. However, the ultimate skins are so expensive so them adding this to ALL skins would just not be fair on the players with ultimate skins. Maybe if it was for legendary skins I could see that but so many skins I doubt this would happen","replies":[{"poster":"SilverLightning","date":"2016-10-15T23:33:17.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but the ultimate skins have animated backgrounds for profile, which makes it more unique compared to the normal skins which I would like to be shown in the profile section.","replies":[]}]}]}
