According to what I looked up, your HP Dv7 Pavillion has Intel integrated graphics. (Intel graphics=bad, integrated=bad.)\n\nThis site lists heaps of GPUs with FPS benches for different resolutions, etc: [link](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-Games-on-Laptop-Graphics-Cards.13849.0.html)\n\nHave a look around and find something you like and then check its GPU against that site. (Ctrl + F search, or manually navigate the graph.)\n\nThe MacBook and MacBook Pro 13\" both use Intel integrated graphics. The 15\" has dedicated graphics but will run you upwards of $2k... it should run league fine, but unless you want a Mac for other reasons it's not worth it. A gaming laptop would be far cheaper and get the job done.\n\nAlso... I prefer League on Windows as opposed to OS X.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-12T04:52:44.490+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Apple products are known to be overpriced for their value.

Think it's just over 1000, but it's one of the better ones for gaming.\nThere's an example, but they seem to have plenty of customization options if you want to sacrifice HDD for a better processor.\nhttp://shopap.lenovo.com/nz/en/laptops/thinkpad/edge-series/e550/?sb=:000000AD:00000912:#tab-customize\n\nThis is purely from what I've heard though, I don't have experience with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DoubleClick","date":"2015-05-12T05:40:33.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yer im not really looking for a mac, i just use my old mac atm for uni notes etc - i prefer pc as well, just want a reliable laptop that runs leauge at max settings easily, thats not slow.
