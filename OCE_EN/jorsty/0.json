In your opinions what are some underrated top laner champions that low elo players have no clue how to deal with, or just have a really hard time to lane against? and how do you deal with those champions?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-09T04:13:14.781+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My least favourite toplane to face is tryndamere.\n\nPlaying laning phase is constant pressure to try to make sure he can't free farm, he doesn't get a tp down to botlane post 6, keeping track of how much burst damage he has to make sure I'm not out of position the tiniest bit, and that he's not going to zone me out post6. And if I do die to him, next time I come back to lane he's going to towerdive me and turn me to mincemeat and then take my tower, and if I get help from the jungle he just 2v1's us whilst we're waiting for his ult to expire, and from there he just snowballs out of control. And if by some miracle or early gank, I do win lane, eventually we start teamfighting for objectives, but he'll just mindlessly splitpush and possibly go 0-12, but he'll still draw our team to stop him and push at least 2 lanes down to their inhibitors and farm up to the point where he'll still manage to kill my out of position adc before inevitably going down.","replies":[{"poster":"Jorsty","date":"2017-07-09T07:47:08.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so who would be a good counter pick for tryndamere? in that case, I actually play tryndamere already since he's so good at pushing towers","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-09T08:57:37.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm I'd say if I had to counterpick, \n- I'd go teemo or jax for obvious reasons the dodge/blind shuts down trynd's damage and these champs can splitpush against trynd lategame too, \n- sion because the ranges of sion's abilities just seem to work well against tryndamere but eventually you get outscaled and so splitpushing becomes a problem because after a while you can't fight trynd anymore so you need a coordinated team which will listen when you ping objectives,\n- garen because it's garen and you'll outduel trynd for most the game thanks to the silence and movespeed shutting down trynd's escapes and chase, allowing garen safety in these fights and making it more risky for the tryndamere,\n- and ap shaco top because it's hard for tryndamere to kill shaco however splitpushing becomes a problem.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-07-15T15:28:05.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are good, though garen takes a bit of judgmment,and a variant build path.\n\n\nNasus is also very solid, trynd does nothing with wither on him, by the time he gets qss he usually cant stop Nasus.

(I think those winrates have gone up by 1%, but nasus is still below average, and usually only wins games that go past 30min).\n\nI don't like nasus because he's useless when behind since he's not inherently very tanky (compared to true tanks or sustain tanks), his damage without stacks is poor, he has no peel, lockdown or engage, his poke is bad, he has no mobility (yes stormraiders and ghost, but that only counts if he's ahead) and his utility is low. He's also not too hard to counterpick, and interestingly when the enemy team has a zilean, his winrate drops by around 10%.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-07-09T04:57:55.441+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius, Garen, Jax, Teemo, Nasus, Kathus (when top).
