And guess what I am being trolled. This is before the game has started. But I have a Nidalee jg, a Ekko mid, a Twisted Fate ADC and a Jax support. Riot please don&#039;t match me with these people ever again O.O back to bronze for me :(","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-10-01T11:54:38.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its extremely difficult to drop tiers. you have to lose like A LOT in order to drop back into Bronze.\n\nThat team sounds awesome. Maybe don't be so negative and it would work out ok, rather than just chalking it off as a loss.\n\nNidalee is one of the strongest junglers around.\nEkko is ok.\nTF ADC can work (just look at TF Jungle)\nand Jax support is something new.\n\nI've seen pro players test out \"fighter\" supports. Olaf, Renekton, Irelia... can work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-10-01T05:03:03.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nidalee jungle and Ekko mid are pretty regular roles, TF ADC and Jax support is weird though","replies":[]},{"poster":"I think I Kennen","date":"2015-10-01T04:04:36.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In case you don't know already, you don't lose MMR from dodging... your LP can go negative, but your MMR will stay the same.
