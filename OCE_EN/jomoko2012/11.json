Also I would like to know if you are able to skip divisions can you skip tiers. Please respond and give me some answers. I am in bronze three at the moment so would it be possible to go to bronze one or even higher?\r\nAnother thing I would like to know is can a person be demoted to bronze one after getting into silver? Is the drop caused by inactivity or losing to many games.  \r\nP.S I have posted this thread because while looking on the forums I could not find any relevant information. \r\nJomoko2012 :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-15T10:56:19.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Jomoko2012,\n\nYou can indeed jump divisions (i.e. Bronze 3 - 1)\nYou can also jump tiers (i.e. bronze 2 - silver 5)\nIf you get in silver you can fall back to bronze, but it takes quite a few losses. Your MMR would have to fall to around bronze 4/5 level before you drop from Silver 5 to bronze 1","replies":[{"poster":"jomoko2012","date":"2015-01-15T23:29:04.647+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Riot Maraudaur :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gryffindor","date":"2015-01-15T11:28:14.168+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can jump without even doing promos like me. was s5 0 lp played 3 games got to 90 lp played 1 more jumped to s3 no promos","replies":[{"poster":"jomoko2012","date":"2015-01-15T23:29:39.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whoa you must have a high MMR then.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-15T11:14:36.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On the subject of MMR, is there any official way to check it?","replies":[{"poster":"Funk","date":"2015-01-15T12:50:19.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Musterpulse,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OmaQfPJn,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-01-15T11:14:36.242+0000)\n>\n> On the subject of MMR, is there any official way to check it?\n\nNope","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-15T20:27:24.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their is the vague estimate on oce.op.gg based on some crazy algorithms","replies":[]}]}]}]}
