However I want to go for a higher rank so I am wondering, &quot;What is a good champion that will help me carry more ranked games?&quot; I already main Lee Sin in the jungle however I want to have another main so that I can carry from different roles such as Mid or ADC. So my question is who do you guys think is a good champion/s to carry silver? \r\nHere is my LoLKing just incase you want to see my stats and what would suit me best: http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/553820\r\nJomoko2012","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-07T23:33:28.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just about anyone, as long as you know how to play them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-07T22:23:02.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can learn to play yasuo (yes he is actually hard to use, regardless of what idiots think, he will feed if he isn't god, feed so hard) go ahead, he is unmatched by anyone if you can play him good, the only person to give trouble would be trynd, but if you can time your r and q together well you can easily win\n\nalso, if you can use viktor(y)'s lazers correctly you can carry pretty hard","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master Namer","date":"2015-08-07T15:27:49.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any champion if played well enough in bronze/silver/gold can carry a game, but to make it easier i will list the best mid/adc/jg/top laners to get good at and will also be able to help you improve your general game play and even help you after reaching a higher elo.\n\ntop: riven, irelia, rumble, shen\nmid: ahri, viktor, azir\njungle: Elise, shyvanna, rek sai\nadc: sivir, vayne, corki\n\n\nthere are always going to be other picks that can \"counter\" your picks, but every champion has these and in my opinion these are the best champions to main in their respective roles if you want to carry to a higher elo","replies":[]}]}
