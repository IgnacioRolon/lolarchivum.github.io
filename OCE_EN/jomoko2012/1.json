Now I am no computer whiz as my older brother is the one who builds our computer and that. I would like to know what is the benefit of a higher fps. I play wtih 60 fps and I have no problems however when I turn off one setting it can go up to 170 -180 fps is there any benefit in this? \r\nRegards Jomoko2012","replies":[{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-06-06T04:36:23.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your monitor is 60 hz refresh rate (most laptops and monitors) then you can mainly only see 60 fps anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-06T04:11:00.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FPS just makes it look better.

As far as I know the highest FPS a human can identify is about 150 FPS, though it may be lower depending on the individual. As far as monitors go, as long as the frequency/refresh rate of the monitor matches the FPS you're good (so 60 Hz for 60 FPS, 120 Hz for 120 FPS and so on).","replies":[]}]}
