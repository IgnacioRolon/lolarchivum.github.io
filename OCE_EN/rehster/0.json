Imo being one of those fully unlocked camera wizards doesn't really matter till you get to plat, since the minimap conveys alot of information already, and the rest can be seen with a quick flick of unlocked camera and then mouse over the target area.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-22T06:30:37.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As someone who uses locked Camera mostly, if it's what your used to and good with it's not a bad thing, you can actually be forced to have more awareness as a player with a locked camera because your using the map more to fill in the parts that you can't see.\n\nNot only this, but the fact that you move it when you need to, makes it a good way to use the camera anyway.","replies":[]}]}
