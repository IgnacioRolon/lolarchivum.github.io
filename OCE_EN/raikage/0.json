If i am not unbanned i will continue to request the lifting on the suspension. If you need me to do anything to prove i didnt break any rules that i am accused of (malicious 3rd party software). I gained ownership of the account from a friend, that was dying. as he no longer needed it, i have no involvement of what the account has been accused of. The time i gained ownership was after the account was transferred to the Oceanic server. All i know is that i have spent upwards of $100 and have lost that over something my now dead friend has done. So i am very upset and it would be greatly appreciated if you could lift my suspension. thankyou{{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T05:33:46.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I gained ownership of the account from a friend\n\nYou realise that this is bannable, yes?\n\nAlso you got this account off a deceased person!?","replies":[]}]}
