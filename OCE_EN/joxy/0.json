Their terms and conditions is now a violation of your freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nAfter tens of thousands of hours of play time over the better part of a decade, and close to $3,000 dollars invested in micro transactions - I can say with the utmost confidence, that Riot Games are advocates of a social justice ideology that violates the spirit of competition and fiercely weakens the fortitude of it's player base by rallying against free speech.\r\n\r\nYes, it's sad folks - the developers behind our beloved League of Legends have politically aligned themselves along side the far leftist social justice warrior ideologs - pretty ironic if you consider recent headlines about bullying, gender discrimination and sexual harrassment coming out of their headquarters.\r\n\r\nThis commentary comes following a permanent ban on my account for verbalizing my frustrations in the height of competitive passion, something which is seen in every competitive sport across the planet - and let's not pretend that League of Legends doesn't try to position itself in that space.\r\n\r\nNow let me ask you in all seriousness - in a game in which every player has the ability to mute unwanted communications with a single click - should exercising your freedom of speech and expression really be a permanently bannable offense? Particularly after such an extensive investment of time and money, how does this not constitute theft?\r\n\r\nWhen a ban is issued for a violation of terms, but said terms violate basic human rights - should actions be legally implementable? Do Riot Games consider themselves above law and constitution?\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive.\r\n\r\nThis is political correctness taken too far - and clearly the result of millennial decision makers heading HR at Riot Games. \r\n\r\nRiot are over coddling their player base, and giving players too much control over the fate of others. The reporting system for example - It's far too easy for a player to get caught up in a competitive emotional quarrel and reflexively report people in heat of the moment. \r\n\r\nStop being ratty little snitches and take it on the chin - the only behavior that should be bannable is player action that INTENTIONALLY contribute to losses - like feeding, trolling etc. \r\n\r\nExercising your freedom to taunt, provoke and vent is innate to human nature - and in competitive environments, can add will to the drama and excitement of the matches unfolding - which is why it is so common in sport.\r\n\r\nTake the UFC for example, where flaming and provoking the opponent is a crucial part of the marketing and hype building process - which adds another dimension to the way the sport plays out both from the experience of combatants and audience.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing more thrilling and rewarding than simply outclassing another competitor after he's spend the last 20 minutes trying to tilt you by telling you that he fucked your %%%%%% mother. There is no better feeling for the victor, and no better lesson for the loser.\r\n\r\nLet's face it, we get passionate about things that we love, and this is amplified by competition - and when we're passionate about something, we're going to get emotional, and we're going to say shit and do shit we don't mean - and part of being human is recognizing that in others and turning the other cheek. \r\n\r\nThere's no honor in reporting someone for venting their frustrations in the heat of competitive passion.\r\n\r\nThere's even less honor in facilitating the ability to carry out that process.\r\n\r\nIf Riot want to remain relevant and prevent their player count from dropping, they need to stop releasing shitty new content that no one cares about, and address what matters.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding that the most passionate players are the ones who love them the most is a good place to start.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-07-13T04:47:58.967+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Freedom of speech is a right to express your opinions on an issue.

As long as it is WE, it is not 'me'; Therefor acting on behalf of the group and not for personal vendetta. This is the image that you are trying to sell.\n\nThe banner that you are trying to rally under is no more than a victim hood mentality. If you had been wrongfully punished, that is a call to action. But when you know full well of what your are doing, and what at stakes; Yet did it any way then dressed it up as political agenda, it's rather pathetic. The kind that ignored all the signs and only complain when things goes wrong. \n\nWhere were your voice in the issue before all of this? Not like you were the 1st to be struck, does it only matter now that you got hit? \n\n> I don't make any such claim\n\nYour implication of the matter is the claim. Even though you are trying to be cunning about it.\n\n> In order to be able to think, you have to risk being offensive.\n\nThat is funny, are you thinking in depth when you swear at those players? Or do you like to use decorative words to hide your true intention. \n\nWhy don't you post your chat log eh? Let see if you put much thought in your insults, or pure rage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BenjiboyISme","date":"2019-07-13T17:12:15.290+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"**TLDR**: waste of time **do not read** dude just complaining that he cant flame someone(use excessive slurs/not normal bm) and got banned so he salty \n\ndude just malding and doesn't want to take the blame for breaking rules he was told not to break and has jumped to conclusion that if a company doesn't want toxic AF players then they must be far-left  AND MUST BE RESTRICTING FreEdOM oF eXPreSSIon","replies":[{"poster":"lotusGOD","date":"2019-07-13T20:39:23.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Salty about losing $3,000 in skins because some delicate little flower can't handle being called a cheeky %%%%.

First you say \"Particularly after such an extensive investment of time and money, how does this not constitute theft?\". I want to inform you that you do not own your account; Riot owns it. As such they can close all servers tomorrow and you will lose all the money invested in the game and they will not brake any law.\n\n2.  Secondly you say \"Do Riot Games consider themselves above law and constitution?\"; what law and constitution. Riot is a company that has it's player base in a lot of countrys and they all have different laws.\n\n3. Then you say \"Stop being ratty little snitches and take it on the chin - the only behavior that should be bannable is player action that INTENTIONALLY contribute to losses - like feeding, trolling etc.\". So you belive that threts to another person for example, is not a valid reason for baning the culprit? And how do you prove intent? That is a realy hard thing to prove just based on one game.\n\n4. You also say \"we're going to get emotional, and we're going to say shit and do shit we don't mean - and part of being human is recognizing that in others and turning the other cheek.\". Are you an animal? Can you not controll what you type? I understand you get mad, i also get mad sometimes and type something offensive; but when i do that i stop immediately and mute all players. I dont flame my team the rest of the game.\n\n5. Finaly you say \"There's no honor in reporting someone for venting their frustrations in the heat of competitive passion.\". So there is honor in flaming someone? This should be a skill based game. If you need to, tilt someone by flaming to win, then you are a bad player. \n\n Also from what i know Riot does not ban you instantly unless you did or say somthing realy bad. Usualy they give you small punishments. So you must have did somthig realy bad or are an all around toxic player. But this could be a wrong statement from my part.","replies":[]}]}
