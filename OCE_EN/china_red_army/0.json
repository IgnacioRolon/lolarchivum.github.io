After all, I have a lot of money in it. I like League of Legends, and I didnâ€˜t lend it to others. If not,Does the skin in the account can be transfer to another account?

They'll go through the process with you, which will include a series of questions to help verify you're the original account user (you shouldn't need to answer all of them, just enough to verify beyond reasonable doubt). If they're able to verify a compromise, they'll be able to reverse any punishments that occurred as a direct result of the compromise.\n\nI'd also recommend that you run an anti-virus scan on any personal computers you've used to access LoL recently, as well as securing any important accounts (for example, email, bank etc), just in case. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is also a good tool to help track down compromises.","replies":[]}]}
