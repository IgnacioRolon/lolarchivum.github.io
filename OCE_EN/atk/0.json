Is it even possible that i always get the feeding team. This sounds eerily like a bronze complaining about his elo. I play with silvers, golds and most of the time i carry with champs such as zed. Maybe for 1 game i win, i lose 3 with a team that either 3v5 team fights or just feeds. It is extremely frustrating, hence any advice would help, obviously I make many mistakes and theres still alot to improve upon, but how do you even get out of bronze. It is almost euphoric playing with silver 1s and such as the teams somewhat know what they are doing. Elo hell :(. Is the trick here perseverance? In lane, I always either get first blood, or roam to achieve it, normally having a large amount of farm compared to everyone else. I really need to know how you guys did it. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-13T02:59:02.588+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Objectives are a big deal atm, a lot of people can get distracted with chasing/trying to get kills, so Nezu's got a good point of splitpushing champs are quite strong, as you can try to win the game on your own if the opponents don't cotton on. If you want your teammates to back off/engage, ping over and over about it. Some people won't ever listen no matter how much you ping, but it does seem to help. Play champs you can guarantee carry with, whether that's a tanky splitpusher who can just shove a lane down to inhib and force the opponent to come deal with you, or you can ace the team with little team help. With this kind of method, you're best to avoid going support as it's much harder to do. Possible, but hard.\n\nUltimately, pick 2-3 champs for two roles, and spam them. Get good. Get really good. Don't try to counter pick, just focus on your own champs that you learn so well they're second nature. And don't let your team try to convince you to go a different champ either.\n\nWhat kind of LP are you gaining/losing per game?","replies":[{"poster":"ATK","date":"2016-04-13T03:49:03.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea cheers man, your right. Ah, I'd say I gain about 22-20 LP, lose 20-19. Also would you happen to know how losing and winning more/less LP works besides from the obvious queueing with lower/higher elos? \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-13T06:37:29.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard that you get more LP if the system expects your team to lose and you win, but it can also award you skewed amounts if you are in a league too high/low for how you're playing (more relevant for when you first place or if you're cheating the system though).\n\nIf you're winning more than you're losing on average that's good, it means you will climb! It just may be slow until you get a good win rate going along. Good luck! :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nezu","date":"2016-04-12T14:27:27.861+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played like 60 games of tryndamere and got from bronze 2-plat 5 in like 2 months, skipped something like 3 divisions as well. There are certain champs that destroy in low elo. One of the things i figured out early was that splitpushing champs in top lane/Jg (Shyv, Jax, Tryn) are usually the way to go as even if you keep going and going and going at your lane you'll eventually get their towers and create some space for your team. It's a really selfish way to play, but it works in bronze/silver.","replies":[{"poster":"ATK","date":"2016-04-13T02:48:59.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks alot man, ill try this out.

Most plat and higher players will have played 1000's or 10,000's of games.

I reached out to some high elo players and asked them to play norms with me and help me improve. It worked, I learned a lot of things I wasn't aware of before. I went back into ranked and got to bronze 1 within a week (I was playing support). \n\nLast season I did my placements, and ended up in bronze 1. Was having a hard time getting out of bronze, so I spent a lot of time getting to know about gameplay choices, champion strengths and practicing basic skills [things like [CS](http://imgur.com/orWUCKH), [warding](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/support-guide-map-control-warding-344910), positioning, [teamcomps](http://www.liquidlegends.net/forum/lol-strategy/476270-picks-and-bans-understanding-team-compositions), and [being a nice person and encouraging your team](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/). If you need help with some of this, you could[ consider hiring a coach](http://www.lol-coaching.com). ] Managed to go form bronze 1 to silver 1 in about a month, only to tilt my way back down to silver 5 a week before season end\n\nThis season, got placed in bronze once again. Been working hard on polishing my skills, as well as playing with my friends in a 5man team most of the time. It means I don't have to deal with toxins and afks, and that I can trust my teammates to be able to at least hold their lanes. \n\nThe past couple of years have showed me that the most important thing you can have while climbing is the right attitude. If you go into a game thinking you will lose/ thinking your team are potatoes, you will have started negatively impacting your play from the get-go. It also makes you more likely to flame. \n\nYour attitude also has a massive impact on the other players on your team. I have had many games where I have managed to talk someone away from going AFK, in order to secure a win, even when it looks like you are going to lose. Recently, I have had players in my game that are going 0/8 in laning phase, but through positive chat, I can keep them in the game long enough to become relevant and sometimes even be the deciding factor in a fight.","replies":[]}]}
