I understand that Riot is working on a lot and the OCE tribunal is &quot;in progress&quot;, I am also aware of the instant feed back system and LeaverBuster, but this has to stop... the fact that a player like this:<REMOVED> is still active and his IP has not been banned from all Riot servers blows my mind. There are good people on this server, there really are and I like to think of myself as one, but frankly its now at the point where a lot of us are considering leaving the game for good.\n\nHopefully those at Riot read this and understand that we have begged, we have pleaded and still we must tolerate these people, I for one will happily raise my hand to be a member of any OCE Tribunal so that we can clean up our server and go back to enjoying games, Victory or Defeat.\n\nEDIT: Here is another player, most likely the previous' friend as the only wins in the match list that they have won is when they duo together <REMOVED>","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-03-23T12:22:14.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like this man.\n\nPeople who don't play league, don't know what feeding is. When the media looks at the game and sees someone walking into the enemy team, they don't see it as a problem.\n\nHowever, people do know what abuse is. People don't want to be abused for doing something they didn't even know they were doing. People don't play. Riot realized this, so they crack down and appear tough on the big bad abusers, but the feeders don't receive anything because in the public eye it isn't an issue.\n\nThe people who helped put the game in the spotlight, the people who have played since beta are all flocking away, because Riot 2.0 is choosing new players over them. Why would Riot want to keep players who have every champ/skin, when we can get new players who have nothing? \n\n\"The less they have, the more we can sell to them.\"\n\n\nGotta remember, Riot is a company first. They do whatever will increase their revenue the most.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-03-23T03:42:47.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man I know the feels but the best we can do atm is report them and hope instant feedback system for intentional feeders does its job and they get banned. It's doing a better job then what you think with getting the wrong doers. \nIn the meantime know that riot is working on a tribunal and that it was scheduled to come out sometime this season but was pushed back because of the new champ select.

Nothing will be 100% perfect. So it's up to us the community  to help wether it be through reporting or a more effective way sending a ticket in as yasei doubutsu suggested. Sure this might take time out of our day which is understandably not something that you should have to do because of another's behaviour, but sometimes we have to help ourselves and not just sit here asking riots to solve all our problems but help in the process by going that extra bit further.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-23T03:29:39.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As much as this does suck, can you please remove that link.\nName and shaming is not allowed, there Is a reason for it.

(Like really, that sucks. No idea why people do that)\n\nIts not up to us to decide the punishment, its up to riot.\nIts stops a professional youtuber (Keyori, Sp4zie etc) or streamer (etc you get the point) from getting there (Up too 1 Million) fans to abuse the guy. To do all these negative things.\n\nThrough the actions of 1 guy, and if witch hunting was allowed.\nWould turn 1 Million people into toxic people.\n\nHatred only spreads more hatred.\nBad only spreads more bad.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI would have reported him, if you team/the enemy team had any decency they would have done the same. More reports means riot has a stronger case against the guy, to perma ban him.\n\nIf you do get him/her again or just a bad game in general.\nI recommend taking  a break watching some silly/funny videos to help clear your mind.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
