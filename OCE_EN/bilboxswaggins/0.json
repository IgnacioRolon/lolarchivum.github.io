It had no purchased champions on it, and was summoner level 1.... I spent over 200$ and the funny thing is I have proof that that account was linked to the email that my new league account is linked too","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-05T10:59:34.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only way (that I know of) accounts get deleted is when it is specifically requested by the owner. If you know the summoner name of the account you might be able to put through an account recovery ticket with support, though you will need to remember details unique to the account to do this.\n\nIt's possible the account was compromised, honestly not sure what to tell you other than support is your best bet for more info here.","replies":[{"poster":"BilboXSwaggins","date":"2019-02-05T11:08:46.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait so how do I set up a support ticket","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-05T12:33:42.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I assumed that was how you got the info you had.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}]}]}
