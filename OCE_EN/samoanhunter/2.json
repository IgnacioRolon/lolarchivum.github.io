It's pretty easy to figure out how to handle the bots for an experienced player, so that can make coops go much easier.

The XP drop just becomes too much to be of significant value beyond an easy first win once you hit level 20 (not so much level 10, but still a drop), and since the major factor of how much XP you earn is the duration of the game, it becomes better to just go with PvP at that point.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-10-19T13:55:34.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ARAMS or AI.\n\nShort games, Short Queues.\n\nI personally leveled my account just by playing 1 game a day and getting first win of the day bonus XP.
