Like for those who are smurfing (such as myself), we go there to test out new stuff, destroy nubs and other things, and yes int + feed.\n\nBut I think people should stop, there isn&#039;t an excuse for this shit lol\n\nIf people don't stop I think that they should go into a &#039;Troll Queue&#039; - or something along the lines of that.\n\nSame idea with the smurf queue, but with people who constantly troll, int and do other shit like this.\n\nTo distinguish who goes to this queue should be like this:\n\n1 - 3 reports per 10 games - No offence \n4 - 6 reports per 10 games - Warning \n7 - 10 reports per 10 games - Just the normal 2 week ban or something along the lines of that.\n\nBut after the ban, give the person 10 games with other trolls, int&#039;rs and people who like ruining the game for &#039;fun&#039;.\n\nSame as like toxic people verbally abuse people through a screen, they are welcomed back to the LoL community with a good 10 game chat ban.\n\nThose people who have multiple accounts, have linked all of them to their one Email Address. Those accounts should be given a warning, regardless of how bad the int / troll was.\n\nTLDR:\n\nMake a troll queue, same idea as the smurf queue.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-10-26T12:51:44.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So it seems like you're talking about a \"prisoner island\" concept, where toxic players (in this case, trolls) are set up to be matched with other toxic players, thus allowing other players to play in peace. It's important to note that Riot has stated in the past they they do not want to use such a concept because it doesn't address the behaviours, it simply hides them.","replies":[{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-28T02:20:44.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is correct that I do want this concept enforced.\n\nOf course it does hide them, but after those 10 games, we reintroduce that particular player back into the 'normal queues'.\n\nWe do not keep them there.\n\nAlso it (in my opinion) does address the behaviour, kinda like a \"Taste of your own Medicine\" thing. Of course that can be debated, but this is just my personal opinion.\n\nAnd to add on further, I think that something needs to be done with this sort of behaviour, whether it be chat banning other accounts associated with the same email, or 'improving' the tribunal system.","replies":[]}]}]}
