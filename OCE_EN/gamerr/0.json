Please check your network connection and attempt to reconnect to our game\" but there is no problem with my network. It just chooses a game that im not allowed to play every once in awhile and has made me loose LP several times. I have tried closing the game and reopening no issues logging in but still cant connect to the game, i even restarted my computer once to no avail. Every instance of this problem i can find online is a good few years old and all of the solves have not worked for me. I don't have an anti virus or anything and i have allowed it through my firewall but i still cant reconnect to the game. I just have to wait until the game is finished then the next game usually is fine.\r\n\r\nHelp please","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-24T05:22:10.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues\n\nFirst I would recommend trying any fixes int hat article that you haven't already, as well as running a basic client repair.\n\nI'd probably stick to normals for a few games to see if it's working out, and if not, submit a ticket to player support detailing the issue: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
