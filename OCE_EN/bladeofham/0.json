However, the system said that I was already assigned to a new game when I clicked the Play button to try to queue for a new URF game. Also, the PVP just indicated that I left an existing game when I quit and restart the PVP for several times. I just want to know what goes wrong with my account or if there is some error occuring to the server.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-23T09:04:21.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis should've resolved itself by now, these are known as ghost games and are caused by your client not receiving the proper \"End Game\" message upon completion of a game.\n\nThese usually resolve within a few hours.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeOfHam","date":"2016-04-22T16:04:16.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have no idea what is happening to my account...{{summoner:7}}","replies":[]}]}
