This can happen multiple times, i think my record is 7 lobby dodges in a row, it took about 30 minutes to get into a game.\r\n\r\nMy idea is that if you dodge at ARAM champ select, the next time you come to that lobby you are automatically assigned that same champion. I assume 90% of the cases of people leaving after accepting a game lobby invite is that they dont want to play the champion they were assigned and have no rolls.\r\n\r\nThe only problem here would be if more than 1 person dodged from different lobby with the same champion, but then they both join the same new lobby - I guess it would just pick one of them and the other would be lucky. Seems that would be pretty rare though.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"doesit","date":"2015-02-27T01:03:15.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Respond to the post how you want to,

might add encourages dodging on low popularity champs that a higher percentage would dodge with (higher chance you'd get rid of the champion)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord

and the edit was made after my post.\n\nAlso i read it as \"Only the dodger keeps the same champion\"\n\nIf that's not the case, then it's like tons more likely that people will get into lobby's with the same champion, and then this entire system becomes pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-02-26T19:15:35.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I was the 3rd person to post on this thread, and neither of the other two were you and that 'Edit' was there before i posted \nso i think you have that wrong.\n\nif you read the original post then you would be correct in reading it that way, however if you read my first post, its different, I'm introducing a new idea.\n\nthere are way over 100 champs, the chance that 2 or more out of 5 people will have the same one is fairly low, and if it does happen, then it will just be like doesit says and the system will randomly choose one of them.\n\nall you have done is put down his idea yet you haven't produced any of your own?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-27T01:12:06.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*bzzt*\n\nThere may be over 100 champs, but we have the problem of two things\n\nPeople with lower amounts of champs tend to have the same champs (IE. low IP cost/FoTM)\n\nFree week champs always spawn more often, due to EVERYONE having access to them.\n\nPersonally i

cannot see this would work, We concluded that players could get DR (Diminishing returns) on leaving games so the more you leave the longer you cannot play, and that the time would have to be spent
