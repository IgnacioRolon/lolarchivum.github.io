But, ARAM is getting kind of old in that its essentially a pringle container of champion trait momentum. \r\n\r\nIf you heavily outweight the enemy in poke, they will sit in their tower clearing wave until they are tanky. If they heaving AP, you gear heavily MR. If they having AD, you heavy armor. If they have enage, you sit and wait. Its become not only boring, but also kind of counter productive to why I think ARAM was established as a map type instead of just a custom lobby type. To teach players each character. There are 100 champs now. If you are new, its going to take you ages to learn how each works.\r\n\r\nARAM no longer provides the platform to teach; Its just an absolutely fluster cuck of imbalances based on lobby random and some of this imba could be overcome with a changes.\r\n\r\nWhat if you keep the lane 100% how it is, except, you add narrow lanes to each side with brush and what not, much how bot and top lane are set up. Without adding passageways where singed or whoever can just run down the side to the enemy base and be troll. I just mean little narrow ways between each tower, with some brush in them; so champs with brush effects are actually useful; so champs with terran abilities are not deminished; so ranged champs cant just sit and poke you, there is space to move and differentiate gameplay rather than sitting in a narrow causeway.\r\n\r\nIt would provide more dynamic interaction I think. A wider lane, but still only 1 actual lane with objectives. \r\n\r\nI havent even played the new champion, but just for example he is pretty useless in ARAM; his kit has heavy interaction with wall hoping. Bard needs terran to traverse. Evelyn needs places to hide. Talon needs walls to hop. There are plenty of champs in league that you just put in the ARAM pringle container and half their kit is useless to range, but adding a bit of lateral movement might just help so those characters are relative in ARAM.\r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents after a few hundred games.\r\n\r\nGL Summoners.","replies":[]}
