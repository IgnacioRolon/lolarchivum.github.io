Lately, i have been versing gold 5/4&#039;s and silver 1&#039;s rather then silver 3&#039;s in my ranked games. My problem is, the ranked system is meant to challenge the player to be better then the people in their rank (for e.g. better then the people in silver 3). I am being put with people in gold and high silver rather then people in my rank, and my question is, How is this meant to help show me that i&#039;m better then the people in silver 3, when i&#039;m not even versing them? My solution is that the ranked system should be redesigned, so a silver 3 player, only verses silver 3&#039;s, and maybe the occasional silver 2/4. This will make the test of &#039;are you better then the people in your rank?&#039; a more fair test, because nobody enjoys being tested on an unfair test.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-16T13:44:49.466+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That just means that your hidden mmr is higher then your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-01-16T16:19:41.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or those higher ranks have lower mmr's","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-01-16T17:14:20.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That not the case if the majority of players are the higher rank.\n\nIt's only the case when one person of high rank is put with players of low rank.\n\nIf a Silver player gets put in a match with Gold/Plat players they have high MMR. If a Diamond player is put in a game with Plat/Gold players they have low MMR.\n\nThe situation where the higher rank person with low MMR happens more often due to it being extremely difficult to drop out of Diamond 5 to Plat 1 or Plat 5 to Gold 1. Where if you have higher MMR than your rank often the game will force skip you ahead a division or two in order to correct the imbalance.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-01-17T02:04:26.991+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly this","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2016-01-17T01:13:25.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's your chance to climb quickly...If you can play up to that level and still do well you will get there really quickly. If not, then you don't deserve to be and you will be playing mid to low silver again in no time. Plus if you pay attention you will probably learn a lot more from the higher mmr games than from just playing your rank over and over which will improve your game in the long run.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sailor Jupiter","date":"2016-01-16T18:31:25.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can seem unfair but you'll find that when you win you'll get a large amount of LP, and when you lose you won't lose as much.
