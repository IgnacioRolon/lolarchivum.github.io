After A LOT of games i eventually got to checkpoint 3/3 to get to level 1 again but when the new season rolled out my honor was put back down to level 0 checkpoint 0/3. I haven&#039;t gotten chat banned or banned at all since last time and my chat hasn&#039;t been toxic at all. Wondering what could have reset my checkpoints because it takes far too long to even get one checkpoint let alone 3, so having it reset for no reason is a little annoying. Thanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-01-29T00:32:58.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine resetting honour due to a new season.

Those above Honour 2 will drop so 2-1, 2-2, or 2-3 depending on where they finished.

A fix is coming soon, within 48 hours. Don't worry; after we adjust things, you won't end up losing any progress during this time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Drakuns","date":"2019-01-24T21:44:39.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} think all got dropped down i've not seen anything about it but maybe its reset lower for the new season, i think i was purple 3 balls down to green 1,","replies":[]}]}
