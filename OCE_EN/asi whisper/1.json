I know sometimes I do not play that well, but sometimes when I do, my teammates just could not careless and proceeds to play bad. I would say most of the games I lose is because of my teammates, I do not know what to do to climb out of gold. Its just fulled of people that do not really want to win and just tilt and proceeds to play bad and or disconnects. I was starting with gaining 26 lp per game, now because of how many games I am losing, I get 18 lp a game and lose like 14, it is not even my fault that i want to lose that many games. Any adivces?","replies":[]}
