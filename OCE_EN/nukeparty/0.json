If a ban is truly made in error then Riot will reverse it. The average player will never have any interaction with any of the punishments systems, except maybe the occasional 5 min queue timer for an accidental dodge (and that isn't technically a punishment unless it's a ranked dodge but more like a \"are you sure you're ready\").\n\nOP was consistently toxic, perma ban was his third punishement. Typically for toxicity there are four punishement tiers and you will face each on ein order. The tiers are 10 game chat restriction > 25 game chat restriction > 14 day ban > perma ban.\n\nOP mentioned below that he never recieved a 14 day ban, in severe cases the system will skip punishment tiers. This is usually reserved for things like death threats and hate speech. In the really bad cases you can face an immediate permanent ban.\n\nHOWEVER, all that said, you won't be punished just for one bad game where you get really frustrated and say more in chat than you should. So long as you aren't consistently or frequently toxic, don't intentionally feed, don't steal peoples roles in ranked etc etc then you are pretty safe. \n\nThe things you will normally be instantly banned for are pretty much impossible to do accidentally. Those include things like account buying/selling, scripting/cheating/hacking/utilising disallowed 3rd party programs and the like.\n\nBear in mind that account sharing is also punishable. Typically it won't be unless it is used for boosting/cheating and the like, but do so at your own risk.\n___\nPLAYER BEHAVIOUR FAQ: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq-updated-for-instant-feedback\n\nLEAVERBUSTER FAQ:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ\n\nSUMMONER’S CODE:\nhttp://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/\n\nHOW DO REPORTS WORK:\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/reports-how-do-they-work\n\nREPORTABLE BEHAVIOUR:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h1q1\n\nNOT REPORTABLE BEHAVIOUR:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q1","replies":[{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-30T08:57:44.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i've never received any of these messages saying you were reported or anything like that\nDoes that mean im a good person and im all good :)\nim assuming i'll receive these messages first","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-30T09:55:51.723+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Moving forward, we'll be replacing the current iteration of Behavior Alerts/warnings with one that interacts directly with the instant feedback system.

Even using words considered offensive aren't punished in and of themselves, it depends on context.\n\nIt comes down to intent. If your intent is to make someone feel bad for any reason (even if it's reactionary) you will face punishments (and not typically for a one time thing).
