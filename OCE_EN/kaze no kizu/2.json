No its just even time you tab now.\n\nEDIT: Obviously needs context.\n\n>Patch 6.17 bugfix: Players can no longer get stuck in weird states (ex. every button is a ping) if they switch to a different window at the exact moment they input a command\n\nTabbing while doing a command will be the initial trigger(still) for your video setting being switched to windowed mode, it also locks the cam so you cant scroll down, as well as making every (left) click a ping, then after its happened once, even without the \"trigger\" of tabbing just as you input a command, it will lock the screen out from scrolling down, change it to windowed and make clicks pings.\n\nTDLR(for the super lazy): After triggering the bug once, (every time you tab out of the game to check things (like the time)) you get that bug.\n\n**For the even lazier: **That bug wasn't fixed, it just became worse","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-08-25T23:42:37.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flying cameras are usually a mouse related issue.
