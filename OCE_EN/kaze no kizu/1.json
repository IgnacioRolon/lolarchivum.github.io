Hauling his ornate weapon from the ground, the man set off in a sprint towards the sounds of battle, his long black hair in flow.\n\nHe skated to a stop, his fellow students&hellip; his friends. It was slaughter, they had not been trained to fight such an enemy, their ferocity and bloodlust, its inhuman... they can hardly be called people, his grip tightened and he steadied his resolve, charging head first into the fray. Swiftly he danced between the enemy soldiers, like a leaf blown by the wind. \n\n----\n\n**_Is a leaf&rsquo;s only purpose to fall?_**\n\n&ldquo;What have I done&hellip;&rdquo; the young man&rsquo;s voice trailed as he stared wide-eyed at the massacre which lay before him, &ldquo;one task and I failed, I was a fool.&rdquo;\n\n_&ldquo;Where are you going fool, come back here!&rdquo; yelled the elderly man, &ldquo;It is your duty.&rdquo;_\n\n_&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long, if I kill them all first there won&rsquo;t be any problem will there?&rdquo; shouted the man as he dashed away._\n\n_&ldquo;Return here now Ya&hellip;&rdquo; the elder&rsquo;s voice was cut off by the ringing of weapons as the gap between he and the fighting closed._\n\n&ldquo;I left&hellip; abandoned my duty.&rdquo; whispered the man. &ldquo;I must accept the consequences.&rdquo; \n\n&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; yelled a voice from behind. Two men seized him by the arms and the captive man&rsquo;s head sank. A third man walks forwards, blade in hand announcing the guilty man&rsquo;s felony; &ldquo;He who was tasked with defending the village elder has abandoned his post, and slain he whom he swore to protect, the punishment is death!&rdquo;\n\n----\n\n**_Death is like the wind; always by my side._**\n\nThe morning sun brought no warmth. The man knelt with his back facing it, his knees resting on the makeshift grave before him. His hands stained with the blood of a loved one; his hands stained with the blood of his brother. \n\n&ldquo;Why!?&rdquo; he shouted at his brother with mixed emotions of sorrow and regret. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you trust me. Why didn&rsquo;t you believe in me? Why didn&rsquo;t any of you believe me&hellip;&rdquo; his voice trailing off as he broke into a sob, &ldquo;Why Yone&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nShakily the man rose, supporting himself with the same ornate blade that had ended his own brother&rsquo;s life. Slowly the man picked up his fallen brother&rsquo;s sword and drove it into the ground, to serve as a tombstone.\n\nThe man let his head fall as one last lone tear fell away, soaking into the sullied earth beneath him.\n\n----\n\n**_Virtue is no more than a luxury._**\n\n&ldquo;The drinks good?&rdquo; came a gruff voice from beside the man. For a moment, he was unsure if the man had addressed him or not, when he realised that he had, he cleared his throat and replied, &ldquo;Like alcohol should be, strong.&rdquo; \n\nThe man chuckled, &ldquo;that&#039;s good.&rdquo; Turning to the bartender the man put in a request, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have what he&rsquo;s having, and please, while you&rsquo;re at it fill his up.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Thank you, stranger,&rdquo; he said appreciatively, taking a swig of the newly filled tankard, &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Well I figured that now you can stay and talk for a while.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;About what?&rdquo; he replied.\n\n&ldquo;Nothing much&rdquo; replied the man in his familiar gruff voice.\n\n&ldquo;I can live with that&rdquo; he replied before putting a small object away.\n\n&ldquo;What was that? A seed?&rdquo; asked the man inquisitively. \n\nHe quickly replied in a defensive tone, &ldquo;Just a trinket.&rdquo; A moment of silence passed between the two before he responded again, &ldquo;Something&hellip; very dear to me.&rdquo; \n\n----\n\n**_Some mistakes you can&rsquo;t make twice._**\n\nPatience is a virtue. Humility is a gift. Both required of a true swordsman.\n\nA maple seed. The last memento left of his brother. A lesson he would never forget&hellip; &ldquo;A seed is just a seed, but given time one may come to know the beauty it holds within.&rdquo; \n\nA lesson of patience. A lesson of humility. A teaching his brother had encouraged. A teaching he had ignored.\n\n----\n\n**_It&rsquo;s just death. Nothing serious._**\n\nThe man sat within a small shrine, his head bowed to his chest, dark wild hair dancing in the wind, mulling over his most valuable lesson of all. Pondering how life would have been if he had heeded his brother&#039;s lesson. \n\nA deep rumble started to build. Steadily growing louder by the moment. There was nowhere to go, kneeling in an open shrine at the base of a glen. Steeling his resolve, he prepared for the worst.\n\n----\n\n**_It is not yet time to die._**\n\nCold&hellip; Darkness&hellip; Silence...\n\nThe faint crunch of feet on snow. A soft voice rang in a half scared, half worried voice, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be dead. Please don&rsquo;t be dead. Please&hellip;&rdquo; Cold delicate hands brushed against the man&rsquo;s own, causing his entire arm to involuntarily clench. The voice came once more, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not dead already, then you&rsquo;ve got to help me.&rdquo;\n\n_Silence..._\n\nThe touch of the unknown person vanished, the snow crunching once more as the person left, once more he was alone in the cold darkness, with naught but silence to accompany him. \n\nThe man reconciled with himself, &ldquo;Hmph&hellip; dying&rsquo;s the easy part.&rdquo; Finally coming to a conclusion he attempted to free himself from the snowy prison, whispering to himself, &ldquo;I alone decide my fate.&rdquo;\n\n----\n\n**_A sword&rsquo;s poor company for a long road._**\n\nHis body ached, but he was thankful for the warmth that the small cave provided. He slowed his breathing and took in the surrounding noises; birds chirping in the distance, the breathing of a young person, likely a woman considering how delicate and soft it was, and finally the sound of crunching stone. &ldquo;Like a sparrow gathering crumbs.&rdquo; Groaned the man. &ldquo;Even sparrows get thirsty.&rdquo; She replied in a familiar voice, scooping clean snow into her newly formed bowl, when it was full she set it onto the source of the warmth, a stack of heated rocks.\n\n&ldquo;you gather stones by hand? That seems tedious for someone who can weave rock.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not angry, are you?&rdquo; she asked, causing the man to lift his head in a questioning gesture, &ldquo;I mean about the snow and the&hellip;&rdquo;\n\nShe was cut off by a laugh, which was then in turn cut short by a groan as the man clutched his side. &ldquo;Your actions tell me all I need to know.&rdquo; Through clenched teeth and a ghost of a smile he continued, &ldquo;You could have left me to die.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to leave you buried in that snow, it was my mistake that put you there.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;And I thank you for that. Although, I could have done without the tumble through the trees.&rdquo;\n\nThe young girl winced and then opened her mouth. The man held out a hand in objection, &ldquo;Do not apologise.&rdquo;\n\n----\n**\n_Never could stay in one place_**\n\nHe sat upright against the rugged stone wall, listening to the sounds of nature; the bird song, the whistling wind. A beautiful harmony in which he could lose himself. His eyes began to flutter as he started to sink into a slumber. But no sooner had he fallen asleep had he awoken, the birdsong had abruptly stopped, giving him cause for suspicion. \n\n&ldquo;Get out of here,&rdquo; came the girls startled voice. He quickly rose, wincing from the pain. He started heading towards her voice. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;I said get out of here!&rdquo; Realising her danger, broke into a dash, attempting to reach the young girl before something he would come to regret could happen.\n\nA rumbling began to build from the direction of her voice, hastening the man even more. He arrived just in time to witness a massive white lion fall down the mountain, the girl soon to follow. Quicker than he had ever before, the man unsheathed his blade and shouted a single word in an ancient dialect, &ldquo;Aseryo!&rdquo;\n\nThe man slid forwards to grab the girl, managing to grab onto her collar, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise you were serious about bringing down the mountain, Little Sparrow.&rdquo; With a grunt he slowly hauls the girl up onto the ledge, &ldquo;I now understand why much of your desert is flat.&rdquo;\n\n----\n\n**_This story is not yet finished_**\n\nThe man, upon deciding that he was a stranger to anyone in the inn finally settled down. Grabbing his drink, he diverted his attention back to the girl, continuing his lesson, &ldquo;You must focus, you cannot hesitate,&rdquo; the girl just looked down into her cup, intrigued by the leaves swirling in the bottom, &ldquo;Danger comes when your attention is divided.&rdquo; The girl started to ask a question, but was shortly cut off. A well-equipped guardsman waded through the inn towards the man, spitting the words he said, &ldquo;This man, Yasuo, is guilty of assassinating a village elder. His crime warrants the punishment of death.&rdquo;\n\nA smirk came to Yasuo&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Kill me? You can try.&rdquo;\n\n----\n\n**Author:** Kaze no Kizu\n\nIf there are any typo's or errors of the sort, could you be so kind as to point them out so I can fix it up?\n\nWord count: 1500","replies":[{"poster":"azaki","date":"2016-06-27T20:08:28.729+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really captivating!

I liked his relationship with Taliyah, and its subsequent dialogues.

The title made me worry but the story is actually really well laid out! The only issue being that it doesn't really follow the conventions set down. This is less \"A day in runeterra\" so much as the story of Yasuo.
