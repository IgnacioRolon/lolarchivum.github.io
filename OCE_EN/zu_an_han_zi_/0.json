People playing this game for fun no matter what server it is, and doesn't matter where it is , there will always be people with bad attitude. No one expect being discriminate against when playing this game.  I was in a  normal game this morning and there were two of my team mates being racist to me, saying things like : \"dont give blue to the fkn chinese \" that sort of shit. Their IDs are : \"[REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]\". Hope they ll get a punishment for being racist.","replies":[{"poster":"LoyalMan","date":"2020-01-04T10:19:22.562+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"So you tried to steal someones blue and they got mad? \nStealing the junglers buff is not something we do in OCE.

If you feel a report hasn't been properly actioned by the primary punishment system - [the IFS](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-) - then you can submit a ticket to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with the content of your report (the more details the better) and it will be manually reviewed. Three important things to note with this method:\n\n1. Manual reports do not inform the IFS for future punishments, so you should always be using post-game reporting where possible, even if you choose to also submit a report via player support.\n2. Riot and Player Support cannot and will not give you *any* information, explicit or implicit, about another player's account. There are a variety of strong reasons for this, but essentially it means you will receive a \"thanks for the report\" type response.\n3. Punishments are not visible to anyone except Riot, Player Support, and the punished player. Some punishments can be inferred from available information, but not all. Just because you don't *see* any action taken, doesn't mean nothing has been done (this is true of post-game reporting as well).","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2020-01-04T04:42:52.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.
