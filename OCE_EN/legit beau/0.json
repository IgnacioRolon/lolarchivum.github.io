(Not sure if it&#039;s just me) The AP scaling on it is always &#039;0&#039; regardless of current AP. eg. ...heals for 5 (+0).\r\n\r\nHope someone finds it and fixes it.\r\n\r\nThx xx","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-09T08:48:58.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nIt's possible that it's simply the displaying of the current value that is bugged.
