So why not fix this by easily to show your latency (ping) on the home page! my suggestion would be maybe next to the two cogs but i&#039;m not really sure, but it would be lovely to be added in, so that you don&#039;t need to play a game to check is your ping is fine, maybe add it in season 6? i don&#039;t know, i hope you understand what i&#039;m trying to say, and also thank you for your time to read this :) ! - Red Suns","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-08T10:35:31.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I *think* this is coming with the client update (emphasis on \"think\").
