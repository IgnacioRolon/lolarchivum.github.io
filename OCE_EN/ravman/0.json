With the current queue alert, it is easy for the match alert to be drowned out by other things unless they tune up their League volume to exceptionally high levels compared to other games.\n\nEven average players don't want to have to watch their League for 3-4 mins; I'm not saying that it's ok to afk or something like that when in queue but they should at least be able to rely on their ears to hear the alert and be able to look at something else while waiting.\n\nThe disadvantages of implementing a more noticeable alert are minimal, and having a more noticeable alert will be beneficial to a lot of people.","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-08-27T07:53:17.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sole disadvantage would be ruining the aesthetic that Riot has going.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-17T23:25:51.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This. I have to agree. If i am queuing for a match, i make a point to have the volume up if I walk off to get a drink etc so i can hear it, or if i have headset setup, i make a point to do everything else before I start queue.\nMy average Q times are <= 2mins, it really is not that long to wait.

I have to admit instead of being glued to my rig, excitedly watching that timer, that sometimes I get distracted by TV, music, mobile, etc. \nThen, I glance up, to catch that last bit of pie diminishing, frantically grabbing for my mouse... Nooo!!!\n\nFrequently there are one (or more) that don't Accept. With vastly varying wait times, I think that a sound with a higher pitch, like the clink of the champion select screen, or even better; a customizable sound, would make a world of difference to game starts. \n\nFound a clip on YouTube with a 'Match Found' horn sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FCjqXkLJKA\nIt's a bit over-the-top, but certainly attention grabbing... Anyone know how to do this?","replies":[]}]}
