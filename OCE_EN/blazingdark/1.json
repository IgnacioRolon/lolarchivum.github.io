It occurs based on your Honour level (level 2+ has standard drop rates, level 1 has drastically reduced drop rate and level 0 has no drop rate) and whether you're actually playing (as in, you need to play a match to be able to get a Key Fragment, though not necessarily win). The Key Fragments are still given out based on a \"month-by-month\" basis, it's just been changed so the drops are more spread out over the month rather than mostly at the start, as it was previously.\n\nAs long as you meet the requirements, you should randomly receive a notification that you've received a Key Fragment while using the client (though it appears it might be mostly upon starting up the client at the moment).","replies":[]},{"poster":"o02GD4U0o","date":"2017-07-11T02:12:56.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Span*","replies":[]}]}
