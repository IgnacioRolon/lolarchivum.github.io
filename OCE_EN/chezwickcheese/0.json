On many occasions laning against her and with her I have/the enemy has been well out of the range indicator and was still hit. This is obnoxious to lane against and makes for a very frustrating experience that doesn&#039;t reward skill. Does this skill have added splash damage or something?\r\n\r\nThis is also not isolated to Illaoi as other champions have similar issues. Please fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-14T07:08:31.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is and its killing me, quite literally","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-12-14T06:30:20.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a real problem!
