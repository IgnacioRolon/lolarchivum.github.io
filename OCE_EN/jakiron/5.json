League of Legends is an eSport that has caused a lot of tension to it's player base made worse because a lot of players, usually young are not mature enough to handle any undesirable results or circumstances inside the game that are often inflicted by keyboard warriors who see the fact that no harm (in most circumstances) can occur to their real selves due to being protected by an IGN and a computer screen. \n\nThe best way I would suggest to relieve game related stress is to have an outlet such as a miniature zen garden or a stress ball. Believe it or not playing music, relaxing music at that is also a good stress reliever. \n\nKind Regards,\nlols =)","replies":[]}]}
