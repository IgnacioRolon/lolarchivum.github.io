Not sure exactly when it got changed, but some time in the past few months gold and plat players started appearing in my games. I&#039;m unranked, but usually matched with mid bronze.  So it rather craps all over some games when you get all unranked and bronze in the game, except for that sneaky gold 3 guy on the other team who gets his main.\r\nAnd before someone starts whitering on about unranked mmr, I don&#039;t care.  Never had gold and plat in my games before, would rather like to go back to not having them.  I&#039;ll happily wait extra queue time to not get stomped by someone 2 or more divisions higher than me.","replies":[]}
