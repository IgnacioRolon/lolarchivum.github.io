The conversation was comical, proving neither gave a damn about the team other than getting the role they wanted.  So I waited for them to resolve it, having not picked a champ yet.  It got worse, not better.  I didn&#039;t want to play with these two tools, and thus I get punished for not picking a champ.\r\n\r\nScrew you mid players.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t want anything done, just filling in 6 minutes by having a rant.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care if you&#039;re recording, I don&#039;t care if you only play mid, I don&#039;t care if you just bought a new skin, I really don&#039;t care about you at all.  Just accept the call order, it&#039;s crap, but its the only thing we have.","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-08-31T08:23:32.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to another normal day on OCE server\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]}
