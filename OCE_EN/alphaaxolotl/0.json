I rushed levelling to 8 to get flash and teleport and get some flexibility in runes. The next day I logged in and tried selecting flash but it said there was an error.

I don't know if I should keep levelling the account if I'll just keep getting reset back to level 6.\r\n\r\nAnyone know of a potential cause/fix for this?","replies":[{"poster":"xEternalFeederx","date":"2019-11-11T02:28:34.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me today... level 26 down to 22","replies":[]}]}
