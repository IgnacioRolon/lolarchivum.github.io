I could understand if I haven&#039;t even pressed a champion to play, but I&#039;ve selected the champion i WANT to play and all because I&#039;ve switched to facebook or another window im kicked from the lobby and have to wait 15 minutes to play again? \r\n\r\nDO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS ITS ABSURD","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-24T08:56:53.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things like these are designed to ensure you are present for play. Better to have a dodged lobby than have to remake a game, or worse, be unable to remake a 4v5. If you can't be present for the few minutes select takes, how can your team expect you to be present for the whole game?\n\nIt really isn't that hard to remember to lock in, and it also saves time in champ select because your gamemates don't have to wait for your timer to tick down. If you know who you're playing, why not just lock it in?","replies":[]}]}
