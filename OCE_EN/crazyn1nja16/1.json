Great montages weave the music into the gameplay.\n\nAn example of this is timing the build up to a one-shot with a crescendo, with the instant the one-shot happens in time with the downbeat as the crescendo hits its peak. You should try to have \"impact\" motions in the clips also be in time with down beats too. Things like Riven landing a jump, or an Eve stealing Baron, or an Annie Flash-R.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are other points as well, such as the major differences in zoom or quality, but musical timing *really* stands out.\n\nOh, and get rid of that dramatic colour filter. Like wacky transitions, this should be used sparingly.","replies":[]}]}
