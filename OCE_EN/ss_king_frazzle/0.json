The incentive would be to dodge games untill you have;\n\n1. Your main champion and role.\n2. The most OP champions on your team.\n3. The weakest champions possible on the enemy team.\n\nBasically no one would get into game ever. So they must have some decently serious punishment, to avoid players dodging for toxic reasons; \"Oh he lost lane last game\" or \"WTF Jayce isn't even a good pick ATM\".\n\nOf course dodging to avoid trolls is necessary in some cases, but they are few and far between. Just keep playing games, and you should keep winning slowly! Remember not to take it too seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-10-04T23:02:04.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this. The system is fine as it is if you're only dodging every now and then when you have people actually trolling. I think adding the option to report people in champ select would be beneficial but they shouldn't remove the penalty for the guy who actually dodges.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlQaeda Zilean","date":"2015-10-04T15:17:15.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about you dont loose lp but have a 5 min timer that goes to 10 if you dodge again\nthen 20 then 30 ect\nbecause when someone says mid or feed then feeds anyways is just a pain","replies":[]}]}]}
