I'm an Irelia main, played close to 1000 solo queue games last season and one issue that i've noticed when playing on my desktop over these games  is the amount of time it takes for me to cast my q. I only have 34 ping generally and the reason why i know it's slow is because at an internet cafe i go to, where i have 32 ping, the cast time on my abilities is infinitely smoother and more responsive than what i experience at home. Does this 2 ping make all the difference or is it my computer, and if it is the latter, what component of my computer is causing this to be the case?","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-12T11:56:41.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could it be your keyboard?
