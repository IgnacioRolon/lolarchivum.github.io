He teleports to where he was 4 seconds ago and deals --- magic damage to nearby enemies on arrival. Additionally, Ekko heals for ---, increased by ---% for each 1% of his health lost over the last 4 seconds. **If enemy champions are inside and get hit by his chronobreak their resistances after impact get decreased by 3/4/5% for 2 seconds.** \n\nsomething like that\n\nI know he is getting some love next patch and it seems biased since i main him and I'm not complaining about him, but honestly i would give this a shot to see how it goes. I've been thinking about it.. maybe its abit much and over tuned or whatever but in a way it would be nice to give him that bonus for providing a good ult on the enemy and if Ekko uses it to escape situations you don't get it of course its basically normal thats if no-ones in it. \n\nshare thoughts below!","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-04-29T08:12:37.589+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"that honestly just feels like the least impactful thing they could give him. \nHow about instead, reduce the Magic damage Ap ratio on his ult by 40% and the base damage by 100, but have his ult zone proc his passive on targets if they have at least 1 stack of his passive.

I 100% agree i think it should proc with atleast 1 stack aswell, it will give the ult the burst it needs.. squishes would be short work like always but better and easier and it can really change a fight for Ekko's team. its like take the risk and it might pay off vibe. \n\ni understand there has to be a negative to good change bc of OPness.. \n\nthe base damage is currently 150/300/450 at max\n\nso ult would be 50/200/350 \n\nand ap ratio at the moment is 150% so it would be 110%.","replies":[]}]}]}
