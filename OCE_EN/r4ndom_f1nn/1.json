Only a couple champs stand a chance against him solo and the only way for others is to be babysit in lane 24/7. His wr is too good for a champ people are just trying out. I personally don't know how to nerf him, maybe his passive needs to deal less damage or his magic penetration from E should be smaller?","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-06-16T12:42:58.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say to nerf his multi-hit damage on Q and that will be enough. The strongest part about him is his ability to trade behind minions without much effort or retaliation. However, there are some champions that completely nullify morde in lane such as fiora and vlad. I think his winrate moreso has to do with people not understanding how to play against him than it is that hes op. Dodge E, use minions to reduce his Q damage, keep and eye on his W bar. Simple enough.","replies":[]}]}
