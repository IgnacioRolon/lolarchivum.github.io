You will be rushing either one of these items most of the time: {{item:3508}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3153}}. Essence Reaver rush for caster adc who can make use of the 20% crit it gives like Lucian who will auto attack between skills (double shot passive). Infinity edge for auto attack dependent adc. Blade of ruined king if you are playing Kog'maw or Vayne although it would probably be better to rush Infinity edge now on vayne. \n \nafter one of the 3 items above you will want to get a {{item:3046}} or {{item:3087}} or a{{item:3085}} depending on which one you need more but honestly it doesn't matter which one you get because they give the same stats and the only difference is the passive. I would say Phantom Dancer for 1v1, Shiv for waveclear or splitpush and runaan's hurricane for teamfight. \n\nAfter that get your shoe either {{item:3006}} {{item:3158}} again depends on what adc you playing.

I haven't tested it yet though. The cull is a good item if u can achieve 100 cs in 10 min and rush at 10. What's the difference between statik shiv and the other energizing weapon that gives one auto attack extra range? BTW with the heal on crit mastery and silver bolt prpcs should I get runans as well as lots of crits? Is youloos worth on vayne anymore?\n\nMy old vayne build was botrk, statik shiv, youloos, seekers, last whisperer, and some defensive item. Does this build work anymore? Also when is previous wounds really good? Against fioras?\n\n Also I've been thinking. Vaynes only problem with early game dueling is that she has no health. I believe it's less than 500 at the start. Vayne can win early duels with her w proc, so what if I started something like dorans shield or the Ruby crystal thing that gives you 150 health?","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-13T22:59:09.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get cull if it's an easy lane like you have a heal and they don't have poke or hard engage or whatever, otherwise dorans blade.\n\nLifesteal and attack speed and ms boost/drain helps that early game trading power immensely and is farmable in split items which helps too.\n\nBe wary, the cull is stronger early than dorans. In some situations though you wont want to risk losing lane even if they don't have a strong lane against you and just because cull adds early power (through the sustain being much better than dorans) doesnt mean it cant scale off quick and be risky (because dorans gives more base AD) so all in all you have to choose wisely, since early game power can vary in lane and the strength of the sustain boost from cull isn't always as good as missing out on some AD for that form of early power and sometimes its better to have some more base AD so it's easier to farm and your harass/trading is slightly better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Burger Turtler","date":"2015-11-12T05:40:12.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For Vayne, I tried this build.
