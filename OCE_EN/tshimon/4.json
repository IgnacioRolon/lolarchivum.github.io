PLZ FIX ASAP","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a Kalista main and I dont know if anyone has notice but im pretty sure a lot of people should know this because this bug has always been there ever since they reworked his passive. If you hold shift on kalista or use &quot;a&quot; to use your aa while using your passive, it makes your passive very clunky and makes her auto attacks very slow. Plz FIX THIS!","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-28T11:03:11.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No idea if its a bug or intended as I don't play Kalista much. Anyway, check [over on this board](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report), and check if it has been described. If not, feel free to add it to the list :D\n\nRemember to [adhere to the proper protocol](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) when doing so ♥","replies":[]}]}
