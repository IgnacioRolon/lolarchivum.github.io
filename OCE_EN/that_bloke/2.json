Upon my return i completed my 10 ranked placement matches, that went something like this:\r\n\r\n3w - 7L\r\n\r\nhowever, my games became increasingly difficult and after checking some profiles i realised i was being put against and with plat players consistently. i was then placed in silver 2. my first silver 2 game i was in a game full of plats and gold 3-1....\r\n\r\nhow after being placed in silver 2 is my ELO still at gold/plat? please explain.","replies":[]}
