How is there no way to resolve this?\r\n\r\n I can&#039;t imagine how new players must feel jumping into these games that they can likely not carry themselves when all 4 of their team mates are suiciding mid over and over or just afking in random locations because their shoddy scripting screws up.\r\n\r\n I hear Dominion on other servers is just as bad. Wonder how ARAM is fairing with this, I don&#039;t play those modes but I know Dominion has a huge reputation for being botter heavy.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-25T19:46:13.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is that they ban 1 and these players just make 10 more","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-25T19:41:30.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"happens in aram from levels 1-29 all the time just report them and they will be banned permanently.\nP.S.
