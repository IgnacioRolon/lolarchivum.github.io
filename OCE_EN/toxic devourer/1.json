This can't be intentional...","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I was messing around in some normals on Quinn and discovered that even though Garens Q(which is an auto attack enhancer) would still silence you if he hit you while blind, even though it dealt no damage(so obviously didnt hit...).\n\n\n I have to wonder how many other similar auto-reset skills are effected by this.\n\n How do I report this?","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-10-18T14:11:35.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Working as intended. Ability modifiers like Nasus's Q, Yasuo's Q and Jax's W will be applied, but not the auto attack. Literally all blind is is an ability causing Basic Attacks to miss, not the effects alongside the Basic attacks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-10-17T20:12:19.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's always been like this. I think it's something to do with attack modifiers technically having a portion that is classed as a spell. I'm not sure about Jax's W - but I think it applies the W damage portion but not the auto and I know for a fact Irelia can still apply the True Damage portion of her W active while blinded.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-18T00:45:04.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ It's basically this. His Q is classed as a spell so only the auto damage will be negated, the silence is a spell element so won't be negated. Unless Garen's Q does magic dmg (which it might I actually don't know, but let's assume for a moment it's physical damage) it will be the opposite with a (Morg/Maw) spell shield, it will block the silence but not the damage.\n\nIt pretty much comes down to the fact that any form of cc is considered a spell effect and therefore will be blocked by a damage based spell shield but not by blind regardless of source.\n\nNoc's/Sivir's spell shields works differently ofc though in that they just block the next ability regardless of damage type but there has to be a spell component or the shield won't trigger (Quinn's Q/TF Stun etc).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-17T20:00:01.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would create a custom game, have your friend play teemo and blind yours garen then Q him to get solid proof to show them, then put it on youtbe or whatever and send them a support ticket with it, and also post it here with [BUG REPORT] in the title to get their attention.\n\nAn example of when i report a bug:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/RxcNLGEA-bug-report-kindred-bug\n\nalso i seem to recall this happening to me playing TF, i stunned someone even while blinded, you might like to test that as well.","replies":[]}]}
