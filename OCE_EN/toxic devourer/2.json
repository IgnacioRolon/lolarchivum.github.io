I love this game but I LOATHE the playerbase...","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was as high as Gold1 this season but unfortunately repeatedly failed promos to Plat before tilting down to the bottom of silver... I regularly take the time out to teach new players)especially ones I find in bot games) everything from builds to runes/masteries/basics...\n\n The thing is though, when I go into ranked I don&#039;t expect to have to teach these players these basic things too... People who main X champion but don&#039;t even know what their core items are or how to lane. People with 0 map awareness. Players who end a game with 0 wards placed despite having a free ward trinket(this happens way to often, you should check the post game stats -_- ).\n\n It&#039;s honestly gotten to the point where the first dumb mistake in a game and I just cannot be bothered with that match and want to leave and hope for a better team. Sometimes despite this I still push on and in many cases carrying 4 heavy players on my back but then, in one stupid catch the entire leads thrown down the toilet and the other 4 players are left wondering why I cannot be bothered defending after they jsut cost us baron and multiple towers by making stupid mistakes.\n\n The sad thing is I really like this game and right now there isn&#039;t anything outside of betas that I really am interested in so I am stuck, playing a game I am clearly addicted to with a playerbase I despise. In truth I think a large part of what nags at me is the average age as a 30 year old, it&#039;s hard to tolerate too much immaturity but this game attracts the young in droves.\n\n I just dunno what to do anymore... Two accounts are on temp bans in the last 24 hours because my tempers so short at the moment, just going for a walk doesnt help not does taking a break. I was so excited about season 6&#039;s changes but I know the truth is it will just be more of the same unless I just stick to premades only with people who I can tolerate and know at least have their basics down.\n\n Just last night I was jungling in low silver and my entire team weren't happy with my pick so 2 of them took smite(I was karthus and my match history had proven I was winning games with it at that elo), but alas and once we load in they are spamming All abusing me and asking to report me. Sad part is after a few free kills I ended up carrying them so hard even the enemy said as much as we took their base. But this is the kind of shit you see far too often.","replies":[{"poster":"Dream","date":"2015-11-11T06:10:10.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should stop expecting your team to be good  and make use of the mute/dodge function LP isn't really important MMR is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2015-11-10T04:04:44.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the community is pretty bad and people do play Ranked without Runes...in Bronze. If it helps, find another game and then come back to LoL after a few months. I always do that and the game becomes more interesting for me.
