Hell they can do it over a period of weeks, doesn&#039;t fucking matter but you say one mean word AND HOLY SH$% prepare your anus for the ban hammer!\r\n\r\n When did the internet become a place where people expect a fucking safe space where they get told they are great and never make mistakes while being rewarded with medals for trying... Such a joke and it only makes the community worse.\r\n\r\n The term toxic is so fucking overused now thanks to Riot, can&#039;t go one game without someone bitching about a team mate and crying TOXIC TOXIC TOXIC! SOMEONE IS SAYING MEAN WORDS!\r\n\r\n After so many years playing and hundreds of dollars and hours... I think I&#039;m almost at quitting point because I can barely handle how BS this games community has become. Mute button? Whats that? WHY EVEN HAVE A FKN MUTE BUTTON IF WE DONT EXPECT PEOPLE TO USE IT? JESUS CHRIST! Might as well just remove the damn thing at this point with how we treat the playerbase.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-27T13:52:02.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry are you bronze? because like I only hear bronze and low silver cry about toxic Summoners I just gave up caring about toxic Summoners I meet them, I report them, I never see em again.","replies":[{"poster":"ScrubCloud","date":"2015-11-29T11:55:23.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but you're low silver","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-29T12:03:54.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I'm low silver 5 0lp. but like I said in my comment \"I just gave up caring about toxic Summoners I meet them, I report them, I never see em again.\"","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-26T13:44:06.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um what is mute plz explain","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-26T22:24:04.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Muting has zero to do with it...\nDeal with the bloody issue at hand....\nNeed a nappy....\nWow.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-26T22:23:27.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bwahahha your post will be removed because they cant handle the truth...\nI mean 8 months ago this started its even pinned the person you employed to clean up this mess fire them and anybody that has agreed with his methods tbh....\nAnd start banning them its very simple you make a ban wave go through and players will change its that simple......\nOh wouldn't want to hurt the bottom line now would we...\nMan up....take the juice and fix the trolling and feeding as well...","replies":[]}]}
