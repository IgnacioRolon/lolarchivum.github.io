What do I get? I&#039;m Gold 4 at the moment working my way through gold.\r\n\r\nTheir team:\r\n 3 games in a row with 1-2 platinums and 0 silvers on theirs. with mid to high golds. and 100ish MMR leads according to OP.GG\r\n\r\nOur team:\r\n2+ silvers with gold 5-4s. I managed to get a plat or two with no more than 1 per game.\r\n\r\n What happened? Well last game for example my silver Jinx had to lane against a platinum vayne. Guess how that ended... These two players cannot even duo together because Riot thinks the skill gap is too high BUT THEY CAN LANE AGAINST EACH OTHER IN RANKED! How does this even make any sense?\r\n\r\n The last 3 games have been one sided stomps wasting both teams time with almost certain outcomes, how can you even be happy with the system in a state like this?\r\n\r\n Bronzes can fight golds, Silvers can lane against plats... Golds can lane against Diamonds? Why is this allowed to happen? I want to progress through my elo but I have to deal with the next tier too? Oh you wanna progress through bronze, go play silvers and golds.\r\n\r\n End rant. Decent game but ranked is such a shitty experience way too often solely because Riots matchmaking is brainless as hell, not taking into account performance or even balancing the teams as 10 man, instead it builds a team of 5 players and then matches you against another group of 5 instead of finding 10 players and balancing like a half decent system would.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-23T07:05:34.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no point playing ranked its full of trolls and afk's I don't see the point in it for what a gold boarder around your champ in the load screen that's worth dealing with the trolls and afk's","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-23T12:21:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Git gud and you might find it worthit","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-23T12:53:47.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"so what your saying is if your good you will like afk's and trolls it makes sense il work on that","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-23T14:22:00.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, if you were good you wouldn't BE in bronze where all the trolls and afks are.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-23T01:48:21.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Two things to note.\n\nOCE is a small server so while the system does try to find balanced matches it doesn't always have the luxury of a massive player pool. \n\nYou noted frustration at being placed with higher ranked players. Higher ranked =/= Higher skill, it simply means that the player grinded the ladder harder. For the system to place platinum players against silvers the platinum player must  be performing really badly while the silver player is performing consistently well. In fact I would feel bad for that platinum player because they are close to being demoted.","replies":[{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-09-23T12:29:39.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even a poorly performing Plat is still entire divisions above the silver player, IN NO REALITY should they meat in ranked. There is no way that the lower and most populated elos are so short on players that they need to fill out games with divisions above them.","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-23T23:43:36.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not that the there is a shortage of lower ELO players but that silver player has won enough games in a row for the system to recognize their skill and placed them against higher skill opponents.  Sometimes you just get of a lucky win streak and this happens. \n\nWhat you need to understand is Division Rank =/= MMR/ELO ranking. The system uses increased or decreased LP gains to move people from their current division rank to their hidden MMR/Elo ranking. \n\nIf the system is giving out higher LP gains there must be higher risk to those players. On the flip side if lower LP losses are being given lower risk of a loss should occur.\n\nYou were on the high risk/high reward team while the opposing team was on a low risk/low reward team. Yes it might seem stacked both all players likely had a mid gold skill rating.","replies":[{"poster":"TOXIC Devourer","date":"2015-09-29T06:35:35.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think you understand how the matchmaking seems to operate, just because you are matched against a team doesn't mean that you are at the same skill, the less players in queue the wider the search parameters and since the matchmaking for this game is done as a 5 man team finding another 5 man team this can lead to large disparities.\n\n Ideally matchmaking would find 10 players and then divide them among 2 balanced teams but that would take some brain power... This system exists in other games not sure why Riot uses such a backwards system though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2015-09-23T09:58:03.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is exactly why I'm Bronze.","replies":[]}]}
