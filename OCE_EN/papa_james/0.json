The overall questions is a yes or no question cause of the second part, which Is a qualifier. \"Why did that man die\" by itself can not be answered with a yes or no. Adding a was question doesn't change that fact. Because in reality your not answering the \"Why did that man die\" part your answering the \"was it because he was old\"part\n\nAnd you can answer \"Was it because he was old\" with a yes or no. Without the first question it may be the wrong answer but it's still a valid answer. Whereas for the why question a yes or no question makes no sense. That's the difference between an open question and a closed question.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-24T06:52:32.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The point still stands the question is only made answerable because it has a why in it.\n\nI don't care if it sounds or reads wrong to you, you can go look this up.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-04-25T00:47:49.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not true. You can totally answer \"Was it because he was old\" by Itself. You'd use the context of the rest of the discussion. But either way you can answer that question with a yes or no. \n\nYou can't answer \"Why did he die\" with a yes or no. That's not how questions work. As a whole \"Why did that man die, was it because he was old\" is answersable with a yes or no. But only because your essentially  providing the answer to your own question. \n\n\"Which way did he go?\" \"South\"\n\"Which way did he go, was it south\" \"Yes\". \n\nIt only becomes a yes or no question when you provide a potential answer that can be confirmed or denied. That doesn't make the first question a yes or no question. \n\nA single why question by itself with no qualifying statements or potential answers provided can not be answered with a yes or a no.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-25T00:59:44.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Its still a simple fact that the question has an answer of yes and no, without the context given by the why there would be no viable answer. Full stop. End of it, I'm sick of your shit Larry.\n\nI really don't give a damn about what you believe I am simply stating, that is correct to say that is a yes or no question, i don't give a damn what you think, put 5 min of research into it instead of complaining then drop it, its not hard.\n\nYou're acting like a spoilt 8 yearold who has to always be right, I don't give a damn about what you think it right or not, I'm just stating what is right, I am not saying I'm agreeing with one side, or the other, I am saying that that is a technically correct question no matter what god damn way you look at it, whatever you say, whatever you do, the point still stands, it is correct.

Try having a discussion instead of just yelling your position. I'm not acting like a spoilt 8 year old, you are. You state your position without any explanation and then tell me not to state my position can you get any more hypocritical. \n\nThe point has never been about whether or not it's a technically correct question. Of course it is, but that doesn't change the fact you can't answer an open ended question with a yes or no. And why questions are by default open ended question. If you add a second question, it's no longer just a why question.\n\nIf he said instead \"Why is league of legends popular, is it because of x\". It would be fine. That doesn't mean you can answer the why question with a yes or no.
