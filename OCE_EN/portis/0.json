I don&#039;t want to play out losses, ty.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-21T15:06:54.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> I stood on the platform moving around\n\nLeaver Buster doesn't just punish people that are literally afk or disconnected. People that are not participating in the match by *idling* like this will be punished as well. If you do not want to play the match to completion then you vote for a surrender; if the surrender vote isn't successful then you are obligated to play out the rest. If you don't want to play the match then you'll have to deal with the low priority queue when you abandon the teammates that want to continue the game. It *is* possible to win 4v5's.\n\nRead more about Leaver Buster here; https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ","replies":[{"poster":"Portis","date":"2016-02-22T03:56:16.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I see, ty. \n\nOne of the points I was making is that I'm happy to play out 4v5s but it became a 3v5 since our jungler essentially started trolling. I don't care what's in the rules it's dumb to force someone to play out that kind of a game. Don't expect players to play out games that are clear losses\n\nIt seems they never revert LeaverBusters on accounts from what I read, I don't know if that's due to Riot's famously bad coding or if they honestly don't think anyone should have it reverted, either way that in itself is far more toxic for the community than people opening lanes for quicker games.","replies":[]}]}]}
