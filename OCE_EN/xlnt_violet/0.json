I thought the magic resist shred and magic pen would go well together but a guy on Reddit said that Wits End would make the magic pen from Rageblade useless. I am a {{champion:96}}  main and i&#039;d like some clarity please. I think these 2 items shredding magic resist would be perfect for him. I have been building    {{item:3091}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3153}}  in this order with boots fitted in when best needed. The damage output seems to be great so far but that could just be Kog&#039;Maw doing Kog&#039;Maw things...","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-11-21T04:40:13.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wits end reduces Mr and then rage blade ignores % Mr. Basically wits end works against rage blade now since you'd want to first ignore a % of Mr then reduce the Mr by a flat amount.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XLNT Violet","date":"2018-11-21T01:59:58.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just did a quick test in practice tool and with {{item:3091}} {{item:3124}} i ramped up to about 1380 dps. I then tested with {{item:3153}} {{item:3124}}  and i ramped up to about 1470 dps. Not much difference in dps but i found that Wits End and Rageblade ramped up a bit faster than Botrk and Rageblade. So i think Wits End and Rageblade can deal damage faster in shorter time span but Botrk can deal more damage eventually. Plus the active and lifesteal gives it an advantage.  I guess it's situational","replies":[]}]}
