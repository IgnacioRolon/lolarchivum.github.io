Yes there are trolls and AFKs in ranked, but if you play a large number of games (large sample size), an equal number will get matched into the enemy teams.\n\nYou have to be careful though that you're not the one causing the AFKs and trolls. If you flame your teammates there's a higher chance they'll choose to afk or troll and in cases like that it would be partly your fault. Even though they are in the wrong, if you had not flamed, they would not have afked or trolled and in turn disadvantaged the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasochistSupMain","date":"2018-12-03T05:48:02.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same.
