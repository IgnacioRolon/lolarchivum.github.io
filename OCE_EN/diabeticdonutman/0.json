Riot doesn't give out 7 month bans so something really weird could be going on.\n\nBut as a number one priority you should get in touch with Riot Support [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Use the category _\"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\"_ and fill out all your information. They should be able to sort everything else from there :D","replies":[{"poster":"DiabeticDonutman","date":"2017-10-07T02:34:48.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks heaps man","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pedojuice","date":"2017-06-11T07:04:49.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"send them a support ticket and talk to rito about it","replies":[{"poster":"DiabeticDonutman","date":"2017-10-07T02:34:28.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers will do","replies":[]}]}]}
