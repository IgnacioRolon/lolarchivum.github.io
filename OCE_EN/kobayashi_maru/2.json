Unfortunately I burned myself out on support awhile back and so picking it as secondary and playing it every game is not attractive.\r\n\r\nWhat are the second and third least popular roles. Currently thinking that the order goes something like mid&gt;top/jungle&gt;adc&gt;sup. Did a bit of googling but found nothing definitive.\r\n\r\nProbably not an ideal way of choosing a role but its that or give Dota2 a go.","replies":[{"poster":"PubgamerAU","date":"2016-04-03T14:44:34.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"30-40 min queues? Wtf. I queue mid/top and get into games in 4-7 minutes.

You build relationships, can learn to fit with each others play styles, have A+ communication and avoid toxins like feeders/afks/general potatoes. With all of the incentives being thrown at you such as, increased IP, mastery points and hex tech stuff, there is literally nothing to lose ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-03T09:58:04.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not so easy to just find people to play with, playing with, ehh by myself is just easier. I sometimes play around evening time, sometimes morning, other times after midnight.

I have a maxed out friends list, with at least 30 players on and ready to play at any hour of the day. This is also helped by the number of chatrooms i'm in (Looking for group, noob, gameplay & strategy, + a bunch of personal ones). \n\nYou can start by growing your own friends list. \n\n* Put an add up in [team recruitment](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment) for silver players\n* Max out the [clubs](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/clubs) you can join\n* Add nice players after a game\n* Hang out in the in-client chatrooms\n* Join some of the groups on facebook\n\nFor scheduling ranked games with some mates, I would suggest using[ doodle](http://doodle.com/).","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-04-03T13:04:38.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I DO have friends on my friends list. The problem is that they come off my friends list faster than I put them on there.\n\nI get one good game with someone, add them as a friend, play another game, take them off.\n\nIt is the same scenario over and over and over for me. Someone has ONE good game and that is it, after that their true colours show and I see how bad they really are. I even got to the point I had one of my 'friends' tell me \"I'm sorry I am worse than you, I am only Bronze\". NEWS FLASH - I was only Bronze at the time also. He went something like 0/8 early in bot whilst I was 1/0 top, yet we were the same rank.\n\nIt is a hit and miss adding friends because they just need that one good game for others to think they are any decent. In fact, this whole game is a hit and miss with how Matchmaking works.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Kobayashi Maru","date":"2016-04-03T09:58:53.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"May have to try adc/jgl.
