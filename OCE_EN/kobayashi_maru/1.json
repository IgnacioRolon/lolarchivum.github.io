It looks like this player might just be bad/new/trying to figure out the game on their own.

He's definitely been doing it a lot and what I meant was from the match history itself it just looks like they are a bad player. This was a observation based on match history only.

If they consistently are negative or go against assigned roles AND they are reported then they will be banned. But I don't think choosing to build a certain way is enough to get reported.

How about 'got multiple BF (3-4 per game) over dozens and dozens of games and ignored role (had support demanded top) and trolled all team mates in champ select while laughing at their attempts to reason with them. Not so pithy but it contains more than a grain of truth.\n\nThis BS short description makes out that hes only done this once and he didn't steal someones role.","replies":[]}]}
