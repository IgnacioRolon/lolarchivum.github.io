I read that the way the system works, is that it places ppl in groups. If one person drops out then that group is re introduced as a group.the result is that there ends up being far more groups than solo in the queue and the system can't cope.\n\nWhile this may be a rumor, I have noticed that if I make it into champ select again after someone misses a ban I seem to have the exact same players on my team.\n\nI actually used to main support but am burned out on it.","replies":[{"poster":"SailMad","date":"2016-02-28T05:25:17.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kobaya, \n\nI'm getting 75 minute queue times.
