The botting problem has been getting progressively worse and needs to be fixed.\n\nWhilst you're right about low queue numbers exacerbating the symptoms, don't ignore the underlying disease; players are well within their rights to quit if their favourite queue or game mode is being compromised (I assume this is either TT, Coop vs Ai or pre30 normals, ARAM gets this too from time to time but with Bilgewater event you probably won't see many atm).\n\nAlso if people are quitting the game, won't that mean less people will be buying fresh accounts, which means botted accounts lose their value, which would reduce the incidence of botting? See how that logic works?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-06-04T05:52:37.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In no post ever, including this one, have I ever belittled the botting issue. \nI am just as aware as everyone else of the problem. I never said I shouldn't be fixed.\n\nI was simply highlighting that there are ways to tackle the problem.\n_\"This game is shit, everyone just leave cos!\"_ is not the right one.\n\nAll this kind of thing does is normalise the issue, to the point where no one can be bothered listening _(boy who cried wolf)_.\nRiot, the community, _(or any other body)_ are more likely to listen to several in-depth posts backed up with facts, as suggested courses of action. Than they are to listen to 100 posts a week saying nothing else but _\"This game is shit.\"_\n\nBecause _\"This game is shit.\"_ Doesn't provide ANY helpful information at all. To either the community, or Riot.\n\n______________\n\nSpend two weeks cataloging every suspected bot in all your games. View their profiles, make notes of how many games each one plays. The frequency you come across them, the average number of games they play per day. Do some calculations, make some graphs. \nThen come back here, with solid facts and predictions, and make your point. it'll make a hell of a lot more of an impact to everyone, both the community and Riot, than _\"This game is shit!\"_\n\n\n_______________\n\n**Think of it like champ balancing. What is more likely to make Riot listen:\n**\n\n_\"I believe Viktor has a lot of underlying power in comparison with other mages, he has a Shield/Slow/Stun/Interrupt/MS speed boost as well as the same amount of burst damage as mages who don't have all that extra kit. Take Ziggs for example.  Ziggs' Q has a base damage of 225 at lvl 18, and an AP scaling of 65%.  So with 500 AP Ziggs' Q will do damage equal to 550. Viktor's Q has a base scaling of 140 per part. The first part has an AP scaling of 40%, while the second has a scaling of 50%. Which brings his total damage to: 140 + 140 + 200 + 250 = 730. So Zigg's Q does 550 damage. and has no additional effects. While Viktor's Q does 730 damage (this is without including his 100% AD scaling), plus gives him large shield and movement speed boost. Both Q's have the same cool down. Therefore I think Viktor may need a slight numbers adjustment.\"_\n\n**Or**\n\n_\"VIKTOR OP!\"_\n\nI for one find the first argument much more compelling.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2018-06-05T11:55:39.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've played for 4 years, and i'm yet to play against a scripter/hacker, but trust me buddy, the bots were WAY WAY WAY worse 2-3 years ago. There was endless bots in ARAM during quiet hours such as 4-6am etc. Literally every game had atleast 1-2 bots, I remember being the only human player in my team, against a team with only 1 human too, it was crazy. Point is, there has ALWAYS been a bot problem and there will continue to be one for a while. Riot is clearly trying their best to remove and invalidate bot programs as often as possible, sometimes they do seep into our games and it is annoying, but just keep reporting them ^O^\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-06-04T05:53:00.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its funny because most of his games have no bots and it's mainly his fault\nin one of his games he played with my friend","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-06-04T01:21:45.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How many times do you want to post this\n\nIts not gonna change... so GTFO boards and just play another game","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurstFire304","date":"2018-06-04T00:57:15.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think league is one of the best games at preventing cheating. ive only encountered like 4 or 5 cheats in 5 years and 10 000 games. hes probably just better than you","replies":[]}]}
