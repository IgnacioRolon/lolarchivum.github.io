I have been by friends to switch them out but i'm unsure if this would be a good move for some of those games when you need a little more exp to keep up with your team.\r\nCould people please share their thoughts so i know before the rune sale end tomorrow.\r\nThank you for reading this.","replies":[{"poster":"ausrhino3","date":"2015-01-27T06:11:34.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you to everyone that has made a suggestion it has made making the decision much easier.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-01-26T22:58:06.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"WAIT THERES EXP QUINTS?!?!?!?","replies":[]},{"poster":"daveeyx","date":"2015-01-26T07:12:43.355+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think move speed quints are seriously underrated if used on the right champ (think Sona/Sora), not only for getting around the jungle but also for team fight positioning or simply getting away when getting chased... I used to run move speed quints on certain jungles as well. That being said, it definitely depends on the support as a lot of people have mentioned. Tanky supports (Thresh, Leo) would be better off with a defensive setup.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-26T06:55:02.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"some supports can make good use of xp quints, those are usually ones with good per lvl scaling. but overall, defensive or AP quints are best.\n\nbut hey, runes are all personal choice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-26T04:29:49.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is the first i've ever heard of anyone using XP runes... you can just put 2 points into the \"Inspiration\" mastery and keep up in XP fairly well (usually only 1 level behind instead of 2).\n\nMost tanky supports (Leona/Thresh/Braum etc) run Armour quints and the AP supports run AP quints.\n\nSome people on occasional like the gold generation runes, but I don't like them.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-26T05:23:31.410+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with what Barry says. I run AP quints on Karma, armour quints on Leona and a combination on Soraka.\nI would probably go with movespeed if I had to pick between the two, as the bonus movespeed helps for a lot of supports in landing CC and doing some harass. Also, the extra movespeed means that you can easily go a little bit more time without buying boots without it becoming too much of a burden.","replies":[]}]}]}
