I haven&#039;t played flex much in the past, but I always carry in solo duo, and I have great mechanics and game knowledge. I feel that adding in flex mechanics wouldnt be too hard. my ign is SaxophoneGod12, and im currently a bronze 1 smurf. I have been up to silver 2 but I gave that account away to a friend. Again, if you need a mid laner, hit me up.","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-05-10T05:24:00.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"This is oce forums silleh.","replies":[]}]}
