Anyway the nerfs looks really minor to me especially when dead's man plate is now an item and he builds black cleaver anyway. Garen is still going to be fast even with his Q nerfed and if you get a youmuu's ghostblade no one can win a race with you except maybe Yi","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-03T12:17:05.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually the ult was not nerfed, just written in a way that will allow people with no maths skills to be able to calculate the damage easier.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-01T15:08:02.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is OP yes, completely OP, maybe not. While I have played him a lot recently, and can say he is very strong, build him wrong and you lose. Or just have a fail team and who cares how strong he is. Yes he is a nightmare in top lane, but you just need to play smart, farm safe and don't give any free kills.\n\nThat being said, if you sit under your tower all day you can't really farm against a smart Garen and once he starts whacking you with his Q, it hurts and a dash > Q > R combo, game over if you are low health.\n\nIn normals you can pretty much expect him to be top most of the time, pick Gnar or someone ranged who has an escape or a Vayne who has some good CC, he chases, you knock him away. If he can't catch you, he can't hurt you.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-01T17:42:52.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"garen is ezy to beat just go for a ranged champ like you sed or {{champion:266}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:31}} {{champion:41}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:24}} {{champion:75}} {{champion:421}} {{champion:33}} {{champion:57}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:8}} {{champion:62}} {{champion:83}} {{champion:62}}  or by far my fav pick {{champion:86}} you ever seen dis shit so funny lol","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-02T11:54:07.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know than if it is just the crap Bronze/Silver players, but I've lost Top lane as Garen a total of, none.\n\nJax is probably one of the easiest to counter with Garen, but when I look at your list all I see is how easy they are to beat with Garen.\n\nAgain, it could just be how terrible the players are I play against because Garen is a one trick pony and if you can't beat him, well.\n\nI always say though, if you can play a champion really well, you can also counter them really well since you know everything about them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-01T01:29:24.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play Darius lol.
