In the end i know i went 1/23/5 but is that really a purpose int? I can vouge i had a bad game every has a bad game but getting a 14 day ban for this 1st offense for purpose inting apparently i know i can be a little toxic from time to time in retaliation to people playing badly but this event made me realize i had just had a bad game and got flamed hard out of and report because of it so i understand the pains of a bad game and regret my past reports for having bad games but honestly how would a 1/23/5 game with unjustified times of apparent inting be seen as an instant 14 day ban no don't do it again otherwise you'll get banned flat 14 day ban for unjustified terms.\r\nHope i can get some insight and support on this situation as the riot employees where no help yours truly\r\n{{champion:202}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-17T02:33:52.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system that punishes for gameplay generally errs on the side of not risking false positives. In other words, if the system has triggered for inting, there is no or only a smidgeon of doubt that there was intentional feeding occurring in that game.\n\nThat's not to say that false positives don't happen, because no system is perfect, but they are very rare.\n\nAs for the game in question, this is purely personal observations from looking at the match history. Getting 23 deaths isn't *impossible* without intent feeding, especially with an assassin on the enemy team (arguably 2 if you count Kai'sa), but having 22 CS over a 35 min game, when your *melee* support managed 76 is more than a little suspect. Even if he was stealing CS (which to any serious degree would be pointless with the support item) that is an extremely low value.\n\nRegardless, player support is the means to appeal your punishment. If you feel your concerns were not adequately addressed you can respond to the ticket. If you want proper community review, then you will have to post your full reform card and your full tickets. We have limited pieces of a whole puzzle here.","replies":[{"poster":"Jhin 4 life","date":"2019-12-17T20:28:12.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah my support and mid laner where toxic and bullied me during champ select and for the first 5 minutes of game my support pre much killed me and said good riddance and that got me so i screwed up but is that really enough to warrant a ban for a mentally ill person to get bullied and snap in return? i was in a party with the top laner and apologized to the sej after the game as what i did wasn't right i know that but i don't really deserve the 14 day ban.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2019-12-17T05:14:01.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how did you even get 23 deaths?\n\neven if I play first time champion in ranked against grandmaster smurf, I wont get over 20 deaths.","replies":[{"poster":"Jhin 4 life","date":"2019-12-17T20:25:46.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"had a mental breakdown to be fair had 2 toxic players that got me hard so yeah that happened.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mon Chan","date":"2019-12-17T00:56:03.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm... Kind of confused, if your title is \"Apparent Inting\" and then you only justify 3 deaths followed by you stating that you had 23 deaths...  Even if they didn't state other times of \"Inting\" you still inherently did. If you were being toxic on top of this supposed \"Inting\" then all the more reason for the ban.
