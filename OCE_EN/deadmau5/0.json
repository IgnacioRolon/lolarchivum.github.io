Of course there should be an option to turn the music on and off, but I feel as though it would add to the competitive but also artistic/fun side that is League.\r\n\r\nSide note: Each champion should have a few songs so it doesn&#039;t get repetitive and possibly accompanied by minimal visual effects in the loading screen to match your current song&#039;s tempo/feel.","replies":[{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-18T01:31:09.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or they should just make a option during champ select to play what song or select songs to queue them up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-17T20:00:23.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One song per map or role. No way is league going to get even 2 songs for each champion. That's 2 per champion, so as of the release of Jhin there's 129 champions, which means Riot will have to make 258 songs.\n\nThat's more songs than the [Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Beatles) have written in their lifetime. It's extremely unrealistic. Better you just pick your own tracks out of your favorite playlist.","replies":[]}]}
