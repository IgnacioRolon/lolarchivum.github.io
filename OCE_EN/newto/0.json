You need to remember, however, that toxicity just makes the experience worse for most/all the people involved, regardless of whether it was intentional. As someone who has never been punished, and has come to value a lack of toxicity in-game, I know I'd be devastated if I got punished (even a 5 game chat restriction) for one or two mistakes (even though I haven't played much recently).\n\nIn regards to the ranked rewards, the information on the [Ranked Rewards Eligibility](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011781068) page states the following:\n> There are a few ways to miss out on this season’s rewards:\n* Players with bans or chat restrictions active when the season ends are ineligible for this year’s rewards.\n* Players issued a ban of seven days or more from 8/22/2017 are ineligible for this year’s rewards.\n* Players banned for boosting during the 2017 season remain ineligible for rewards.\n* Players who experience fraud-related or erroneous bans will still be eligible.\n\nSo it seems that, as long as the ban in question was issues *before* the 22nd of August, you will still be eligible for ranked rewards.\n\nWith that said, you can feel free to post the chat logs relating to the ban for review by the community (and the Volunteers and *maybe* one or two Rioters). You should have received an email containing the logs, if not you can always submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) requesting the logs, and we could even see if there's a Rioter available to post the logs for you (with your permission, of course).\n\nAs a final note, if you do believe the punishment to be made in error (even if it's a matter that you feel the punishment was merely too severe) you can submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) to appeal the ban, who will pass it along to the Player Behaviour team who will then review the case. Remember to submit a different ticket for each issue.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to speak up.","replies":[{"poster":"Gizzels Smurf","date":"2017-10-29T03:14:07.329+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what is ruining the game. I have been 2 week banned on my smurfs within 1 day for literally 1-2 games i get tilted on by people shit talking me. This is a adult world and while you can \"mute\" being heavily penalised when the previous 6.5 years no one gave a fuck is ridiculous. Not to mention your support team when you send in a ticket are fucking useless and show little care. I lost a diamond account that was played since season 1 and owned 90% of skins, just thrown a way by a few games i got tilted in.. where as last season you could literally tell everyone to go fuck themselves on a daily basis and get a mere chat restriction. I get you dont want to people to be toxic, but shit happens. Dropping a ban hammer within 1-2 days of games is going to kill this server and your game so fast. I mean, no one i know plays this game anymore.\n\nA punishment system that gets reviewed thoroughly by a employee i can justify, but a system that has 2 triggers, bad language and reports based on players in a game that generally report people for EVERY loss and abuse your slightest mistakes is complete bullshit. And dont once tell me you review peoples reports, it takes 30 hours for a simple ticket to get a response, and thats generally a fucking automated one. Just writing this post makes me mad as fuck at how stupid you have made this game, i have no idea why i even bother with this shit anymore, its not even fun.. and majority of streamers dont even play this shit. NOT TO MENTION there are countless videos of pro players/streamers being abusive and because of their fame NOTHING happens.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-30T05:30:52.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yes you are expected to know what is acceptable in any one game, and know if there are any people who are going to report for no real reason.\n\nHell when i got banned it was because of manual review, because i'd never been banned by the bot because it was never enough of the whiny shits that reported me.\n\nWhat we need is Riot to either take a hard stance on behaviour, or stop taking such a hard stance on behaviour, but again, this isn't what they want to do, they want to look like they are doing something to toxicity without actually putting in the effort to actually do anything against the people who are actually toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-30T09:29:44.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to be honest, I agree with the sentiment. From the perspective of a player, it certainly seems like Riot's punishment systems could use some improvements, particularly to efficiency. I understand it often seems as though the truly toxic players are able to evade any actual punishment, while the more benign players take the brunt of it (keep in mind, this is an observation about how the community sees the effectiveness of the systems in-place). I've seen a lot of toxic players come to the boards to dispute their bans, which has given me a smidgen of trust in the system, but at the same time I also see a lot of players upset with the (supposed) lack of action from the system, which does give me some doubt.\n\nOne of the main areas I think the systems could use improvement is feedback to the players. The Instant Feedback System notifications are a great start on that, however they have been almost untouched since they were first implemented, and only cover a select group of punishment types (typically chat and connection related, from what I understand). While there are resources for players to get an idea whether another player has been punished, they don't tell the whole story, which can make players unsure whether the player i question was banned or just stopped playing for a time, and gives no indication to lower tier punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-30T09:49:38.066+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My biggest issue is consistency when it comes to the banning system.\n\nFact is before i got banned for 2 weeks, i had CONSISTENTLY acted the same way and was never banned.\n\nWhich leaves me of one of two options.\n\n1. My ban was unjustified, as my behaviour was alright.\n2. The system sucks, and it took a manual review for me to be banned for bad behaviour.\n\nAnd for me, both of these options seem to apply on my end, sure some times i went a bit over the top and deserved the ban, other times, the ban is just shit, and at the time i got the ban, it was all in 1 not anything like a 2.\n\nAnd you know what i got into a game as i was typing this, GP support who was deliberately stealing CS, and i'd be the bad guy for leaving the game, and this isn't an uncommon scenario.\n\nEDIT: And as another point now that i'm out of game, the inconsistency shows even with the people who come in here complaining, not many of the complaint's come from NEW players, meaning the bot hasn't noticed them for in cases YEARS (there was someone who had been playing since Season 4 according to OP.GG not long ago, and the rioter in that thread said all punishments had been within 12 months) which honestly isn't good enough.\n\nYou need to have a stance on these punishments, or else when people get banned, they have no fucking clue why.\n\nHad i received a chat ban _**ever**_ before i got a 2 week ban, i'd probably not shit on the system so much, but having just got a straight 2 week ban, i REFUSE to believe that the system works.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-01T10:15:24.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Newto,\n\nAre you going to play for a team this coming split?

Most of the time you'll get players who will do one (or more) of several things that reflect negatively on them, including (but not limited to):\n\n* Presenting their post(s) using behaviours that would and/or did get them punished in-game (such as harassment, offensive language, slurs etc.)\n* Presenting chat logs that show such behaviours (as mentioned in the previous point)\n* Intentionally omitting parts of chat logs to remove such behaviours, then having a Rioter call them out and provide the omitted logs.\n\nIn those cases, it's easy to look at the situation in retrospect and understand why they've received several downvotes. Newto has exhibited none of those behaviours, and quite frankly I find it easier to trust people who present their points in a constructive manner, without intentionally omitting information that is relevant when required/asked (like chat logs, or parts of them).\n\nConsidering that, and that Newto appears to have support from several other players who are effectively speaking as \"character witnesses\", it makes sense that this particular thread would be receiving some upvotes, rather than a bunch of downvotes.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-10-30T15:40:19.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes im not referring to those instances of people clearly denying things or whatever in a desperate attempt to get unbanned.\n\nthis guy in chall has admitted he made a mistake and pretty much deserved the ban at the time but believes he shouldnt be punished for that 1 mistake when you consider his overall behaviour across his many game/season. and i agree 100% with him. \n\nproblem is there are people in low elo in the exact same position, especially with how Riot are now escalating punishments for certain zero tolerance words/phrases. they had a bad week and are now ineligible for rewards or have lost \"their\" accounts when if you look at their behavior overall across their many hundreds or even thousands of games you would conclude their behavior is good.\n\nyet if they make a post about it they receive the \"sucked in\" and \"well you deserve it for being toxic\" posts. they are told \"too bad\" and that riot has \"0 tolerance\". in some instances they are also ridiculed for their rank. but this person in challenger is somehow being forgiven by the \"community\" here.\n\ni mean the thread title and his post are insinuating he should be given leniency because of the fact that he is in challenger.....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"amelianna xD","date":"2017-10-28T22:52:21.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So many people spoke nicely about you but you didn't thank anyone?
