For example how gruesome, explicit and darn right adult themed these skins can get seeing as people of all ages can play this video game.\r\n\r\nI had three ideas for Halloween inspired skins. \r\n\r\nThe first being a Marionette or Manikin doll Orianna. Similar to these examples:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f9/3d/d8/f93dd81cb396ae0d27331a39a24e27b1.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/321866704595713833/&amp;h=640&amp;w=480&amp;tbnid=zRA25KsyrJH9VM:&amp;docid=BkLartzbrsev8M&amp;ei=ieQxVuqVD5CDoQT85oiYCw&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CCcQMygMMAxqFQoTCKr-vOus58gCFZBBiAodfDMCsw\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/b0/c6/64/b0c66449a9cd4d946bd018330d13ba51.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.pinterest.com/yackjak/marionette/&amp;h=400&amp;w=236&amp;tbnid=9sI5w5HSUxkMyM:&amp;docid=GKFKJsAsKEK76M&amp;ei=h-UxVrq4A5TSoASxlZCICw&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CCAQMygEMARqFQoTCPqXwOSt58gCFRQpiAodsQoEsQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/4c/0f/9f/4c0f9fb63bd5ae036b646ca26b85ded3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/30680841186874119/&amp;h=600&amp;w=400&amp;tbnid=w2y0LT8H6SygaM:&amp;docid=5K22zCjhxWy-7M&amp;itg=1&amp;ei=h-UxVrq4A5TSoASxlZCICw&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CCEQMygFMAVqFQoTCPqXwOSt58gCFRQpiAodsQoEsQ&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=775\r\n\r\n( Sorry for the rush job google search)\r\n\r\nThe second being a Plague Doctor Swain.
