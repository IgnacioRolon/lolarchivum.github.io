Also it may be in the video game already but my inferior human eyes may not have the capability of viewing this feature.\n\nIs it possible that you could update and add two sections to the Post game information. Where we would compare statistics relating to &#039;Damage dealt to Champions&#039; and &#039;Towers destroyed&#039; etc, I think it would be nice to see two more statistics.\n\nI would like to see these two statistics which can help players improve their teamwork,\n- Wards purchased\n- Wards placed\n\nI personally think this could overall improve the teamwork of players who don&#039;t use the convenient free ward you give us, the cheap upgraded wards and also the Stealth Ward, Vision Ward and Sightstone.\n\nI&#039;m certain the players inside the community who would like to see League of Legends gain more experienced, teamwork using players will agree that this updated statistic will help gameplay overall.\n\nThank you very much for your time Riot, please keep up the great work\n\nRegards,","replies":[]}
