The point is they have a thing that makes them unique and different to each other","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-22T04:53:25.174+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The difference between sol's q and anivia's q is that his q grows, his q is a **STAR** which cannot be instantly reactivated. His q also doesn't slow or do damage for just touching enemies. His w requires playmaking and moving to position the stars, karthus's e is literally activate then stand in the middle of enemies as close as he can. Those are very different.\n\nThe damn simple fact is you have an ability based on starts called starsurge (which by the way is the same damn name as sol's q) and whats this? a star with a core? sounds familiar, which gets bigger over time? wonder where heard that before, and it stuns, oh yea its sol. Only difference is sol's q is harder to use. His w is pretty much ekko e in reverse. His passive is leblancs ult crossed with illaoi's passive, and his ult is leblancs ult crossed with illaoi's ult. His e is an illaoi passive combined with heim's q. Literally nothing here is original to the game, every part of it has been stripped from something else.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
