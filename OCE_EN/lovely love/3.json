I got 20 rune pages so I should receive 5 EPIC MYSTERY SKINS right? Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t  get anyone after I completed the mission, and I know I owned all available skins but I still think Riot should compensate those RP we paid for rune pages with something like chest that contains guaranteed skin permanent for those players have owned all skins!\r\nI&#039;m just wondering is there anyone else met the same situation like me, we really need Riot&#039;s help~~\r\n\r\nFollowing is my screenshot:\r\n[https://i.imgur.com/zelJ079.png]\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-07T10:54:40.627+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably the best chance that you have at getting this resolved is by submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us).

Can you try checking your account in either of the two ways below?  If it shows that you didn't get your skins, please send in a player support ticket so we can get your case fixed.\n1. Click on the notification button (under the X For closing your client and above your friend's list) and open up any of the gifting events.  You should see a pop-up with the epics you received.\n2.
