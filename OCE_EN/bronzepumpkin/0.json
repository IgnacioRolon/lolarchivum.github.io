I am someone who only wishes to play League of Legends casually, for fun. I have only ever played one game of ranked, after being pressured into it by a friend, and the game was a horrible loss due to becoming a 4v5. Anyway I play only normals. I find that I am matched against people ranging from bronze to gold, despite the fact that myself and most people I decide to play with when I rarely do are unranked. To make it worse the team that I am on seem to only have very low ranks if at all. It is extremely frustrating, especially when they spam horrible messages in chat. I tried contacting Riot to try to sort this issue out and be matched with people my own skill level yet in their reply they just avioided the topic and rambled. I wish they would just fix it so I can enjoy this game again... {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-02-16T10:35:41.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It matches you based on your MMR and also its normals so expect people to be premades, you will never find balanced match making in normals as its not possible, if you want balanced matchmaking you play ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-02-16T10:57:28.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty much this. Your mmr is basically your 'skill' level. Due to high elo people generally not playing normals much, they will have a low normal MMR and  you will usually get matched up with them (I am bronze and played against a challenger today because he only had 45 normal wins). \nAs for the horrible messages, just mute everyone in game as you start and communicate solely by pings. If you don't want to do that I suggest finding some buddies and playing with them (as long as they aren't toxic).\n\nTL;DR suck it up buttercup, the rito gods are powerless in this matter.","replies":[]}]}]}
