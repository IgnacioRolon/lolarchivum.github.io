Wrong. I get 2 remakes in a row with an aram and AI game between them and bam, autofill activated. Meanwhile the asshat who got filled to sup and said he was going to troll and picked Vayne support with TP and made the adc decide to afk gets what punishment? \r\nHas rito provided any explanation for why dodges and remakes consume your protection? Does the community feel this is how it should work?\r\nI for one am mega pissed that dodges and remakes consume protection.","replies":[]}
