There's no good way to mix the sounds you specifically want to be louder in the client right now. Here's hoping the new client brings some flexibility. Others have suggested turning up the volume but you'll probably find yourself turning it down during champ select which I think is pretty inconvenient over longer sessions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-10T04:51:39.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the game used to tab in automatically when a queue came, but if you run admin it still will, you could also right click your volume in taskbar, open volume mixer, and shoot the client up to the top, that will make everything the same as it is now, but make the queue pop up noise louder","replies":[]}]}
