They&#039;re also far worse at playing than bots used to be. \r\n\r\nPlease Riot, for the love of god help us. We&#039;re drowning in bots. I&#039;ve had to report a bot in almost every game for the past few weeks. It&#039;s ruining this game for everyone!","replies":[{"poster":"Lairdeth","date":"2018-02-13T15:23:40.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fear that riot is allowing a nominal amount of bots to keep the 'concurrent users' at an all time high. I come across bots in ARAM & Treeline of all places... I feel your pain... Report them for Cheating/3rd Party. But don't hold your breath. Bots give them concurrent user stats that they crave.","replies":[]}]}
