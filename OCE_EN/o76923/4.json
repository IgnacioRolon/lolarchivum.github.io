Perhaps an in game widget to gauge your players&#039; thoughts would be appropriate. For example, when you do a promotional event you could see how people&#039;s opinions change, or you can get general player consensus of things you would like to know we think. \r\n\r\neg. A simple feedback tab on the profile menu, feedback buttons for relevant features of the game in the store etc.\r\n\r\nI&#039;d imagine this could also help you narrow down the price ranges that would sell the most by seeing the stats on how fair people think rp prices are, and it could also allow you to see which skins would sell most in a sale. A general option and perhaps item-specific ratings could give you valuable marketing knowledge...\r\n\r\nAnd finally is there a wishlist function in the store? :p\r\n\r\n{{item:3640}}","replies":[]}
