As far as learning I am (by personal analysis) a frustrating learner. Most people would tell me that when learning lanes, use the simple champs to learn. Example: Garen Top, Annie Mid and Ashe Bot etc. However, I hate learning this way as I find no difficulty learning these champs and just want to get right into the mediocre champions to use and potentially main.\r\n\r\nMy list so far is: Darius Top, Yi or Jax Jungle, Ahri Mid, Pyke Support and Jinx Bot. I&#039;m having some fun playing Darius so I don&#039;t see any real reason to change him however I was intrigued by Aatrox. Yi and Jax for Jungle I&#039;m also having fun with, Yi definitely on the weaker side but is fun to play all around. Ahri for Mid, I enjoy her but I don&#039;t. I was looking into Zed but believed he may be too difficult for me at this point in time. Support I don&#039;t play at all, but if I must, Pyke and Thresh are there. ADC as Jinx. I;m not like Jinx a whole heap, and although I enjoyed Ashe, she was too easy and boring for me. Jinx is just outright boring and her lack of mobility is everything against what I have fun in playing. \r\n\r\nThis may sound confusing and I apologise. To summarise however, is Darius worth changing? Maybe for Aatrox? Ahri to be changed? And an ADC suitable would be nice. I like the look of Draven, but again. Think he is too difficult.\r\n\r\nIf you guys could help me by giving me a list of some &#039;mediocre&#039; champs I should refer to mainly for top, mid and adc I would appreciate it highly.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-07-10T11:39:15.524+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for a reasonably mobile ADC, you *might* want to look at Quinn. Between the move speed on her Heightened Senses (W) passive and Behind Enemy Lines (R) she can certainly move around, both in and out of combat. Keep in mind, however, that she is among the marksmen on the shorter end of basic attack range (equivalent to Jinx's base range).\n\nHaving said that, my understanding of the meta is that Quinn is typically used Top, and occasionally Mid, as opposed to ADC. Considering that, I'm of the opinion that of you figure out how to use her right you can get her to work in any position, even Support (I did so several times over the years and it worked out well enough for me, not sure how it would translate to the current patch).\n\nAll that said, I *might* just be biased because I'm an enthusiastic Quinn fan.\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-07-10T03:08:17.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who has played this game since season 1 (Im no pro, i have lots of gaps and breaks inbetween). i'm telling you this:\n\nListen to the advice people gave you, stick to easy champions.\n\nYou may not think it, but there's a lot that goes into a game of league, A LOT, so much to think about, and it gets to a ridiculous amount of things to worry about, the better you get at the game. \n\nWith that being said, something you don't want to worry about early on is: Hard champions to play.\n\nthis just adds an unneccesary increase of information that you have to think about, and will in-turn make you progress a LOT slower.\n\nhowever:\n\ni don't think you are stuck to easy-champions alone. Find a few easy mains (garen, ashe, annie, etc) play them as your main-champions, (1 for every lane at-least)\n\nEvery so often, play a new champion to test that champion out, maybe a few games, however, revert back to the easy champions often.\n\nas for what champion you SHOULD play.... No-one has that answer, not even yourself, your \"Main\" champion will change so often it'll feel rediculous, with patches, and new-found loves, you'll end up swapping mains consistently, this is normal.. don't overthink it.\n\ntl;dr: Main the easy champions for now, and every so often mix it up, playing new champions you think may be interesting, mains will come naturally and entirely depend on what you like. it will change often","replies":[{"poster":"Bartolaim","date":"2018-07-10T03:11:55.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the 'easy' champs just feel so weak in norms. so easy to get destroyed. thats why im looking for these mediocre champs that dont have so many weaknesses and outplays.","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2018-07-10T03:59:25.722+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen is one of the strongest and most OP toplaners atm. trust me, the champions aren't weak. there's a lot to learn, farming, positioning, roles, build structure, etc. \n\nadd me if u want me to show you why the easy champions feel weak to you","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-07-10T02:50:36.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why not udyr i feel like his is the easiest to jungle with","replies":[{"poster":"Bartolaim","date":"2018-07-10T02:54:07.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not doing too bad with Jax and Yi in jungle, but will definitely have a look.
