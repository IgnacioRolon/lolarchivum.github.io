Ive been experiencing alot of these types of matchups since 4.2 dropped. I have no idea what is going on and why its happening.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone with more knowledge can shed some light on exactly why this happens, but its near every game i have. Is it MMR? is it broken? is it caused by 2+ friends playing together?\r\n\r\nI did a little reading on the subject and from what i could find, it points mainly toward trying to even out \"fairness\" by pairing say a trio of silvers vs a platinum and a gold due to the advantage of having team communication. That could be right but isnt that a little over the top? in the game listed above it was myself who is clearly S5, with my friend who is level 16. The other team had 3 golds, platinum and level 12\r\n\r\n**This is not a rage or flame thread. **\r\n\r\nIm just curious as to what exactly is causing it and if it is broken then perhaps riot need to tweak it?\r\n\r\nPS: We won the game","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T23:36:37.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">PS: We won the game\n\nMade me giggle.\n\nBut anyway, I can tell you something. MMR, the current \"elo\" system in place, is *not* reflective of the current division you are in and/or how many games you have won. It's related to your skill. It could just be that you were versing some pretty bad gold players (especially the fact that you won) who got into their divisions by being carried or something, I dunno. Next, unrankeds get their MMR from the normal games they have played, and that could be based off of anything they've done. It's possible to have unranked players who have the MMR of the average Plat.\n\nBut what I'm explaining is something which is rare and shouldn't happen often. You said \"Ive been experiencing alot of these types of matchups since 4.2 dropped\", which should not be happening. I guess the only explanation now is server under-populace, which would cause these rare instances to occur much more frequently.\n\nHope that clears it up a bit.","replies":[{"poster":"DeadReign","date":"2015-01-08T07:15:46.394+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"It kind of clears it up, but it could also be a problem with leaver buster causing low priority queues for particular people. If it cant find enough people to match correctly due to them being in low priority queue for leaving (ud hope there isnt that many in it) then it would find anybody, On top of that i find it odd that it can even make that kind of matchup as listed above simply for the fact on my team we had 3 people under level 30. How could the game even make a decision on the 3 non 30's MMR when they arent even high enough to be judged in that way yet\n\nAs i said before this has ONLY been happening since 4.2. It makes me think they have done some tweaking to matchmaking which has caused these kinds of matchups to occur which clearly as anyone can tell it shouldnt. I could understand if my team was all 30's unranked. At least then MMR could make sense\n\nIm getting kind of sick of it but in another way it can be a good thing. U play against higher skilled opponents and u learn things u may not before. What really annoys me is when u get paired like that and u 20min surrender just to get out of it because ur getting stomped, or they stomp u so hard u dont even reach 20mins\n\nIve played games such as this and the opposing team even talk trash when theyre winning when clearly theyre higher skilled. That is the OCE community i have come to expect. Trash talking platinums vs non 30's...such poor attitude","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:17:25.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">This is not a rage or flame thread.\n\nEh, well there's really nothing that can be done about it. If the MMR has become flawed, then nothing short of the red in charge of matchmaking seeing this will fix it.\n\nBut the way it's designed, you should also be having matches were you have a team that's clearly better than the opponents. It would create a balance, of sorts, were you win some and lose some, with most matches being competitive.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
