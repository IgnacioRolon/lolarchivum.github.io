WTB Armor...","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically i&#039;m really struggling with the new rune system, i need help trying to work out how to make a tank work. \r\nI am a support main and i tend to focus on tanks. \r\nMy old rune page was literally just, 20 armor and 10 mr (roughly) \r\nThere doesn&#039;t appear to be a way to make up the loss of armor and it means i&#039;m basically dieing every time i go in in the early game. \r\nIs there some way to give me armor back that i&#039;m not seeing? The best i can find is 5 armor from iron skin... I&#039;ve got to be missing something right? \r\nTheres no way they remove 20 armor runes and replace it with 5 armor..\r\nYes i am aware of the 5% boost while using a consumable. \r\nFirst of all i use consumables to heal, generally after the fight or half way in... Is that the problem? Are you going to have to run iron skin and use a pot whenever u want to engage? \r\nThe far far better option is to gain permanent 5% armor and MR from the 10 minute wait on conditioning, however this means i&#039;m basically useless for the first 10 minutes unless i want to feed. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m really struggling and i can&#039;t seem to find any help. Probably cos it&#039;s really new but yeah... It&#039;s making it really hard to enjoy a few games without getting flamed to hell for feeding when i engage.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-08T14:12:54.744+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have alot of ways to gain extra hp, and if you want to fight early, the aftershock keystone in the resolve tree gives 20 flat armour, not to mention all tank supports got some extra base armour.\n\nbut yeah, tank supports are less tanky early on, so you'll want to go resolve into domination, pickup cheap shot and take ignite, opting for damage to make up for the lack of defence. Tank supports are alot squishier early on with the new runes, but on the other hand, cheap shot and unbreakable, and enemies botlane having less base resistances, makes engage supports really good at fighting early.","replies":[{"poster":"Soena","date":"2017-11-08T15:40:20.299+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, i didn't see the armor/mr on aftershock! i stopped using it when i was finding it detonated too late to hit people when i engaged, i literally had 0 damage done by it on malphite, cos it detonated after the ult knockup was long finished and everyone was either running away or dead lol.\n\nThat armor/mr boost is very effective, provided your champ has a hard cc. ty :) \nOh also what is unbreakable? i cant seem to find it :S (possibly cos i'm blind?)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-11-09T01:55:50.183+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sorry I got aftershock mixed up and started calling it unbreakable because before I edited my post, I was talking about how the new runes give alistair alot of damage whilst being very tanky, since he relies more on his ult for tankiness during the midgame, rather than resistances like other tanks.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"tts01008","date":"2017-11-10T12:28:23.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They boosted the base stats of all champions so that they don't die immediately early game even without the old runes.","replies":[]}]}
