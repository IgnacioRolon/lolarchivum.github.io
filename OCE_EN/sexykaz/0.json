The competitive scene shows a huge drop in competent players. This makes weekend league competitive impossible for low ELO players to climb. Does anyone else agree with what has been happening for the past few weekends. During the week there are competent players and then when the weekend comes around, player skill drops when  matchmaking. Should there be something to fix this type of matchmaking.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-06T03:14:34.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are concerned over the games on the weekend, then you simply need to not play (ranked) on weekends.\n\nObviously the weekend allows people who don't have time during the week to play, so people are going to be rusty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-05-07T05:09:30.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not up here sorry","replies":[]}]}
