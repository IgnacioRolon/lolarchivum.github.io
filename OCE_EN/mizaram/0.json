(I&#039;m sure someone has already thought of this, but I can&#039;t see a current forum post promoting this)\r\nAt early levels, junglers will actually be able to assist with damaging the turrets rather than just pushing the opposing team off the turret.\r\nThis may even re-introduce the double {{summoner:11}} meta.\r\nWe expanded on this by taking in the item buffs to smite:\r\n{{item:3711}} would give a 1 sec {{item:3363}} (without the 1-hit ward) around all standing enemy turrets (thought about putting {{item:3364}} around dead turrets also)\r\n{{item:3706}} would reduce dmg to champions by 50% for x seconds (3 seconds???)\r\n{{item:3715}} would increase minion damage to the turret by 50% for x seconds (3 seconds???)\r\nThe drawback to all this ... it is perfectly viable that all 5 members of a team could end up running smite/flash or smite/teleport for summoner spells and would ruin the balance, so there would need to be more balance changes around this (imagine out-smiting a Kalista at Baron with 5 smites).\r\n\r\nWe came up with tonnes of other ideas, but this one was the only one we thought through extensively ... some of the other things we were discussing were as follows:\r\n- Levelling for turrets inline with dragon (to increase HP and A/MR)\r\n- Multiple threat bonus (reactive A/MR based on # of enemy champs in range)\r\n- Double-jungle meta (I&#039;m not talking lane-swap meta, I&#039;m talking invade and disrupt - as in &quot;all your camps are belong to us&quot;)\r\n- Devourer ADC meta (I know some vayne players try this, but yeah ...)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I wanted to try to get this post in view for PBE members, or somewhere more visible than OCE boards, but this will have to do for a start.\r\nAny feedback appreciated - tell me how good, or bad, these ideas are.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-04-19T04:03:26.958+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smiting Krugs already gives you a buff that lets you do a HUGE chunk of true damage to towers.\nJunglers already ruin towers faster than anyone else on the Rift.\nNot to mention Smite's utility was just nerfed massively, by it no longer working with spell effects.\n\nOnce towers are buffed, Jungler's effect on them wont change much, they'll still smite krugs for that huge true damage hit, and getting the Dragon Buff for true damage burn on buildings will be more sought after.\n\nTowers being harder to kill wont prolong laning phase, laning phase ends when the players decide to start grouping and team fighting. This can happen at any time, without a single tower dieing, or even after all towers in all lanes have died.\n\nEnd of the day the Meta is entirely controlled by the players and what the players want to play, however League is a game where every champion is countered by some other champion and or play style and itemisation.\nWell except for Vayne, there is no counter to her apart from making the player rage quit the game at 3 minutes.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizaram","date":"2016-04-19T04:44:52.410+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting arguments, and wholeheartedly valid.\n\n> Smiting Krugs already gives you a buff that lets you do a HUGE chunk of true damage to towers.\n\nFully aware of this, and as a result of my proposed changes, something would need to be done with this - potentially replacing it with something else.\n\n> Junglers already ruin towers faster than anyone else on the Rift.\n\nIf they can get up to touch the tower, fair enough ... statistics say that although junglers do a lot of damage to turrets - ADCs do it better and will only do it if they have 1 to 4 other team members around them (unless they are a split-push Vayne)\n\n> Towers being harder to kill wont prolong laning phase, laning phase ends when the players decide to start grouping and team fighting.\n\nI'm curious to know if this is true or not from a diamond/masters/challenger elo standpoint.\nIf you have 5 people visible on the map and in 1 area, that's a lot of lost experience & gold in sidelanes - that can't be efficient.\n\n> This can happen at any time, without a single tower dieing, or even after all towers in all lanes have died.\n\nGenerally agree with this, but inline with the response above ...

Do you think that this is because turrets are too strong? How do you think your proposed changes will affect low-elo games?\n\nI think that low-elo games would initially drag on for longer, because they'll be slower to adjust and adapt to the changes. When low-elo players like me get a grasp of the benefits of multi-smite, then the game times will shorten and players will be more decisive.","replies":[{"poster":"Mizaram","date":"2016-04-19T03:01:31.077+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll be the first to admit that I'm a bronze player (I haven't even done my provisionals for this season as of yet) so I know exactly what you are talking about.

I think alleviating these three issues is one of the long-term goals of Dynamic Queue. DynaQ has numerous incentives to encourage people to queue with others (e.g. higher chance of Hextech Key Fragment drops). The more people queue in groups, the more teamwork will result, if the comms are harmonious of course","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CookedChickens","date":"2016-04-19T05:23:09.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just played kogmaw mid :D won so hard (wasnt the usual ap kog mid i went full on adc kog mid).","replies":[]}]}
