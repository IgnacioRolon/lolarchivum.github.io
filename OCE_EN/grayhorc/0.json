There are 6 roles that Riot have made searchable. \"Assassin\" \"Fighter\" \"Support\" \"Mage\" \"Tank\" \"Marksman\"\n\nGranted you find champions like Blitzcrank listed under Tank/FIghter and not Support, so it's not perfect but can help newer players.\n\nThere is also a way to make Custom Lists using LSI (although I don't know if it's 100% \"legal\" to do so). But the fact that you can kinda means Riot could easily implement a custom list system.","replies":[{"poster":"Grayhorc","date":"2016-03-15T02:22:26.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i reckon it'd be pretty cool if they did implement a custom list system then it'd be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-15T07:29:54.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can implement it yourself by keeping a word document or a notepad with\nChampionname|Championname\n\nEG.
