You REALLY hate spellvamp, eh? :P)\n\nI&#039;m unranked and have spent most of the last year on League playing arams, so I can&#039;t really talk about balance across all elos, but here we go.\n\nKayle: When I read that Kayle was up for a rework I had no idea what you&#039;d want to change, but then I remembered that her ultimate has no cost and came up with this idea. \nKayle should be able to cast her ult whenever it&#039;s up, absolutely, but it shouldn&#039;t be free, not something that powerful.\nI feel like the cost of her ult, should be &quot;100% of current mana.&quot; Hear me out.\nFor every X mana Kayle spends, could extend the duration of her ult, or apply some other form of buff to her target?\nThis way, Kayle can still cast her ult for as low as 1 mana, so it is always available to her, but now the Kayle player has a lot more to consider.\nAlso {{item:3165}}.\n\nNow... Teemo. Every part of his kit is sort of iconic, but a friend and I came up with a few ideas.\n\nThe death of AP stealth hamster: All of Teemo&#039;s AP scalings could be removed and replaced with AD scalings, removing his early spikes and bursty nature.\n\nThe return of the sith: E ratios down, Teemo passively gaines 1%/2%/3%/4%/5% spellvamp (;)) scaling with rank.\n\nA friend of mine came up with the idea that Teemo&#039;s poison could stack up to a blind, instead of his Q applying it immediately. Meaning that Teemo would need to land R, E, Q to proc the blind on a target. This would still allow Teemo to use his passive for assassinations, he just needs to be a little smarter about it.\n\nFeel free to tell me these ideas are terrible, it&#039;s a subject I enjoy thinking about, and if my thoughts can be of use, then that&#039;s gg :)\n\nThanks for the read.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T06:27:17.848+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't find Kayle's changes plausible personally simply because she has to deplete whatever that's left completely to use it every time. I can get behind that you are trying to force Kayle use it as a last resort \"all in\" thingy rather than it being used as a trading or initiation tool, but what's more likely to happen with a kit that rigid is that people would probably just stop playing her altogether. And that's isn't what we want to see. I think you are on the right track but the execution imo needs more work.\n\nIn terms of Teemo, I personally don't find it plausible to have him get spell vamp directly in his kit, because that would be literally confirming the fan favourite of \"Teemo is Satan\" joke being literally canon, which well... But with your idea about switching Teemo's scaling ratio, I think that's a good one, but instead of making everything AD instead of AP, I think mixing them up is a better idea. And last by no means least, I like the idea that Teemo's blind would need to be stacked to get, though I'd prefer the requirement wouldn't be so harsh about it, however a neat concept nevertheless.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-23T06:36:18.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your constructive comments :) My favourite discussions are when people disagree with me and are able to explain their reasons :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-01-23T06:26:47.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where did you hear these champs are being updated?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-23T06:29:40.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SkarSkarSkarner,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=8UNXoA6E,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-23T06:26:47.395+0000)\n>\n> Where did you hear these champs are being updated?\n\nI think he just meant that he wants a rework on those 2 champs and sharing his ideas about it.
