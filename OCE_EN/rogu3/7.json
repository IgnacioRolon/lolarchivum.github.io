Before I look into doing it myself, I was hoping I could get some more feedback on whether or not this is against the rules?\nHe swore it wasn&#039;t, but I&#039;ve spent a few hundred dollars on my account and I don&#039;t want to lose it just for some cool audio files.\n\nEdit: Clarity. Searching the internet has returned a bunch of mixed results, I've seen posts from rioters saying it's not a bannable issue, and I've seen posts from people who have been banned because of it.

But, that's a big IF we ever decide to do that. Although we don't officially support using other region's voice packs, a lot of Rioters do it here in the office too.\nLots of Weabo Rioters were very excited for the Japan launch and all those anime voice overs :D","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-03T06:38:35.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Sargonas\nYou are correct. I'm not sure why this support representative gave this answer, and I've asked for someone to look into it.\nThat said, this is NOT why the person in question was banned. It was for a mod/tool detection as they said, but it had nothing at all to do with a VO swap. That's all I can really say on the matter though, obviously.\n\n\nForum response\nI am in no way defending OP's friend, however the Rioter clearly says \"modification of voices and language is a modification of our client.\" He then proceeds to say that's the reason he got banned for.\nHowever, in the first screenshot, the Rioter says that OP's friend was banned for exploiting bugs.\nWhy is there such an inconsistency?\n\n\nRiot Sargonas\nI honestly don't know. I'm not involved with European player support, so I can only speak to our rules and policies on what is/isn't ok to use, but not to the actions of the Player Support staff. All I can say is, sounds like there was some communication issues there between support and the player in question and I've pinged some folks who can hopefully help address it.\n\n\nHopefully you can understand why I'm worried.","replies":[]}]}]}
