Let me explain a bit more on this, when we think about ADC and its role in a team we think of high amounts of damage over an extended period of time. Like to the point where its not uncommon for them to be doing majority of the damage over an extended team fight. On the other end though pros must come with cons and that con is how squishy they are, how if caught out or not protected by their team how easily they can be killed.\n\nNow in the example you gave you said that why should a Syndra be allowed to walk up and kill you, or if she roamed bot lane why is she able to make you back away to your tower. Well in a sense that is the PRO of an mid laner. Packing high burst with long cooldowns. They are able to do that because they were designed to do that. Going back to the theme of with pros there must be cons, notice how I noted on long cooldowns. Most, if not all mid laners that I can think of at the moment in my head need these cooldowns to be up to do damage. So in the sense of a team fight if your front line is able to force the enemy mid laner to use their cooldowns on the tanks, instead of the ADCs, there we have the con of the mid laners. They have to pick how they want to use their cooldowns to disrupt the enemy team.\n\nWhen it comes down to it league of legends is a team game, sometimes its hard to think of it that way in  the heat of solo queue xD but it very much is. Each person fills a role in each team and its your job to fill that role. As an ADC its your role to be doing all the damage that you can as safely as you can. With your support sometimes it can be their job to protect you, or they could be a diver with CC such as Leona and instead be more aggressive and set you up kills. ADC is a very difficult role to play in solo queue with this in mind because you in a sense have a very big con that can be taken advantage of easily. This is where we roll into how its difficult to balance the game around the different elos where people understand their roles and people who are still learning, the competitive players and all that fun stuff that I applaud Riot for doing so well at. \n\nIf you are interested Riot actually did a panel at PAX Aus this year where they went in depth into balancing champions in what they called \"Riot Games' Top 5 Pain in the Ass Champions to Balance\" It was a very fun panel that I was lucky enough to attend and ask a question at that really gave an indepth look as to how they balance the game and I would defs recommend having a watch if you are interested in learning more. (Rengar is also one of the 5 champions featured as well.) [If you want a link to the vod you can find it here.](https://www.twitch.tv/pax2/v/100188744)\n\n--\n\nI hope that helps explain a bit as to my thoughts as to the current state of ADC. If you want to chime in your thoughts on what I said go for it, and if there is any other questions I can answer specifically let me know as well. Good luck in your games and I will see you around!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-01T13:05:24.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thank you for your comment, and I'll do my best to adapt to the ever shifting state of the game :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2017-01-02T01:47:44.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LGC Elam,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=23RRWQV1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-01-01T06:05:24.377+0000)\n>\n> I myself am an ADC main and I can very much feel the pain that you are when it comes to playing ADC at the moment, however after a lot of thinking about it over the past few months, I think that the position ADC is in actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it.\n> \n> Well in a sense that is the PRO of an mid laner.

But I doubt it. And I also doubt that there is a \"not enough attention\" issue in the bot lane, since that bot literally has been the entire focus of the game's balance for most of seasons in the game's entire history already. Almost any and everything has been buffed and nerfed on the basis of how well they're doing with and against ADCs, for a good while now, if you haven't caught up yet.\n\nSo no, I don't think bot needs Riot at all. In fact it's really about time we need less of Riot in bot.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-01T13:09:27.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps less of Riot is truly in fact what the bot lane needs, maybe attention will get drawn somewhere else :P\n\nI do thank you for your perspective on this issue though, it's nice to see a point of view that is so different from my own.\n\nI also remember a time when spell thieves edge received a nerf because mages started taking it mid.

Not to mention, none of the \"tank meta\" in later seasons even has come remotely close to the real tank-meta of the S2; or if you haven't caught up yet, there is none after S2 (or at least only for a very short period of time when Cinderhulk was arguably OP, but that still wasn't because that tanks were OP, it was just that 1 item). \n\nIt's just that people for some reason got used to S3's assassins killing full tanks in a rotation and ADCs pew pew gunning down full tanks like minions, and thinking \"now, _that_ is normal\". And when tanks are no longer just utterly underpowered, \"ZOMG TANK META!!11!!\" \n\nAnd really, what's the fundamental difference between tank meta and any other meta? Aren't they all pretty bad, game-breaking, imbalanced and potentially obnoxious/toxic? But why are people cool with assassin meta and ADC meta that have been dominating the game for the vast majority of the last 5+ years and they get so little complaints, when tank meta that has barely made it over 1 year (and maybe a half) of the game's history gets so much hate?","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2017-01-03T00:37:30.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree, I think it was the \"Juggernaut\" meta that killed it ;_;.\nor at least made it 100x harder","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2017-01-02T04:59:31.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agreed\nBot lane is the least likeliest lane to carry a game\n\nAll you can do as bot is try and take first tower.
