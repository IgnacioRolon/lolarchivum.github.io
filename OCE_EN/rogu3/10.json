Once bought, they would be added to an ammunition pouch that would be exclusive to marksmen. The marksman would purchase x amount of ammo, store it in this pouch, and toggle the ammunition on and off as they needed.\n\nClass exclusive content is probably a bad way to balance the game, but the concept just feels like it could have so much potential.\n\nBuyable ammo would be more of a late game thing, as purchasing the items would take away from your build paths. With that said, it could be cool to include different tiers of this ammo, for different prices. \n\n\nAn example;\n\nTier 1 (Laning phase, used for trading.)\n50g per projectile;\n+10% life steal\n\nTier 2 (Mid game, to help you make clutch af plays)\n150g per projectile;\n+30% crit chance\n\nTier 3 (late game, after you achieve full build)\n1000g Per projectile\nApplies a 1 second silence to the target, target can only be silenced by this ammunition once every 10 seconds.\n\n\nHad a few more ideas but I didn&#039;t want this post to get overlong. I would love to hear peoples opinions on this, good and bad. Maybe even your own ideas for ammunition?\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"chichun2002","date":"2017-01-06T12:15:36.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting concept but the problem is many players would prefer to build items that are permenant such as bloodthirster and it would most likely only be use after full build such as stat increasing potions","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-06T13:18:13.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A very good point, and the very reason why we are seeing Ziggs bot lane is because of his early power. They could implement this the way I've outlined and it may very well change nothing at all.\n\nThe promise of EVEN MORE late game power probably isn't something marksmen need. Yet I do like the idea of an adc being able to fork out a few hundred gold for some life steal shots, so he can toggle those on the next time he has to duel with his enemy laner who may have just gotten a lead and bought themselves a {{item:1053}} or {{item:1018}} \n\nAnother factor is that Riot don't like the idea of 'invisible power,' and it's quite possible that even with particle effects to display ammo in use, people would probably still feel cheated by these items winning trades.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-01-09T00:47:14.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about early game elixirs, and later games elixirs, to make these items feel more strategically used, instead of late game little power, i mean, am i the only one buying an elixir when im close to 6 or around 6 with anivia (level) and i already have my tear, i buy a elixir and use it when i get my blue from jungler for immense power of spamming","replies":[]}]}]}]}
