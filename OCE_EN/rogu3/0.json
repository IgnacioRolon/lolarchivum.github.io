I&#039;ve been playing ARAM for about a year solid, I don&#039;t understand much about MMR, but could my success there be the reason I am matched with Golds in my provisionals? \r\n\r\n-I have never ranked before.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-02-01T12:02:08.181+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=rogu3\n\nAn unranked account, that is, an account that has never play ranked EVER, has around mid Silver MMR. About Silver 4-3. No one knows exactly what it is, but it is roughly around that.\n\nBeing a new account, your MMR is very volatile. So winning and losing will have large effects on it. The more games you play, the less volatile is becomes which is why winning your first few games is so important.\n\nAlthough OP.GG does have a \"MMR Calculator\", take it with a grain of salt, as no one actually knows what your MMR really is. It is simply a guess.\nWhen I did my placements this year, it said I had Gold 3 MMR (after 9 games) and I got placed in Silver 1. \n\nNormals, ARAMS etc do not effect your Ranked MMR.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T12:18:23.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your response :)\nYeah I figured that OP.gg may not be entirely reliable, seeing as it claims I'm level 2, when I've been level 30 for a year haha.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-01T10:55:38.936+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ranked mmr starts at Silver 5, and is determined form there.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T11:10:19.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So until Silver 5, you have a nonranked mmr?","replies":[]}]}]}
