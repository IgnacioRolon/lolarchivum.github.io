Yet in skin spotlight, it&#039;s a bunch of gay looking brush tips? or fox furs? I like the brush tip coming out of his gun for the recall. Sure, I personally do feel it looks kind of derpy, I just wanted to address the disparity between splash and skin? In Jhin&#039;s classic skin his shoulder device is covered, so I assumed that may be the case with the Blood moon skin, but if his gun is loaded with brushes, why are the brushes covering his ammunition?\n\nAlso, why does he glow pink? Really? We had to wait this long for a kick ass new Jhin skin, and you made him glow neon pink every time he crits?\nI&#039;m still going to buy it, but god damn do I feel like a lot of potential was wasted.\n\n-Could a little more detail be put into the candy red hand? the colour looks really flat in my opinion.\n\n-The abilities are 110% perfect, could not be improved by god himself.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-08T06:02:34.678+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"> why are the brushes covering his ammunition?\n\nhttp://img02.deviantart.net/2f4e/i/2016/038/f/7/jhin_meme_by_mikouchan-d9qyb6a.png","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-08T06:40:17.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, I have to respect that xD","replies":[]}]}]}
