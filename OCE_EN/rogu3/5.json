The ARAM meta is interesting, to be blunt the ARAM meta is what actually put me off summoners rift. Seeing champions like Yasuo and Katarina feed their asses off because they have no idea how to play a game they can&#039;t solo carry is so cathartic.\r\n\r\nHowever the abyss meta has its King... And unfortunately that King is Fiddlesticks.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not his terrify or his passive, it&#039;s not his drain or his ult... It&#039;s his gosh fricking darn bird...\r\n\r\nOn the rift it&#039;s rare for Fiddle to be able to hit all 5 people with his bird, which is why it&#039;s so impactful when it does happen.\r\n\r\nOn the abyss, it&#039;s rare for fiddles bird to not hit/ bounce back to the majority of your team.\r\n\r\nRiot talk a lot about balance, primarily how much effort something requires to pull off, verses how much effort it requires to play against.\r\n\r\nCounter play should be more difficult, yes. But when the counter play is your entire time positioning extremely carefully from Fiddlesticks and each other in case someone forgets they aren&#039;t allowed to try and poke Fiddles team... It&#039;s a horrible environment to be in, and I see so much flame because someone &quot;brought the bird into the team.&quot; \r\n\r\nIt&#039;s not difficult to do, it&#039;s not skilful, it&#039;s not intelligent and it definitely isn&#039;t fun to play against.\r\n\r\nThere isn&#039;t a change that can balance him in both games modes, and playing against a Fiddlesticks has to be one of the most annoying parts of ARAM.\r\n\r\nI vote he be greyed out on the howling abyss. It&#039;s not like certain champions haven&#039;t been restricted from certain things before...","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-30T22:40:20.203+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"whos fiddlesticks?","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-01-31T02:07:27.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lE9KGfFF,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-01-30T22:40:20.203+0000)\n>\n> whos fiddlesticks?\n\n*who's","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-31T04:38:36.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really helpful comment....","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-01-31T02:07:06.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are many strong champions in ARAM, {{champion:9}}  does not top that list.\n\nIs he strong?

Second, try.

The fact that it silences isn't the problem at all.\n\nLike I brought up, how much effort fiddlesticks has to put in to win a game, is way lower then the ENEMY TEAM has to put into winning against Fiddle.\n\n1/5 of the people on your team have to make the tiniest mistake AND BAM.
