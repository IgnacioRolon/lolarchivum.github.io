{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-19T08:20:34.397+0000","title":"Champion concept.","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot like to use archetypes in their champion design, which is something I respect, it allows us to have so many champions with such varied abilities.\nI cant help but notice that one particular archetype has gone completely untouched. Also, if I&#039;m not mistaking, we are overdue for a new support :P\n\n(Champion name) The Cheerleader \n\nP - While The Cheerleader is standing still or using emotes, all of her allies around her receive bonus health and resource regeneration. Weak early, strong late, to justify her standing still for brief pockets in a full on team fight.\n\nQ - The cheerleader throws forth one of her pom poms, once landing it will detonate in a massive area. Enemies hit by the confetti are slowed, allies are sped up. The spell leaves no AOE, and the confetti does not linger. Targets must be hit by the immediate blast to receive the effects.\n\nW - Passive. If the cheerleader can land 3 auto attacks on an enemy unit in a row, the target will become taunted. Duration scaling with rank.\n\nE - The cheerleader may activate this ability to bounce from the heads of three ally targets. Each charge only lasts 1.5 seconds, and if the cheerleader fails to choose a new target, she will flip back down to the floor. While atop a target, the Cheerleader will take a portion of damage they receive for them while being untargetable herself. Massive cool down. \nEDIT: Balancing issue. When the Cheerleader is on top of a target that uses a movement ability, what happens to the cheerleader?\nMy thought, she can travel with them during DASHES {{champion:236}} {{champion:105}} {{champion:67}} , could even do a cool animation where the Cheerleader flips from the targets starting point to their ending point.\nBut if the person she is on top of uses a BLINK {{champion:81}}{{champion:57}}  {{summoner:4}} , she will be dropped as if her charge ran out. \n\nR - The cheerleader throws out a red or blue pom pom, binding with a target ally. If the target has more AD than AP, they will be bestowed with ALL of the cheerleaders AD. If the target has more AP than AD, they will receive half of her AP. While the cheerleader has bestowed stats to another, she no longer has access to them, and will thus be very vulnerable herself. The duration of the effect will scale with rank, and would end immediately following the death of the Cheerleader. \n\n\nJust an idea, nothing is really set in stone, the concept is more important than the abilities I could come up with :)\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-19T09:06:39.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually like the base principal of the abilities\nthe passive might be that when she emotes not stands still because you can emote and run, giving something for the LCS try hards to chew on.\nthe W might need an active to compliment her ability, perhaps attack speed buff or each of her next few attacks apply a debuff\nthe Ult seems strong but the duration is a little out of the question\nmaybe just have it for a set time, but cancels early in the event of her death","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-19T09:39:10.560+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your feedback very much, very good suggestions :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-01-20T07:14:20.009+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"no worries\nconsider checking out mine as well if you want some ideas","replies":[]}]}]}]}
