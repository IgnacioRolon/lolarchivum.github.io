The vast majority of people who play ARAM, see it as a casual game mode that you go into when you&#039;re on tilt or just wanna have some fun. I&#039;ve been playing the ARAM mode almost exclusively for the last year, and I have definitely noticed that my games are becoming far more competitive and far more difficult.\r\n\r\nTo the casual ARAM player, this guide might just be a little boost to your success, but to people like myself who play this mode as our primary game, the information below could make a world of difference to you. Let us begin.\r\n\r\n**Counter building.** -A short note. All you require is a familiarity with defensive items and you should be able to construct a full build during the games loading screen. Far, far too often do I see people rushing an armor item against a team with 4 AP and vice versa. Too much faith in recommended items, mayhaps? :P\r\n\r\n**be a part of your team, not apart from your team.** This is the primary reason I made this post. Too often when we have a tank initiator on our team, will they fly in to engage, no pings, no warnings, and no regard for their team mates. They will then proceed to die, and type something along the lines of &quot;This team is shit, I engaged why did you all run away.&quot; \r\n\r\nTo explain my point here, I just want to talk quickly about crowd control. Crowd control, in my opinion is something that is definitely balanced around the higher tiers of play. Typically if the Morgana can land her dark binding on the enemy marksmen, her marksmen will be able to pick up the kill most of the time.\r\nIn my ELO, when I play Morgana support, my marksman will usually finish csing the next minion or two, and sort of half heartedly fire off a skill shot in my aid.\r\n\r\nCrowd control is only meaningful if it is utilized. If you&#039;re playing Amumu, and you bandage toss yourself in and ult as an engage, who is making use of your Q cc? who&#039;s making use of your ult? If you&#039;ve gone ahead like that so your team can &#039;catch up&#039; you better be pretty convinced your team has a much stronger team fight, because your team just spent possibly their strongest team fight ability on &#039;starting a fight.&#039; \r\nSometimes, engaging ahead of your team is the right call, but I stress this would be the case in probably one out of thirty cases.\r\nYou&#039;re more often than not better off waiting till your team is engaged on, and then using your utility so your team can focus down their primary target.\r\nThat&#039;s not only Amumu I&#039;m talking about, that&#039;s across the board. One of the only &#039;engage tanks&#039; that I&#039;ve seen have success when going ahead of the team to engage is Sejuani, and even still, I&#039;d argue her ult is still better suited to be used during a team fight, rather than to start a fight.\r\n\r\nJust remember, you&#039;re one person. Play to the other four, don&#039;t expect the other four to play to you.\r\n\r\n**Battle lines.** This can be a touchy subject, because we are essentially putting 140~ champions into two categories. The back line, comprised of damage dealers and squishies that can assist your damage dealers. The front line, people who are able to defend the back line.\r\n**WHO ARE ABLE TO DEFEND THE BACK LINE.**\r\nThere are few things that bother me more, than a front line of divers. This is something that might be more ARAM exclusive than most of the things discussed here, but if the enemy team has a fed mage, or almost any assassin, under no circumstance should the front line be charging into the back line.\r\n{{champion:51}} Oh a team fight, this should be easy.\r\n{{champion:111}} I&#039;m going in.\r\n{{champion:51}} ...In? ... where?\r\n*Nautilus proceeds to dive past the front line and pop his full combo onto the enemy Jinx. Reducing her to half health.*\r\n{{champion:51}} Oh my, that was indeed some impressive damage from someone who is building full resistances.\r\n{{champion:111}} ty I try v hard.\r\n{{champion:51}} It&#039;s just a shame that while you were &#039;bothering&#039; Jinx, their Garen and Zed just wandered over to us and uh... well...\r\n{{champion:111}} /all gg shit team\r\nOnce more. \r\n**WHO ARE ABLE TO DEFEND THE BACK LINE.**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Itemization** You might be thinking, &#039;jesus christ, shut up you already covered items.&#039; Now, while you might be sort of right, there are a few more points I wanted to make further about tank itemization that I felt deserved their own category.\r\nFirstly, please stop building sunfire cape. Not all together, just not every game.\r\n{{champion:86}} But we are always team fighting, the passive damage does so much work!\r\nNo, no it really doesn&#039;t. Also since when is sunfire a team fighting item? I was always under the impression that you rush this to help you win 1v1s up in top lane and push the minions. It has it&#039;s purpose, absolutely but I feel like most people that are building this item could be building a locket instead.\r\n{{champion:55}} LOCKET IS FOR SUPPORT VIOLENCE SOLVES EVERYTHING.\r\nOh, so sunfire Garen is going to carry us to victory? Ever since locket lost it&#039;s passive aura, I am seeing a lot less of it in ARAMs, but I feel like a vast majority of people underestimate the impact this item can have. The shield is downright massive. It might be a bit of broad statement, but I honestly feel like every champion who isn&#039;t hard carrying the game should be building locket. The combined shielding will do so much more work than &gt;50 magic damage a second. At level 18 this shield can prevent 665 damage. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but that&#039;s about the size of the shield you get from {{item:3003}}, but doesn&#039;t cost 20% of your mana, has a shorter cooldown and applies to everyone nearby?\r\nNow imagine if two people on your team had this item?\r\nThree?\r\n\r\n\r\nI will be overjoyed if even a single person makes use of this information, I look forward to seeing you on the abyss!\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"MoNkEyFiReS","date":"2017-02-06T02:26:06.702+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I completely get you dude. I play tank a lot because I don't trust my ally gragas or maokai to go tank even when they are the most viable tank. I've gone tank fizz and nidalee (some of the weird ones) because I know they will always go damage xD Used to live off ARAM, still is my favourite mode.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-06T04:20:39.862+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for this comment, I really appreciate it :)\nIt might be a little more meta than tank Fizz, but I've often gone tank Evelynn in my ARAMs. Invisible disruption tanks are fun! Haha\nSpecially if you get a rylais somewhere around the middle of your build. So terrifying :P","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-02-05T13:54:45.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you see Nasus, Nautilus, Amumu, and Malphite in ARAM go full AP...","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T15:10:06.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Full AP Nasus I'm all for, I hate playing against him, but boy have I seen him do work.\n\nBut yeah, when our only tank builds full AP, and is like \"it's supposed to be fun, guys!\"\n\nYep.
