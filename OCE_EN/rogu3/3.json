Just did a whole bunch of reading from posts as old as 2014 about this subject. Seems the ARAM community has been talking about it since the launch of howling abyss.\n\nThe general consensus seems to be that ranked ARAM would be based on luck, and that it would be dominated by smurfs.\n\nI do see some sense here, if the enemy team rolled a Sona, the constant healing and shielding will be hard to deal with. But does this not sound similar to the ranting we hear out of my ELO? \n&quot;Champion X is overpowered because of their core mechanic! I don&#039;t want to buy specific items to counter people!&quot;\n\nAlso, why would there be more smurfs in ranked ARAM than in regular ranked?\n\nA fellow summoner put forward his idea on a reddit forum, basically your entire team goes into the lobby, the final 3 people on each time will be banning. (Done like this to support however your team Comp is turning out. Also to snatch away potential synergy from the enemy team.)\n\nSummoner one on your team and summoner one on the enemy team have their champions rolled. At this point summoner two, three, four and five can declare they want summoner ones champion, and ask them to hold it. Summoner one can also reroll if they have the potential.\nThis will continue down the line until 6 champions are banned and 10 champions are rolled.\nYou will be able to trade with anyone that already has their champion, so long as you yourself have a champion.\n\nHonestly, I adore this concept. While it may be true that some champions are stronger than others on the abyss, I believe the same is true for the twisted tree line and summoner's rift. \n\nGood coordinated team fighting trumps any individual &#039;strong pick.&#039;\n\nAdditionally, watching professional ARAM games would be so, damn, exciting.\n\nBefore people try and tell me &quot;it&#039;s a causal game mode,&quot; let me just say that I&#039;m aware of that. Just like normals. Which would be the reason I am asking for a ranked version.\n\nI genuinely believe the ARAM community is large enough, and the META is unique enough to warrant its own ranked queue with its own terms of entry.\n\nI welcome your feedback, positive and negative.\nJust remember, ranked 3v3 was debated back and forth for ages before it was finally implemented.\nTrue, it wasn&#039;t wildly successful, but there are a lot of people who have devoted themselves to treeline Ranked.\n\nI think it&#039;s also worth noting the ARAM community is much, much larger than the treeline community.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-05T15:27:36.924+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"While there is a little skill, making a ranking system for a game mode based solely on luck is kinda dumb.\n\nFyi tt ranked has been around for yonks... i remember playing it back in 2010 on my old account.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T17:04:41.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"The game mode is not based around luck. Honestly it makes me so angry when I read people saying that. The heart of ARAM is team fighting. Fighting well as a team makes up for the enemy having stronger picks than you. Utilizing your crowd control, focussing the right targets. The game is not won in champion select. I've been on the rough end of so many 4v5s that my team has managed to turn around. I've been in a game where the enemy team had a Fiddlesticks, a Lux, a Xerath and a Ziggs. After ten minutes of being boned my team had an actual conversation about what we could do. The more informed players shared advice on itemization, and our tank laid out a plan of engage. This happened in less than a minute. We ended up winning that game, and I promise you it had nothing to do with luck, it was five people working together.\n\nI'm aware that tt ranked has been around for awhile, yet I have read some of the posts regarding its creation while gathering information on this idea.\nIt was heavily argued over, and many, many people made the comment \"why make a ranked mode out of a casual game that the champions aren't even balanced around?\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-02-05T15:23:25.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats the entire problem though \"all random\" it isnt the better pick on the day, or the better play on the day, it is jsut luck. you cant get a ranking system out of luck alone.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T17:07:41.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said I would welcome all comments, positive and negative, but I'm really sick to death of being told ARAM is all about luck.\nLux isn't a strong pick if you can't land a skillshot.\nEven if it's a good lux, she's not going to be worth anything if she doesn't know how to position in team fights.\n\nIn a ranked system, the higher you went up the ladder, the less the 'lucky' picks would mean. Notice anything about the strong ARAM champs? they are mostly the ones that dominate solo queue bronze.\nBlitzcrank. Zyra. Sona. Fiddle. \nPeople that know these champions and know their weaknesses know how to play against them. That doesn't change just because the floor is a different colour.","replies":[]}]}]}
