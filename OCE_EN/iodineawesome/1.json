When you are chating to someone, what you say does not follow the other person&#039;s speech, but goes after what you first say. It doesn&#039;t really effect the game but I just wanted to let you guys know of this. Also the times seem to be wrong. Example:\n[9:58AM] IodineAwesome: Hey\ngame?\nu start plz\nok :)\nis your chat being weird?\nlike its not putting the words after mine?\n[10:52AM] : ok seeya\n[7:23PM] nyanswag3076: hi\nsure\nok just hang on fixing my rune book\nyea\nyea\n[8:16PM] : i gtg for dinner","replies":[{"poster":"A Coiled Viper","date":"2016-01-16T08:39:04.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im having exactly the same problem.
