I was just wondering, because of this I now have to wait a LONG time before I can play because I have disconnected from too many games because I cant press anything. So I was wondering of it was possible to wipe how many times I&#039;ve &#039;quit game/champion select&#039; because really its not my fault and others are having the same issue. I&#039;m a bit frustrated with the waiting to play thing :/","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-14T14:03:13.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nRegarding the actual issue you're experiencing, this has been acknowledged by Riot and they're working on a fix, see [this](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/hprhLF4v-61-champion-select-bug-unable-to-select-champion-after-changing-summoner-spells) thread for more information and for how YOU can help speed up the fix.\n\nNow onto your other question, unfortunately leaverbuster is an automated system and punishments through said system cannot be reversed, even when such issues occur.
