( his is mid lane I'm talking about no longer use for support)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schweetie","date":"2016-05-05T11:19:08.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with many things here. I am a zyra main and although i can zone well, she steals too much cs for support and is now too predictable to play around as mid (esp against dash champs that stomp on those seeds). Her damage to champions is waaayyyy lower now and especially with the removal of her old passive, there is just no burst anymore. Compared to new brand, malthazar and existing champs such as le blanc, zed and even diana, she is too weak.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-04T22:46:19.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Coming from a zyra main I both love and absolutely hate the change. I'm fine with all the actual changes and she feels great to play with. What I don't like is the fact they absolutely gutted her damage capability.\n\nShe has flat out gone from a pseudo mid zone burst mage into a zoning  utility sustained support mage.\n\nRiot you released her as a mid champion. Give her some damage back please.","replies":[{"poster":"Pararnore","date":"2016-05-04T23:11:23.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is her damage really that bad now? I haven't played her, I've just seen gameplay (keep getting adc over mid today..)\nShe can't 100-0 people anymore in like .5 seconds? :( EWWQR was literally instant death if they didn't have any tank stats. I now hate the update LOL (as an assassin/burst mage player)","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-05-05T03:25:17.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is. I caught out the enemy support in one game (brand). I was lvl 11 and he was lvl 9. I had big rod, completed boots and completed frost queen. I used my full combo (EWQWR - correct combo) and did maybe 40% damage to the brand.\n\nIf that isn't absolutely gutted dmg wise I don't know what is. I would have killed him extremely easily pre rework.\n\nGG Riot GG","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-05-04T23:26:17.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not a Zyra main, but I found being sup with her last night more difficult as I was stealing a lot of cs when I cast my e and accidentally hit a random seed.
