The way Zyra would look here is that she would be in/on a flower/rose which has 4 major vines as legs.\r\n\r\n_Zyra Rework/Update Idea._ Zyra starts the game in her Bramble Form\r\n\r\n**Passive- Root Network**\r\nWhen Zyra and her plants attack the same target they all do x increased damage to that target. Zyra and her plants are connected, if Zyra leaves the plants alone they go dormant and begin to wither. (x second lifespan when left alone, maximum of x plants)\r\n\r\n_**Q- Deadly Bloom/Rise of the Thorns**_\r\n**Deadly Bloom:** Zyra sets a seed sprouting a Thorn Spitter in a targeted area which is under Zyra&#039;s control attacking Zyra&#039;s targets. (Seeds stored periodically, up to a maximum of 2 stored at once)\r\nThorn Spitter- (Ranged, immobile)\r\n\r\n**Rise of the Thorns:** As Zyra is out (not in flower), she unleashes Thorns all around her travelling outwards (similar to Nautilus E, travels faster), dealing damage and reducing enemy&#039;s magic resist for x seconds. The first wave/closest thorns are greater in size causing enemies hit by these to be knocked up for 1 second.\r\n\r\n_**W- Rampant Growth/Grasping Roots**_\r\n**Rampant Growth:** Target Vine Lasher/Thorn Spitter over grows causing it to combust, spraying thorns.  If more plants are nearby when one is combusted the effect chains onto them increasing the explosion radius and damage. The plant that was first targeted with this spell heals for the portion of the damage dealt not the ones that chain with the explosion. (more damage with more plants)\r\n\r\n**Grasping Roots:** Zyra sends a surge of vines in the targeted direction, dealing damage to enemies hit and rooting them.(like the E we have on Zyra now but travels faster, and root duration lower) If grasping roots passes over a Vine Lasher seed, the seed sprouts with increased attack speed for 4 seconds.\r\nVine Lasher- (attacking enemies with short ranged attacks that slow its target by 30% for 2 seconds, they also chase after the most recent attacked champion by Zyra or one of her plants, Zyra can&#039;t control Vine Lashers but they do interact with Zyra&#039;s passive Root Network, they also wither over time, 10 second lifespan)\r\n\r\n_**E- Regrow/Stranglethorn Shield**_\r\n**Regrow:**\r\n_Active-_ Zyra targets one of her plants (Thorn Spitter) which then burrows under the ground, dormant. Second cast, targeted area causes the plant to regrow there. (Used to reposition plants/Thorn Spitters)\r\n\r\n_Passive-_ When a Thorn Spitter is destroyed by Rampant Growth it leaves a Vine Lasher seed behind/in its place planted (invisible, these seeds have a 30 second life span. only 2 of the destroyed plants would plant a Vine Lasher seed, if chained with W destroying multiple plants). Every time Zyra uses Rampant Growth on a plant she heals for x amount.\r\n\r\n**Stranglethorn Shield:** Zyra encases herself or a plant in a thicket of thorny vines granting a shield, when enemies attack Zyra or the plant the vines spring from the shield and latch onto the attacker, constricting them. This effect ends after 10 seconds where the vines then wither or if the enemy retreats to a certain distance causing the vines to break. If Zyra/plant is nearby other plants the vines would latch onto the nearby plants as well granting them a weaker shield but also has the same effect against enemy champions. (Enemy champions who attack plants with the shield have vines attach onto them ect...)\r\n\r\n_**R- Blossom/Bramble**_ (4 second cooldown)\r\n**Blossom:** Zyra&#039;s brambles unwind as her flower opens revealing her and granting her a new set up devastating abilities. (Increased basic attack range and  and movement speed in this form.)\r\n\r\n**Bramble:** Zyra withdraws into her flower closing, covered by brambles (Thorned vines) protecting her. (Zyra has increased defences and mana regeneration. Zyra has decreased basic attack range in this form.)\r\n\r\n_**&quot;Closer to the flower, closer to the thorns.&quot;**_\r\n-**Zyra** {{champion:143}} \r\n\r\n_**Bramble Form**_\r\n-Deadly Bloom\r\n-Rampant Growth\r\n-Regrow\r\n-Blossom\r\n_**Blossom Form**_\r\n-Rise of the Thorns\r\n-Grasping Roots\r\n-Stranglethorn Shield\r\n-Bramble","replies":[{"poster":"Willi God","date":"2016-02-09T07:57:33.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would you even consider reworking a champion as smooth, unique and balanced as Zyra?","replies":[{"poster":"BTWAN","date":"2016-02-09T08:29:17.240+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"smooth, unique, balanced and clunky? srs her passive is weird and doesn't really fit in with her kit? she is super slow at the same time squishy? \n\n* Her plants have way to few hp...they literally have 5 hp and can be killed by anything and everything: \n\nJust hitting it, any form of AoE, tower hits, just any dmg effect that is in the game can and will hit those plants and since they have 5 hp that means that WHATEVER you throw at them they instadie which kinda makes them completely useless in pretty much any fight especially teamfights!\n\n* Plants do not focus champions or at least not always, very often I had double plants right on top of a champion and they just shot the minions next to it which makes the slow of the e spell kinda useless (clunky/buggy aka AI)\n\n*  Her passive shouldn't take that long to arm, I feel like once people know what Zyra can do they will just run away way too quickly before you get to actually shoot them and since the range is ok but the width (and to some extent the speed) of the shot is really small you can just juke it easily especially with champions like Graves / Vayne / Fizz / Trynda / etc.\n\n* Her ultimate could be a tad quicker in arming, not that much but it feels like forever until they get knocked up and unless they're permaslowed they will prolly just walk out of it (ofc you could snare them into the ult which is what I did to prevent them from walking out of it)\n\n* Like I said before, Extremely squishy and low Mobility- due to how her harass works, Zyra naturally pushes the lane, making you very vulnerable to ganks. Couple this with low mobility, being extremely squishy and you have a very dangerous early game.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-09T10:00:36.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically if suck at playing said champ it should be reworked?

You realise your plants to a SHT TON of damage, her ultimate isn't about knocking people up, of course it does knock them up if they stay long enough, but it does a ton of damage it forces their team to split if used correctly or they are forced to be knocked up, Zyra is a very smooth champion, you q, seed, plant comes out, no champion can sit there 1v1ing a plant they will get destroyed. \n\nZyra is a great champion in a game of horribly designed champions, They already ruined Graves - My favourite ADC, I'd rather they not ruin Zyra as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"onguana","date":"2016-02-10T01:15:39.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would prefer if they treated her more like Illaoi allowing her to spawn plants without using abilities","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-09T13:18:44.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If anything just change the passive.
