I strongly believe custom games should be more customisable. e.g. select starting level, select starting gold, select starting time. This will be a very efficient way for example a {{champion:11}}  verses {{champion:11}}  with different builds, testing which one does more base damage. It will also create a funner environment for all players to enjoy. Just as riot is able to create champion spotlight videos with minions staying still, not to that extent i would like to strongly urge us taking a step forward and better ourselves at league with this creation of more customisable games. I&#039;ve recently heard dota has released a simular feature and, not to try copy, would love for such a thing to be implemented within the league of legends society. Let us not say {{champion:150}} but instead {{champion:245}}  this plea among the society and begin this road to the true custom games. Thank you very much for reading\r\n\r\nTl:dr: Lets make custom games more customisable by adding starting golds and champions level / time{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-11T02:48:08.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice idea!","replies":[]}]}
