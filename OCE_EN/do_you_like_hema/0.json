Hopefully they'll be able to help you get the username of your old account so that you'll be able to log in and continue using it.\n\nJust as an idea, if you have an email prompting you to change the username of the account, can you try clicking the link in that and see if it brings up the correct account during the process?\n\nEDIT: I've just been told by someone that their username was auto-updated to use lowercase letters in place of uppercase letters. If your username did user any uppercase letters, can you try using all lowercase and see if that allows you to log in?","replies":[]}]}
