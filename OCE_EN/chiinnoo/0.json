This problem does not come from my pc specs or internet, my internet is fairly good ( http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/5003396009 ) and my pc also has quite good specs, but ever since yesterday I have not been able to play a single game without rubber banding issues. I have been attacking the enemies and minions, nothing would happen, then 7-9 seconds later everything that I had requested previously would happen then, death, attacks, abilities, damage, ALL OF IT. I cannot control any of this. If anybody has a fix or has the same problem please comment below!","replies":[{"poster":"Oklam","date":"2016-01-17T20:19:45.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chiinnoo, I have the same problem as you since the matchmaking patch (the new fancy one). Nothing have been done so far. My pc have very good specs, speed tests and such, resetted my router and cable, still the same. Random spikes, champion won't move for 3-4 secs then everything come back to normal. I hope Riot will fix it BEFORE ranked season.","replies":[{"poster":"chiinnoo","date":"2016-01-17T22:59:39.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please reply to me if you have fixed it somehow :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"chiinnoo","date":"2016-01-17T22:58:54.682+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg, this is so annoying, I hope it gets patched because I can only play ai right now D:","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-18T04:05:09.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nSucks to hear you are having this kind of issue.  It sounds very much like packet loss to me, and that can be caused by any number of things on the path between your computer and the LoL servers.\n\nHere are a few tools you can use to check over the issue yourself, and maybe get started on looking for the solution.\n\n* [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) - Riot Support\n* [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/) - Put game logs into this from games where you've had the problems described, and it will show you a graph of ping / packet loss for the whole game.\n* [Run a trace route](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2) between you and the OCE servers.  This will help show the network path from your computer, through any ISPs, to the League server.\n\nAlso - What ISP do you guys have, and what location are you in?\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"chiinnoo","date":"2016-01-19T02:12:59.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"UPDATE: MY PING AND PACKET LOSS GOT MAGICLY FIXED","replies":[]},{"poster":"chiinnoo","date":"2016-01-18T09:11:56.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sooooo...
