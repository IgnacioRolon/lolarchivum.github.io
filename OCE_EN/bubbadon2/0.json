Is there another way to refund some champs (as I&#039;ve spent past week trying to save up for a champ and still haven&#039;t gotten close to it so want to refund champs I&#039;ve never played for them) or some way I can have this fixed?\n\nThanks &lt;3\n\nEdit: I should also not most of my purchases have been with RP/IP rather than BE.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-18T10:23:30.240+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Purchase history only shows a set timeframe (30 days I think?) so if you haven't purchased anything/opened any chests/used any tokens in that time the nothing will show. You can only refund things while they remain in your purchase history afaik.\n\nI'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support as they can give you more comprehensive info: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI wouldn't however recommend using your refunds on BE content. Tempting as it is early, that very thing is what a lot of people regret using their refunds on later. You can always get more BE, it's only a time investment, the same is not true for RP.","replies":[{"poster":"Bubbadon2","date":"2018-12-18T11:16:22.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've submitted a ticket through that link, thanks for the help. And yeah its for my alt account so won't be spending RP on it anyway so will be worth it for me (I also don't have the disposable income for RP purchases anyway). So given that I'm pretty sure the purchases were about 5-6 years ago I'm guessing my chances aren't great?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-18T13:06:24.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahah yeah I wouldn't say that's likely.

Two of my refunds were IP purchases for champs I now play and love, and weren't even 6300 at the time, all because I was new to the game and impatient. Would have been nice to use those on some skins instead. I know I'm not the only one in that boat, but there are of course still people in the other boat.\n\nI was just confused at the 6-7 years ago.
