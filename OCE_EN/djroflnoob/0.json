I wanted to say that the LeaveBuster feature in my opinion does not take into &#039;negative externalities&#039; benign to other players. I personally have been an individual that has AFK&#039;ed, however in this circumstance your server, or my internet, it doesn&#039;t matter, was to blame. An example. Temperatures in Australia commonly saw past 40 degrees and ISP&#039;s crash constantly. Another is UNKNOWN disconnection issues that cannot be resumed without game restart/relog. In these instances a 20 minute penalty CANNOT be rationalised. Penalties are building into resent for a game i love. I don&#039;t want to see this game turn into something I love to hate. \r\n\r\n---&gt; issue has occurred again after I pulled the team to victory after my very brief absence due to server diconnect. SORT IT OUT","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-20T13:04:03.341+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny how you blame uncontrollable issues, and even use temperatures of Australia as an example, yet I, as well as several other people I know, have never even got the \"I agree not to leave\" pop-up from such issues. And some of those people are intentional leavers on the rare occasion. Just accept your connection obviously isn't stable enough for a game that requires a stable connection and deal with it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-04-21T07:57:23.137+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n It would have to take a large amount of leaving to actually trigger leaver buster. If you are constantly getting leaver busted for issues you can't control, don't play league. Don't ruin someone else's game because you, yourself, can't seem to get a stable connection. Go play customs or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-20T12:04:16.626+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"just watch the latest my little pony episodes while you are in que?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rikin","date":"2015-04-20T12:51:33.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not supposed to take into account 'negative externalities'. It's a simple measure of \"Did this person leave this game, and has he already accumulated enough leaves to warrant a penalty\". Me, I think it's pretty fair system. Clearly if someone cannot keep a stable connection and they keep wrecking games they can't expect not to be punished.","replies":[]}]}
