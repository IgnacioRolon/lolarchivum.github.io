This has resulted in a 2 week suspension placed on your account.\r\n\r\nHere are some Chat logs from games where you displayed offensive behavior:\r\n\r\n[3:14] Bright Dusty (Morgana): wow\r\n[3:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i can tell\r\n[7:11] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i wantyed to back cait pls use heal im so sick of adcs you cant use summoenrs it happens to often kid\r\n[10:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): whjy heal after i die? pls tell me\r\n[12:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls come bot gravesn and help get this tower im roaming if you wontr\r\n[17:27] Bright Dusty (Morgana): im not kidding you guys catn even use basic sumnmoenrs\r\n[21:13] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cass flash ultri\r\n[22:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait\r\n[30:29] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait why do you nerver ulti?\r\n[31:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls stop absuing me i just noticed you leave summoenrs up so long and barely ulti\r\n[35:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait real pls use summoenrs\r\n\r\nThese are examples of berating your teammates by asking overly sarcastic questions with malcious intent. We will not be lifting the suspension due to the negativity observed.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if audited again for negative behavior your account will be permanently suspended. The good news is that most players will never reach that level of punishment. In fact, most players who have been warned or suspended are able to change their behavior completely; I am confident that with the right attitude you can avoid any bans in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\npls lets have a constructive discussion, i get people dont like what i say but is a 2 week ban worth, my second one in a month, also after each punishment i try to and want to improve my behavior.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-02-17T01:00:53.296+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yours is a case where you don't seem to be explicitly abusive, but you still get reported a TON. You seem like a nice enough guy, but straight up, I think it's because your teammates find your constant demands to answer your questions annoying. You claim you're trying to communicate with your teammates, but all you're really doing is making a point of their mistakes or things you aren't satisfied with and you won't drop it until they do what you want.\nThey just want you to play the game and stop distracting the team with useless chat.

endless questions, very passive agressive\"\n\n\"we did a mistake at the start of the game. since then, this person keeps harassing me with that mistake i did at the start. please look into this persons attitude. also the enemy team says that he wont be banned. I assure you, he deserves to be for this.\"\n\n\"left bot-lane the whole game because draven wasnt talking and didnt put down a trinket\"\n\n\"picked ezreqal support after about 5 mins left bot lane and didnt come back leaving me bot to 2v1 for pretty much the rest of lanning phase\"\n\n\"talking a lot of shit all game\"\n\n\"Spam pinging cooldowns.

When I mentoin in game about players to use summoner abilities, or ultimate abilities that is considered overly toxic? The punishment doesn't clearly fit the game. I'm not going to act innocent, I get reported a lot, if I see a player ruining my game I dont abuse, I ask them to use sumoners, to use abilities. If you check the stats in the game you will notice how often they were left up. I don't need to be sarcastic nor do I want to. If you check the stats they used the ultimate ability about 2 to 4 times in that game. Now I know regardless of what another play does shouldn't effect how I respond, but this is clearly the point asking them to Pls use summoner abilities and skills. I'm asking people not abuse me and you put that as a reason im getting a 2 week ban, it's obvious you are grabbing at straws. I dont understand how saying ' can't Pls use summoner' contributes to my 2 week ban. I'm not being sarcastic check the stats they had major trouble using and I'm asking them to use an ability which is otherwise not being used. There is no malicious intent in what I'm doing. If I see a player who for some reason can't use basic features of the game I ask them to use. Trust me I've accepted my 2 week ban it's not about overturning it. Anyone who thinks this deserves a 2 week ban is very triggered and needs to relax. Anyway let's improve my behaviour and not just ban the account. Instead of the line of dialogue that you say is worst of the worst, what can I say other wise to players who abuse me? (And no I shouldn't have to mute someone to play this game so I don't have to mute them), players who can't use abilities? Players who can't use basic sumoners? Instead of saying glhf and ggwp what else can I say? I main support instead of being in lane where my lane partner can't use these abilities (check the stats, they have trouble using them) what do you suggest I can do in game to have a fun game, instead of being locked into a lane with a player who can't use basic gameplay mechanics. Fo the 11 lines of dialogue what can I do to improve the game in a positive way instead of using those direct lines of chat. I'm a direct kind of person, and I bring that in game and I guess players don't like to be questioned. But to ban my account, for 2 weeks seems overly toxic to me, anyway like I said let's improve the dialogue and my in game personality. Pls help me improve in game\n\nsorry, poor grammar and no paragraphs when doing 1 on 1 stuff cant be bothered. the point i was trying to make was that anything, literally anything in game could be negative, if reported. instead of doing what i do what can i do otherwise to someone who claims they've had to much weed and cant react quick enough. i could make a point about it, but cant be bothered, also about its not feedback i was giving more a suggestion in that is being confrontational, but not need to argue the point. also in the text there is apart where i say. \n\n \" Trust me I've accepted my 2 week ban it's not about overturning it.
