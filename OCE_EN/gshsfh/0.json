When I attempt to open the launcher, it comes up with: &quot;PVP.net Patcher Kernel has stopped working&quot;. I have googled possible solutions such as deleting the logs+ other stuff you need to delete; I have run it in compatibility mode with windows xp service pack 3 and have run it with administrator. I have looked at over 40 different links and I&#039;m running low on patience and hope. I was hoping somebody could help me as I am technologically retarded. I have windows 7. If you need any more information about my laptop, teach me how I find out that info first and I will be happy to share all my specs. Thank you :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-22T07:11:37.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First, read and keep an eye on [this discussion](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/qGggBnHi-lol-client-crash-may-22nd). But yours doesn't sound *quite* like what's happening there.\n\nCould you run dxdiag and show us what comes up on the Display tab? To do that, hit Winkey+R, then type \"dxdiag\" and hit Enter. Then, go to the Display tab. Either screen-shot it or just write what comes up there here.\n\nI'd rather wait until Riot have fixed the store-related client crash first, as this might just be some collateral damage from that.","replies":[{"poster":"gshsfh","date":"2015-05-22T13:48:27.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your comment, here is an image of my dxdiag display.\nhttp://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2yzj0w3&s=8#.VV8zafmqqko","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-23T01:28:17.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry, but I don't like to click random links on the internet.
