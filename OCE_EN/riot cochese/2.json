Unfortunately, this particular issue can&#039;t be mitigated by disabling a specific champion or item so we&#039;ve temporarily disabled Ranked while we develop a solution. We&#039;ll keep you updated with our progress as we continue triaging the issue.\n\n-Riot Cochese\n\n**UPDATE - 17/07/15, 11:11am AEST**\n\nWe have verified full functionality, and ranked queues, have been re-enabled in all regions. Thank you for your patience.\n\n**UPDATE - 17/07/15, 10:15am AEST**\n\nA fix has just passed our quality assurance tests and we are preparing a patch to fix the recall bug. You will not have a patch to download, we are able to fix this without patching to you. Once this is completed, we will re-enable Ranked and I'll post an update here. Thank you for your patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-07-16T20:45:00.687+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"We've tested our fix against the majority of champions in the time since our last update .
