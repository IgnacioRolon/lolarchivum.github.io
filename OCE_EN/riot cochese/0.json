We've known [this fix](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq9) to have some success but it does not work for everyone. We are investigating this issue and will try to keep everyone updated on the status.\n\nOther **possible** workarounds:\n\n- Player Maclman mentioned that [this](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664#wq9) works for them most of the time.\n- If the error appears, immediately switch to a tethered connection such as from a mobile phone and attempt to reconnect.\n- Alt+Tab and restart your PC as soon as the firewall error appears, then attempt to reconnect to game.\n\nEDIT:\nWhile we investigate the cause of the recent rise in firewall errors, it would help us a lot if you could run the network diagnostic tool. This will collect the necessary network details of affected players and hopefully we draw similarities and derive possible solutions.\n\n[Network Diagnostic Tool](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2015-01-16T02:22:51.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi guys \n\nOkay well i don't know if anyone else has this problem before but anyways.I log into lol like i do every day.I enter a queue like everyone else  does . I find a match i click on accept like normal. Then i select my champion like normal. But this is when the problem starts the lol closes. Then i have to wait about 7 mins for the lol logo to show up. By this time i have been classed as afk which means leave busters. Then once the logo comes up i get loading in but all i can see is my player card and my champion. No others champions just their names. My laptop is two weeks old okay and im on ultra fast broadband. Then the game crashes how am i meant to rank up when i cant even load into the rift .  So far im ready to punch my laptop in half. This is a problem that you need to fix riot. I have spent  over $300 on your game and this happens plz riot fix this. I'm getting sick of getting leave busters cos your game isn't working maybe if you spent more time on fixing your bugs and all the problems with league of legends instead of bringing out new skins maybe this problem wouldn't be happening so plz can you fix this bug.

At times I can see the connection is possibly being dropped within their network.\n\nOne of the other things I noticed was your connection couldn't give me a ping result to the google dns servers, which is quite strange.\n\nI would try:\n- Rebooting your Modem\n- Rebooting PC\n- Contacting your ISP and having them check your connection. Explaining your situation\n\nIf those things still don't help please let me know and we can do some further tests.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[{"poster":"ratheraverage","date":"2015-01-16T03:45:48.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"ToxicHawk","date":"2015-01-16T04:13:21.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ratheraverage,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=UWunwEot,comment-id=0002000000010000,timestamp=2015-01-16T03:45:48.253+0000)\n>\n> those had all been done before even posting. as had flushing ip leases, as requesting qos check from isp\n> \n> I can run a 1vs1 game but on exit cannot load stats.

They do not show up after low custom games.\n\nIn regards to the internet issues. I can only give you feed back on what your trace routes to our servers are telling me. The fact that your connection was having troubles sending packets and getting responses from Google DNS servers really stood out to me as a possible ISP issue.\n\nThis is the test from your log file that was sent to me:\n> Google: \n\n>Pinging 8.8.8.8 with 32 bytes of data:\nRequest timed out.\nRequest timed out.\nRequest timed out.\nRequest timed out.\n\n>Ping statistics for 8.8.8.8:\n    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss),\n\nAs you can see your connection was unable to receive any packets back.\n\nNow this is the same test from my pc:\n\n>ping 8.8.8.8\n\n>Pinging 8.8.8.8 with 32 bytes of data:\nReply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=60\nReply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=60\nReply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=60\nReply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=2ms TTL=60\n\n>Ping statistics for 8.8.8.8:\n    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n    Minimum = 2ms, Maximum = 2ms, Average = 2ms\n\nOne thing you could possibly try is changing your DNS servers to something other than your default (which is generally your router adn then from your router your ISP.)\nAn option to try is OpenDNS:\n- Primary DNS Server: 208.67.222.222\n- Alternate DNS Server: 208.67.220.220\n\nIf this resolves your issue it would appear the DNS servers you are routing through is not working as intended.\n\nAlternately a discussion with your ISP would need to be started and further testing with their engineers would need to occur so we can analyze this further.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-01-16T17:20:39.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thx for looking into the log, still hoping you will fix this please:)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-01-16T01:07:03.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's possible and we would like to work with you a bit more to better troubleshoot.\n\nCan you run this here: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/tools/network-logs and then send the results to toxichawk@riotgames.com\n\nWe will take a look and get back to you with our findings.
