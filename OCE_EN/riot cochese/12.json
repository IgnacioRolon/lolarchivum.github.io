The team is working on getting these champs fixed asap. \r\n\r\nI know that some of you will encounter issues as well, it happens.

The reddit thread goes into more details, but it definitely impacted game play and something we felt strongly enough to disable until a fix is made.\n\nCurious about the patching issue you have, what happens and what do you do manually as a work around? Maybe we can work together to figure this out.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-11T06:52:15.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply. I'm just interested in when things go wrong. Not because I'm pessimistic or anything, but it's so that I can learn from the past.\n\nI think I had a little discussion about this with Riot Gehirn (I can't find it, though). Basically, whenever a patch is dropped, my patcher gets to 32% and then \"An unspecified error has occurred.\" It stops right there until I close it. Retrying nets the same result.\n\nI found out that it's doing this because it's failing to create the tag in the correct location saying that the files have been downloaded/patched in correctly at a certain point. To manually fix this, I create a blank file (with no extension) named \"S_OK\" in the latest version folder inside the \"releases\" folder. Upon opening League's patcher again, it's automatically at 32% and it starts scanning files, then it downloads the rest of the patch and it's A-OK.\n\nI also noted that the \"S_OK\" file in consumed when this happens.\n\nPS: I use 'DISCUSSION' view, so it's probably more organised if you use the \"Reply\" button to reply to me, instead of adding it above my message.","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Cochese","date":"2015-06-12T07:03:17.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HORSE OF FORCE,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=WcLPlVFO,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2015-06-11T06:52:15.609+0000)\n>\n> Thanks for the reply.
