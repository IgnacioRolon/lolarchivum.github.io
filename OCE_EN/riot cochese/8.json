Ranked decay will be re-enabled on July 28 at 5:00AM AEST.\n\nThe time that&rsquo;s passed will still count against your inactivity period when decay is re-enabled, so if you&rsquo;ve taken a break, make sure to play a game before July 28 if you want to avoid the LP penalty. If you&rsquo;ve been playing consistently, this won&rsquo;t affect you at all. \n\nRanked decay refresher:\n\nBronze, Silver & Gold:\n\nThere&rsquo;s no decay in solo or team queues for these tiers.\n\nPlatinum & Diamond:\n\nSolo and team queues:\n\nAfter 28 days of inactivity in a particular ranked queue, you&rsquo;ll be hidden from the standings in your league. You&rsquo;ll also lose LP depending on your current tier. Every seven days thereafter, you&rsquo;ll lose LP until you play a match in that queue particular.\n\nMaster & Challenger:\n\nSolo queue:\n\nDecay sets in after 10 days of inactivity to ensure competition continues at the highest echelons of League. \n\nTeam queue: \n\nDecay occurs after 28 days to account for the difficulties of managing five (or more) player schedules.\n\nFind out more about ranked decay here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h7\n\n**UPDATE - Tuesday, July 28**\n\nThis is once again live and ranked decay is in effect.\n","replies":[{"poster":"troIIntemptation","date":"2015-08-04T06:00:40.561+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I heard Charlie {{item:3057}} Was Joining the Lague of Legends Tornament","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-25T05:44:02.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just need to confirm, is your mmr affected when decaying?\n\n\ni clicked the link but couldn't find the answer","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-25T07:50:58.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MMR doesn't decay.","replies":[{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-26T00:12:51.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=HQM1bbta,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-07-25T07:50:58.862+0000)\n>\n> MMR doesn't decay.\n\nAHHHHHHH YEAAAAAAAAAA","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-27T23:30:05.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It changes based on your league, e.g: Xin Zhao Emmersaries: If everyone is playing and you're not, then your mmr will not lower, but the average mmr will go higher, and you'll probably be playing with toxic people","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-06T13:13:09.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do not remember a time, or any given week I haven't ran into toxic players","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-06T23:12:30.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"R u in bronze???","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bill","date":"2015-08-05T05:58:36.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx","replies":[]}]}
