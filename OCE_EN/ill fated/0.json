I tried to reconnect a few times but it was gone for good so I quit. Today I get on league and see that I&#039;m in a low priority match making queue for 5games with 20mins waiting time... Riot please, I&#039;ve had this once before and it&#039;s hell to get over it, please get rid of it.","replies":[{"poster":"the true Viper","date":"2015-06-21T11:57:34.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Don't worry your not the only one. It just crashed again. Checked the net and my pc. everything is good. It has happened way too many times. I have losses due to the fact it me ten damn minutes just for league to register the was a game. I find re-logging generally works. sometimes it can take awhile. so getting fed up with it. The fact you got punished for a technical error. I thought the game was supposed to see problems and come up with \"lose prevented\" or something like that. Well hope they fix it soon.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T08:09:56.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I thought the game was supposed to see problems and come up with \"lose prevented\"\n\nNope. Loss prevented is for region-wide issues that affect the majority of players at the time. If a single server hosting a game shuts down and the people in it disconnect, loss prevented won't be enabled.","replies":[]}]}]}
