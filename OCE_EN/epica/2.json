Now i&#039;m not talking about tiny little things like telling people when to secure objectives, split push or group for team fights, i&#039;m talking about people who essentially tell other people how to play there champion, how to build there champion, and point out every little thing they think they&#039;re doing wrong because they believe they&#039;re &quot;helping&quot; (well some people just do it because they&#039;re salty) but 9x/10 this kind of backseat gaming just puts people on tilt and results in a loss for the team. Not only that some people are just so fixated on the way other people are playing they don&#039;t realize how poorly they&#039;re playing themselves and end up blaming there team for a loss which was actually mainly caused by there attitude towards there teammates/the game and the way they were playing, not there team. \r\n\r\nI personally believe that (if it isn&#039;t already) backseat gaming should be considered toxic behavior and in turn people should receive bans for it. \r\n\r\nOpinions?","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2015-10-21T06:47:31.992+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you ever tried giving someone constructive criticism about the way they give \"constructive criticism\"? \n\nPretty disastrous. They usually don't even realise what they're doing and won't have any of it. Hard to not see it as toxic at that point.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-21T12:30:44.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've given constructive criticism on someone giving non constructive criticism to a player flaming a feeder who's doing it on purpose because of personal problems with another player, I've seen worse, a conga line of pain and suffering going through every single player on the team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-21T12:28:41.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where both players are equal, never give specific champion advice unless you specifically say you main that champion first, and ask them what they're trying to build for.\n\nAlways give general advice.\n\nIf there's that one kid that goes \"I invited a level two player over in this match, so don't you dare say a word to him\", go crazy and help the player wherever possible","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lil Wilz","date":"2015-10-21T11:25:06.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree it is an annoying thing and doesn't help, but the word toxic gets used far too much to explain away things people don't like.\n\nit actually means for those who don't know, someone doing something negative that causes a ripple effect, an argument throughout the team, negative attitude throughout the team.\n\ntelling someone how to build their champ, isn't that.\n\nits hard to put emotion into text. specially when you are wasting time every time you talk to anyone in this game, costing yourself precious minutes every time you type. which is why people generally use short hand when they tell you how to build or do anything, and it sounds like an order, even though it may not be.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vilemaw Bot","date":"2015-10-21T09:57:30.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't consider it as a toxic behaviour unless they are insulting (laughing at) you while at it, what I mean is that if they have a negative attitude towards you that would mean it's toxic behaviour. If they are being a dick you can always just mute and report them but if they have been nothing but nice even though they are telling you how to play the champion then you could just tell them that you don't need their advice and you know what you are doing.
