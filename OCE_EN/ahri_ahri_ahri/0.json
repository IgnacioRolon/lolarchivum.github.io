I haven't played league in months because I've been having problems trying to get up the launcher. When I click my league icon it comes up with this small dark grey window with the new riot logo in white in the top left, under it a title saying \"COULDN'T UPDATE\" in capitals and the message \"Something went wrong with the update, even after repairing. Please contact our player support wizards so they can work their magic to get you a fix.\" I am on a mac. I was having these problems before I updated to Catalina, I've just updated and it's still having the same problems. I tried the hextech repair thing and it didn't do anything :( I've tried uninstalling and redownloading which actually makes it worse. A few months ago I use to be able to login in and play one session before closing it and having the problem come back. Then I use to be able to make it to the login screen. Now when I click the icon I get this error message right away. I have no knowledge of coding and fixing things like this. I've tried guides and whatnot and still no luck. I'm very confused please help me in any way you can ! and hopefully no big tech words.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-30T10:55:06.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nMost people here (and certainly I'm included) aren't too familiar with Mac, so you'll get much better info from them.","replies":[]}]}
