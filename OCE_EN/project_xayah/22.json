I&#039;ve only ever played 16 ranked games: the 6 I played in season 3 (absolutely terrible experience) and the 10 placements I went through in season 4 (during the last 36 hours of the season, placed Silver 3. It was a wonderful experience, everyone was so nice).\r\n\r\nMy point is, I&#039;m thinking about jumping into ranked before the season ends and seeing if I can get gold (Maokai&#039;s a bit of a favourite of mine, it would suck to miss out on his Victorious skin). I wanted to know what everyone thinks of this and maybe even get some advice.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n*(Probably)* The most autistic person here.","replies":[]}
