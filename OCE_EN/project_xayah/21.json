Again...","subforum":"GD","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I&#039;ve been suckered into playing league again and, honestly, I&#039;ve just given up trying to quit. I&#039;m done trying to kid myself, I&#039;ll be playing this smegging game until Riot goes bankrupt. I&#039;m going to (*try to*) take on a whole new mentality and just restrain myself from complaining. Feel free to take the piss if I stray (and if I [or Riot] say you shouldn&#039;t, just quote this because this is basically me giving you permission).\r\n\r\nOn another note, I&#039;m seeing a lot of new names on the boards. Are these new people or just the result of name-changes?\r\n\r\nAlso, what have I missed? Did the illegal immigrants finally get deported?","replies":[]}
