Ever since the announcement was made 2 weeks ago I&#039;ve not seen a single Rioter respond to any concerns without using a generic and/or half-assed comment that doesn&#039;t leave room for discussion. I want to believe the OCE Rioters are concerned about the OCE community but, when it comes to the server skin, I&#039;ve seen nothing that would suggest there&#039;s any truth to that statement.\r\n\r\nI want to know what your **personal** opinions are (and don&#039;t give me that &quot;I&#039;m not an expert&quot; crap like Ferlyn did, you don&#039;t have to be an expert to have an opinion).\r\n\r\nI want to know whether you think it&#039;s fair to the OCE community.\r\n\r\nI want to know whether you think Riot&#039;s excuse of &quot;we&#039;ve already given you a free skin&quot; is fair, considering it was only a skin they had &quot;lying around&quot; at the time when other servers have received multiple **free** skins that actually represent their region.\r\n\r\nI want to know whether you truly believe that &quot;Comsic Reaver Kassidin&quot; accurately represents OCE when pretty much every culture has placed some importance on stars, whether it be navigational, cultural, religious etc. and whether slapping a southern cross on the splash art makes it any more so even though Brazil, who have their own server and server skin, can also see the southern cross (it even appears on their flag).\r\n\r\nI want to know why it was never considered to make multiple skins to more accurately represent the server, as has happened with other servers (or at least why this was never mentioned to the community).\r\n\r\nAnd keep in mind here that I **know** at least one of you guys will see this thread. If no Rioter ever comments, that will lead me to believe you guys don&#039;t care. If the only Rioter comments are generic and/or half-assed then that will make me believe you only care about putting this community down. If you guys actually hold a discussion with the community about this, that will restore some of my faith in you guys, and I&#039;m sure many others will feel the same way.","replies":[]}
