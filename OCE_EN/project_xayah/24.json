I already run discord on my phone for the better speaker and less impact on my extremely low end system.\n\nI can't imagine that there is any problem with voice chat being used for abuse that wouldn't already be encountered through regular ingame chat, so I don't understand why overwatch can have voicechat but league can't. \n\nAlso whilst it's harder to automatically ban people for spoken discrimination and negative behaviour, it's alot easier to judge the tone and context of such language and determine if it's banter or serious abuse through a recording of voice (though i guess you would need to update the ToS and stuff for this).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-12-07T05:46:36.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that recording voice chat is a lot more space and resource intensive than recording text chat.
