Their names all seem to follow a certain set of guidelines, being that they are generally 2 names with the term &quot;V2&quot; used as well, sometimes multiple times. They *always* use the summoner spells heal and ghost and it appears they always end up feeding. They have no concept of turrets, consistently dying by taking *only* turret hits. They also appear to queue as either solo or with a &quot;partner&quot; bot.\r\n\r\nIf anyone encounters these player bots I implore you to report them in the post-game lobby for &quot;unauthorised 3rd party programs&quot; so Riot may remove them from the game as efficiently as possible.","replies":[]}
