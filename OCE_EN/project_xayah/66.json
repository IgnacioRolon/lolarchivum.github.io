Caleb could most always be found with Jinx, getting into all sorts of trouble, and Valor was either watching the two, or chasing after mice, and other varieties of rodent, at the far end of the oval, amongst the tree line.\n&lt;They&#039;ve never been this late...&gt; Quinn had been waiting for over an hour now, long enough that the first signs of night had started to appear in the sky. The three had a routine, and right now it was coming undone. She was starting to get worried, though she would never admit it.\nWith a long clang, Valor perched himself on the steel fence bordering the school, directing an apologetic squawk at Quinn. &quot;You&#039;re late...&quot; The two stared at each other in silence for a few moments, after which Valor broke eye contact and stared towards the ground, seemingly in regret. Out of everyone, Quinn had the best understanding of Valor&#039;s behaviour, but even she struggled to understand his body language at times.\n&quot;I would&#039;ve thought there&#039;d be nothing left out there for you to hunt by now.&quot; She commented, attempting to lighten the mood. She glanced back at the sky, noticing the first star of the night, concerned that they would fall behind schedule. They had an hour now, maybe two, to have dinner and finish their homework, before heading out.\n&quot;Hey, guys.&quot; Caleb loudly announced, strolling casually toward the gate. Quinn glared with a disappointing stare, arms crossed, making her thoughts known. &quot;Don&#039;t look so serious. You really need to try relaxing once in a while.&quot;\n&quot;We&#039;re running behind schedule. You shouldn&#039;t have taken so long.&quot;\n&quot;Is that concern I hear?&quot; Caleb retorted, thinking himself quite witty. &quot;Come on Quinn, do we really have to do this *every* night? I think it&#039;s starting to become an obsession for you...&quot; Valor let out a short squawk, clearly agreeing with Caleb&#039;s observation.\n&quot;If we don&#039;t, who will?&quot;\n&quot;The police.&quot; Caleb responded, in a sharp whisper, concerned someone might overhear. &quot;Look, I&#039;m just worried about you. So is Valor. You spend too much time thinking about... *that part* of our lives that you don&#039;t have any time for yourself, any time to truly live. We can&#039;t be responsible for everyone.&quot;\nQuinn let out a sigh. Maybe they were right. Ever since they had been chosen by the First Star, she couldn&#039;t help but think of one thing. Of helping those in need. Of doing the right thing. It&#039;s how they were raised.\nMaybe it was time they took a night off. It had been just over six months since they first started going out at night, since they started using their new found abilities to help people. Six months straight without a single night to themselves...\nQuinn glanced back at Caleb, then Valor. She could tell they were worried about her. Maybe some time off wouldn&#039;t be that bad?\n&quot;Alright&quot; Quinn conceded &quot;One night. We&#039;ll try it for one night&quot; and with that, they started to make their way home, as they did every day for the past six months, except this time they wouldn&#039;t be leaving until the sun came up the next morning.\n\n**Excerpt from &quot;The Star Guardian Mythos Throughout History as described by Gerald Harbinger; Chapter 27: The Modern Era&quot; an as of yet unpublished book exploring the history of the Star Guardians on Runeterra**\n>So while the mythos of the Star Guardians has become one of the foremost subjects in various outlets of media, there is more to the story than most people already know. I am, of course, referring to the group that has come to be known as the &quot;Star Vigilante Trio&quot;, who are, by all indications, a band of rogue Star Guardians.\nDuring my research on the subject, it has become clear that the foremost duty of the Star Guardians is to protect not only Runeterra, but all of creation, from a force most commonly known as &quot;the Darkness&quot;. Yet, here we see a small group of these guardians defying their primary duty, and choosing to target more terrestrial threats, more specifically being crimes such as muggings, assaults and petty theft. Threats that, in ideal conditions, should be left to the various institutes of law enforcement whom are paid to deal with such issues, within the bounds of the law.\nSince their original mention in police reports some 6 months ago, this group has been reportedly working in the shadows of the night to provide assistance in the forgotten alleys, backstreets and moonlit parks. At the time, there was no one who had decided to take the situation seriously, believing this group to be a &quot;figment of imagining&quot; of the victims of crime. The truth of the matter was later made clear, when common criminals started appearing in emergency wards with sword wounds, crossbow bolts of an unknown composition protruding from their chests, shoulders and extremities, and various injuries that have been attributed to an attacking bird of prey, most probably an eagle.\nDescriptions of the group would indicate that the leader is a woman, utilising a repeating crossbow altered by the power of the entity known as the First Star. This woman is believed to have led the group to become vigilantes, rather than fulfil their regular duties as Star Guardians. Accompanying her, a man of great strength and character, who acts as a representative to the people the group assists, and a bird of prey, believed to be an eagle, who can reportedly be seen flying the skies at night, looking for their next target.\nThere have been only a few consistent depictions of this group in the media since their first mention, ranging across various perspectives, though perhaps the most prominent has been the persistence of a weekly opinion columnist for the Runeterra Daily newspaper, known as Jasmine Olivander. In many of her writings, Jasmine has depicted the &quot;Star Vigilante Trio&quot; as a group unconcerned with the collateral damage they cause, and of the live they put at risk by performing acts of vigilantism. She has, on several occasions, attempted to confirm the identity of the individuals that compose this group, however has met only scepticism in the wake of failure after failure. Jasmine continues to urge the public, and the government, to call for this group, and all Star Guardians, to take responsibility for the damages they cause, to both people and property.","replies":[]}
