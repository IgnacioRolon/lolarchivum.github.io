Please keep that in mind. Also, fair warning, long post (no TLDR).\n\nI think everyone (at least, everyone who isn't a troll) will agree that Ranked is a strictly competitive mode, and should be taken with paramount seriousness and moderation. It's that very nature of ranked that is why I rarely, if ever, touch it. Quite simply, it's not an environment I find fun, and I play for fun (I'm sure there are many who have different views). However, that does not mean I don't understand the importance that ranked holds for a very substantial portion of the player-base, and it is that understanding that should allow everyone to view this suggestion with the same seriousness as they would expect from the queue itself.\n\nWith that said, I think everyone here will agree that there are certain individuals (whether few or many in number) that prey upon the innate seriousness of the queue for their *personal* enjoyment, an act that causes discomfort, disruption, frustration and rage in other players. It is exactly this that such players are seeking, for the individuals they are matched with to suffer while they have the time of their life making it that way. As a result of being exposed to these behaviours, there are many players who &quot;break&quot; from their self-control and resort to responding to such individuals in kind. Troll the troll, flame the flamer, harass the harasser, an eye for an eye. This is certainly not an environment and \"culture\" that can be maintained and addressed without serious attention.\n\nObviously, there are already systems in place to deal with undesirable behaviour within the community, *however* it would seem there is little, if any, room in those systems to address the ranked community itself, which some believe has become a breeding ground for the worst of the undesirables. All the time, positive and benign players are introduced to the Ranked queue, whether because of another player, or their own choice. While there are no statistics to work off, if even one of those players becomes a negative influence, that's one too many.\n\nAnd so, that brings me to my suggestion:\n#Ranked Restrictions\nThe basic idea is simple. Whenever a player is punished for unacceptable behaviours, not only do they receive a standard punishment (chat restrictions, low priority queues, temporary/permanent bans etc), they receive a ranked restriction. A period of time during which the ranked queue is *completely* locked to them, which will persist for the duration of the punishment itself, and a time after. Such a system may be seen to \"encourage\" toxicity in non-ranked queues, *however* it can be said that such negative behaviours have a lesser effect in non-ranked queues, compared to ranked queues. Referring to one of my earlier statements, it can also be said that the innate nature of the Ranked modes attracts those with the intent to ruin games, and by \"cutting them off\" from such modes, there is a higher possibility of reform (which Riot has stated is the purpose of the punishment systems) or, at least, leaving LoL, and becoming some other developer's problem (sucks for them, but good for us).\n\nHaving explained what Ranked Restrictions are and some potential impacts on the game/community, I'd like to now suggest how they would be applied to each tier of punishment currently employed by Riot (this list is what I *personally* think would be effective, it does not necessarily represent how they would be applied if such a system were implemented):\nDodger penalty, 2+ dodges (30 minute queue cooldown) = 1 game Ranked Restriction\n5 minute LPQ = 5 games + 1 week Ranked Restriction\n10 minute LPQ = 5 games + 2 weeks Ranked Restriction\n20 minute LPQ = 5 games + 4 weeks Ranked Restriction\n10 game chat restriction = 10 games + 1 week Ranked Restriction\n25 game chat restriction = 25 games + 2 weeks Ranked Restriction\n2 week ban = 2 month Ranked Restriction\n\nI realise that the chances of Riot taking any suggestion into consideration, let alone seriously discussing it's viability, is probably non-existent, but, at the very least, the players can discuss it in all seriousness. So, discuss.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-13T08:20:36.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh, I'd never be able to play ranked in this system.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-13T09:00:58.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't help but suspect that's a good thing.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-14T22:00:42.534+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"4 week ban from ranked cause internet bad for some people","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-15T01:15:59.768+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're internet is that bad that it's resulting in enough DCs to reach a 20 minute LPQ, then you're technically breaking the ToU and EULA, which means you don't have a leg to stand on.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-16T22:01:54.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean you’re not directly breaking it at all so it’s quite unpunishable unless it gets very very out of hand","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-17T02:19:36.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's stated in section 1.2 of the [ToU](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) that it is the players responsibility to ensure their internet connection meets the requirements of the game.

You don't see Riot working on new skins and champs and systems to add into the game, and yet that sh!t is getting done all the time. Same basic principle applies to punishments.\n\nThe big difference between chat offences and gameplay offences (and this will certainly *not* be the first time you have been told this) is that text is easy, it's just words on a screen and it's a lot more efficient to deal with that than having to look through gameplay and try and figure out if someone is really inting or they just bad at the game. That's why it takes a lot longer for gameplay offences to be dealt with, and that's true with just about any online game.\n\nAs for your point on the LPQs, the bottom line is that if a player does not have a stable internet connection, it is *solely* their fault if they are choosing to play a game that *requires* a stable internet connection. They can't keep blaming this sh!t on their ISPs and landlords and sh!t, because that's not how it works. These players are making a *conscious* choice to negatively impact dozens/hundreds of other players when they have *plenty* of options for other things they could be playing.\n\nAbsolute bottom line, if you are DCing due to a faulty/unstable connection enough to reach the higher tier punishments, that is *your* fault and no one else's. Find a solution to the problem or go play another game, don't expect Riot (or any dev) to allow you to consistently ruin the experience for other players because you cant accept responsibility.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-13T07:41:52.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a similar version of this in a Reddit post I made, except tied to the Honour system.\n\nInting, trolling, or a very negative attitude all affect Ranked, and since the punishment for these results in the player dropping to Honour Level 1 or 0, I suggested making Ranked exclusively for those with an Honour Level of 2 or higher (similar to how Clash is only for Honour Level 3 and higher).\n\nUnfortunately I had no idea for reducing this behaviour in Normal games, but Ranked is definitely not an environment for this sort of nonsense.\n\nI know other games implement a minimum Honour or something for their Ranked queues. Mobile Legends has a minimum requirement for an Honour score of 80/100 for Ranked, and 60 or 70 for PvP. HotS even goes as far as only making Ranked available when you have 14 Heroes who are at least Mastery 5 (granted, their Mastery system goes to 20 and Mastery 5 only takes 10-15 games).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI also don't think the dodger penalty should be that high. It is a legitimate climbing strategy to dodge bad games. Perhaps something for repeated dodging, but I shouldn't be punished for dodging a game where 4 people get autofilled, decide to troll and run it down Mid, and even declare those intentions in Pre-Game chat.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-13T08:11:41.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't think tying such a thing into the Honour system is a good idea. From what I've seen and heard, Honour gain is all over the place, unpredictable and inconsistent, with some players getting back to Honour 2 in a matter of days, while others are taking several months. Tying it into punishments makes sense, since then players know exactly why they've got the restriction, whereas with Honour it's more of a \"did the wrong thing and indefinite amount of time ago\".","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-13T07:26:57.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something I could totally get behind, although I do have issue with the dodger pentalty. \n\nMost of us have had games where a dodge has saved us from the loss of LP, wether it be because of an at-home emergency, a pregame flame fest or that support teemo with ghost cleanse. While I totally understand that it is annoying to have to sit through all these dodged queues to get into a game (we have all been there), dodging is a pretty big strategic thing and is one of the first things I was taught by high elo players that I reached out to for tips. \n_For this reason, I think the one game ranked restriction should kick in as your second dodge penalty, and the first penalty should remain as a 5min queue lock and a -3lp. _","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-02-13T08:05:56.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what you mean.

As for myself I only play ranked only playing normals if im trying a new champion out or want to practice in a role. That said the reason im saying this is a terrible idea is because anyone who is serious about ranked never plays normals. Normal games are not good indications for improvement unless you're bronze or silver. In ranked games people actually try, they play their main roles, they give a shit about winning, etc. That may not always be the case as you get the occasional casual or troll, however it is never the case when you play norms.  \n\nAs such if people have bad games playing ranked which some people do (a normal part of climbing), they could get restricted for over a week? Like what? If someone were to get restricted that long in plat or above without a second account of the same calibre to play on they will likely to be just as worse off in terms of skills and decision making. \n\nDodger penalty is also ridiculous and is bad enough as it is. I shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes+ to find another game when my mid wants to play jinx and my darius is already talking about trolling if he doesn't get ganks (Talking about my last game i lost because i didn't dodge even though i knew i should have).  But anyway, this is complete nonsense. If someone is truly bad enough to warrant these ranked restrictions then they're better off having their account banned as a whole.","replies":[]}]}
