I have started a petition, located on [Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/riot-games-riot-let-us-have-the-oce-skin-for-free?recruiter=394058478&amp;utm_source=share_for_starters&amp;utm_medium=copyLink), and fired off a support ticket to Riot in the hopes that the issue might be discussed.\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that no one from Riot ever stated that the Pool Party Ziggs skin given out during the beta was a &quot;replacement&quot; for the OCE skin, and that, if we wanted to have the skin that is to represent our server, we would **have** to spend money on Riot Points to purchase it from the in-client store. Help me fight this discrimination against the OCE server and add numbers to the petition.","replies":[{"poster":"Akuen","date":"2015-10-02T03:11:11.564+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer to this question is simple. Yes, we should. As someone suggested somewhere else, if charity wasn't added purely to placate and manipulate us, what they should have done is made it free for OCE and then had a percentage of worldwide purchases go to charity. Instead, we just get fucked. Par for the course for OCE to be honest. Of all the companies screwing us over, I had truly hoped Riot wouldn't be one of them. I thought after the backlash on the Karma rework that Riot would have learned to \"Announce changes sooner\" and to \"learn from this moving forward\". But those are all just words to distract stupid people from the obvious truth that they're just straight up ripping us off.\n\nAlready signed the petition btw. I doubt it will change anything but who knows.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-02T06:37:05.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to have your support. Thing is, I've not seen anything else that could change Riot's mind so this petition is probably our best bet for change, and it will only help if enough people know about it. I've tried to spread the word myself but it seems it's a job for more than just one person and I'm not trying to convince other to help me spread it among the community, but haven't seen any evidence of this happening yet. \n\nAs I've stated in the update, Riot seems to be ignoring my attempts of discussion on the issue, which doesn't bode well for them. I'm going to keep trying, and attempt different methods as well, so that this cause can get the attention it deserves. If all goes well with this it may just prove to Riot that they need to listen to the community more.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"promastermentos","date":"2015-09-29T11:44:21.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well i wouldn't mind paying for decent skin and besides guys the money is going to charity.

There were plenty of good ideas from the community, including a Cockatoo themed skin, but instead Riot gives us this barely passable \"server skin\".\n\nThing is though, they could do any number of things to raise money for charity. They could have a skin/champion sale, make a skin for the sole purpose of raising money for charity or any number of things, but instead they exploit the OCE server by using our server skin to raise that money.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Autismo Extremo","date":"2015-09-29T07:14:03.801+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i dont think they ever stated the skin would be free, at least i cant find a source on it, but they most definitely made it appear that way.

Riot has had over 2 years to tell us our server skin wouldn't be free, if anything they should have at least responded to one of the dozens of threads discussing a \"free server skin\", yet they never did. Why is that? Why did they neglect to inform us? Likely because that wasn't part of their plan at the time.\n\n> but I think combined with the charity thing is acceptable.\n\nAnd this is exactly the response they were hoping for. If they can get people to ignore the obvious exploitation of our server skin just by promising to donate some of the profits to charity it effectively gets them off the hook. As I've said, there are any number of ways they could raise money for charity without exploiting the OCE server, but they're not.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-09-29T23:50:36.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Getting a 1350RP skin half price on release is a good deal.

Instead we get this mockery of a skin for a champion that I hardly see played, and it will cost us.
