I'm unranked trash this season (probably Bronze) but I'm damn well allowed to have an opinion so here I go. I am surprised it was not Lucian, maybe he has fallen off this season I don't know because I don't particularly care for the \"pro\" scene that this game tries its hardest to promote as a sport but I digress.\n\nSivir has had two skins in recent memory on op of all her others and I really think Riot need to add something special to this one. Riot have generally made the Victorious skins pretty cool looking, although Janna's was pretty dull until the sweeping visual touch up changes brought it in line with the others. The problem I have with Riot's recent skin releases such as the Warden skins and the OCE Kass skin is that they look like Victorious wannabee skins (and yes, the fact that Sivir is among them creates ludicrous irony at the thought as she's getting one now).\n\nAs long as Riot hide or fix Sivir's broken neck that can easily be seen on any skin that isn't her base afaik it should be in good hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-10-03T04:51:23.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THANK GOD IT ISN'T AZIR!!! thank you riot :D\ni now have at least another year to try and get to gold :P","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-10-03T00:14:52.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To me it looks like a very realistic Lux :) although if it is a marksman, Sivir would be nice.","replies":[]}]}
