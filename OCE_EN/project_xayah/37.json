That said, our systems aren't as bad as you make them out to be.\n\n_Here's a few things I wanted to clear up:_\n\n+ **Riot is always working to ban scripters.**\nJust off the top of my head:\n\n We had a script [banwave](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/47d8t9/looks_like_the_bans_for_3rd_party_software_was_a/) this February, and just last week a bunch of high [elo boosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ni57b/qq_accounts_are_all_getting_banned/) accounts were banned as well. \n\n There's far more going on behind the scenes, but **Riot** has to keep quiet sometimes because it alerts scripters and gives them a heads-up on how our systems work.\n\n+ **A challenge by design.** \nRust also has a big advantage in this area because they are not free to play. Each time you get banned in Rust, you have to make a new account and pay $20 to start playing again. There's a decent financial risk to scripting there.\n\n Since League is free to play, it makes it much harder to disincentivize scripters from making new accounts. This isn't an excuse but rather something to keep in mind when comparing us to paid games.\n\n+ **Facepunch's system isn't as good.**\nI'm sure Facepunch is a great studio, but their scripting detection system isn't as capable as ours.\n\n Creator [Garry Newman](https://playrust.com/cheatpunch/) said himself:\n\n _ \"...it’s not hard to get around (by design). We fully expect cheats to be touted as ‘CheatPunch proof’ quite soon.\"_\n\n They are still in alpha though, so it might be interesting to see where their anti-cheat efforts go. I'm sure we could learn a thing or two from them in the future.\n\nI'm always sad to see players leave. Hopefully you might reconsider coming back later :(\n\nI hope this helped.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-18T11:58:55.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=acAwO9lR,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-06-17T06:41:17.851+0000)\n>\n> + **Riot is always working to ban scripters.**\n\nTo point out the obvious (because apparently I need to) I was not referring *just* to scripters.\n\n>  League is free to play,\n\nThis, right here, is the exact reason why Riot ***SHOULD*** be banning ***ALL*** accounts of players who consistently break the serious rules, because it takes less than 5 minutes to make a new account **at no cost** (as opposed to Rust which, as you pointed out, costs $20 USD to get around the punishment in the same manner).

If Riot want to stay competitive (and want League to stay relevant) they need to step up their game, else they'll lose their players to the \"up and comers\" like Paragon, Overwatch (which I'm confident has already grabbed a quite significant portion of League's player-base) and, dare I say, even Rust (despite not even being a *similar* genre).","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-06-19T00:29:52.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> To point out the obvious (because apparently I need to) I was not referring just to scripters.\n\nIt's a little unfair if you ask me; to pick Rust's scripting system, but then compare it to Player Behavior systems and others in League...\n\n__*\n\n> This, right here, is the exact reason why Riot SHOULD be banning ALL accounts of players who consistently break the serious rules, because it takes less than 5 minutes to make a new account at no cost (as opposed to Rust which, as you pointed out, costs $20 USD to get around the punishment in the same manner).\n\n**Scripting results in an instant ban. As soon as you're detected that's it. No second chances.**\n\n_Our player behavior systems are different though. They revolve around reform._\n\n+ If we instantly ban anyone who's toxic, they'll just make a new account and come back. Nothing has changed.\n\n We also have the problem that millions of players, who just flamed because of stress/bad day, will be banned. When usually these players are great and just have a few rare off moments.\n\n__*\n\n_**Also we need to clear up multiple accounts:**_\n\nIf **Riot** finds out you have multiple accounts that you're breaking the rules with, they'll ban them guaranteed. They do this for [elo boosting](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751834-MMR-Elo-Boosting), but it also applies to scripting. The issue is that this information isn't that easy to get a hold of and often leads to collateral damage.\n\n+ _What if the person is playing from a gaming cafe?_ \nAll the other accounts that log on will come from the same IP and computer.\n\n\n+ _What if the person is playing from a university?_ \n1000s of accounts might be coming from the same IP address. \n\nThe notion that **Riot** knows which account is connected to each individual person, and is not banning them is ridiculous. I'd doubt even the NSA has this information on hand for everyone.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-06-18T20:40:59.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi sparky.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2016-06-17T04:01:45.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I was thinking of getting back into LoL since you added Champ Mastery to ARAMs, but now I'm just going to stick with Rust until you fix your sh!t (which will probably be never), because Facepunch actually do sh!t that matters.\n\nYou realise that's the equivalent of trying to hold a military base hostage with a banana.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-17T05:11:00.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Vote 1 Trump,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=acAwO9lR,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-06-17T04:01:45.558+0000)\n>\n> You realise that&#x27;s the equivalent of trying to hold a military base hostage with a banana.\n\nThat comment wasn't intended to incite change, just a statement of fact.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Vanilla Bread,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=acAwO9lR,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-06-17T03:49:57.960+0000)\n>\n> bye\n\nI'm only leaving the game, not the boards (for now at least).
