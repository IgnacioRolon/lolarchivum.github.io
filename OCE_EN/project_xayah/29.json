As it stands, the Summoner Name Protection system requires basically no commitment, allowing players to &quot;keep&quot; a summoner name on inactive accounts and prevent it from being used by others, with practically no effort whatsoever. Not to mention, it takes a rather ridiculous amount of time for a summoner name to actually decay to the point where someone else could use it.\r\n\r\nFor those who don&#039;t know how Summoner Name Decay works, I&#039;ll quickly explain (or you can look at the Support Page on the topic: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914 ). Basically, the summoner name of each account is given protection from being taken by another account (through the name change service in the store). That protection is set for 6 months upon account creation and has 1 month added for each level above 6, capping at 30 months (or 2.5 years). An account only needs to play one game of any kind in order to reset the protection period. When the protection runs out, the name becomes available for others to claim through the name change system.\r\n\r\nNow lets consider that for a moment. &quot;One game of any kind every 2.5 years&quot; to keep protection. What kind of commitment is that? If players wish to keep their summoner name, shouldn&#039;t they be required to play a little more often than that? And shouldn&#039;t they be required to make more of an effort as well?\r\n\r\nIn order to address this there are a few options to consider.\r\n\r\nOption 1: Significantly reduce the protection period. It could easily be lowered to 1 year (for level 30+ accounts) with negligible &quot;consequences&quot;. It wouldn&#039;t mean much more effort required to &quot;protect&quot; one&#039;s summoner name, and it&#039;s not like it will change anything for the active/semi-active players. Still only 1 game, of any kind, required to reset the protection, just means the inactive ones aren&#039;t protected for as long really. Personally, I think it could go as low as 6 months without much effect, but that&#039;s just my opinion.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Impose stricter requirements on the games needed to reset protection. More than likely harder to implement, and requires more of a commitment. Change the modes that will contribute to the Summoner Name Protection (such as restricting it to PVP Matchmade modes) and increase the number of games required to trigger the reset (such as 5, rather than just 1).\r\n\r\nOption 3: Both of the above. Reduce the protection period and increase the restrictions on what kinds of games will contribute to resetting the protection.\r\n\r\nFeel free too discuss, and please expand on what you have to say, but keep it civilised.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-08-30T03:35:19.928+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about, instead of resetting the protection period, a game only extends it by a month? That way, players who want to come back to the game a year or two later still have that significant protection, but if they don't actually get back into the game, people wanting their name don't have to wait a practically infinite amount of time.\n\nI see a lot of players coming back to the game after a couple years, so I understand the reason for it being such a long protection, but I also don't think anyone would be all that fussed with the 2.5 being reduced either.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-08-30T04:41:00.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting idea, incremental protection with each game played. Something like that could certainly work while also requiring a significant level of commitment to \"secure\" the name. Active and semi-active players wouldn't notice a difference, while those who leave the game for longer periods would either need to periodically return and play out some matches, whether every month or two or when the protection has run down, (which may also prompt them to return to regular/semi-regular play) or they simply risk the possibility of losing the name. Make it so each game adds 1 or 2 months protection, up to a hard cap of, for arguments sake, 12 months/1 year (or possibly 18 months/1.5 years, maybe [seems a bit long to me, to be honest]).\n\nI'd be okay with something like that. Honestly seems like a better idea than what I've suggested.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-08-31T13:20:18.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A long time ago, I didn't know this was a thing, and thought inactive names could be taken after a month or two, and so when I went on holiday in Europe with my family, I'd still play a game every few weeks on like 3000ping in aram, and I built aura/tank/ardent/redemption azir(or whatever champion I got) and tried my very hardest to be useful.","replies":[]}]}
