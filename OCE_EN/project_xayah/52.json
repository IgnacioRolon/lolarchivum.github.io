On several occasions you get contradictory information regarding the size of both Red Dwarf itself and Starbug. Looking at the first attached picture you can see the comparison between a single person and the ship \"Red Dwarf\" itself. This does raise some questions. As for Starbug the contradictions seem to be greater in number. It's shown at multiple times that the crew (Lister, Rimmer, Kryten and the Cat) are not that much smaller than Starbugs exterior *[attached picture 2]*, examples in \"Psirens\" (season 6, episode 1) and \"Stoke Me A Clipper\" (season 7 episode 2), *however* we are shown on multiple occasions that Starbug has an unrealistically large interior *[attached picture 3]*, examples in \"Tikka To Ride\" (season 7, episode 1) and \"Duct Soup\" (season 7, episode 4).\r\n\r\nHow is this possible? You might ask. How can Red Dwarf and Starbug be so big on the inside compared to their exteriors? Well the answer is simple, Time Lord technology. In fact the Tardis appears on Red Dwarf as the crew escape death in \"Demons & Angels\" (season 5, episode 5) *[attached picture 4]*. At some point during human history they (or possibly just the one company) managed to get hold of the Time Lord technology that makes things bigger on the inside. Red Dwarf and Doctor Who take place in the same reality!","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-24T03:32:31.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"fuck i haven't heard the words red dwarf in regards to the tv show in ages.\nAlthough, I'm just going to go with standard tv show contradictions about stuff.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-03-25T09:47:42.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Er...
