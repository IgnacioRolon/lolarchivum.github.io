Few things I&#039;m unsure of though, and the values aren&#039;t set in stone or anything.\r\n\r\nBefore you comment, just know that all I&#039;m interested in is discussion, criticism and suggestions. If you&#039;re not going to contribute anything useful, you&#039;re not going to get a response.\r\n\r\n**Quinn**\r\nDemacia&#039;s Wings\r\nMarksman - Fighter\r\n**Statistics:**\r\nHealth: 532.8(+85)\r\nHealth Regen: 5.42(+0.55)\r\nMana: 268.8(+35)\r\nMana Regen: 6.97(+0.4)\r\nRange: 525\r\nAttack Damage: 56.46(+2.41)\r\nAttack Speed: 0.668(+3.1%)\r\nArmour: 23.38(+3.5)\r\nMagic Resist: 30\r\nMovement Speed: 335\r\n\r\n**Passive: Harrier**\r\nRange: 525\r\nCooldown: 8-2.928 (based on critical strike chance %)\r\nPhysical Damage: 15-100 (based on level)(+16-50[based on level]% AD)\r\nValor periodically marks a nearby visible unit as Vulnerable, revealing them for 4 seconds.

The cooldown of Harrier is reduced by critical strike chance with diminishing returns.\r\n\r\n**First Basic Ability (Default Q): Blinding Assault**\r\nRange: 1025 (cast range)/210 (ranged radius)/275 (melee radius)\r\nCost: 50/55/60/65/70 mana\r\nCooldown: 11/10.5/10/9.5/9\r\nPhysical Damage: 20/45/70/95/120 (+80/90/100/110/120% AD)\r\n*Active (Quinn State):* Quinn commands Valor to fly forward in a line, stopping when he collides with a unit, dealing physical damage and applying blind for 1.5 seconds.
