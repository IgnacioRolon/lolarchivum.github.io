At times I would choose a target to hunt, wait the 8 seconds for it to take effect and then kill them, usually within a few seconds. The bonus damage still applied, and the mark was removed from them, but I was able to pick the champion I had just killed as my target, and I was under the impression that I wouldn&#039;t be able to do that.","replies":[]}
