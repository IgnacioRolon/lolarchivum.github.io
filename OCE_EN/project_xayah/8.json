The scent of blood hangs in the air, guiding the beast to his quarry. All efforts to escape are in vain. In a flash of gore-soaked fur, Warwick strikes-and his target is dead in an instant.","url":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/champion-warwick-uncaged-wrath","image":"https://lolstatic-a.akamaihd.net/frontpage/apps/prod/rg-warwick-update-2017/en_AU/180ad66c595d642327935831c48af781f3bf14f8/assets/img/warwick_share.jpg"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Is it just me or does anyone else think Riot did a great job with this?\r\n\r\nNow I realise there&#039;s not been much in the way of actual gameplay with the new {{champion:19}}, but (to me) it seems like these changes will shift his power so he&#039;s still strong but not overbearing. Probably the most notable thing (for me) is the change to his ultimate Infinite Duress which is now a skill shot rather than targeted (much needed change, in my opinion).\r\n\r\nDiscuss.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-01-10T23:52:40.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, they have given him everything. I think as long as he remains a Lifesteal Tank and doesn't become the old, 2 damage item 1-combo insta someone, he will be really healthy and pretty cool.\n\nHis new Q and E will 10000% fix the problem with old Warwick \"being useless until 6\". Gap closer with a Fear. So good. You can jump behind them and fear them backwards.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-01-11T07:27:17.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basic kit insec","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-01-10T23:43:10.791+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Infinite Duress now needs to be aimed and can be blocked!
