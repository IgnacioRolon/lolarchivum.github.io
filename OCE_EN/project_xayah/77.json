Infertility is only one aspect of the situation, since it only applies to \"traditional\" (male-female) relationships. People who are single or that are in any form of \"non-traditional\" relationship wouldn't be considered \"infertile\" simply because their sexual activities failed to result in pregnancy. However, with this new classification, such situations would mean they would be considered \"reproductively disabled\" (that's what I'm calling it for the moment, anyway).\n\nSo, technically, yes. Homosexuality is now considered a disability (reproductively speaking, of course).","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-22T00:19:47.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how about china where there are about 20 million more blokes than girls because of female infanticide in agricultural areas?

The main point is that someone who's seeking to have a child but is incapable of finding a willing partner for the process would be considered disabled, allowing them better access to technologies and procedures that could assist (IVF, for example). It's within the realm of possibility that such a scenario could be the result of a skewed ratio of potential partners, though (I'd say) quite unlikely.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
