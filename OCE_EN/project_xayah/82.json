Previously, I&#039;d rather hastily put together the stories in only a few hours (if that) for whatever fanfic contest was running, but the current contest afforded me the opportunity to bring together some of my favourite champions in a way that made sense (hence, I became more invested). Overall, I am rather satisfied with how I managed writing this story, even though I needed to re-write parts to keep it under the word limit. I hope at least some readers enjoy this story, and please feel free to post feedback.\r\n\r\n___\r\n##The Moment That Makes Us\r\nIt is said by some that an individual&#039;s life is defined by a single moment. One decision that puts them on the path to who they are destined to be. It is the single most important moment of life, and what ultimately shapes the future. There are notable examples of these moments from every corner of the world. For Quinn of Uwendale, that fateful excursion into the mountains. For the Hand of Noxus, the Battle of Dalamor Plain. For Rakan the Charmer, to pledge himself to Xayah the Rebel, in the midst of a tavern brawl. For Fiora Laurent, to restore honour through great sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFor the man now known by all across Runeterra as &quot;Love&#039;s Bane&quot;, it was a decision between duty and family, a choice said to haunt him through every moment of his life, until his inevitable death. His name is Garen; Emperor of Demacia, self proclaimed High King of Runeterra, Sworn Enemy to Magic, Conqueror of the Shadow Isles, Destroyer of the Void, Dreadknight, and Slayer of Heartseekers. So many titles for so little of a man, and yet it took just one moment of his life to change the course of history.\r\n___\r\n##In The Time Of Our Fathers\r\nDuring a time of relative peace, when the future was still in the hands of our fathers, there was one family at the heart of it all: the Crownguards, sworn to protect the King. Garen, who was to be The Might of Demacia, and his sister Luxanna, who held a secret that could never be known.\r\n\r\nOf course, life is never so simple. Even in attempting to avoid the truth, all it takes is just one unlucky moment, and that secret would be a secret no more. As it turns out, Garen would experience one such moment, and forever remember his impossible choice. That moment was to come the day before he was to leave home, to join the Dauntless Vanguard, and aged only 12.\r\n\r\nGaren had made ready to depart, but felt there was something he must do before leaving. Not knowing how long he would be gone, he felt he should say something to his sister. Garen made towards Luxanna&#039;s chambers, thinking of what he might say to her. As he walked through those familiar halls, the last time he would do so for so long, he became lost in thought of what may come from his training.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he had reached the door that he heard it. Such an unusual noise, like nothing he had ever heard before, and causing such dread to befall him. Standing there, as if stunned, Garen no longer had any thoughts beyond the noise, hoping with all his might that it was nothing. He knew he had to find out, and so, silent as he could, opened the door, and realised the truth.\r\n\r\nThe truth, right there before him, all suspicions confirmed, and Garen knew what this meant. He could not bear the thought, but knew what he must do now, and could not let his love and compassion get in the way. So suddenly he realised he&#039;d already made his way into the room, dagger drawn, standing behind his sister, and eyes drowned in tears. The last moment of her life, he thought, the last moment of such potential. With one choice, in one moment, Garen secured his place in history, and the final words Luxanna Crownguard ever heard, the most sincere of apologies.\r\n___\r\n##To Fight With One You Love\r\nDarius had come to the neutral lands stretching between Noxus and Demacia, with a small party of scouts and rangers, after hearing rumours that Demacia&#039;s infamous Dreadknight Legion was marching towards Noxus. The group had been combing the countryside for any signs of the Demacian forces, and Darius had not realised how far he had gotten from the others.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he heard it. The sound, now so faint but growing louder, of an approaching army. Darius knew what this meant; War. He knew he had to retreat, there was no way he, and his party, would be able to take down an entire legion. With that, he started making his way back towards Noxus, keeping an eye out for his fellows.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after he had turned to retreat that Darius was stopped in his tracks.  He had heard the cries of an eagle, coming from the direction of the approaching Demacian force, as if to call for help. With a glance back towards the Demacians, Darius saw the reason for the incoming trouble: the Rebel Ranger Quinn and her companion Valor. He rushed out to help them, hoping to flee before being found by the oncoming force. Unfortunately, the three soon realised they would not be able to outrun their foes. They would have to stand and fight, even though it surely meant their deaths. They stopped running and prepared themselves.\r\n\r\nSo there they stood, the Noxian King, the Rebel Ranger and the Azurite Eagle against the might of the Dreadknight Legion, and as the battle begun, they fought in perfect unison. The raw might of the King, who struck down each warrior before him, the guile of the Ranger, who&#039;s cunning nature confused even the keenest of foes, and the vision of the Eagle, who never missed his mark. The Impossible Victory for an army of three.\r\n___\r\n##The Final Hope Of A Generation\r\nThe Heartbreakers, named so because they would strike at the very heart of hatred within Runeterra, being the man known as Love&#039;s Bane, prepared for their last stand. The slaughter of the Dreadknight Legion during The Impossible Victory, as the battle had become known, presented an opportunity, one that would not last long, and would likely not present itself for another generation. A chance to end a decade of rebellion, a decade of fighting in the shadows, of secretly spreading love, compassion and hope among the people of Runeterra. A chance to end the infamous Era of Hatred.\r\n\r\nTheir numbers had dwindled over the years, the Heartseekers and Sweethearts of the rebellion laying down their very lives for the cause, for their beliefs, for something so important as love. The Heartseekers Quinn and Valor, who had witnessed firsthand the tyranny of Garen, the Sweethearts Xayah and Rakan, who fought to share their love, the Noxian King Darius, who had now experienced the strength that love can bring, and the double agent Fiora, who would give them their way in.\r\n\r\nWeaving their way through back streets and hidden passages the rebels continued forward, ever closer to their final destination, stopped only upon reaching the castle walls, a Demacian legion in their path. In a rush of death quills and rapier strikes, blurs of white and pink moving through the mass of troops, a path had been opened. With no hesitation, Quinn, Darius and Valor passed through, leaving Xayah, Rakan and Fiora to hold back the tide of Demacia&#039;s finest.\r\n\r\nInside the throne room they made it, and there he was. Garen Love&#039;s Bane, standing just before the throne, as if expecting the rebels to appear here and now. The rebels and the tyrant exchanged only glances, no words needed to be spoken, they all knew what this was, and after a brief silence, the fight had begun.\r\n\r\nAny keen observer could have said that they were evenly matched, a stalemate of one against three. A flurry of sword, axe, bolts and talons filled the room with the sound of battle, as if ten thousand soldiers were in combat. Around the room they fought, looking for any opening, any advantage, they could find. That fight could have lasted a few minutes or a few hours, such time mattered not, it would take only one mistake to end it all.\r\n\r\nThat mistake was made by Quinn, a misplaced step was all the advantage Garen needed, and down she went, with Valor to fall next. Darius stood firm, knowing he had to make this count, to his very last breath, as all the Heartbreakers had. The brief respite had ended, and Garen unleashed his fury. It did not take long and Darius was unarmed, sprawled on the floor, with the tyrant prepared to strike.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s a strange thing, when you know you&#039;re about to die. Ask anyone who has survived the experience, and they will tell you the same thing; it&#039;s as if time stands still. In that moment, when time stood still, Darius saw it, in the eyes of the tyrant. The rage that fuelled him, but more than that, a heavy guilt weighing on his soul. In that brief moment, it felt to Darius as if they had locked eyes for an eternity. That&#039;s when he noticed, when they both noticed, a single bolt that had struck just the right place, between the armour plating, and that rage and guilt simply disappeared, and so ended the tyrannical reign of Garen Love&#039;s Bane.","replies":[]}
