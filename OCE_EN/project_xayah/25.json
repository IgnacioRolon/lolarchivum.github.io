And from Taric's story, I'm guessing that Demacia either borders on, or is close to Targon. \n_(but don't trust me on that)_\n\nWe know from Taliyah's story that Noxus, Shurima, Ionia and the Freliord are costal, or at least some parts are.\n\nand I believe that Zaun and PIltover are geographically in the same place, one is essentially the slums of the other.\n\nI hope thats at least a little bit helpful!\n\nDon't trust me 100% though. Its hard to piece together a picture from all the fragmented and conflicting lore around. Hopefully when the universe is fleshed out a bit, all the holes \nwill be covered.\n\nGood luck! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-04-27T00:53:05.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did come across that map, however dismissed it because it didn't seem to contain the most important information I needed. *However*, on closer inspection it appears that map has more information than I originally thought. For example, it appears that the southern tip of Ionia can be seen in the top right corner.\n\n[This](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/leagueoflegends/images/3/37/Runeterra_Map_01.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20161202020807) is the copy I'm currently looking at, which seems to be 10 times larger than the copy you linked.\n\nIf we look to the west edge of the map, we can see indications of Demacia and the Freljord, and it appears that the Freljord is actually *south* of Demacia, which is quite interesting.\n\nAnother point of some interest is some writing just to the east of Noxus, says something along the lines of \"Khooran(?) Iron Pinnacle, Ere(?)\" from what I can tell.\n\nUnfortunately, it still doesn't contain enough information for my purposes. I suppose I could try asking one of the Rioters directly, but I doubt I'd get the information I need.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-27T10:42:32.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I think you're right, there are a lot of clues in the map, that don't give us certainties, but can give us more of the general view than we thought.\n\nYes i see what you mean about Demacia and the Freljord, i completely missed that.\nThats weird the the freljord is below Demacia.\nPerhaps what the map means is that the river leads to the freljord (from one of the glaciers perhaps?), not that the freljord is actually directly west of the map? Who can say.\n\n\nYea I doubt Riot would give out such information, just incase they decide to change it later for the release of a new story/champion.\nBut its worth a try.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-04-27T08:16:43.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huh haven't seen HeartVine post in ages.\n\nSorry can't help with this really.\nI'd say Riot probably needs to retool their map since all the lore rework.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-27T10:32:26.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Comments quite a bit, posts not so much.\n\nAs far as the map, given they just redid a whole bunch of their worldbuilding lore, I'd imagine around now would be an excellent time to redo some of the basic lore centrepieces like maps.
