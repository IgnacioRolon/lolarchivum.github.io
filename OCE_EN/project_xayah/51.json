I'm confident we've had more than a few interactions where neither of us has downvoted the other but your attitude to one of our more recent discussions seems to be heavily impacting the way you see our interactions and, quite frankly, I'm starting to find it a little annoying that you're now bringing up that discussion every time you reply to me. You can call me \"arrogant\" for using the downvote system in a manner it was intended to be used, just know I don't care if you do.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
