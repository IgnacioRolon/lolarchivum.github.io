Keep it up Riot!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-04T03:32:23.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These penalties are in place as far as I'm aware, and people have been complaining for both sides on the boards. The issue you are having I think is that there are still people getting used to it, so there are people who are only forgetting once or twice (not enough to get punished), and it's just adding up. Another month or so and everyone will be used to it and you won't really have to worry anymore most likely (we all hope at least).","replies":[{"poster":"Retlow","date":"2016-02-05T01:00:49.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure that the penalties isn't in place yet. \nI had a guy in queue - he told, and I quote: \"I just keep dodging till I get the position I want\"\nHe got toplane 3 times in a row, he wanted jungle. Every time we left queue it said in chat: \"(Summoner name) left the room\" but yet he turned up in the next 3 queues anyway. Untill I decided to leave myself since this was going nowhere. I didn't get a penalty either. Got strait into another champion select and luckily for me the other guy wasn't there again.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-05T01:05:36.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well all I know is that a lot of people have been complaining about getting low priority queue for forgetting to lock in. It could be that the system is much harsher on those who have existing leaver buster penalties from in game afk etc. I don't know enough about it I'm afraid. I know the system is working in some capacity, but in your situation it certainly seems like it's missing some people.\n\nI would remove the name and shame as it's against board policy, but you could take it to a support ticket and see if they can look into it.","replies":[{"poster":"Retlow","date":"2016-02-08T09:31:23.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well everything is new as well so I guess I just have to give it some time and it will be all good in a couple of months. You can't assume that something new will be released without any mistakes or issues involved or changes to come. \n\nThanks for telling me to remove the name, I didn't realise it - was stupid of me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-08T13:08:18.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, honest mistake about the name, but checking the universal rules on the left wouldn't hurt.\n\nIt will definitely get better as people get used to the system, and if it becomes too much of a problem Riot may consider other solution sin the future. :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
