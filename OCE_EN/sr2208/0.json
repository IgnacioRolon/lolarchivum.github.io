I used to play LOL by using my vodafone 4G network because it&#039;s lightening speed.\r\n\r\nBut now I can login client, the weird thing is I keep lost connection and connection timeout  forever. I am sure my network is fine.\r\n\r\nNow I can only use my home network to start a game, once started, I will change to vodafonr4G and it&#039;s fine.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me to solve this problem? Vodafone 4G can play lol in game smoothly but keep lost connection in client.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-07T03:12:50.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI would suggest contacting vodafone as it's possible they're currently experiencing issues on their network.\n\nThe real question here is why you would rather be using a 4g connection over your home connection, if your home connection works fine and is of adequate speed you should have no issues with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"sr2208","date":"2016-03-07T03:33:35.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for suggestion.\n\nThe only reason I use 4G rather than homenetwork it's because my wife and family always youtube facebook download whatever....\n\nI cant survive with that high ping spike","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-07T04:07:37.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're feeling up to the challenge and your router [supports DD-WRT](https://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database) then there's a neat little blog post [here](http://markmaunder.com/2011/01/26/how-to-reliably-limit-the-amount-of-bandwidth-your-room-mate-or-bad-office-colleague-uses/) about rate limiting others on your network.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
