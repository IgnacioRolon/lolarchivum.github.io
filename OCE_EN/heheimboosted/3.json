I am simply just looking for any team that has/can place high at LOL related events/tournaments. Funding for LANs, shirts, etc is a possibility depending on how well your team can perform. I&#039;m open to all offers but would prefer a team with higher ranks. However, if your team can perform well together then that is the exception. So, if you&#039;re interested in the offer or want to find out more, simply message my account or visit our twitter page (link above). \r\nThanks guys\r\n\r\nP.S sorry if the post seems a little rushed or vague. I will be able to explain better and in more detail over discord or what not.","replies":[]}
