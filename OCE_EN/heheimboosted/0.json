I simply ask for ganks but end up getting banned, LITERALLY JUST FOR ASKING FOR GANKS! I even say GG at the end to get on your reporting bots good side. I really enjoy playing the game but find it stupid when I cannot even ask for simple things such as help when my lane is getting smashed by 2 other players, while my team simply abuses me for &#039;feeding&#039;. Now all that money and hard work is gone forever. \r\n\r\nThanks Rito...","replies":[{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2017-04-02T04:11:53.147+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will have emailed you a list of what you said, if you paste that here we can tell you how we feel about what you said.
