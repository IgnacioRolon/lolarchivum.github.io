My NA account has a resetting mission every day that gives somewhere around 500-600 exp. It&#039;s pretty painful to level with only 150 exp per game here.","replies":[{"poster":"iConnix","date":"2017-11-14T23:08:31.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"FWotD bonus starts from level 15 onwards IIRC","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-15T04:23:51.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it was supposed to be a lv 10 start, but who knows how many bugs are in new system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-11-15T01:30:23.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We got it, it starts level 5 actually","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-15T04:23:00.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its supposed to start at lv 10, new system just bugged like no tomorrow","replies":[]}]}]}
