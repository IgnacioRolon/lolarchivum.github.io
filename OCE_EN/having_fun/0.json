Unfortunately its the opposite. Now that I don&#039;t play as much I have dropped down in rankings and game after game people see my diamond boarder and assume I&#039;m some amazing player, then when I don&#039;t perform I just get abuse such as &quot;how much did you buy that account for?&quot;, &quot;are all diamond players that bad&quot; and other insults along these lines. Whilst you could argue that players would just abuse me for something else I believe that the expectation of a winning lane adds to the reason. \r\n\r\nIm sure most people have experienced something similar, whether it be someone abused for their previous ranking or even champion statistics that someone looked up. I believe you should be able to chose hide this info so at the very least people only abuse you for things you did in that particular game.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDue Hickey","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-05T16:16:47.979+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it's hard to hide info like that due to sites like OP.GG (which riot don't control) and similar.\n\nBut honestly if you were a diamond player you should probably be able to go at least even in Plat 5.\n\nComes down to, just mute them when it happens, they don't deserve your time man.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-07T06:11:30.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those peeps are just jealous and insecure.

This tends to happen in solo queue where I'm just trying  a new champ or building differently. I just laugh my ass off how people can dissed your last season effort due to the one game that you are playing. \n\n**Diamond players do lose games LOL.\n**\n\nI agree of the idea of hiding/showing your boarder settings in game.Maybe a similar system like the club tags? :) \n\nAnyways best of luck! Don't let those type of players ruined your experience","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-04-06T03:07:37.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can ask support to remove your banner, one of my friends did the same thing on NA.
