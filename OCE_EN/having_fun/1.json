Surely its not that hard and there is literally no reason why it shouldn&#039;t be added. If you want the competitive scene to mirror that of ranked surely this is a must have.\r\n\r\nProblem 2\r\nDynamic Que players often pick duo bot, mid/jungle and so forth, therefore they are less effective and disadvantage their team if they don&#039;t get these roles.\r\nSolution\r\nJust let people chose one role. I don&#039;t know why the role selection was suddenly added when riot was so against forcing people to conform to the meta but allowing people to only chose one preferred role at the cost of increased que time would fix these problems. Also when you que up as say Jungle primary and Support secondary you will get support 90% of the time with only 10% jungle in comparison to Mid primary and Adc Secondary where you will get each around 50/50. This causes players who don&#039;t mind playing support not chose it as a secondary as they never get their favorite role which should be fixed. If you select your primary role it should be the role you get most often. \r\n\r\nProblem 3\r\nLong Pick/Ban phase after loading.\r\nNow that 3 people on each team are banning and each person picks on their own the champ select screen goes much slower even though each person individually has less time to chose than before.\r\nSolution\r\nAn easy solution to this is to allow people to lock in preferred picks before their turn causing the game to just auto select that champ instantly on their turn unless it has been taken away. This would speed up the pick/ban phase immensely and also stop accidental dodges.\r\n\r\nProblem 4\r\nToxicity. Often times people in dynamic ques (especially 4 mans) will be toxic towards the people not qued with them when they are losing. \r\nSolution\r\nAfter games if a member of a dynamic que is reported for verbal abuse or unsportsmanlike like conduct it messages the whole team letting them know that the player has been reported and not to encourage such activity in the game.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading","replies":[]}
