Too many people add me after reading one of my posts in the forums, see that I&#039;m (only) silver, and instantly label my as &#039;not good enough&#039; to mingle with the &#039;superior Gold + race&#039;.\r\nThis frustrates me a little, because they assume that someones solo que rank accurately resembles their talent (which it obviously doesn&#039;t)\r\nI main tanky, cc, teamfighting champs, so i&#039;m finding it hard to carry myself and my team to victory without dealing tonnes of damage. I consider myself to have a good understanding of the game, make good shot calling, and play a good team fight in game. I have no doubt that i could play to a high standard in high gold elo ranked 5&#039;s team, but no one seems to realize that solo que and ranked 5&#039;s is a completely different ball game.\r\n\r\nAny tips or ideas from you guys that can get me into a ranked 5&#039;s team and find a regular duo partner to grow synergy with?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nspan\r\n{{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yondas","date":"2015-06-01T13:23:49.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I main tanky, cc, teamfighting champs, so i'm finding it hard to carry myself and my team to victory without dealing tonnes of damage.\n\nUhhhhhhhh These champs are easier to carry with than adc's. You litterally wait for the silvers to clump pull the trigger and then your assasin(s) get a field day with their carries. If your team doesn't have any assasination potential on their carries then you make sure ur slowing and stunning the enemy frontline as they are approaching ur carries making sure your carries can dps while making sure to kite back. Don't kid yourself by saying \"I have a good understanding of the game\" as people with garbage mechanics but good game knowledge can make it to gold and they do that on supportive style champions. Your issue could be you don't have the time to grind 70-80 wins which is what it took me to go from bronze 3 to gold 5 on a smurf. Right now the meta favors tanky cc trains so you should be finding it easiest to climb with them right now.\n\nEDIT: Also assuming you play top lane and run tp tell your support to keep a ward in the bush closest to the enemy tower so you can tp for free double kills.","replies":[{"poster":"span","date":"2015-06-02T06:45:45.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i know how to teamfight as a tanky cc champ like its second nature. i managed to get to G5 in preseason but have recently dropped to S5 and im finding it hard to climb. maybe the issue is lack of time to 'grind out' 70-80 wins.\nalso, that was secondary info to the fact that people dont seem to recognize the difference between solo Q and ranked 5's.\nthanks for the input anyway.","replies":[]}]}]}
