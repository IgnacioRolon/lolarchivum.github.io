Too many people add me after reading one of my posts in the forums, see that I&#039;m (only) silver, and instantly label my as &#039;not good enough&#039; to mingle with the &#039;superior Gold + race&#039;.\r\nThis frustrates me a little, because they assume that someones solo que rank accurately resembles their talent (which it obviously doesn&#039;t)\r\nI main tanky, cc, teamfighting champs, so i&#039;m finding it hard to carry myself and my team to victory without dealing tonnes of damage. I consider myself to have a good understanding of the game, make good shot calling, and play a good team fight in game. I have no doubt that i could play to a high standard in high gold elo ranked 5&#039;s team, but no one seems to realize that solo que and ranked 5&#039;s is a completely different ball game.\r\n\r\nAny tips or ideas from you guys that can get me into a ranked 5&#039;s team and find a regular duo partner to grow synergy with?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nspan","replies":[{"poster":"Nestay","date":"2015-06-02T05:50:31.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SoloQ is exactly accurate of where u should be.","replies":[{"poster":"I Kokichi I","date":"2015-06-03T06:00:30.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably not exactly accurate, maybe you could be a division higher or lower but not much difference with that anyways.
