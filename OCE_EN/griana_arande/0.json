I mean the number of my epic skin owned didn&#039;t change and I found this skin under &quot;OTHERS&quot; not &quot;EPIC&quot;. I know this is a really small issue but me as a skin collector, I really care about this. So did riot mess up or it supposed to be like this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-12T06:21:07.820+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm could be just cause it's a new skin and they didn't have all the extra stuff in for it's release, not sure tbh. I'd recommend waiting a couple days and see if it fixes, and if there's no change check back.","replies":[{"poster":"Griana Arande","date":"2018-01-12T06:29:08.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks :)","replies":[]}]}]}
