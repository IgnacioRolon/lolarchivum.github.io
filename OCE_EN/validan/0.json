Yet I can&#039;t queue up as mid in unranked, because for some reason, OCE doesn&#039;t have unranked draft. \r\n\r\nYou don&#039;t always get what you want in Blind Pick - Top and Mid are usually called first. I can play any position, but that&#039;s not why I want to play unranked, I want to practice the spots I play in ranked, and try new things out without having to lose LP if they don&#039;t work. I wouldn&#039;t care if the queue was 10 minutes if that&#039;s what it took.\r\n\r\nCome on Riot, how hard can it be? You have it for NA.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-11T07:02:43.425+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThere was a [recent post by Sephyre](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/VdoPT9GX-queue-schedule?comment=00010000) regarding the implementation of normal draft.
