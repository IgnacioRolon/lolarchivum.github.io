Use the catergory _\"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\"_, and then fill out your information.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure if you're aware, but it's fairly common for people to use untrustworthy VPNs which steal their data and passwords. It's possible this might have happened to you. \n\nIn fact you might want to take a look at some [very unusual summoner spell swapping](https://i.gyazo.com/ea4266835124222abb697d8bec6eb33c.png) that happened on your account 12 days ago. If you don't remember doing this, it's likely you got hacked. But in any case, you need to contact Riot Support.\n\nBest of luck :D","replies":[{"poster":"Kobyliang","date":"2017-06-06T09:49:17.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dosent work they said that im scripting now","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-06-07T01:23:59.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You'll have to take that up with Riot Support unfortunately.
