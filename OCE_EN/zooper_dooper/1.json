With no innate escape, Wrath relies heavily on positioning and raw damage to quickly dispose of any opponents. His absurdly high late game damage allows him to single handedly carry games if left to do as he pleases. Having said that he suffers greatly during the early stages of the game. Being very prone to ganks and having a low damage output, Wrath must survive the early game in order to reach his true power. This is one AD carry you wish your bot lane didn't feed.\n\nI imagined Wrath to resemble Death off of Darksiders 2 (for anyone who has ever played it). He would be a moderately tall, small build male with pale white skin and blood red eyes (makes him seem squishy). He would wear black robes covering the majority of his body except his face and hands. Wrath's weapon would be a large scythe (similar to that of the stereotypical Grim Reaper).  With that, his basic attack animation would be similar to Thresh's (uses a melee weapon at a long range). \n\nBase Statistics (All bracketed numbers show growth statistic):\n\nHealth: 460 (+60)\nHealth Regen: 5.5 (+0.5)\nMana: 215 (+65)\nMana Regen: 5.7 (+0.6)\nAttack Damage: 48 (+3.5)\nAttack Speed: 0.638 (+3.6%)\nAttack Range: 550\nMovement Speed: 325\nArmor: 20 (+2.7)\nMagic Resist: 30 (+0)\n\nAbilities:\n\nPassive: Burning Rage\n> Wrath grows more angry at the existence of the world causing him to deal more damage as the time of the game goes on.\n> \n> Wrath grows more angry at the existence of the world causing him to gain an additional 1 AD per minute in game.\n\n Q - Wreck (Cost: 60/65/70/75/80 mana) (Cooldown: 11/9.5/8/6.5/5 sec.)

(Skillshot)\n> Wrath throws his scythe into the target area, dealing physical damage to all affected targets over time and causing them to take increased damage from Wrath's attacks.\n> \n> Wrath throws his scythe, cutting at the legs of all enemies in the target area dealing **60/105/150/195/240 (+40% AD) (+50% AP) physical damage over 3 seconds**. Targets affected by Vulnerability also take an **additional 2/4/6/8/10% damage from Wrath's basic attacks. **\n\nE - Bound To Die (Cost: 60/70/80/90/100 mana) (Cooldown: 19/18/17/16/15 sec.) (Range: 600) (Tether Range: 800) (Cast time: 0.25 sec.) (Target Ability)\n> Wrath latches his scythe to the chest of his target , creating a tether between himself and the targeted enemy. The enemy is marked with **Inbound Death** while tethered. Last 5 seconds.\n> **Inbound Death:** Every basic attack received from Wrath while tethered applies a stack of **Inbound Death**. After reaching 4 stacks the tether explodes dealing bonus physical damage.\n> \n>Wrath latches his scythe to the chest of his target, creating a tether between himself and the targeted enemy.

After reaching 4 stacks the tether explodes dealing **30/65/100/135/170 (+75% bonus AD) + 4/5.5/7/8.5/10% of the target's maximum health in physical damage.**\n\nR - Apocalypse (Cost: 100/100/100 mana) (Cooldown: 100/85/70 sec.) (Range (swirl): 550) (Range (fired scythe): 850) (Missile width (fired scythe): 60) (Missile speed (fired scythe): 2125)\n>Wrath becomes enraged making his scythe split into two and swirl around him dealing physical damage to all nearby enemies for a short duration. Wrath can then fire a scythe in a target direction dealing physical damage to all enemies in a straight line (deals less damage to subsequent targets).\n\n>Wrath becomes enraged, making his scythe split into two and swirl around him dealing **15/35/55 (+50% AD) physical damage** to all nearby enemies every 0.5 seconds for 4 seconds. After 4 seconds Wrath can then fire the scythes in a direction dealing an additional **30/60/90 (+100% AD) physical damage (deals 10% less damage to subsequent targets, down to 60%)**. 2 scythes can be fired. Reactivate the ability to throw the scythes early.\n\nRecommended Items (in no particular order):\n> Blade of the Ruined King (Wrath has exceptional duelling potential and this item compliments that in every way)\n> Berserker's Greaves (Standard ADC boots and also best boots for Wrath)\n> Infinity Edge (As with any ADC you need raw damage and this item gives just that)\n> Last Whisper (Going to need that armor penetration since almost all damage is physical)\n> Statikk Shiv/Phantom Dancer (Either of these two items will give enough Multiplier stats (Attack speed, critical chance)\n> Any defensive item (Mercurial Scimitar, Banshee's Veil, Randuin's Omen) (Wrath has a lot of damage as it is and he will need a defensive item to keep himself alive)\n\nEdit Log: Changed Apocalypse to deal half the damage per strike but deal damage twice as often. This does not change the overall damage. (Makes it easier to get at least one hit onto an enemy) ","replies":[{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-15T14:29:52.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds alright, i would agree with shadeslayer, he doesn't sound incredibly original but i still think its a good concept, maybe tweak some attacks to mirror something like an actual grim reaper, then if he bases his power on anger turn his passive in a berserker ability, the more damage he takes the greater his own attack is. 'course since hes a bit squishy this gives him a very unique role in the game and some interesting build options. .......oh and completely off subject i happen to have just made a character concept myself and was looking for some reviewers, would u mind taking a look if u have time??

Every champ is supposed to bring something new to the table, but Wrath doesn't really feel all that different. I mean, his passive sucks, and he is basically a weird kalista champ, with irelia ulti. Anyway, its still cool to see people with ideas, and I couldn't come up with an idea if my life depended on it, so don't take it too hard.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2014-12-06T05:04:41.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please let me know what you think in the comments!
