(W) at rank 1 . This bonus attack speed was not granted until I put a skill point into it in which I then received the normal attack speed bonus (30% for rank 2). This may be due to the fact that you can not assign a skill point into his W upon spawning into the game but I&#039;m not sure. All other attack speed bonuses were there and it was simply the bonus 20% not being applied.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.","replies":[]}
