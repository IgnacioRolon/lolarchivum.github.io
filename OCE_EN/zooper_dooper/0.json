After being hit 4 times, Zer'sah deals a bonus (40/50/60% AD) physical damage on her 5th hit and slows the target by 30% for 1.5/1.75/2 seconds. The slow amount increases by 10% (up to a maximum of 60/70/80/90%) every time they are hit by any champion as they are slowed.  Targets can only be Crystallised every 8 seconds.\n\nQ: Luminescent (Cost: 40/45/50/55/60 mana) (CD: 9/8.5/8/7.5/7 seconds)\nFires a single crystal damaging the first enemy hit for 40/70/100/130/160 (+50% AD) physical damage. If it hits an enemy champion Zer&#039;sah marks them and gains (40% + 5% per level) attack speed for 3 seconds. Her next three basic attacks against the marked target gain 25 range and deal 5/6/7/8/9 (+2% bonus AD)% (minimum 30/45/60/75/90 damage) of their current health in bonus magic damage. \nIf the target is Crystallised, Zer'sah converts half of the bonus damage (2.5/3/3.5/4/4.5 (+1% bonus AD)%) into True damage.\n\nW: Shattering Glow (Cost: 45/50/55/60/65 mana) (CD: 20/19/18/17/16 seconds per charge) (Max 2 charges)\n\nPassive: Each time an enemy is Crystallised Zer&#039;sah gains 20/25/30/35/40% movement speed for 1.5 seconds. 5 second cooldown.\n\nActive: Zer&#039;sah creates a crystal land mine nearby. All enemies who walk over it are dealt 70/105/140/175/210 (+120% bonus AD) (+50% AP) physical damage and acquire 2 stacks of Crystallise. Traps last 75 seconds and a maximum of three traps can be set at once.\n\nE: Crystalline Spike (Cost: 50/60/70/80/90 mana) (CD: 12 seconds)\nZer&#039;sah creates a large spike to grow from a nearby wall, damaging all enemies hit for 60/100/140/180/220 (+90% AD) physical damage and briefly slowing them.\n\nCrystalline Spike immediately Crystallises an enemy if they have been hit by Shattering Glow within the last 2 seconds.\nApplies the maximum slow amount if the target is already Crystallised.\n\nR: The Spire (Cost: 100 mana) (CD: 140/120/100 seconds)\nZer&#039;sah launches a giant crystal underground arriving at its target location after a short delay. Enemies hit by The Spire&#039;s inner ring are instantly Crystallised and take 250/375/500 (+150% bonus AD) physical damage. The outer ring applies a single stack of Crystallise and deals 66% damage.\n\nNote: The range of this spell is 3000/3750/4500 units.\n\nThis is my first one so no hate :)\nThanks for reading this and let me know what you think.\n\nEdit Log: \nPassive :Converted stun into extra damage, increased slow amount.\nQ: Now deals bonus damage to Crystallised targets.\nW: Passive - No longer heals when an enemy is Crystallised.\n      Active - Heals for half of the damage dealt by the trap.\nE: Briefly slows targets instead of moderately slowing for 1.5 seconds. \n    Crystallised targets now have the maximum slow applied (60-90% based on level) to them when hit.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-11T05:39:16.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have multiple sources of slow (some passive) combined with movespeed and attack speed buffs. Kite for days without even needing to use strategy. The buffs aren't even the abilities, you just get all this extra stuff on top of your already decent damage abilities.\n\nAnd the heal is just too much. If you want to have something like \"heals for 50% of damage dealt\", then you can't have it as an AoE with high AD/AP scaling. With max CDR, that's under 9 seconds for a big instant heal that also hits hard. You can set 3 traps close to each other, nuke the team walking over them, and heal off all 3, while being safely out of range.","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2016-09-11T02:50:48.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your damage numbers (especially q) are far too high","replies":[{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2016-09-11T05:06:25.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're referring to the % health damage I don't think it's that ridiculously high. This deals 5-9% on only 3 melee attacks on one target and that is only if you hit them with the original missile. If you manage to kite them for a few seconds and not get basic attacked this ability does very little damage.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-11T03:06:26.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another ridiculously OP player creation, what a surprise.","replies":[{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2016-09-11T05:01:57.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would you mind elaborating on which parts are OP?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-10T10:47:15.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"like skarner mixed with fiora, xin, naut and jhin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2016-09-09T21:09:22.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really nice concept, there's a lot of interaction between her abilities and the crystal theme is strong :) Would there be a lock out on her passive stun? So once an enemy's been stunned they can't be stunned again by the passive for a short period (like Nautilus). Otherwise she could just build max attack speed and be really annoying. Other feedback would be that she seems to have lots of steroids, which is not necessarily a bad thing but would need to be carefully tuned so she wasn't OP. Overall though, great work! Do you have any lore in mind for her?","replies":[{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2016-09-10T10:12:53.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback. I added the lock out period on her passive (which i forgot to add originally) and have modified a few other things to hopefully make her have a more steady power level.

Like skarner. Another crystal champion.\nBut it does have some cool elements, like the e ability. Still, the q ability is basically a skarner e, passive is just a standard multi-hit stun like with braum and kennen and the ult seems like a long-range leona ult.","replies":[{"poster":"Zooper Dooper","date":"2016-09-10T10:05:18.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback. I understand what you're saying so I've made a few modifications to the Q and passive. I don't know if it makes them completely unique abilities but at least they aren't duplicates of other champions abilities. Let me know if you think they're in a better spot or if there is anything else I could do.","replies":[]}]}]}
