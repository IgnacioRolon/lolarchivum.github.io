Also Add In Brisbane Servers? if they haven't already.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So recently i&#039;ve been having problems with my league client. It&#039;s acting really slow, for example when i go into champ select it takes years to select the champion that i want to play and then when i actually select it it&#039;s about time to load into the game and it also does it for the runes and masteries. Like it&#039;s bullsh*t why does the new client even exist? The old one was fine. Never really had problems like this at all. Another thing is that when i accept a match it gets stuck on the accepting match overlay. So it goes into the lobby and i can&#039;t do it anything because of the overlay of the accepting match thing. Like i had a cooldown after it. It&#039;s not fair for me just to get cooldowns because of the client bug. I&#039;m wasting more of my time waiting then playing. Riot needs to fix there sh*t... Also put some Brisbane servers in too. We don&#039;t all live in Sydney for christ sake. I&#039;m getting 70 ms every match. Should be getting 20ms.","replies":[]}
