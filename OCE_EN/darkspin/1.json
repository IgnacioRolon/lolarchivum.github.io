HI. I&#039;m a reletivily new player (joined MID-season 5) to League and with the release of JHIN and the FIORA rework. I got interested in what goes into champion design, especially the passives synergy with the champs kit. And i thought with some friends about funny or cool ideas and one day, we thought of the items that u buy in the shop every game u would use in-game, but that would be kinda funny when i saw BROFRESSCO&#039;s 6 swords MASTER YI build. As time went by, one day it clicked. What about a champion which can be any META, one that has different auto attacks every 6 auto&#039;s??? and around that time i was in-love with the ZED/SHEN and JHIN lore. So i went with that concept, of a combination of IONIAN champs and assasins like TALON and even RIVEN and YASUO like champions that can be built a certain way whether it be AP/AD/TANK/full CRIT so on. \nSo what about an IONIAN champion that wields 5 blades and a gun?\n\nPASSIVE: \"Arsenal 6\"\n1. The first auto attack that u spawn-in with, is a gun. Much like JHIN&#039;s, an IONIAN crafted &quot;BEAUTIFUL WORK OF ART&quot;\nit is a gun with 1 shot, and after that shot must reload for 2 seconds. dealing 100% physical damage that negates TURRET DEFENCES. (he is vulnerable during this time! Great harass tho :)\n\n2. The second auto attack following the gun is (BIG BOY) which extends the range of his auto attack (like RAPIDFIRE CANNON on a melee) that deals AP/AD damage maybe.\n\n3. The third will be a sword that deals 50% increased CRIT damage on that auto and gains (10/20/40/60%) attack speed based on the level of your ult. \n\n4. The FOURTH shot will give lifesteal based like (5/10/20/40%) at the levels and move speed (10/20/30/40) over 2 seconds.\n\n5. The fifth auto slows on-hit (20/30/40/50%) for (1.5-2.5) seconds dealing 50% total AD and 75% bonus AP and cannot CRIT. But exSIXcutes minions below 30% health.\n\n6. The last shot grants a shield based on (HIS) missing health on a raito of (1% shield for 3% missing health)\n(These auto's rotate in this order. Unless Q does something interesting.)\n\nPASSIVE: I HIT YOU TOO MUCH I NEED SOME RESTRAINTS: COOLDOWN REDUCTION DOES NOT AFFECT THIS CHAMPION!!! \n(although, I only implemented a NO CDR because of his low Q cooldown and passive synergy. (but then there is his ULT... so i think CDR should only effect his R and or E. As a low Cooldown ULT is little OP. Just a bit. lol.)\n\nthat is the PASSIVE. which is pretty cool i think. but the stats should be changed for balance i guess. \n\nQ. Severing blade: (sorry for the long amount of text)\n(HE) throws a long skill shot.... that... well it becomes a pain to explain so. um imagine a NID spear with its range, but going faster than a LEE SIN Q, acting like a JHIN W - going through minions until it hits the first champ. BUT this Q travels tough minions until it hits the first enemy champion **or** wall and stays there for 10 seconds. Now this sword is firstly going to be the sword u had in your auto attack slot. So now your auto rotation is 5 instead of 6, so on, until it fades after 10 seconds. Now, this skillshot is on a **3 second cooldown** and can stack on an enemy champion. with stats, (40/60/80/100/120) base and (50-150% AD scaling). If u land 2, it reduces enemy champs self healing for 6 seconds and (HE) applies grievous wounds to that targets over that 6 seconds.(or something like that. its a reward for landing 2 Q&#039;s in 10 second succession). and BTW u can&#039;t throw your gun because thats just weird.\n\nW. &quot;SHUNPO&quot; (basically) \n\nWith the same range as Q or even little smaller, u can click on a targeted sword embodied in an enemy champion or structure/wall\n(or ward) and u flash on to it damaging the closet enemy within a small range (prioritises champs) dealing (20-50) base damage and 10% AD and 50% AP plus DOUBLES THE EFFECT of the sword u used with your Q u landed = OP. U get slowed late game, now ur stunned. 30% lifesteal on that hit, make it 60%. So on. (on a **10 second cooldown** or something.)\n\nalso if he is rooted or CC'ed he cannot W towards his Q or anything.\n\nE. AOE skillshot that looks like a ZED shuriken and a LUCIAN W. that knocks up champs. called (KI-lock) lol key lock. lol. wink wink.\n\nThe title pretty much, plus, (HE) launches a blade, (this sword does not stay in terrain) at a YASUO E range , **not point and click** and well, knocks them up for 1.5 seconds or something dealing 80% bonus AP and 40% total AD with base stats of (30-110) on a **10/15 second cooldown**.\n\n(His E sword should and would be the passive sword he is currently holding/ or he can target an already placed sword which he can (explode) and apply the CC.) I'm still deciding which one is a better option. AS if u can apply your cc to any word u just placed it would widen combo potential, but would make (HIM) more broken. with a combo of. (Q enemy, E him, R him, W back to him, auto, Q back up, auto) mixed with thunderbirds and RUNES and MASTERIES is bit devastating with damage.)\n\nR. THIS IS A ZED/TALON/MASTER YI Q/ILLOI E/EVE ULT THING. and no he doesn&#039;t go UNTARGETABLE... Becuase that would be aids.\n\n(HE) targets an enemy champion to ult. (ZED ult range) (HE's) body is left behind at his original location and enters (KI-MODE?) and in an AOE circle around that champion does a MASTER YI alpha strike, striking 6 things of corse and then a final AOE damage  to the targets that got hit, afterwards. also (HIS) body can be attacked with the  same amount of current health a (ME) which can kill (ME) during ult and at the end of the ult, which lasts about 1-4 seconds (depending on how many people he hit) and then returns to his body. This prevents him to ZED ult in mid team fight kill the adc/carry and not take damage and safely ult back. although if u apply CC to body it only affects the body and DOES NOT CANCEL the ult.  the stats can be like (150/200/350) base damage and 60% BONUS AD and 40% TOTAL AP. At **cooldowns of 100/80/50 seconds** (keep in mind no CDR). (so u can build him however u like, AP/AD/ FULL ATTACKSPEED to take advantage of his passive and scaling abilities, but then your squishy as hell. so its pretty cool. META breaking quality baby.\n\nAPPEARANCE: imagine SHEN&#039;s father. someone of the KINKO order, maybe that samurai in PROJECT OVERDRIVE with zeds movements, but that is Impposible to do with LORE and such but, some one like that. Even an old YASUO like character. with RED flowing hair and a streak line of gray. (much like an old yasuo that looks like KATARINA, with all the blades and that kinda thing. maybe even a cloak like JHIN&#039;s or yeah... i don&#039;t know exactly. But ay. u get the idea. \n\nLORE: I have no idea... I&#039;m not that good. ok. but something to do with IONIA. and the number 6. maybe he is called AGENT SIX. i have no clue because it is not my speciality.\n\nSO thats the overall feel/idea of my CHAMPION, it revolves around 6, much like JHIN's 4 !!!.\n\nAs GBAY99 would say, &quot;Good luck in SOLO Que. and have a wonderful day.&quot;\n\nP.S. {{champion:44}}  GEMS baby are just truly outragoues. (and i love these HALLOWEEN emotes RIOT, give me more!!!)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}  so good. ALSO i&#039;m in my placements still. so don&#039;t judge me on being BRONZE 5...

This champ should have 2 auto's in a row than wait 1.5 or 2 secs for reloading. And when casting a ability dose it reset the reloading. So for example: he fires 1 or 2 auto's than reloads but fires q. After the q do I wait anther 1.5-2 seconds to reload?\n\nThis is a really good champion idea.

(Personally i would have the Shield implemented as the 1st or second shot to Exacerbate this window of opportunity. \n(i think the inability to get cooldown reduction is a little harsh however (perhaps cooldown reduction only affects his Q and has double the effect 10% cdr resulting in 20% reduction)\n\nThe Q is a cool ability the 2 hit combo means that the second attack gains power at the cost of counterplay which is always good. \n\nW represents an interesting premise a mobility ability on par (or greater) that katarina Shunpo or Leesin's  safeguard due to the lack of the need for wards.\n a thought that could be implemented Breathe originality into the idea could possibly be that you can dash to (or appear at) a Nearby Sword this would mean that you could increase the effective power and threat of each sword throw. and present counterplay and moments where you could fake a team out by throwing a sword in one direction and run in the other. do they head to the sword you could teleport to? or do they chase you and risk you teleporting (good players will recognise if the teleport is possible because of cooldowns and mana cost, but it would present an interesting premise.\n\nThe E is nice a short range knock up with an unusual hit box rather than the bog standard circle. although if you went with the idea above perhaps the Sword remaining in terrain would be a good idea. \n\nUltimate presents good counterplay perhaps too good with your body being vulnerable after you use it but that means that you could front load the damage (although having no way to halt the ultimate without killing X-is personally i would allow hard CC such as a Stun to halt the Ult but the overall premise is good it presents an old Fiora ult but with counterplay. \n\nI like the overall idea i hope to see more of them  \n[Click here to See Cimaans](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/xFy2xJAN-champion-concept-cimaans-the-stage-magican)","replies":[{"poster":"DarkSpin","date":"2016-08-13T01:37:25.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you on commenting and giving input. very cool idea with Q and passive. i did intend on the shield being more impactful but with 6 different auto u can only get rid of them via Q to get a higher chance at obtaining the child auto more often.(i believe that X-is NEEDS more counter play within his combo's) also another idea i was trying to put in him was the fact that you don't need wards to jump 2. Because when playing kat and lee, there are these moments when u go. ahhh damn i have no wards and i could have out played that bugger. etc.\n\nBut I only implemented a NO CDR because of his low Q cooldown and passive synergy.
