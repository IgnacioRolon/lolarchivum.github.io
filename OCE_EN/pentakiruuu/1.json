Our house have fairly heavy use of the internet, but I'm more interested on who can provide quality ping and STABLE connection. I'm currently with Belong (a branch from Telstra) and it mostly works well, although drop-outs are common and so is packet loss during gameplay. 40ms ping atm, but I've heard others get near 20? Anyways chuck some recommendations down in the comments below, all contributions are appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-08T12:36:52.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Optus is pretty good they cover most parts of Aus and have nbn ready plans","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-08T10:16:37.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just **don't get TPG whatever you do**, Telstra(Bigpond) is generally pretty good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Paragon Miracle","date":"2015-02-08T09:43:42.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I Would look into getting iiNet NBN, it is probably the best internet you can get in Australia at this moment just make sure you can get it in your area.\n\nHope this helps","replies":[]}]}
