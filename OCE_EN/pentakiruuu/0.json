The actuality is, this is where losers with limited friends play, troll, and be extremely toxic together. I would usually say most people are fine and it&#039;s a few bad apples that spoil the bunch, but that really isn&#039;t the case. Please deliver on instant review of cases Riot, so we can go back to playing a fun game instead of babysitting teens. At the very least, pay us to babysit them as they cry and throw shit around?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-16T10:56:21.345+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Although I agree that normals have quite a few trolls lurking there, but that's kinda just the thing with solo queue in general and not necessarily only concerning Norms.\n\nAnd I disagree with the statement saying that someone who has limited friends is simply a loser like you described, nor should the case be about player age in general.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-17T03:40:55.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"this is where losers with limited friends play\"\n\n\nBecause online friends make you cooler than the other kids.\n\nYou daft screb.","replies":[]}]}
