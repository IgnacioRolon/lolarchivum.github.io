So far, we've not had Draft on OCE because Riot is adamant that we don't have the population to support it as a standard queue, along with everything else we've got so far. I can understand that, to a point. We don't even have TT on more than 38 hours in a week (168 hours total), and 24 hours of that is unranked. Nor do we have the RGM (Rotating Game Mode) queue up for the total time across the weekend, or even Blind/Ranked SR for all 24 hours of any given day of the week.\n\nWhile it would be good to get Draft, it could still present some issues whether it's added to the current roster or simply replaces Blind. If it were to get added to the roster, we'd probably be looking at a very strong impact on other queues that run at the same time (it certainly wouldn't be added 24/7 right off the bat), meaning it's a bit detrimental to other queues. On the other hand, if it were to replace Blind we'd have the issue of the minimum champion requirement (of 20, or 16 at the lowest) meaning a fairly significant portion of the player base would simply be unable to play the standard PVP SR modes, which is obviously not something Riot wants to do.\n\nAll that said, I think it is about time Riot gives Draft a chance, test it out on the weekends or something (sometime when there's a lot of people playing), just to see if it is viable for at least a small portion of the week.","replies":[{"poster":"Lil Oxygen Thief","date":"2017-07-09T09:04:42.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not necessarily saying that we need bans in normal games, i'm suggesting that you are just able to lock in your position before a game to avoid any confusion.","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-07-13T06:13:29.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically, we had a version of Draft mode in Oce, Riot realized that we didn't have the population to support it, and put the idea on the backburner.\n\nAt the moment, i still do not believe we have the population to support draft pick (Just on the basis of my own games, i'm usually within a 100-200 mmr gap. which is ridiculously bad compared to other servers).  If they were to implement draft pick, it would have to entirely replace blind pick, due to the numbers, and issues with queue time will still arise (and be definitely much worse)\n\nThe only conceivable way i can imagine Riot implementing draft pick currently, Would, as HeartVine said, to implement the queue in increments, as a test. However i think there should be more done.\n\n1. Bans would have to be removed (Especially for new players, this would basically make it impossible for new players to play, 10 champions banned, 9 champions used, must have atleast 20 champions OWNED to play... isn't realistic)\n\n2. the system would have to be MUUUCH lighter in ranked, maybe asking for your top 3 roles in order (Top>Mid>Adc), Attempting to find the best match of players for the first Minute or So, and then auto-filling required people.\n\n3. Auto-fill protected would have to be removed (I have once waited in a 20 minute queue, in GoldV, while auto-fill protected... it makes the sorting system MUUUUCH harder, if you play popular roles.\n\nthe ONLY benefit the system would have, is to remove \"call order\" from the game, sorting out individuals prior, so that less complaints happen.\n\nHowever then the same issues that happen in ranked, and current blindpick, would still happen... People not respecting the system, and just stealing/auto-locking whatever they feel like.. However i do believe it would minimize this... slightly..","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-07-09T07:42:41.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"totally agree.
