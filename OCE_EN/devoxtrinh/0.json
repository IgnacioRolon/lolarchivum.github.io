My internet turns off and on because it is sht, sometimes i restart it because i get 1k ping and i know i know, some people are going to say ''It's your fault for having sht internet'' or something like that but... i'd be more helpful if i reconnected with better ping rather than feeding. I seriously keep getting banned. 5 games, i wait 5-10-20-30 minutes just for a game, seriously! Do something about this sht man...  I'm not sending a ticket and wait for days, maybe even weeks just for a fuking reply. Here's a tip Riot: If you want to keep your players, unban me ;D. No i'm serious, unban me... I will go complain to my internet provider  now.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this absolute useless thread.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T09:50:00.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How long does it usually take you to reconnect?
