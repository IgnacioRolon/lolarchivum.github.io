How are new players surrposed to experience the game properly with smurfs not allowing them to learn? I cant get any BotvsAi games without someone coming in and destroying the bots not giving new players the chance to learn. Why do so many people smurf anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"rly","date":"2014-11-27T17:34:59.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Until the day Riot releases an easier way to get a new account ready and able to play ranked games (likely never), you're always gonna have smurfs taking up a fair decent portion of the < level 30 accounts. \n\nEven if there was a way to get rid of all the soloq hero smurfing, you'd still have people creating new accounts to play with their friends who have just started League... which is actually a good thing! League is a dauntingly hard pastime to pick up by yourself...\n\nAs for whether smurfs are ruining learning opportunities in bot games... keep in mind that there are 3 lanes on SR, just because one lane may be snowballing it doesn't mean there's not a solid laning phase you need to partake in before you get to the lategame where all the smurfs get to stand behind the nexus 1shotting the bots for a few minutes before the superminions win the game for them.\n\n**IN MY OPININON **Smurfs can often (not always) be a lot more toxic and/or destructive in and to PvP games than bot games as they exploit holes in the gameplay of players who quite possibly have no idea what the %%%% they are doing.\n\nGetting rekt when you're competent at the game is good because it shows you the weaknesses in your play (and if you're clever enough enough to figure it out; teaches you how to improve). Getting rekt (like going 0/12/0 in lane against a silver smurf) as a level 5 who's literally just set foot in the PvP scene is only going to demoralize them and drive them away from the game before they've given it a fair chance. They aren't going to understand what they have done wrong, nor will they understand how to improve to prevent them from being steamrolled in the future. \n\nThat being said I do know of many smurfs that were extraordinarily kind and helpful in MY under 30 games. I actually learned a great deal from a wide array of players during my climb, as i'd imagine everyone does.\n\nSo I guess in the end it comes down to human nature. Smurfing itself isn't the problem (ie it's not innately harmful or helpful), it's the individual smurf's attitudes, actions and character that determine whether or not they are an aide or hindrance to our new community members. Experienced players can pass on knowledge far better than any well made tutorial but they can also do far more harm than a bad one.\n\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-27T14:55:28.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not even gonna try answer this","replies":[]}]}
