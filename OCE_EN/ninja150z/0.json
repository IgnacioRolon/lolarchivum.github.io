The video examples for summoner spells and champions (without having to press play to load the video) is pretty cool too.  That makes everything feel really polished.  I think there must be a few things I'd like even more if I could test it but so far I've had pretty terrible luck with performance.\n\nWhat I don't like is how it applies patches while you're logged in and you can't play a game until it finishes.  Actually I might like this feature if it gave you an obvious alert when it finished. I think that I prefer to have the patch installed before I actually login so that I can begin playing straight away, though.  It sort of feels deliberate as if we are encouraged to browse the store while patches are applied.  I am not sure why anyone would want to be logged into the account before the patch has finished being applied otherwise but I'm there to play (and sometimes shop) but predominately to play.\n\nI also don't like the look of the rune pages last I looked a week or two ago because the first thing that came to my mind was minesweeper. Don't ask me why. Maybe it was the small size of the runes?  They sort of looked like little buttons. All I know is that it threw me out of the immersion because I looked at it and instantly thought \"what the hell?\" I liked the old rune page much better. \n\nI didn't have much time to explore the store but it seemed a little more complicated to navigate?  I didn't spend that much time with it to be honest so I probably shouldn't comment but maybe some other people found that too?  Anyway the #1 gripe is obviously just the performance of this client.  I open it up on my home PC (which runs legacy client fine) and the ENTIRE COMPUTER goes choppy.  I have to close the client so I can do simple things unrelated to League like open up My Documents or get a video to load.  I got thrown out of a few lobbies in ranked too because it just took so long for the client to acknowledge my mouse clicks during banning phase.  I'd really like to be able to test the new client more to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NoMoreChillies","date":"2016-12-09T04:16:12.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beta client dislikes:\nChat window blocks last position in champ select\nNo item sets\ninvite too damn small\nlag more than legacy\ncant pick skin until everyone has locked and then limited time to choose\n\n\nLegacy worked well imo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-12-08T11:17:07.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm the opposite, I love the new client for how crisp everything sits.
