To be completely honest, I have never gotten more than 6 rapid kills in a bots game so I don't know if it will keep on saying you are legendary or if it goes through the \"double/triple/quadra/penta\" again. I do know for certain that the announcer doesn't go past Pentakill (or Hexakill if you are playing that game mode)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-11T01:17:25.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, possible in bot games as your streak will continue as they respawn, you can go up to ten, my highest was eleven.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-06-11T00:34:20.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's earlyish game and u wait a bit, then kill one, then wait a bit, then kill one but keep it within streak it's possible to basically get a 10 kill streak because of short respawn timers if it happens during siege and then u are near their spawn.","replies":[{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-06-11T00:44:21.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hmm, I'd like to test this out","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-11T00:25:09.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Photoshopped obviously and it's septa.","replies":[{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-06-11T00:28:33.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually it wasn't photoshopped,this is my irl friend","replies":[{"poster":"Coolbluey","date":"2015-06-11T00:31:24.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also this: \"The heptagon is also occasionally referred to as the septagon, using \"sept-\" (an elision of septua-, a Latin-derived numerical prefix, rather than hepta-, a Greek-derived numerical prefix) together with the Greek suffix \"-agon\" meaning angle)\".
