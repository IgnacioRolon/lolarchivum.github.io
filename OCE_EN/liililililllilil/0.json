Positive games will obviously progress you further than neutral games and you won't progress at all for negative games (a negative game doesn't have to result in a punishment), but it's also worth noting that progression will take longer this season than it did last, because we have the whole season to progress rather than only part of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Periscope","date":"2018-03-26T19:14:49.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You progress by at least being \"not-unsportsmanlike\" or at least a neutral player. Your progress is impeded if you are negative in your games. You will progress if you don't say anything. If you feel like you've been neutral - positive in most of your games, write a support ticket and inquire about why you aren't progressing. They may be able to point out why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-03-24T12:26:04.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not even Riot know how it works.
