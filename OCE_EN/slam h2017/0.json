I turned level 30 not long ago and played a couple of Provisional Matches but I was being matched with gold and platinum players who were all a lot better than me so I decided to stop playing ranked for now and I was hoping to start again in the season 9 pre-season. After watching the video I was confused as to weather the season 9 changes would mean that I would get matched with people closer to my skill level or make my situation worse. If someone please explain this that would be great\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-02T00:46:19.770+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As for the video, it is only an idea they have so nothing is yet decided if it will happen. The video is just saying that normally now you have to play 10 games in ranked before you find out what your rank is. So you don't know where you will be placed.\nIn the future you will have an estimation of your rank after your 1st game which will the the LOWEST rank possible after your placements. So rather than guessing, Riot are giving you an estimate of whereabouts you will be ranked which is nice.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nYou will be put against the same players no matter when you queue since its about yours accounts MMR not about when you play. So you will be playing against Golds until you lose enough games that the system realises you are not \"good enough\" and drops you down a few levels.\nI have no idea why a brand new account is being placed in Gold games, when normally they are put into High silver games first to test them.\n\nSadly the only way to fix it is by playing and losing. The system right now thinks you are a gold level player because you got carried in your first game which was a high silver/low gold game. So you can keep playing and losing until you are \"where you belong\" or play normals until you are good enough to belong where you are.\n\nAlso you should probably not jump straight into ranked if you just hit 30 and want to climb to high ranks. You should play atleast 200-300 normal games before jumping into ranked and have atleast a 50% winrate.\nIf you really wish to not play normals anymore but don't want to ruin your accounts chances of climbing easier, I would suggest just playing Flex. The matchmaking is a bit crappy (like normal games) but people take it a little more seriously then normals.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=slamh2017\n\nYou have played 119 Normal games and won 52. 43% winrate. Which isn't great. So I would suggest you stick to normals until you get a little better. You don't want to be one of those people who are \"stuck\" in Bronze for 4 years.\n\nI would say you really need to work on your farming. You want to average about 7 cs per minute as a solo laner and you are averaging about 3-4 which is Bronze level.\n\nAlso you never buy Control Wards. Everyone in the team should buy atleast 1 per game.\n\nBoots are very important and should be the 2nd item you finish on almost every champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slam H2017","date":"2018-08-02T01:01:19.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your help","replies":[]}]}
