Of course, that doesn't mean you should be stupid and go Top Lane Kha'Zix or something, if you're gonna do something like that, please either do it in Norms, Bots, or Customs. You can't be banned or punished for doing it (technically speaking) but they will still report you for it.\n\nKeep an eye on the minimap as well. This is crucial, especially when the enemy jungler is MIA.\n\nDon't push the lane unless you're confident enough with your skill, you have an escape ability/route, or you've lit the ganking places up like a christmas tree. I see so many people, even in Diamond+ doing this, and it usually ends with them being ganked. Whether the gank was successful or not is case by case though.\n\nSmart pings. They're there for a reason, use them. Remember by Alt + Click you can let teammates know how long until your Flash, Ignite, Zhonya's, Ult, etc, has until it's up. But please, DON'T be a dick and spam them, especially if you spam them when someone fucks up, or just trolling. Excessive and unnecessary pinging is toxic, and can be reported under the unsportsman like conduct.\n\nNotify your team when summoner spells have been exhausted. Made the enemy Fiora flash away? Type \"fiora f\" and that let's your team, especially your jungler, that they can't escape as easily. Same with ults. A good player has a rough idea of how long every champions ult is on cooldown for.\n\nDon't split push if you're not playing a split push champion. Sure, Heimerdinger and Annie might have excellent burst damage and can easily fuck up a team running it down mid.. But they aren't good split pushers, they can't take the turret as fast as a Vayne or Jinx can. If you're not sure, don't do it. Stick with your team, you'll be fine.\n\nPrioritize objectives. Turrets are great to get and all, but if you have a chance to get a dragon that's worth it (like infernal), or Baron, go do it. I recently had a game where we were losing until we aced the enemy team somehow.. And if it weren't for me shouting at our team to grab that Baron, we would've lost. Team wanted Turret, I saw an opportunity, with 20 seconds until first spawn, we could get Baron. But in saying this, don't just run off and try a drive-by smite steal. As for dragons, by checking the scoreboard (tab), you can see which dragon is currently up. Cloud dragon is a dragon you wouldn't mind losing, as it only gives you movement speed. And unless your team has no escapes, you don't really need it, and can give it up.\n\nThere's more but I've hit character limit RIP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-01-05T07:07:31.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings,\n\nWhen it is the case that you are feeding every single game the important thing to realise from those deaths is why they happen. Every death in league is either from over estimating yourself or underestimating your opponent. If you can think back to your games and realise why you died, you might start to see a pattern behind it.\n\nIt might be the case that possibly you weren't warding river enough, you need to practice your combos more, or its your trading in lane. Once you figure out a common mistake that you are making you now know what to improve on when playing. Every game that you go into have a mechanic that you want to focus on.\n\n---\n\nThe next thing I would recommend is that try to stick to the basics and take regular breaks. For sticking to the basics try to stick to the champions that you know and love, by sticking to this area's you know it will make the choices that you make that are incorrect stick out a lot easier, helping you improve from them.\n\nAlong with this if it is the case that you are playing a lot and still feeding I think it might be wise to scale it back a bit and take breaks between each game. When you take a break before getting into the next game you are able to reflect on what went right and what went wrong. This will help you go into the next game with a fresh mind set and avoid any \"tilt\" that may come your way from the previous game.\n\n---\n\nOther than that I would say that specifically if it is the case that you are having trouble in the laning phase as a top laner, I would recommend focusing on the basics in some custom 1v1s with some friends. This will let you practice comboing, punishing your opponent when they over extend or use cooldowns they shouldn't along with csing with an opponent in lane.\n\n---\n\nI hope that this helps, always keep in mind that everyone goes through rough patches in their gameplay, and its always a struggle to get back to normal. However realising your mistake that you are making in feeding, which you have done, is the first step towards getting back to normal, so good job with that.\n\nIf there is any other way I can lend a hand or any specific questions that you have for me let me know and good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
