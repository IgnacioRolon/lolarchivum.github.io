You either have not warded, or you warded the \"too late\" bush.\n\nIf you have JUST WON a 1v1 and the enemy is dead, you should be recalling under tower as soon as you've shoved a bit of the lane, if you are recalling on 300 hp in the middle of your lane and you KNOW THE ENEMY JUNGLER IS SOMETHING LIKE A HECARIM OR NOCTURNE then you deserve to die. \n\nAlternatively, if you are chasing someone down their lane for the kill, and you get it, but end up being so low that they literally kill you two seconds after, that again is your fault, you should have assessed the risk and decided if the kill was worth the risk of dying, especially if you don't have eyes on the enemy jungler.

As for chasing them down and risk analysis, obviously even with risk analysis things don't always go your way, (if they always did, id be there instead of faker holding the world cup, but they don't and so I'm here taking to you instead.)  you could underestimate their power or have unlucky minion block or have miscounted the seconds on their ultimate cooldown, or just blatantly miss an ability, it does happen now and then etc etc there are multiple factors. shutdown gold included in risk analysis.\n\nas for shit talking, you have no idea what my rank is because I am using a forum account, so perhaps you shouldn't make statements so blindly. \n\nAlso in no way does my rank come into account with what i said (so how is it even shit talking), i said it confused me that he was talking like he had never been ganked when his icon was only gold, because if he ALWAYS escaped every gank unscathed, i would hazard a guess that he would be ranked a lot higher than that, seeming that even the pro's get ganked occasionally.\n\nso tell me where in that statement does my rank come into it? i am neither stating that i am better than him or disputing the fact that i die in ganks, so please enlighten me as to the point of your statement?","replies":[{"poster":"A Moist Crevice","date":"2015-11-20T23:35:55.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Weow what a strawman.\n\nSo im assuming you've never dodged a gank before, and ganking is an unstoppable force that cannot be avoided then?\n\nEdit: If you get ganked once, the jungler and laner were smart, if you get ganked 3 times, and every time was successful, then you suck.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-20T23:58:06.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course it isn't an unstoppable force, and of course i have both died and got a double in ganks, but funnily enough it has killed people in the past, so i state my surpise that you are so immune to it.\n\nalso please show me where in my string of comments that i mentioned i was successfully ganked multiple times?\ni only said i get ganked ONCE, and suddenly my lane is gone even though i was ahead.\nso what was the point you were making?","replies":[{"poster":"A Moist Crevice","date":"2015-11-21T00:48:59.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, I see\n\n\"but each time i get a kill i am low enough that i have to recall and cant finish their turret, and then i get ganked and die\"\n\nYou were referencing these as separate instances, as you recall and both come back to lane on full health. The way it was phrased made me thing you killed your lane opponent, then when on 300 health, started to recall, and were killed by recalling. That does clear things up a little bit. \n\nAnd to your earlier post, I never complained about your rank, I just told you not to bitch out someone who is gold when you are using a forum account, and not showing anyone what your real account is, and its quite typical for people who are low ranking, for example bronze or low silver, to use a forum account on the forums, since they get flamed out by higher ranked players when they make balance suggestions. I literally said nothing about your own rank, I just said don't say something like \"WHY AREN'T YOU CHALLENGER\"\n\nIts quite possible to know mechanics of something, and make a mistake or get greedy and die as a result, the person you responded to previously, as well as myself are guilty of this. It's also possible that we DO escape every single gank, as we know how to position, but perhaps we have really really terrible micro and just feed our lane opponents even when we don't get ganked.\n\nBut on a more serious note, it seems like you have serious anger issues, all the guy above did was explain gank avoidance to you, and you seem to have instantly taken it as an attack on your person, and respond with \"WHY AREN'T YOU CHALLENGER THEN?\"\n\nThat is not an adequate reply. It's you strawmanning an argument. I can know how to do something as much as I like, doesn't mean I can do it 100% of the time in practice.\n\n\nWinning lane is also not dictated by the first tower, winning lane is dictated by whoever comes out stronger. Sure you may have lost your turret, but now you can still roam and take the turrets of other lanes.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-21T01:15:16.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok thats my bad then, sorry.\n\ni use this account for a couple of reasons, 1 being i have spent a lot of money on skins and the fewer places you type your username and password in the less likely you are to be grabbed in a hacking event.\n2 being i generally have quite in-depth discussions and would rather not be reported in game because i happened to get on someones bad side. \n\nanger is not present at all, i simply responded in a passive aggressive way to a passive aggressive comment. My first post was just strengthening the original poster's comment that towers are much weaker now and so games are more prone to snowballing nothing negative about that, which was then followed by a comment with the polished message of \"you must suck at warding\" \"what? you cant 2v1 wow you suck\" which were completely unnecessary, and by saying that implies that he is above all that, so i merely responded with a message of \"why don't you practice what you preach\"\nif you read all my comments there is no anger at all, sure there may be snarky remarks and passive aggressive/sarcastic lines, and thats just because i have no patience for the \"holier than thou\" attitude or for people who pose emotional/irrational arguments without considering all the factors and evidence, and he pertained to the first of those criteria.\n\nalso its perfectly fine to know what to do but not be able to do it 100% of the time, but if you 'cant' do it 100% of the time then you have no grounds to diminish others for the same offence, by all means give them advice, but saying \"why cant you 2v1?\" has connotations of \"i can, why cant you\" and unless you can 2v1 100% of the time then you have no grounds, and you just are adding negative comments for no reason.\n\nAlso yes that is the case but i would rather roam with my tower than without it. it is never counterproductive to have one more tower than the enemy.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-11-21T06:04:28.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what goin on in is thread","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-20T07:01:46.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Towers do scale over time ATM.
