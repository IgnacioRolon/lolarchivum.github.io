Does frozen heart make you auto slower or does it just make your attack speed lower? because if it lowers your attack speed, auto attack resets wouldn&#039;t be effected? is this the case with riven, or does Frozen heart actually slow her fast combo?\r\n{{champion:92}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-25T09:30:39.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes Attack speed slows affect attack casting, you should know this from playing against Nasus and trying to orb walk. If you play Riven into Nasus it's really hard to be running with Q-s then turning to land an auto-attack because it takes several years to land your attack with 0.0001 attacks a second.
