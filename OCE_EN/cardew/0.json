( ;_; ) \r\nAnyway, after my provisionals I&#039;ve been playing a few games of ranked and my 1st win I recieved 21 LP. The second time I won I recieved 25 LP and the third time I won I have just recieved 28 LP. What&#039;s with the increasing LP? I thought that 25 LP was alot to get from a win because from 0 LP, after 4 wins you&#039;ll get to your promos. That seems really fast. \r\nJust wondering what&#039;s with my increasing LP gain.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n-Cardew","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-15T09:52:22.242+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"First you need to understand what elo is. Elo is basically a number rating of your skill, the more games you win the higher it gets. And if you win against a team with more elo than you, then you'll gain a lot in return (since you were supposed to loose). This also works vice versa.\n\nBronze 2 consists of players with on average 1150 elo. You must be playing at higher elo than this, say at 1250 elo. Since you're essentially playing at a harder difficulty, you should be rewarded with more LP.\n\nIt'll also help you climb faster to get to where you really belong.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-15T09:46:37.278+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your mmr increases when you win.\nthe higher your mmr, the more LP you gain.","replies":[{"poster":"Cardew","date":"2015-09-15T09:51:16.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but I was placed in Bronze 2.

So yes 25-30LP a game is high but it's the systems way of moving you towards the ranking your skill deserves.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-15T10:52:26.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can, it is possible, to do so well that you skip ranks, say going from Silver 4 to Silver 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-09-15T09:56:05.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was receiving 35 LP per win once, playing at Silver 3 against Gold 4.
