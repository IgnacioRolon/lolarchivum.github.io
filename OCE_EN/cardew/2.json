He can mid as well as Jungle. You can also build him tanky (although its not that good anymore).\n\nI own both and personally I'm terrible with both. But still have a lot of fun with Fizz.\n\n{{champion:105}}\n\nA tip for both though. If you have trouble in mid and find yourself 0-3. Its a simple fix. Just wait til you have your first item then go bot and get a double kill. They kill ADC's and supps ridiculously fast and easy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corsage","date":"2015-12-04T09:17:24.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's up to your playstyle, both champion are assassin but one is AD and the other is AP\nTalon is very mobile but his escape is questionable , on the otherhand Fizz kit make people mad since he is very slippery especially when he has a lot of CDR.\nIMO : I would get Fizz because I think he is more powerful in the current meta.","replies":[]}]}
