I'm fine with that as long as there's a viable role open. For example, the new DJ Sona skin scares me because of the people who decide to play jungle Sona and don't even communicate to the team in champ select. I'm fine with having to play leona jungle if someone instalocks sona, as long as they respond to when we say 'go support, I'll jungle'.\r\nIs there anything that anyone can do about people like this? Could there be a mode for people who want to play their champ? Or at least a way to flag people who don't communicate in champ select.","replies":[{"poster":"Nature","date":"2015-03-01T08:25:33.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teambuilder?","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-01T07:45:26.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's funny cause given your match history this hasn't actually occurred, and honestly, not a lot of people instalock support.","replies":[]}]}
