But I  assume I know how the mmr system works as in you gain/lose lp and mmr based on the other team. I was s5 0-30lp for a while and started getting matched with bronze which I understand but while in bronze I&#039;ve needed 2 wins to make up for 1 loss. My mmr is about 960-1000 according to op.gg and I was recently matched with a team of 2 silvers (middle silver 5ish), one bronze and 2 unranked, with my team being 3 bronze and 2 unranked. I expected to have a hard time this game and I did lose. But I lost 24lp for this one game. A few games ago I lost 28lp which really freaked me out. And my game before last was only a ~16lp gain\r\nAnyway, my team being almost a whole division lower, I expected a significant mmr difference and not to lose so much lp. Isn&#039;t mmr what lp +/- is based on? Why do I lose so much lp when the other team are higher rank? \r\nAlso some climbing advice would be great, I can&#039;t seem to win even if I win lane and roam and ward a lot :(\r\nThanks :D","replies":[]}
