Any further violations will more than likely result in a permanent suspension. This is made explicitly clear in the reform card and is something you should be very aware of. \n\nWhile it will take time, you can still restore your account to good standing with consistent good (or at least neutral) behaviour, and so long as you hit honour 2 before ranked rewards for next season, you won't lose anything you can't earn back. A permanent suspension on the other hand is exactly that. Permanent.\n\nCasual hate speech, whether it is explicitly intended as such or not (though this was clearly at the very least meant as an insult), has no place in a healthy community. Within your own circles, while I certainly can't endorse it, you do you. It is up to you and the members of those circles to decide what is and isn't ok within the confines of actual laws. \n\nIn the wider League community however it is not accepted or permitted. Whether or not you agree with the sentiment, you have agreed to abide by the community's guidelines in order to play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"slxw","date":"2018-12-23T13:34:53.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not off just that. but what is that ?","replies":[]}]}
