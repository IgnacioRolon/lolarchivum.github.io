I&#039;ve been told it&#039;s dependent on how other people play the character.\r\nIn one of my last matches I had 28/1/6, 212 CS and had by far the most gold in the match. I did only take the 2 towers in my lane and an inhibitor but I warded at every possible opportunity (where it was appropriate). This match went on for 43:34 (they did not want to die at the end XD) and I got an A+.\r\nI&#039;ve also gotten an A+ from 10/2/8 before taking the same amount of towers, etc.\r\nAm I cursed or do I just have to get good?

Near Perfect CS\n\n2. A positive KDA\n\n\n\nYou got the KDA part down absolutely fine but the CS needs some work. Even as a jungler, getting an S is hard and I had to earn 363 CS in 45 min just for a **S-**. So, you should CS at around 7.6 per min or higher to get an S on SR.\n\nGood Luck and Have Fun!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-02-03T16:19:11.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, 28/1/6 is a very, very nice score. Well done. If it was up to me I would just hand you an S+ and give you a friendly slap of congratulations on the back, even though your CS is poor, however I think that is problem.\n\n\"Perfect\" CS usually means about ten CS per minute, which is extremely hard to get, but for 42 minutes I would say a good CS score would be about 300. 212 is actually quite bad for someone with such good wave clear like Ahri, and that would definitely be why you didn't acheive an S. \n\nOh well, better luck next time!","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-03T06:57:18.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imo 28/1/6 is an impressive KDA, but it doesn't really make you look like a team player, no?
