This was used simply to host the games in a live environment whenever we did semi's/finals that room was full of cameras and equipment when this went on, not chairs :P\n\nI'm not the best one to ask about this, but we're not yet at a stage where we can support live crowds for our regular season matches.\nThink of us as being at the stage the NA LCS was in 2013, but with some of the lessons from that era built into our league to make it the best we can.\n\nIf interest in the OPL continues to rise (support your team!), and with the introduction of bigger and better team sponsors, who knows what we'll be able to do in a year or two.","replies":[]}]}
