I&#039;ve found that teams are _soo _ much less toxic (generally speaking), everyone is satisfied with the roll they have and there&#039;s such good synergy. I think overall it&#039;s really improved the quality of the game and I find I enjoy it a lot more than how it was before. Aside from it being a little slow for my liking, I think a similar version of it should be used in norms :) We&#039;ve had Team Builder in the past, which I quite enjoyed ~~but never used seeing as though there was a 45 minute waiting period because no one used it enough.~~\r\nI think enforcing what we have now in ranked is a great idea. No more arguing over who called what first, no more autolocking, no more trolls and lost games because someone&#039;s pissed they didn&#039;t get the lane they wanted. I also think this would really set apart League from other games like it :)\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[]}
