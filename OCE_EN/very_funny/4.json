The problem at the moment is that when they stop they don't come back. Meaning that both new and old players won't get to experience it (again).\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple: Have a 1 or 2 week rotation for the game modes. Meaning that every 9-18 weeks (as there are presently 9 game modes). The roster will repeat. Or a vote for a different game mode every 1-2 weeks, with a game mode not repeating for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThen everyone is happy.\r\n\r\n*This is a double post, I also posted this in Miscellaneous.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-01T06:50:10.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The problem at the moment is that when they stop they don't come back.\n\nYes, because after the release of One For All, Hexakill and, most importantly, Ultra Rapid Fire we ***NEVER*** saw any of them again.\n\nUntil they got re-released that is...\n\nSure, OFA and Hexakill were a little different but that was Riot trying to improve on the original concept, you can't blame them for trying to add more fun to Featured Game Modes, can you? As for URF, it still hasn't changed from the original concept (save for a few \"keeping it fun\" changes).\n\nNo doubt we'll be seeing a few of the other popular Featured Game Modes make an appearance at some point.\n\nAs for the \"Featured Game Mode Roster\" idea it seems Riot isn't planning on something like that. It's been suggested many times but Riot have given no indication that they're even looking into it (to the best of my knowledge). We can hope for the best but you should expect nothing to happen about it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pineapple Squish","date":"2015-08-01T05:55:09.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, this would be amazing.
