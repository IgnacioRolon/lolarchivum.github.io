For example, when you first introduced URF it was advertised as &#039;The future of League&#039;. Last year you released a song with it.\r\n\r\nA suggestion that would keep the hype for URF and the rotating game mode queue is that the RGM doesn&#039;t start until April 1st of the new year with the first mode being URF of course. I get that it might get tricky to find new ways to promote it but I am sure with your workforce and a year of ideas you&#039;ll be able to come up with something great. It could also be a way to reintroduce the RGM to the new year.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nVery Funny","replies":[]}
