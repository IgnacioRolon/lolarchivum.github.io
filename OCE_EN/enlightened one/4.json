Now, you can say &quot; just mute &quot; or &quot; Ignore them &quot;, which is perfectly valid. What I&#039;m talking specifically about is the mentality behind it and trying to prevent these people from ever getting to that \r\n&quot;Tilt&quot;\r\nKeep your teams spirits high. \r\nThis doesn&#039;t require speaking or &quot; chatting &quot; it requires a show of strong and decisive leadership from those who can take that position. IE BOT LANE AND JUNGLE. These three, should be able to carry the game practically by themselves with the right team work. \r\n\r\nI have more to say on this topic though I&#039;d really like to share it in conversation with others who have been thinking about this.\r\n\r\nThis happens not only in Rift but also in ARAM where your team has been dealt a low poke but high engage team, and the enemy team has heaps of poke and very little engage. The simplest answer to that is WORK AS A TEAM, REACT QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AND ALWAYS RELY ON YOURSELF FIRST AND THEN THE REST OF YOUR TEAM.{{champion:43}}","replies":[{"poster":"KingOfWolves","date":"2015-08-08T05:08:10.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The Toxicity on OCE is unbelievable, I would have stayed on the American servers if I knew that OCE was like this. They really need to start making serious punishments for the attitude, like removal from all ranked matches. Make them have to pay a service to get it re-activated, $100 per ban seems fair. Make it reset every season so they can learn. I started playing a few months after LOL came out, I have spent so much money now that I really should not have. \n\nYeah the whole mute system should be overhauled, if they get muted too often take away chat privlages. Half of my games end up with me reporting two people and setting 3 to ignore. My ignore list eclipses my friends list, I rarely even talk any more because I would rather not even risk speaking with some toxic, even at the cost of being friendly and being helpful/supportive of my team.\n\nThe whole tilt thing though is a bit of a mentality thing, its not really 100% accurate. While a negative attitude does hurt morale in a team its rather the lack of any real immediate punishment or deterrent. Being banned 6 months later after you got reported is not going to deter people because they wont even know what particular event caused it. There needs to be an immediate deterrent in place, perhaps even an in-game one. Make a toxic player have a 'toxic' symbol above their portrait and character for the game. Does nothing but I guarantee that the enemy team will make his life hell just to set him off. Chat bans work too but it needs to be on a game-by-game basis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-08T06:47:02.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you*","replies":[{"poster":"Enlightened One","date":"2015-08-08T07:16:52.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read the title a thousand times and dind't see that D\"X","replies":[{"poster":"Enlightened One","date":"2015-08-08T07:17:32.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's going to annoy the crap out of me, being unable to edit it and all v-v","replies":[]}]}]}]}
