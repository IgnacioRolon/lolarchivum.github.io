I enjoy the small amounts of damage I do get off as I also do so in a way that makes the opponent either shrink away in fear or round back in a panic so my ADC can jump on their back and possibly punch their heart through their chest with what ever axe/arrow/giant shurakan thing. etc etc .\r\n\r\nI realize she has great potential for AP bursting people with combos and quick moving. \r\nHowever I haven&#039;t really experienced other items I liked on her apart from {{item:3069}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3504}} {{item:3151}}{{item:3285}} {{item:3290}}   Maybe I could try{{item:3115}} {{item:3124}} {{item:3100}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3152}} {{item:3222}} \r\n\r\nI pretty much want to try other builds but I really enjoy the one I&#039;ve been doing recently as it really seem to work effectively with my style of play.\r\nI tend to always be searching for a whole team fight I&#039;ll never really engage unless there are more than 2 of us there ( unless it&#039;s just in lane faze and I have sight stone available )\r\n\r\nI tend to really think about the strategic team fight compositions. However I do understand that I am not at my best as I still die.\r\nSome games I wont at all some games I&#039;ll die enough that I&#039;ll want to quite for all of .000001 of a second and then realize that surrendering is for pussies who can&#039;t defend. So I defend. \r\nTry harder, think clearer and focus so much more that it&#039;s enough to notice a difference in play almost immediately.\r\nTake a deep breath. Take a few moments to think ahead, check your map check your team mates, check yourself. \r\nMove forward.\r\n\r\nOh and quick tip, keep your mouth shut. Don&#039;t blame anyone. Not even yourself. See your mistake, learn, and adapt.\r\n\r\nx&quot;D{{champion:34}} {{item:3840}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-18T12:28:06.030+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:14}} \n\n{{item:1055}} {{item:1001}} {{item:3070}} {{item:3004}} {{item:3057}} {{item:3047}} /{{item:3006}} /{{item:3111}} {{item:3042}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3035}} or {{item:3072}} instead of {{item:3035}}  if they aren't armor stackers or {{item:3026}} instead of {{item:3072}}  or {{item:3111}} {{item:3042}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3031}} and possibly {{item:3142}} after or before {{item:3031}}  also instead of or coupled with {{item:3035}} to capitalize an early lead or just {{item:3142}} and {{item:3031}} if they don't look like they'll armor stack into {{item:3026}} \n\nMakes a sick AD Mid laner.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-08-18T04:19:09.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i roll sona on aram... the joy.","replies":[]}]}
