It's been like this since beta. They hold most of the power and honest players are made to endure them for at least 20 minutes if not much longer! (seeing as you can't ff if trolls occupy 2 of the 5 slots in a team). The other problem is that players are usually only ever banned if they troll consistently, it doesn't account for single match experience of any user at any time which lets a lot of 'toxicity' slip through.\r\n\r\nProblem: 1 person can ruin the game for both teams, 1 team is annoyed at someone intentionally feeding because they lose, the other team gets an unsatisfactory victory, both teams lose and the troll wins.\r\n\r\nSolution: In game report feature, people on both teams can report someone for trolling, reaching the threshold of people for a ban or whatever allows people to leave the game safely (but not the person who was reported).\r\n\r\nComplications: Abuse (in the same capacity that people can abuse the report feature normally, but in this way it ends the game), could solve by making it ban worthy to report incorrectly. \r\n\r\nOr maybe a solution like; if someone is completely negative on your team with no cs and is obviously trolling in a tier of matchmaking were they don't have an excuse then just let the other players DC. \r\n\r\nthoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-01-31T05:50:27.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Spaceman Hobbes","date":"2015-01-31T05:53:49.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"That is the only way to deal with it.\nAt the end of the day it's a childrens game, being played by children.\n\nExpect childish antics to ensue.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-01-31T09:17:07.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude, a lot more adults/teenagers probably play this game than little children.........","replies":[{"poster":"UrSuperman","date":"2016-09-25T07:53:26.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"U could say adults/teenagers with mental health issue is playing this game because its free and  they can just sit down all day and play while using Centerlink to pay for their food and rent that it, assuming u r in OCE","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2016-09-26T01:24:36.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Things can change in 2 years....","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
