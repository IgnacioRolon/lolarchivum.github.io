Here i was looking forward to playing all double IP weekend, but alas due to 200-5000 ping spikes every 30 seconds I've only been able to play 6 games. I just left a game where exactly this happened and i'm not going to be surprised if i get banned for 3 days again. Yes i'm not the best at staying in losing games, i often leave them when there is no hope and i except when i get banned because it was my fault. But when i lose to lag, i can't play at all and often feed because i'm 'frozen' in these moments of pure lag. If these don't get fixed i'm afraid Riot, you've lost a player.","replies":[{"poster":"Daellym","date":"2015-01-20T14:21:19.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to agree, and people having lag spike issues on Oceania are NOT rare... I would be happy if Riot said it was on my end but it doesn't even seem like they know...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smelly Abo Coon","date":"2015-08-11T12:17:16.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have no problems with other games, but only league and especially aram games from 6pm to 10pm roughly. Sometimes I get into good games of 60 ping, but most of the time within that time scale i get average of 150 throughout the whole game, making most skillshot and kiting champs unplayable. And it's horrible playing with more than 70 ping.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-11-30T10:12:09.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its easy to blame Riot and all, but if the other 9 players in the game have no problem then that means the server is likely working with stability. I too get ping troubles... using my pocket wifi but not my main connection which is also pretty bad to be honest. Considering I have no major troubles with ping on my connection at home when I do with Garry's Mod, Nosgoth, Neverwinter, Bloody Good Time, Sanctum.......\nBasically, my point is that I have a lot of games where I do have ping issues yet LoL isn't one of them.","replies":[]}]}
