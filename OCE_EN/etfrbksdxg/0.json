So they had to basically pull everything by themselves, in off times essentially, hence the progress was immensely hindered and was only completed very recently.\n\nBut it's just an hypothesis of mine.\n\nTbh, as much as I would like to demand more as I value equality greatly. But considering we actually got the damn thing which had since been forgotten by everybody, I personally am willing to give it a free pass. It's not the full experience no doubt, but they have shown that they're willing to go this far to keep a promise and I'm cool with that.\n\nKinda like how a delivery man who took literally years to deliver a package, due to numerous extreme difficulties/hazards he had met during his way.

Such as education for one, averagely (or so I heard) they are paying 4 times the fees local kids are paying. Then there are bus tickets, health care etc.\n\nBut then you have refugees, I mean sure, they definitely suffer a lot back in their homes and the trip across sea must have been detrimental.

Getting your hands twisted from doing too many things at once is never good.\n\nI am not saying to just kick the refugees back, because that's just not cool from both moral and economical point of view.
