It&#039;s up to you to define what you want your gaming experience to be!\n\n**Rules &amp; Member Complaints\n**\nIn Define Gaming, we want to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable experience. Define Gaming has a set of rules and a member complaint system to hold people to respectable standards and punish those who choose not to meet them. Our rule list can't be found here they are on our website. Go to the damn website!
