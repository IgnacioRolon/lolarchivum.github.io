Let us take Zed for instance, Zed is a really powerful champ, one of the if not the most powerful midlaner, he has been for a long time, almost everyone but zed mains want his kit to be made weaker as the only real counter to him is getting a zhonya's, which a real good zed can easily counter by murdering you with his shuriken attack. Then there is also Darius, who got buffed a month ago, because Riot was afraid he would fall out of the meta? As for adcs and supports, them rito actually sometimes balances right. Jungle is another thing where the meta always has this one champ, did you guess who he is? If uou guessed Lee Sin you are correct, for some reason Lee is always in the meta too.\r\n\r\nOut of the 3 previously mentioned champs, the only one whose gameplay is very focused on skill is Lee Sin, as in order to lay him well one must master his combos, Darius on the other hand is a walk in the park and wins most lanes easily without requiring much skill to use, Zed is more neutral, as he is not hard to learn at all, but once mastered is a real beast who can fulfill any weaaboo emo kid's dreams of flashy plays. \r\n\r\nI realize rito is after some big profits which is the actual reason why some champs can be better by a margin than others, but I think it would be fun for some champs who have been dead for a while to rise in to the meta, as the current one feels boring in every aspect.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2019-06-17T04:10:32.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darius is a walk in the park when the enemy top lets you stack passive for free. Darius is a very good pick at the moment for sure but hes pretty much all or nothing and there are plenty of champions in the meta that do fairly well against him. \n\nZed takes way more skill than leesin to be played to his max potential imo and its no one but the zed mains in high elo who understand this about zeds kit. The problem with zed is that even if you play him to his max potential, he cannot 1v5 like some other champions can, for example vayne. Since he is limited by his energy and his main kill potential is all in his R. Which means he has to be strong at least in the 1v1 and in laning, he is afterall an assasin.|\n\nLeesin on the other hand cannot be weak early game or else he is useless. Thats pretty much it. He has to be strong early to reward good players with him because if he doesn't get ahead early he is basically a champ with a 1 knockup and thats it.","replies":[{"poster":"always improve","date":"2019-06-17T11:09:24.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like both Darius and Zed are champs that are overtuned in lower ranks simply because players can't play around their weaknesses but they become balanced at higher elos.

All there is to consider is skill cap and counter play.  A lot of people dont know how to counterplay zed apart from stack armour or rush zhonyas in low mmr, and thats what makes them low mmr. It is just as easy to be a shit zed than it is to be a shit leesin. Both have missable skillshots,  both have potential to misuse gap closers and escapes. Lee has to make good plays in a split second, zed has hit hit triple q and double e while managing shadow cooldowns and blinks. They can both kill you level 6 with an all in full hp if you let them. Darius is similar except he has the juggernaut playstyle meaning you counterplay differently. I guess what you mean to say is their strengths are more suited towards low mmr games than if you were to play a tank even though tanks are much more preferable to a leesin and ap control mages are more preferable to ad assasins.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Daymon","date":"2019-06-18T10:48:00.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just change pantheons w in the vgu if u want, make it so you can jump by ground targetting, and make ult cancel cooldown time have cdr% apply to it. aside from that dont change anything.\nsword of the occult add\nleviathan add\nmana potion add\nred wards 50gold, 3hp\nthe only thing ur account can get locked out of play for should be third party hacking NOTHING ELSE\nscuttler revert to 2 minutes, 50% hp/manaback/xpgain = balanced\n\nand ur game would be fun again\n\nif u were actually decent\nblind ranked mode where i q my presetup and it loads me straight into game\nblock third parties from stealing ur database account snooping information\nmake all games blind ranked like that no options from lvl 1-1000 accs only game mode. its 2019.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-17T11:29:09.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps this can offer you some insight into why they make the decisions they do:\nhttps://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/2019/06/join-us-for-a-patch-cycle/","replies":[]}]}
