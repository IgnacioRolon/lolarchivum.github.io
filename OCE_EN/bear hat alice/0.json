If your badges are missing or you feel you have incorrect badges, please file a ticket with support [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).**\n\nWe’re rolling out ranked season badges to the boards right now! Please be aware this can take a while because of the sheer number of players receiving them, but we’ll update this thread when we’ve finished. You’ll see your ranked badges for all seasons (not just the most recent) in your boards profile or when you hover over your name in the boards.\n\n**As a reminder, you’ll get a badge for each season you finished Gold or higher (except Season 2, where you had to be Platinum or higher).**\n\nThanks for your patience!","replies":[{"poster":"Arkadian","date":"2014-11-26T00:10:07.125+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is the 2014 badge so weird?
