Yet, they still tend to be playing on this server?\r\nIt may only be a one-time thing but even if it's a \"one-time thing\", I'd like to know Riots actual reason behind letting these players loose. If you provide them with the power to be toxic, can i be toxic as well without getting banned or is it just favoritism for the toxic ones?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-10-02T03:02:18.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There should be no reason that you'd be unable to get a response from a person when interacting with Support. The only time you wouldn't get a person is if it's \"Blitzcrank Bot\" responding to the ticket, which should only occur in \"clear cut\" cases, and even then you can request a response from a person and you *should* receive one at that point. Even then, however, the Support staff wont be able to share any information about what action may be taken against other players.\n\nThe specific circumstances of any given case can easily impact how it will be dealt with. Chat offences can often lead to chat restrictions, which may appear as though no action has been taken (unlike bans which show a distinct gap in match history), and other types of offences can result in action not being taken *yet* (while still contributing to potential punishments), depending on the degree of the offences (or, in the case of third party software, being delayed due to the \"ban wave\" approach).","replies":[{"poster":"Noobster","date":"2019-10-02T03:45:22.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I \"request for a human\" but even so, I don't get a response :/ I just get a survey and nothing else.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-02T05:06:24.917+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spamming the same or similar tickets to support can result in them being automatically closed.\n\nThere are a few other things that can cause it, but that's the one I've heard of most often.
