As one may not have the money to do so, but the RP available to transfer.\r\n\r\nExample: If i purchased a $25 RP Gift card for myself. Which roughly amounts to 2700 ish RP. Then i proceed use 1700 which then leaves me with 1000RP. I am able to gift to the other player the 1000RP which i hold as a gift rather than purchasing another RP card such as a $10 RP card as a gift.\r\n\r\nThank you to anyone that discovers this message on the boards and took their time reading it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2018-11-16T23:58:18.242+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey noobster,\n\nYou're right that chromas are individual items so you'd think they would be giftable just like skins or champions. The reason chromas aren't giftable appears to be simply that it wasn't prioritised on the launch of the new client, and it's still not a priority for the team since  there's still [a whole lot of work](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/client/client-features/future-plans-client) to be done on the client. See Riot KateyKhaos's [response](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/Jxx6j3B1-gifting-chromas-bugged?comment=000100000000000000000001000000010000) for more info.\n\nAs for your second question; RP transfers not being allowed is an old safeguard against \"RP farming\". Back in the day you would get 400 RP for free once you reached level 3, so RP transfer was disabled to stop people leveling up 100s of smurfs to transfer RP to their main account. Now that system has been replaced with the Hextech system though, so hopefully once the developers finish the important stuff they start allowing RP transfers between accounts.\n\nHopefully that answered your questions :)","replies":[]}]}
