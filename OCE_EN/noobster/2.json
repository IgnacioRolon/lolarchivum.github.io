And no, i don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible for someone to roll all the 867+ Skins with the champions they get with the chests and capsules (unless they bot for level ups)\nTLDR: More active players.\n\nMy reasoning for this is that in your League of Legends in-game store, champions worth 6300 BE is worth 975 RP, 4800 BE is worth 880 RP, 3150 BE is worth 790 RP, 1350 BE is worth 585 RP, and 450 BE is worth 260 RP so i don&#039;t see why we can&#039;t do something like this.\n\nIf the player base cannot re-roll champions that are worth the same amount RP that skins do, why would the company even place a price on them worth the value of a skin? (other than for the one trick ponies that wanna smurf in the lower elo for their &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;joy&quot;, torturing them in their promos out of Iron IV)\n\nTruly I Thank You to all who found this and took their time reading this impossible dream of an idea.","replies":[]}
