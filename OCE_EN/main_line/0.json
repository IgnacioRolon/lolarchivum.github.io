This is what the edibility criteria was for selection.\n\nIn majority of sport within Australia ACT is considered to be NSW eligible and we just followed suit there.\n\nWhilst I agree in future we should potentially look at opening up more teams, this is just the first step. Also the Rest of OCE isnt something I really like just due to the fact it feels like the other guys. \n\nAs for QLD I think that WZRD was definitely a better choice than Midbeast but thats what selection is supposed to do, generate conversation and hype for the event.\n\nCheers,","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-25T07:28:21.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough with the eligibility rules. But yeah more teams would be awesome, it means no one will miss out (e.g. guys from WA , Shernfire, Pacman, Blinky, Chelby - NZ are probably good enough to field two teams in this). I suggested 'Rest of OCE' but it could well be the island nations, for example Fiji have some good players like Illusion (played Challenger series last year).\n\nAnyways I hope to get some tickets and come along. Cheers also!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-25T05:26:11.428+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like your idea about Rest of OCE - the other guys involved in Origins are also going to share some thoughts and explanations, but its definitely important to note that this is the 1st year and we definitely have room to improve if our players are loving it as much as we are!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-25T05:28:04.310+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that there should at least be a \"Rest of Oceania\" team to represent the islands. It's like having teams for England, Scotland, and Wales, and leaving out Ireland (or Northern Ireland). **It's like Riot don't care about the players... oh wait, they don't**.\n\nSplitting NZ into North and South is a good idea, but it doesn't really matter considering how small New Zealand is compared to Australia.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure Midbeast said he wants to put the pro scene on hold (and focus more on his YouTube) until he's finished his studies (I know he did sub in for a few games during his summer break).","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2017-05-25T06:44:19.645+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A pacific islands idea would be cool! We could combine Fiji, Vanuatu, etc into a team! Having north and south island is also cool!\n\nAt the end of the day, if this tournament is successful  who knows what the future will hold. So pick a team and get behind them :-)","replies":[]}]}]}
