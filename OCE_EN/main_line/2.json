The Janna followed me around in the jungle and stole camps, fed and bought a zillion sightstones. In addition her and her idiot buddy (Kayle) argued that they called duo bot, when they hadn&#039;t and another duo bot that DID call and locked was forced to have to go to other lanes.\n\nI dont wish to waste time with these idiots, I&#039;ve got better things to do, so I warned them that i would leave and they didn&#039;t stop so I left. Don&#039;t tell me that I have to put up with this BS the whole game and then report them?\n\nP.S. Look at how many wards they placed on the fountain.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-05-25T17:08:07.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"jungle morgana. not even level 30, so no complete set of masteries or runes. 2 attack speed quints + scaling runes....as a jungle morgana....and to top it off, your 1st skill was your Q......janna only got 1 monster in your jungle the entire game, and she only bought all those sightstones 30 seconds before the  end of the game, which you had apparently stuck around for since you know she put all those wards down. the only 2 level 18s in the game were on your team\n\npipe down chump, i can smell your lying privileged pretentiousness from my block list. you're just as bad as them. you just watched your team suffer instead of trying to help, which you could have even as a shitty jungle morg","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-26T02:02:44.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=A0eFIoN9,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-05-25T17:08:07.343+0000)\n>\n> jungle morgana. not even level 30, so no complete set of masteries or runes. 2 attack speed quints + scaling runes....as a jungle morgana....and to top it off, your 1st skill was your Q......janna only got 1 monster in your jungle the entire game, and she only bought all those sightstones 30 seconds before the  end of the game, which you had apparently stuck around for since you know she put all those wards down. the only 2 level 18s in the game were on your team\n> \n> pipe down chump, i can smell your lying privileged pretentiousness from my block list. you're just as bad as them. you just watched your team suffer instead of trying to help, which you could have even as a shitty jungle morg\n\nI don't care a flying fig who my champion was or what skill i levelled first. Lets talk about the facts here.\n\n1. Janna and Kayle spammed in the team chat \"duo bot' and ruthlessly refused to accept that there was already a duo bot. Ever wondered why I was Jungle Morgana?\n2. Janna and Kayle then went mid together for a short period of time (even though they called duo bot), after that Janna went to the enemy red buff and sat there for a couple of minutes (right on top of the buff, not in any bush). Then she came to annoy me in the jungle by trying to steal my camps. **Sure she only got one, because I'm reasonably good at last hitting.** But that is not the point, I asked her politely to leave me alone, and she didn't. Then I warned her to stop trolling. Then I left.\n3. My first skill was a Q because two trolls decided to instigate an early invade. Despite this, they intentionally gave up first blood by leaving Ezreal to die. Did I know they were trolling at this stage? No.\n4. I did not stick around to see all of the sightstone trolling. I can read a summary of the game thank you very much. Don't assume things before you know the facts. You could have asked me.\n\nSo the question stands, what is the procedure when two idiots are intent on trolling the game like in this one?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-26T10:08:32.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But incidentally, I used your advice in this game:\n\n[http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/91267321/200912352](http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/91267321/200912352)\n\nI guess they wanted to duo so badly that they went duo jungle.
