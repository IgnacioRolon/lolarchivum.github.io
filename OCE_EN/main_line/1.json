Hope you get the Infernal or Cloud ones!\r\n- Rift Herald is super strong, and low elo need to realise this.\r\n- Towers are too easily melted now that mages do more damage to them, it seems like Riot want games to finish faster.\r\n- Hextech items are garbage, except Gunblade on niche champions.\r\n- Removal of boot enchantments is kinda disappointing -  thought Riot wanted diversity? Or is it just easier programming? The previous removal of homeguard was bad enough.\r\n- Bloodrazor is super broken on Kindred.\r\n- Guinsoos is a beastly late game item for on-hit Teemo, who also got buffs this patch :\\ .\r\n- Soraka nerfs - good shit.\r\n- Frostfang and Spellthiefs mana nerfs = good stuff, was way OP before.\r\n- Devourer - good riddance.\r\n- Spirit Visage buffs = welcome to the tank meta. Super broken on Mundo.\r\n- Warmog&#039;s Buffs = HELLO MUNDO\r\n- Black Cleaver changes - undecided.\r\n- Righteous Glory - nerfed into the ground. Will probably get removed at some stage due to lack of use.\r\n- Undecided about jungle timers being visible to both teams. Could create more strategies, or could just be a buff to noobs.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-05-04T22:28:24.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with a lot of the above, but disagree on a few points.\n\n1) Yep, Athene's is now trash-tier if you're not a healer support.\n2) Love love LOVE the changes to drag. It really adds a lot of the strategy and intensity of the game.\n3) Agree, Rift Herald is just amazing. Give it to your split pusher and destroy the game.\n4) The rocket jump Hextech item is great! I use it on Blitz if I don't really need AD or MR, as it gives good all-round stats, a bit of wave clear and also an extra dash to close gaps for that pull. I think champs like Riven could use it too.\n5) Glad they got rid of Devourer. Yes, it was OP and fun, but if you weren't winning lane and you knew that your junglier would be farming for 20 mins, it was not a fun item to have.\n6) I think the jungle timer icons are silly and clutter the mini map. There is no point to them and only serves to make jungling harder when versing good counter-junglers like Shaco or Xin or Lee Sin, who effective don't even need to sweat when trying to pick off your camps. The only time it could be *good* for your ally team is if you're getting counter jungled heavily and your team can set up an ambush. Otherwise just buffs noobs who can't jungle and super-buffs already good counter-jungle picks.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-05T14:20:25.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=The Spawn Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=qGBp7sIt,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-05-04T22:28:24.998+0000)\n>\n> I agree with a lot of the above, but disagree on a few points.\n> \n> 1) Yep, Athene&#x27;s is now trash-tier if you&#x27;re not a healer support.\n\nI think it's bad on healer supports also, because the amount of poke that you need to put out to get it to heal to reasonable levels is just too high. I have had a noob Syndra in one of my recent games not realise that the item was changed and after a while in mid lane with it, she only had it charged to 188, which is weak considering the mid lane poking.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=qGBp7sIt,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2016-05-04T22:36:34.750+0000)\n>\n> IF 6.9 was reversed, i would not be mad.\n\nHaha.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xanexadonis","date":"2016-05-05T04:36:17.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"love the items... could do without the crazy mages to be completely honest. and this is coming from a guy who loves a good malzahar game\n\nplaying against them makes me want to throw my computer of to my window, bream let the scraps, and have has chop it up into pieces so small that even heim couldn't put it back together","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-04T23:06:26.569+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the black cleaver buffs were a buff, like sure you lose 10 AD, but now it's 400 gold cheaper meaning you can access that powerful passive much sooner which benefits heavy snowballers like {{champion:92}} .","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-04T22:36:34.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IF 6.9 was reversed, i would not be mad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HKn Allisrem","date":"2016-05-04T18:44:56.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the new jump on the hextech is OP OP\nI agree on the rest","replies":[]},{"poster":"Denavai","date":"2016-05-04T14:28:52.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hextech items have their uses.
