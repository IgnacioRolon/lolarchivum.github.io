LMAO.\r\nAnyway nothing major happened but I would like to have a refund on the name change (BE) (if that is possible) that the hacker used. I have worked hard grinding and saving up for the upcoming BE Fiesta Sales. Even if the refund name change doesn&#039;t get resolve, I will still manage to sleep at night.\r\nThank you.\r\nPS: Change your password at least once a year, so hackers can&#039;t access your account\r\nPSS: This is my first post, so I don&#039;t know the protocols or procedures, forgive me.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-19T09:46:26.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support detailing your issue. They may ban your account and ask you to submit an account recovery ticket. This is usually done because there is still suspicious activity on the account and so they want to verify ownership and secure it, the ban will be lifted once this is done.\n\nSupport will be able to confirm that the account is secure and can usually undo anything done while the account was compromised.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nI would also recommend changing the password for the email attached to your account. Since it's not always clear where exactly compromise comes from it's best to secure anything attached as well just in case.","replies":[]}]}
