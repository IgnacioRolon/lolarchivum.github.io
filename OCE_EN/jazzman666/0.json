Sorry for typos, i dont just dont care that much and you are all literate with comprehension of english and should poses extrapolation of speech/lateral thinking/tralslation tools &lt;3 :){{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} First of all, I dont actually even aggree with his passive, as he is a warewolf and a BLOOD HUNTER at that, i think his passive should be something fitting, like the same amount of magic damage that WOULD have been dealt in a bleed effect on his LAST hit....  you know, for EDGE of tower range ult CLOSE kills, guaranteed ;) :D\r\nI dont even know if you guys could write the code to recognise what WAS a last hit, but idk, the heal makes sense, have the heal be for like .5-5% (I dont know maths) his attack damage ON hit\r\nOr i want his passive to actually be an activateable one.......... Im so intensely jealous of the champs that get to &quot;Dash&quot; over walls, and although he has NO probelm with it currently i think it&#039;d make his Jungle route, and even kiting/ chasing down a little bit easier if he could &quot;dash&quot; over &quot;thin&quot; walls like i see other champs i cant think of right now can do, i want you to have to cick or do somethign to do it, not just automatic, i want it to take skill to &quot;dash&quot; I just want to be able to kite harder tbh, i dont like dying in my own jg... like maybe even make it called, like... idk &quot;Home Game Advantage&quot; Where IN HIS OWN jg he can dash over, like, the edge of dragon, the thin bit of krugs  &quot;wall&quot; NEAR dragon, right near gromp there, between gromp and Sentinals, the sides of wolves, and just above sentinals into river there.\r\nOR give him a fear function, when he is below a certina % health, he get&#039;s big &quot;transforms&quot; and ppl are &quot;terrified&quot; of him for .5 seconds, AND he dashes 50-100 units in direction of mouse... something like that???{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} Second of all, I dont like how his q is the only thing to scale off AP, so i think it might be cool/ make him less of a &quot;one click champion&quot; if, say, his R also scaled of AP... there are build for AP warwick, and peple just always go &quot;bro my Q does so much damage&quot; And im like.... Nah man :/. \r\nI also would love it if his Q&#039;s code was changed to not replace an auto attack, but instead be cast in the next space it can fit, so that way when his attack speed gets higher it gets harder to time/make him stop attacking-use-reselect target to autoattack and when it&#039;s maxed he&#039;s EVEN LESS of a pointand click champ/ its a useless ability :P.{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} His W makes me severly enjoy playing this champion, especially helping other champs MELT through towers, even without a mountain buff, it&#039;s just... its.... extremely satisfying and possibly my favorite thing about this champ HOWEVER.\r\nI DO NOT THINK HIS W SHOULD COUNT TOWARDS THE ATTACK SPEED CAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nIm not sure if this is spaghetti code or something, but ive noticed i can only EVER get a cap of 2.5 Attack Speed on this Champion, I get this PURELY through build sometimes, with my inventory being more or less tank-less, MR-less, AP-less etc etc etc, I get Attack Speed and CDR mostly with final looking like: Blood Razer {{item:1416}} (RIP Devourer :&#039;( ), Berserkers {{item:3006}} (Occasionally Mobility {{item:3117}} or Lucidity {{item:3158}} ) Blade of the Ruined King{{item:3153}} : mostly for the Unique Active, Youmuus{{item:3142}} , again for it&#039;s rediculously sexy Unique Active and sexy little 10%CDR, Nashors{{item:3115}} , is a &quot;waste&quot; for its AP since that&#039;s not the focus of the builf (OR its a tasty bonus depending on your view of the cup) BUT for it&#039;s attack speed obviously and for it&#039;s (less desire for eyeball removal inducing) 20% CDR, with 6th item being situationally: Wits End{{item:3091}} , with a little MR and magic PEN for your autoatacks (which deal magic for SOME reason); Hydra {{item:3074}} for more lifesteal, Deaths dance{{item:3812}}  to max CDR and for the bleed; Mercurial {{item:3139}} for more AD, MR and lifesteal, Bloodthirster{{item:3072}}  for that SEXY overheal and AD, or Dervishes {{item:3137}} for MR, CDR and that lovely active to let you ult :D{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} The point of THAT ALL was that one day while using my W I got to 2.5 and shit myself, procd Youmuus and was THOUROUGHLY let down with the result, please UNCAP this, or fix it so that his W IS NOT CAPPED at least... items i udnerstand or you could get to probably 6 attack speed, but like, I want to BUILD ITEMS to get to 2.5, then have my W actually still hlpe ME, it still helps teamates for sure but that&#039;s not hte point &lt;3.{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} His E should STEAL attack speed off the person, and maybe make this a TARGETTABLE ability, i like that it is toggleable and therefore you ahve to turn it off then WAIT for it to turn on when you dont want them to see you/know you&#039;re there, but i find people RARELY kite from it anyway, as, unless im, like, idk, in top JG and they are at blues inner turret, and they KNOW thats the only place i can be coming from etc etc etc, the point is, its great it gives you movement speed, but honestly i find it&#039;s the last thing i max coz it&#039;s useless and RARELY guarantees the kill. The game is far more involved than kiting all the way down mid to MAYBE catch up to them, yo uget intercepted, then any time you DID spend putting faith in your E, is wasted :(.{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} Also regarding his R, I think he should either get more onhit damage (regardless of what that scales off) for it or it should have a slightly larger range, and it should be make the suppressed target take 50-80% REDUCED damage from ally champions,because the amount of times I&#039;ve ulted a target and had it KS&#039;d makes me want to bauge out my eyes, afk, ff@20 and uninstall after the game :P.\r\nI dont think it should be a skillshot either, and i dont think it should make him pounce if it is IS a skillshot and he misses, or if it IS a skillshot i want the cooldown reduced y AT LEAST half,as 1:30 is absolutely JOKING around :P.{{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} &quot;He is easy&quot; No. He is EasiER than SOME champs. But ANY champ takes skill to be good at.\r\n&quot;He is point and click&quot; Occasionally in the right players hands he is a LITTLE bit, but NO more than Fizz or Yas or Di (F****** Dianna) or Ziggs (seen some of the best plays EVER on a good ziggs player friend of mine) Vayne, Akali, Rengar, Teemo or to an extent, Zed...... he also probably have some of the MOST counters to my champ out of all of them, can be EASILY targetted myself as WW rarely builds tanky even Hybrid build, it&#039;s EASY to deal more AD than i can sustain, EASY,  because if you kill me on 5 health, you still killed me :P.\r\n{{champion:19}} &quot;he is simple/noob champ&quot; People only ever say he is simple, i find, when i am killing them (especially more than once) he may NOT have the most amount of mechanics, no, thats true, but the point is, I WANT him to have more, you chose one with lots, i still killed you so it doesn&#039;t matter, and mechanics aren&#039;t even how you win the game... Mechanics might be Meta at MSI, but that&#039;s because the &quot;S tier champs&quot; are what those people ENJOY playing, i THOUROUGHLY dont believe they are the &quot;best champs in the game&quot; or that&#039;s A) All anyone would play/ get good at and B) You&#039;d AT LEAST see more of them picked in dynamic queue\r\n{{champion:19}} &quot;He&#039;s just a one trick pony&quot; Yes, flash ulting out of the shadows is a formidable/thereforeembarasing slightly troll-y and really frustrating way to get killed, it is FAR from his only trick and the REASON i carry TP{{summoner:12}}  as much as flash{{summoner:4}}. Because his W boosts EVERYONES attack speed, his E... well... his E is the least worth it but lets you hunt down whoever youjust suspressed for not long enough, his Q takes that final swipe when you know you cant chase the kite, his ult has a ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY COOLDOWN ARE YOU JOKING??? So even if he WAS, he&#039;s still only a one trick pony every minute and a half, although his W alone makes him a 5 trick pony.... You just mad im melting you frozen to the spot, and then shredding the tower you where trying to defend ;){{champion:19}} \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you enjoyed my thoughts, please tell me what you think/ Riot: Please respond :D &lt;3\r\n\r\n{{champion:19}} Warwick 5eva{{champion:19}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-01T20:11:18.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"WW is a very powerful jungler. Probably one of the most powerful, you basically cannot 1v1 him, he can solo drag at lvl 2 or 3, he can solo baron basically before it even spawns. In the 4 years that I've been playing i can't recall a time when his win-rate EVER dropped below 50% (and once went as high as 70%) which means that if anything, he is too powerful. And in all the changes you have asked for, i don't see anything that doesn't buff him... And WW does NOT need buffs.\n\nThe attack speed cap is 2.5 for all champions except 1 (and i doubt riot will ever be making that mistake again.) So if you're building enough attack speed to reach that cap without your W, then that is a stupid thing to do and you are building VERY VERY inefficiently. It would be far better for you to build AD instead (or better yet HP as believe it or not, WW is actually a tank, and looking at your build, i don't think you've quite grasped that fact.) \n\nIf I'm understanding you correctly... you want WW's ult to have a larger range.. do more damage... be targetable.. and have a shorter CD?... Seriously? Why not just make Katarina's ult hit 5 people instead of 3 , and give Zed 2 more shadows? Theres a reason that it doesn't do those things, \"BECAUSE IT'D OBVIOUSLY BE TOO FUCKING POWERFUL!!! O_O\" \n\nAnd... are you actually serious about complaining that you ult someone and one of your team mates gets the kill? The whole point of WW's ult is to lock down a high priority enemy champion so that your team can delete them before the fight even gets in full swing. Its not an execute move.. its an engage move, you're supposed to use it on someone while they are full HP if you want to make the best use of it. The fact that you think that your team mates should be able to help get that kill tells me that you have no understanding of WW at all... \n\nOk.. I'm going to give this to you bluntly.. WW is **THE** definition of \"point and click\" I'm sorry but thats just the way it is. We all want to think that our favourite champions take skill, but sometimes that just isn't the case, and I'm afraid this is one of those times. WW, Xin and Udyr are the biggest \"point and click\" champions, thats not me getting at WW, thats just the facts. \n\nYou think that WW is \"no more point and click than Fizz/Yas/Diana/Ziggs/Vayne/Akali/Rengar/Teemo and Zed?? Ok i understand now, i realise that the problem is that you have the wrong definition of \"point and click\" in your head. Let me enlighten you, what \"point and click\" means, it means: You point your mouse over the enemy, and click! and thats ALL you need to do. Thats what it means, no aiming, no juking, etc etc. \n\nFizz, has to aim 2 of his abilities (one being a very long and slow skillshot), and he has huge potential for dodging and juking and outplaying. Yasuo, is about as far from point and click as you can get, his ONLY targetable skill is a small dash that does almost no damage, and if you use it on the wrong enemy at the wrong time, you have fucked yourself over, His Q is a skillshot, his 3rd Q is a longer slower harder to hit skillshot, his wall is a skillshot that requires good reflexes and/or strategic thinking, and his ult requires him to hit a skillshot to use, OR actually have a good team comp. Diana, has one of the most complex skill shots in the game (WW has NO skill shots, let alone complex ones). Ziggs... Ziggs... Ziggs ONLY has skill shots... like i legitimately don't know how anyone could think he is a point and click champion? Yes you do point at the enemy, but apart from his Passive, i don't think Ziggs ever 'clicks' on a champion.. ever, sure he just spams QWER, but there is no clicking happening. Vayne, Vayne is an ADC you cant really call ADC's point and click champions because the whole damn point of ADC's is to click on the enemy to do damage, but despite their entire role being built around pointing and clicking, NO ADC is as \"point and click\" as WW is. Akali's playstyle revolves around ducking in and out of her invisibility, using up time between cool-downs, which means occasionally taking the mouse off the enemy and issuing a movement command, which makes her less \"point and click\" then WW. Rengar, not gunna lie, Rengar is pretty \"point and click\", but at least he has a skillshot, and you need to use his abilities In a certain order to make use of the situation properly (and that order changes with the situation) which is more than can be said for WW. Teemo, is \"point and click\" but at least his ult and Q require some strategic thinking. Zed, Zed's ult is very point and click, but his main damage comes from skill shots, and his entire kit revolves around his shadow, which is also a skillshot. \n\nPoint and click champions are almost always AD (because AP champions pretty much cant be point and click, because with the exception of Azir and Kayle, you pretty much never actually 'click' on an enemy, you spend your time aiming skills instead.) Okay, this might help you when thinking about who is \"point and click\" and who isn't. \n\nPretend you're 1v1ing someone, now ask yourself these questions:\n\n1. Are you using a skillshot? (if yes go to 5.)  (if no go to 2.)\n2. Does a large portion of your kit come from Auto attacks? (if yes go to 3.) (if no go to 5.)\n3. During the fight, does your mouse ever move off the enemy champion? (if yes go to 5.) (if no go to 4.)\n\n4. Im sorry your champion is a \"point and click\" champion.\n5. Congratulations, your champion is not fully a \"point and click\" champion. \n\nAnd now you have your answer.\n\nBut your'e serious? \"WW rarely builds tanky\"? WW IS a tank. if you have less that 3000 HP you are doing something drastically wrong. WW's whole playstyle revolves around sustain, and you cant sustain well when you're squishy. If you have 4000+ HP, life steal/attack speed from BotRK and a spirit visage for resistance and healing benefits, you are basically unkillable. You then Jump into a fight, ult the enemy ADC let your team delete them, then just use your sustain to stay alive during the team fight while the enemy attack you (because if they attack you, they wont be attacking your ADC or mage, who are the proper damage dealers in your team) \n\nYou are damn right when you talk about the champions with the most complicated mechanics and the ones that are fun to play not necessarily being the best champions. The more skill a champion takes, the more likely you are to fuck up with them and die. The less skill a champion takes, the less likely you are to fuck up and die. Thats why Garen/Kat/Annie etc. are the beginner champs, because you have to be really _trying_, in order to fuck up with them.\n\nWW is a simple champion, you can use 3 moves in a fight, 1 is a targetable ability that deals damage (literally the most basic an ability can be) the second, is an AoE attack speed buff (sure its useful, but it requires 0 brain function to use), the third is a targetable ability that deals damage and surpresses them. \nso in a fight your options are:\n1. QWR\n2. QRW\n3. WQR\n4. WRQ\n5. RQW\n6. RWQ\nSo in every fight ever, you only have 6 possible things you can do. Compare that with someone like Azir or Syndra. It does take an awful amount of brainwork to work out which one of your 6 options you need to use, and if you happen to use the wrong one and it doesn't work, all you need to do is point at the enemy champion, right click on them, take your hands off the keyboard, put them behind your head, lean back, and wait for one of you to die.\n\nWW is a strong champion don't get me wrong, he can make some team comps unstoppable, and I'm always happy when he's on my team in a ranked game because he is a tank (and so few people play tanks these days) and he instantly takes the ADC or assassin out of the fight for me, and you have a good chance of winning if you play him. But he isn't complicated, he doesn't require anywhere near as much skill as most other champions, and has braindead kit.\nThats just the facts, its not fair, its not what you want to hear, but its the way it is. \n\nMost people find WW boring to play and boring to play against (but play him anyway cos they like to win), and with the influx of new exiting and complicated champions like Azir/Sol/Talyiah/Jhin etc etc. people just find him more and more boring and less and less people play him, and thats why he is being updated.","replies":[{"poster":"JAZZMAN666","date":"2016-06-02T13:43:32.594+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"So, first of all, Warwick *IS* a powerful Jungler, no-where near as powerful as Di or Shaco IMHO, or Lee-sin early levels, as they consistently DELETE me, but he is great. I have never in my LIFE seen or heard of him solo-ing dragon at 3, since maybe 4.2, and here is actually a youtube video of how to solo dragon on EVERY champion level 3, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSw9xrwwyZ0. I also struggle to solo Baron untill at lesat 16 with sunfire and some other shit, but I actually HAVE seen that done, so i'll leave that a little alone. Im not claiming im the best, INFACT i admitted im still well on the road to mastering him, so just fyi, your condescension is THOUROUGHLY unappreciated, even if it is well intended (i hope). I also dont keep track of win rates/ even know where to find them AND see him played sweet **** all of the time, so even IF he has a high win rate, it is a rarely applicable high win rate... There is a reason he is rarely played DESPITE this win rate, and i agree he needs an update but i think you misunderstand what i want.\n\nFirst of all, I described that situation as a genuine question/funny anecdote to my build/IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES so chill with the innefficient build comments, *especailly* as I rather enjoy sitting on 38% CDR, over 30% lifesteal, and aroud 2k health that never depleates also able to (upon revision of build) EFFICIENTLY reach the 2.5 cap for around 12 seconds of the engage (procing w then youmuus). I realise that the issue with my build is attack speed marks, i got thirst for it at lower levels (only even GOT level 30 on this account around a month ago and havent played since....... tahm was released) and have since changed them out and played slightly better.\nAlso, WW may very well BE a tank, but there's actually really four ways to build that (2 primary as they are inclusive) You go health and/OR health regen, let his passive and w etc refill the LARGE pool you have by a tiny little bit, or you go lifesteal and/OR attack speed, and have a lower pool of health and just watch it never get depleted, expecialy with Bloodthirster, THATS what lets me tank baron usually, that shield that because im attacking so frequently, absorbs all the damage so that my 2k health pool never even gets touched..... Which im perfectly happy with. I HAVE FULLY grasped the fact that he is a tank thankyou very much, i just clearly think far more laterally and abstractly than you... The problem is that its you that has an issue with that (and you clearly DO), i feel like im defending myself and i shouldnt be. If you dont have anything nice to say..........\n\nI believe there is also FARRRRRRR more than one way to skin a chat, and fyi ive infrequently even seen AP WW built tanky......\n\nSo.... No... You have 300% missunderstood. What i want for WW's Ult is for it to have a larger range OR do more damage on hit, i want it to be more devastating... Fucking Ekko had more stun than me (pre 6.11) due, that's not cool, that's all its good for, you said it yourself, itlocks down high priority targets, and that's GREAT, that's awesome, All i want is to get more of a reward for more or less wasting it's 1:30 CD.\nI get in so many teamfights (dynamic queueing obviosuly) where it's ez, i'll punce the ads, we pick him off MAYBE (sometimes not even) and then either I get left to die, or they DONT pick him off and he kites and lives etc etc etc etc etc.\nI want it to be more worthwhile and make you think more about when to use it, coz at the moment, it's wasted due to bad teamfights. \nSo just to break it down, i want it to either do more damage, or have a larger range, so that either i can guarantee the kill on the adc who was bursted down to 100 from a larger range than my Kill steaing team-mates OR I can have more of an impact when it ends up being a suicide.\nI know the other option is to get better team-mates. but. well. It's OCE fam. I think the character in itself deserves it as an assassin though, and that's the important thing, is THATS how he plays, chasing down enemies, poucing on them, melting them. that's ww in a nutshell. \nI want it to do more damage/simply make the target take reduced damage from allies, because if he's so \"point and click\" he deserves the kill for BEING point and click, OR to  have more range OR to have a lower CDR, OR OR OR OR OR OR.\n\nI dont actually even believe my initial complaint was even ABOUT in teamfights, i just carried that idea on. What im Sick of, and the reason I want PRIMARILY want reduced damage from allies is when im in the enemy jg for example, our bot lane is pushed up to the gromp say,im taking the enemy gromp, vi shows up, shes just taken her wolves so she has taken some damage, I q her, I ult her, then vayne shoots her, or Bard autos at the right time, or mid lane roams for what ever reason and a sand soldier pops up, THATS What im sick of, getting KS'd in ONE on ONES and again, I know the other option is to get better team mates, but, AGAIN it's OCE fam, AND I truly think he deserves it as the Blood Hunting Assassin he wants to be. There's a LOT of frustratign situations in this game man, and if you DONT think that using a 1:30 cooldown ult to sometimes not even get the assist, then you're joking with me: YES im complaining about that haha :P>.....\nI also have no problem with it being a skillshot; very far from \"verything im suggesting is a buff\" i think that'd be great, I think those slight buffs should be included or something like..... if you try to ult a traget and yo umiss, you dont still pounce right into the middle of the enemy front line and just get rekt son. That would be shit. That would make him less worth playing than he his now. Coz he is only JUST worth playing, and that's got very little to with how \"point and click\" he is. its got to do with how he synergises/ peoples opinion of him and how people treat ww jg's in general actually. Just to be perfectly honest man, you seem like one ofthe kill stealers :/.\nAlso the situation you gave is INCREDIBLY oppertunistic as, well, rarely if EVER isa vayne/trist/ez/jhin/luc etc etc etc etc in range of my r BEFORE a teamfight starts... that's just... that's rare and the way you WANT it to go. I use it as equally as much of a guarantee as an engage and sometimes as a disengage. \nFor example, if there Luc has just poked up with culling, but he's taken some damage from... who the fuck ever else, thats when ill flash ult from the backline, and let my team kill him even if he's so far advanced that that could be a suicide, my pre preprocced w helps them save me or rek everyone else more, but if they dont, and its me for the adc, that's worthwhile trade.\nFor example: IF we 4 kiting, and there fizz is about to come in and jump around all slippery between the low HP 4 of us there might be left, i will ult him, and let them jump back in to rek him even if he gets me, or ust kite hard and live. TRY to get the kill obviosuly but like.... \nIt's the same when Dragon comes up, people KNOW I can solo it... Rather fuckingng quickly with my w and youmuus it's everyones job on my team to zone HARD when it comes up, and if we loose a support, that's worth it. You try not too, but it's called trade offs and please dont teach me about my ult when therer's far more than one way to use it :P..\n\n\nAnnnnyyyywayyy you're really rude and have no understanding of TACT Whatsoever :/.\n\nLet me ask to you WHERE precisely fizz is aiming? At the champ? Thought so. That's called pointing fam. \nLet me ask to you WHAT precicely fizz does once he as pointed? He clicks fam.\nThat's called pointing and clicking, shortened to point and click. In that sense every champ is point and click: actually something that annoys me about the term, is, they fucking all ARE by the intrinsic nature of the gaming platform.\nAlso to be noted more thoroughly than that, what i mean by point and click should maybe be read more as point, click, and melt. There are some champs that just melt %%%%s. There is very little way to combat them except MAYBE getting in first but regardless of how many skillshots they have, they are still point click, and melt, for example, pre 18 there is NO way to duel zed, fizz, vi, ren etc etc etc, not to mention that  POST 18 WW still gets countered VERY FUCKING HARD by a LOT OF FUCKING CHAMPIONS :/...\nI WANT HIS ULT to be a skillshot, I think almost all of them should be where its not global or form-shifting tbh, and all the champions that you're defending being point and click, all the champions that ARENT'T \"Point and click\" THey all aeally only have one MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE two, and a difficult little mechanic or two, that's why I want more to be involved in playing him: DO i want to use my ult right now? Is the kill guarnateed? IS the kill guarnateed by me? Can we get it anyway through poke and will my ult be more usefull later on now ot MEANS more to USE? will i be able to make the shit (if its a skillshot)? DO I want tot q Right now, or do I want to W? BEcause my Q now doesnt replace an auto attack, so i want to chunk them down big, as in, last hit kill, or i want to outsustain them with my w, cosz there is NO WAY i can get a q in between two w strikes past level 11 or so? Will my E be effective now it does so sweet fuck all no-one ever gets more than a point in it and maxes it LAST? Am i alone? Are THEYYYYY alone? I am more formidable now, when i toggle this ON, they know that, theyre team knows, they will get help. IS it assured. Is my r up. Is it waste to use e, let them all know roughly where i am, AND r, jus tfor one kill? is he kill worth all that? Will i even get it? (AS A SIDE NOTE I think his E should have a per second mana cost, that way you think more about if its on or not, if its WORTH being on or not, and if you'll have mana by the time yo uget to the fight, I also think maybe it should give you movement speed when its on and theyre inrange, but then STEAL that attack spped when you TARGET them, that way they know they're fucked, they kite harder, you're a lITTLE more of a threat, of a presence....","replies":[{"poster":"JAZZMAN666","date":"2016-06-02T13:46:41.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I WANT him to be more involved and have to think about more with him :/?????///???/??/??111!","replies":[{"poster":"JAZZMAN666","date":"2016-06-02T13:48:31.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want his passive changed, his q altered, his w touched, his e changed, his ult a skillshot?

There is a reason he is rarely played DESPITE this win rate, and i agree he needs an update but i think you misunderstand what i want.\n\nFirst of all, I described that situation as a genuine question/funny anecdote to my build/IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES so chill with the innefficient build comments, *especailly* as I rather enjoy sitting on 38% CDR, over 30% lifesteal, and aroud 2k health that never depleates also able to (upon revision of build) EFFICIENTLY reach the 2.5 cap for around 12 seconds of the engage (procing w then youmuus). I realise that the issue with my build is attack speed marks, i got thirst for it at lower levels (only even GOT level 30 on this account around a month ago and havent played since....... tahm was released) and have since changed them out and played slightly better.\nAlso, WW may very well BE a tank, but there's actually really four ways to build that (2 primary as they are inclusive) You go health and/OR health regen, let his passive and w etc refill the LARGE pool you have by a tiny little bit, or you go lifesteal and/OR attack speed, and have a lower pool of health and just watch it never get depleted, expecialy with Bloodthirster, THATS what lets me tank baron usually, that shield that because im attacking so frequently, absorbs all the damage so that my 2k health pool never even gets touched..... Which im perfectly happy with. I HAVE FULLY grasped the fact that he is a tank thankyou very much, i just clearly think far more laterally and abstractly than you... The problem is that its you that has an issue with that (and you clearly DO), i feel like im defending myself and i shouldnt be. If you dont have anything nice to say..........\n\nI believe there is also FARRRRRRR more than one way to skin a chat, and fyi ive infrequently even seen AP WW built tanky......\n\nSo.... No... You have 300% missunderstood. What i want for WW's Ult is for it to have a larger range OR do more damage on hit, i want it to be more devastating... Fucking Ekko had more stun than me (pre 6.11) due, that's not cool, that's all its good for, you said it yourself, itlocks down high priority targets, and that's GREAT, that's awesome, All i want is to get more of a reward for more or less wasting it's 1:30 CD.\nI get in so many teamfights (dynamic queueing obviosuly) where it's ez, i'll punce the ads, we pick him off MAYBE (sometimes not even) and then either I get left to die, or they DONT pick him off and he kites and lives etc etc etc etc etc.\nI want it to be more worthwhile and make you think more about when to use it, coz at the moment, it's wasted due to bad teamfights. \nSo just to break it down, i want it to either do more damage, or have a larger range, so that either i can guarantee the kill on the adc who was bursted down to 100 from a larger range than my Kill steaing team-mates OR I can have more of an impact when it ends up being a suicide.\nI know the other option is to get better team-mates. but. well. It's OCE fam. I think the character in itself deserves it as an assassin though, and that's the important thing, is THATS how he plays, chasing down enemies, poucing on them, melting them. that's ww in a nutshell. \nI want it to do more damage/simply make the target take reduced damage from allies, because if he's so \"point and click\" he deserves the kill for BEING point and click, OR to  have more range OR to have a lower CDR, OR OR OR OR OR OR.\n\nI dont actually even believe my initial complaint was even ABOUT in teamfights, i just carried that idea on. What im Sick of, and the reason I want PRIMARILY want reduced damage from allies is when im in the enemy jg for example, our bot lane is pushed up to the gromp say,im taking the enemy gromp, vi shows up, shes just taken her wolves so she has taken some damage, I q her, I ult her, then vayne shoots her, or Bard autos at the right time, or mid lane roams for what ever reason and a sand soldier pops up, THATS What im sick of, getting KS'd in ONE on ONES and again, I know the other option is to get better team mates, but, AGAIN it's OCE fam, AND I truly think he deserves it as the Blood Hunting Assassin he wants to be. There's a LOT of frustratign situations in this game man, and if you DONT think that using a 1:30 cooldown ult to sometimes not even get the assist, then you're joking with me: YES im complaining about that haha :P>.....\nI also have no problem with it being a skillshot; very far from \"verything im suggesting is a buff\" i think that'd be great, I think those slight buffs should be included or something like..... if you try to ult a traget and yo umiss, you dont still pounce right into the middle of the enemy front line and just get rekt son. That would be shit. That would make him less worth playing than he his now. Coz he is only JUST worth playing, and that's got very little to with how \"point and click\" he is. its got to do with how he synergises/ peoples opinion of him and how people treat ww jg's in general actually. Just to be perfectly honest man, you seem like one ofthe kill stealers :/.\nAlso the situation you gave is INCREDIBLY oppertunistic as, well, rarely if EVER isa vayne/trist/ez/jhin/luc etc etc etc etc in range of my r BEFORE a teamfight starts... that's just... that's rare and the way you WANT it to go. I use it as equally as much of a guarantee as an engage and sometimes as a disengage. \nFor example, if there Luc has just poked up with culling, but he's taken some damage from... who the fuck ever else, thats when ill flash ult from the backline, and let my team kill him even if he's so far advanced that that could be a suicide, my pre preprocced w helps them save me or rek everyone else more, but if they dont, and its me for the adc, that's worthwhile trade.\nFor example: IF we 4 kiting, and there fizz is about to come in and jump around all slippery between the low HP 4 of us there might be left, i will ult him, and let them jump back in to rek him even if he gets me, or ust kite hard and live. TRY to get the kill obviosuly but like.... \nIt's the same when Dragon comes up, people KNOW I can solo it... Rather fuckingng quickly with my w and youmuus it's everyones job on my team to zone HARD when it comes up, and if we loose a support, that's worth it. You try not too, but it's called trade offs and please dont teach me about my ult when therer's far more than one way to use it :P..\n\n\nAnnnnyyyywayyy you're really rude and have no understanding of TACT Whatsoever :/.\n\nLet me ask to you WHERE precisely fizz is aiming? At the champ? Thought so. That's called pointing fam. \nLet me ask to you WHAT precicely fizz does once he as pointed? He clicks fam.\nThat's called pointing and clicking, shortened to point and click. In that sense every champ is point and click: actually something that annoys me about the term, is, they fucking all ARE by the intrinsic nature of the gaming platform.\nAlso to be noted more thoroughly than that, what i mean by point and click should maybe be read more as point, click, and melt. There are some champs that just melt %%%%s. There is very little way to combat them except MAYBE getting in first but regardless of how many skillshots they have, they are still point click, and melt, for example, pre 18 there is NO way to duel zed, fizz, vi, ren etc etc etc, not to mention that  POST 18 WW still gets countered VERY FUCKING HARD by a LOT OF FUCKING CHAMPIONS :/...\nI WANT HIS ULT to be a skillshot, I think almost all of them should be where its not global or form-shifting tbh, and all the champions that you're defending being point and click, all the champions that ARENT'T \"Point and click\" THey all aeally only have one MAYBE MAYBE MAYBE two, and a difficult little mechanic or two, that's why I want more to be involved in playing him: DO i want to use my ult right now? Is the kill guarnateed? IS the kill guarnateed by me? Can we get it anyway through poke and will my ult be more usefull later on now ot MEANS more to USE? will i be able to make the shit (if its a skillshot)? DO I want tot q Right now, or do I want to W? BEcause my Q now doesnt replace an auto attack, so i want to chunk them down big, as in, last hit kill, or i want to outsustain them with my w, cosz there is NO WAY i can get a q in between two w strikes past level 11 or so? Will my E be effective now it does so sweet fuck all no-one ever gets more than a point in it and maxes it LAST? Am i alone? Are THEYYYYY alone? I am more formidable now, when i toggle this ON, they know that, theyre team knows, they will get help. IS it assured. Is my r up. Is it waste to use e, let them all know roughly where i am, AND r, jus tfor one kill? is he kill worth all that? Will i even get it? (AS A SIDE NOTE I think his E should have a per second mana cost, that way you think more about if its on or not, if its WORTH being on or not, and if you'll have mana by the time yo uget to the fight, I also think maybe it should give you movement speed when its on and theyre inrange, but then STEAL that attack spped when you TARGET them, that way they know they're fucked, they kite harder, you're a lITTLE more of a threat, of a presence....","replies":[]}]}]}
