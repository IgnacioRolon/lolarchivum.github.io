Pleas assist.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, I have no idea if anybody here could even help me but for the last 2-3 days I&#039;ve been experiencing lapses of the game where my ping spikes to 350 and I can&#039;t move for 2-3 seconds every 30 seconds. I&#039;ve dropped a significant amount of divisions because of this and it&#039;s made the game simply unplayable and very anti-fun. I have no idea what to do anymore, there is no other devices connected to the WI-FI in my house and I&#039;m the only person using the internet, I&#039;ve tried changing my DNS, removing every connected device, countless other things.\r\n\r\nThe only other thing I could think of is to re-install LoL but I don&#039;t know if this would make any difference.\r\n\r\nIf it helps my ISP is Telstra.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-20T05:47:25.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Exiled Riven,\n\nDid anything change in your home internet/network setup around when you started seeing the issue?\n\nCouple of suggestions:\n\n* Try getting rid of the Wifi for a game or two - try using a cable to connect direct to your router.\n* Run a trace route to 103.240.227.1 (post results)\n* Check through the suggestions in the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support page\n\nLet me know how you go\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Exiled Riven","date":"2015-10-20T06:47:57.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello, thanks for the reply. Unfortunately due to the position of where my PC is in retrospect to the routers location I can't set up a wired connection. Nothing has changed in regards to my connection in recent times also.\n\nI've attached a screenshot of the trace route for you to look at. Thanks. \n\nTo clarify again it's not a constant lagg, my ping is usual at say 60 ping then randomly spikes to 150-200 for 2-3 seconds.\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/83f35ed13b5220f364dca58af76091c3","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-22T03:24:27.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nIf there is a way you can move your computer near your router and/or use a long cable to test, it would be a really good idea.  The type of ping spikes you mention are typical of an unreliable connection, which lines up either with a congested wifi channel, router cpu/overloading issues or congestion on the network path between you and the game server.\n\nAdditionally, you'll need to run that traceroute from your computer (not from a website).  It is important to make sure you are tracing the path from yourself to the game servers.  [Instructions here](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169336-How-do-I-run-a-traceroute-) (replace _yourdomain.com_ with 103.240.227.1)\n\nAnother thing you can do is check your logs out in [Logs of Lag](http://logsoflag.com/), which might help get a better picture of the problem.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}]}]}
