Our team started to gain momentum then all of a sudden random spikes. The spikes stopped for a bit then they started at all the perfect times our team was engaging. Obviously this is not normal. The pic outs the user account in question, im not phased about forum etiquette. Has someone else come across this?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-28T07:19:44.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its odd that it even gives a message saying he unpaused tthe game. Perhaps it can be a weird thing in Riot's coding of the game, but I think it warrants a report, since if it is a weird thing in LoL's code then Riot would know that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Definitive S","date":"2015-02-28T06:37:40.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The game started lagging at really awlful times for my team. It seriously was so bad that any time we were all on the same screen or on the screen with Vi it lagged. Im not convinced.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-02-28T06:31:49.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The servers have felt a little laggy today.\n\nThat guy ended up being on the losing team, and fed pretty heavily, I would say there is more chance that it was a glitch than him being a cheater.","replies":[]}]}
