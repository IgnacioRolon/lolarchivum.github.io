When I click it or attempt to open it, it doesn't make any movement or any sign that it is opening. When I check task manager to see if the the game is running it doesn't show up at all. I've tried some methods which I have found on other league boards such as deleting the lock file in the league folder but nothing seems to work unless i just turn my computer on and off which is a bit of a pain when i just want to play. Additionally, sometime the league of legends logo/ icon  thing which shows up on your desktop before the client opens just sits there and when i click on it, nothing happens (as seen in the link).\nDoes anybody have any idea on how to fix the problem without having to restart the computer?\nThanks in advance\nfile:///Users/nedmilne1/Desktop/Screenshot%202019-09-07%20at%209.58.30%20pm.png","replies":[{"poster":"be ready for dp","date":"2019-09-14T14:57:02.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solution!\n\nSearch up 'Riot Games' in finder. There will be a folder. Right click on the application 'Riot Client'. Move 'Riot Client' to trash. Then open 'League of Legends' Application.  \n\nIt should automatically re-download the 'Riot Client'. Open the 'Riot Client' and it should take you to the login after downloading and updating (takes a min). \n\n\nPs. This happened to me today, and after reinstalling 3 times this worked!","replies":[]}]}
