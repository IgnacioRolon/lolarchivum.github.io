Also Riot confirmed it in a podcast linked in the thread. You still have to play 10 games no matter what before getting your rank, but the system recognises dodges as losses.\n\nSo for example, if you go 10-0 in your placements now, the system will actually have you as going 10-1 even though technically the 1 doesnt exist.\n\nhttps://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/3ETdh8cM-psa-no-matter-what-dont-dodge-games-during-you-placements","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-01-17T06:00:40.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was just posted by Riot support... so apparently even Riot don't know the truth about dodging in placements.\n\n> For the record though, unlike promo series, games dodged in placements will not count as a loss out of your 10.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RiotSupport/status/953476271597670402","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-17T08:57:27.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's alittle confusing, but as I understand it that still holds true right?
