What&#039;s worse was that I was in my promos, and I only have one game because of them. \r\nI have an idea for Riot to implement some things into their own game. One of them is to be able to report someone outside of the game. The reasoning behind this is so that if you have to dodge a queue because of some jerk you could at least report him for ruining the game for you. You could use the report system for other things too.\r\nAnother suggestion is to implement a votekick system for Champion Select, specifically in ranked. I&#039;m not sure if trolls do exist in high elo but trolls definitely exist in lower elo. If they happen to troll, you could just votekick them off the team and someone who is currently in a queue could take their place. Though it might not work for duos that troll, at least this could prevent trolling to a certain degree. If you happen to abuse the votekick system for the wrong reasons however you can be punished.\r\nI&#039;m only suggesting these requests because I don&#039;t want people to troll in my games, or in fact, don&#039;t have these jerks ruining games for other people and making them angry. The community is already bad enough but we could still try to form a good community right?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-11-02T08:29:31.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've suggested the vote kick idea before and I think it's a smart harmless way to remove toxic players or insta-lockers.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-11-02T09:20:32.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can check the rank/ match history of people on your team before you even get into game.

You see that button on the top of the page labelled \"Support\"? Click it, submit a ticket and you can report people outside of the game.\n\n> if you have to dodge a queue\n\nBullsh!t. You **never HAVE** to dodge a queue, you **choose** to. There's a big difference.","replies":[]}]}
