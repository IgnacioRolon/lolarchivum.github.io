You won't earn loot for the duration of your punishment, be it a temporary suspension or a chat restriction.\n* Signs of reform. Once your punishment has ended, you'll continue to be restricted from earning loot until you're recognized to have made significant progress in amending your past behavior.\n\n>Stay focused on solid comms, teamwork, and sportsmanship in your games and you'll be earning chests and keys sooner rather than later.\n\nThe \"significant progress in amending past behaviour\" isn't measured over a set period of time e.g you wont start earning loot exactly 2 weeks after the end of your punishment, but instead is completely reliant on you not being a sarcastic flamer in your games. It is different for every player. \n \n\n[Take a look at this for more info](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions)♥","replies":[{"poster":"Skullkiller1789","date":"2016-06-10T05:42:48.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been nice for at least 4 weeks and i still haven't been getting any keys or chests.

Since loot is a reward, Riot don't want to reward people for \"Not being a Dick\" because not being a dick should be standard.
