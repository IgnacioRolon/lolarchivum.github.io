GTX 960, pre 6.1 i could get 250-350 fps all game, since 6.1 i get 350ms at the beginning of game but testing in custom game attacking the minions and having champions attacking and casting it drops to about 150ms and struggles to get higher, not only does it drop fps it feels clunky as if i have input lag and delay on some of my movements or abilities.  This fps is from playing on the Very-High setting, even if i change this to very low i gain about 20fps but it won&#039;t break the 200fps mark and i still feel the input lag, i have also changed all of the game options and other video settings.  I even try to run the game without the client open but does not change anything.  All other games on my computer run as normal around 200-300 fps (more demanding than league too) and i have not changed anything.  I did try repair but i have yet to try full reinstall but wish to avoid this, i have heard of some other people having a similar problem but i guess not enough for anything to be done as of yet.  Is there any more testing i can do to help solve this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-31T23:51:02.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey 1Matt,\n\nSome newer PCs and graphics cards do seem to get the kinds of issues you describe (fps glitches, input lag) when running League at very high FPS.  We've also seen this on our competitive PCs that we use for OPL finals and similar.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest trying is to set a framerate cap in your video settings in-game.  If you cap it to 144fps, the game should play much more smoothly.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
