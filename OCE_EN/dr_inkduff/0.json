Our Ahri was 5th pick, but had asked for mid, and nobody complained so she picked that. Our 4th pick then locked in lb at the last second and followed by complaining that she should be mid, not ahri\r\n\r\nOur team was nice enough to sort it out and let our toxic lb go mid anyway, but she was only there to troll... By the time I dc'd she gave the enemy kat 10 kills (this is about 12 mins in). The Kat was so happy about this win that she was going to honour the lb and report the rest of us...\r\n\r\nI see no point in sitting there watching our team feed intentionally, and seeing the chat of our team raging and the enemy team trying to get on our nerves as well (i know I can mute, and I did, but stilll...) So, I disconnected and I'm going to bed...\r\n\r\nSadly though, I now have a leave in ranked and could get banned for this. It won't help that the other team is reporting the players on our team that actually wanted to play and honouring the troll... I have got warnings about this stuff on my account before, and its bulls**t... \r\n\r\nI am sitting in bronze, and people just say \"its easy to climb out if youre actually good enough\", but these were 2 of my first 3 ranked games in months and all I have gotten out of it is that ranked sucks, and there is no system in place to fix it, and so I will stay in bronze for a while longer...\r\n\r\nI literally just lost ~30 LP and a leave on my account because of 2 people that wanted to troll instead of play the game, and there is nothing I can do about it.\r\n\r\nRiot, please fix this flawed system in some way. Frankly solo ranked isn't even worth playing after being placed into B1 because of this s**t.\r\n\r\nLook into the chat for that game if you will. I will admit I can one rude comment towards the Katarina that I probably shouldn't have said, but I wasn't particularly happy about the way my time was being wasted. It would be plainly obvious what was going on in that game from the chat, and I think our team should be rewarded LP back, and the enemies taken from them, and in other games when people are reported for this kind of behavior some kind of action should be taken instead of just letting it slide!\r\n\r\n","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2014-12-28T14:19:36.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a tip for next time, don't leave. i know its frustrating, trust me I'm in b4 cause in my provisionals my computer decided to freeze during my first ranked game then in the next game decided to just shut off and die, therefore causing me to drop straight down to bronze and i won 3 of the ranked games after and glady i wasn't in bronze 5 but still bronze 4 is %%%% but its easy to climb but not bothered to play with toxic people so instead i play norms. but yeah when i play i just push on, i have won a 3v5 in ranked, mid fed then left and then on guy just kept dcing, not he's fault i know but the other guy was a %%%%, but our team joined together and we fought, took towers and we won, it was hard but anything is possible. so a simple suggestion, don't leave, then after report them, get screenshots and send a support ticket. also keep calm during all this, its the main thing to remember. sorry about the 30LP lose, i feel you bro :/","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Inkduff","date":"2014-12-29T03:40:09.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I get what you mean...

We had a Nidalee who started the game 0/7/0, feeding 2 kills to mid, 2 to top, 2 to ADC and 1 to the jungler. She then got 2 kills to add to her gold worth and got to 2/12/0. She ended the game 12/15/27 and we came back to win because she got that %%%% out of her system (This was a ways into the game by the way) and we played smart, we focused objectives, snagged picks and made some plays that we had to make.\n\nMy point is this, feeders can say they're going to make you lose the game, but they can also turn the game around if they cease. I'm more inclined to give up (Surrender, not AFK, which by the way, if 4 of you agree you can't win should be an automatic surrender even if the feeder says no) if it's clear that we're just outmatched, no one's feeding, no one's at fault, the other team is just flat out better than ours.\n\nIf you commit to a game of league, you commit for (In 99.9% of games, occasionally pubstomps can make it faster) at least 20 minutes, regardless of the situation.\n\nP.S. If you can't think of something to do in a game like that like, oh, I don't know, practicing CS (Which, let's face it, at your elo and mine, you could use some practice at), seeing if they're stupid enough to let people split-push, contesting objectives for situational practice or improving KDAs or scores, maybe you should quit on the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Inkduff","date":"2014-12-30T02:17:28.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was 10 minutes into the game and they were pushing down our inhabit turrets. We couldn't surrender yet as it was so early. We couldn't leave our base to split or practise farming, bc the katarina already had a dozen kills, and we would die instantly. We were forced to just sit in the base and wait. \n\nI did not make this post to address games that can be won. I am writing about games that cannot. Forget the game I was in, and imagine a game where someone trolls the whole time and makes it absolutely impossible to win. This is the game you should be thinking of when discussing this topic. Don't keep trying to change a premise of my discussion; that is not how it works...","replies":[{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2014-12-30T02:35:37.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you are trying to say, of course there are games that can't be won for any number of reasons. But what you just said leaves two possibilities, either a) You were defending your base and therefore were obviously doing something before you left or b) They were pushing down your base so you could hypothetically have left the base and done all of the things I just listed because they're not going to come after you because you aren't doing anything particularly relevant to the game in question. (But enough about your game, lets move onto your points)\n\nThe thing that you are ignoring is that there is a priority order for things like this at Riot. If no one leaves, the troll/rager/toxic player is the one who is punished. Once someone leaves that game, they are the one who is bumped up the priority order for bans or warnings because of the fact that people can just leave games they aren't interested in when there isn't someone deliberately playing poorly in their game and RIot then has the issue of 4 people having their experience ruined because someone just left the game. You are giving the LB what you want if you leave, they probably don't care whether you're there or not, it validates their actions if you angrily leave the game\n\nThe idea that you should get LP back and the enemy team should lose theirs is pretty laughable for a start, you afk'd from the game, that's almost rule one for this game on things you can't do. The second idea that there isn't some form of system in place to ban people is also pretty funny seeing as you asked where you could send a support ticket from which is currently the best way to report someone directly to Riot while reporting in-game (With sensible comments as Riot have stated elsewhere, anyone with the source want to help a brother out here?) is periodically monitored by Riot.\n\nThere are always games where people troll, it's what people do. But for every game I get one in, I get one where it's Freelo because the other team has one or if not that, it's a relatively well played game where it is simply a matter of skill. Is this feeding over 50% your games, most likely not, and if it is, then start by looking at 1) Yourself and 2) Whether you're getting the same people in which case block and report to Riot and then wait for a bit, then play again.\n\nTl;Dr Don't leave. Report and move on. AFK is treated worse than any reportable offence.","replies":[{"poster":"Dr Inkduff","date":"2014-12-30T08:07:54.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If no one leaves, the other 4 people on the losing team are still punished with a loss they didn't deserve. \n\nFrankly, I would rather people DC than troll. 3v5's are easier to win than a 5v5 with one person intentionally feeding and telling the enemies your location etc. The priority should be on them, not DCers in the first place (plus there is the fact that DCing can be hardware / software related and not intentional).\n\n\"Giving LB what you want\"? I don't really care what LB wants... I didn't want to sit there pointlessly clicking around the base wasting time, so I left. I got what I want. What LB wants is no concern of mine. I also didn't \"angrily leave the game\". I said goodbye to the other lovely people on my team, wished them luck in their future games, and left rather peacefully... Making stuff up about what I do doesn't give me a very high opinion of yourself.\n\nStop telling me I shouldn't have afk'd. I was NOT the reason we lost that game, as I have made painfully obvious. I don;t want to hear about the effects of afking or the punishments for it. This post is about trolls and that's it... I suggest you try to get rid of the steel box around your head that is stopping any information from going in before you try to continue to participate in any further discussion with me. \n\nYou are still just trying to argue with me rather than see a point and consider it.

To be a little more specific, this is sort of like buying tokens into an arcade expecting to have a great experience : then coming out of it not enjoying the experience, and then demanding that you get your money back.\nI think this example fits well into what you're going through at the moment : you've invested *time* into a game, you've come across people that have turned that *time* into a *bad* experience, and now you want to ask riot ( who are completely untied to this incident) to compensate for something a *player* did to you.\n\nI didn't read through too much of what you've been saying, it's late at night - the bold font is too bright for me to deal with right now.

I'm not trying to put you down, instead - im trying to help you understand that all of this ( what you're doing right now ) isn't worth pursuing. I'm sure there's a lot I could have probably written out to reason with you here, but like I said, it's pretty late at night - and my mentality is sort of limited at the moment.\n\nWhat you need to remember is :\nThis game is meant to match up 10 random players into a 5v5 game.\nOut of those 10 players, you don't get much of a choice on who you have to interact with.\nWhen you get feeders/trolls/afkers - the only sense of control you have is how you *choose* to react to it.\nComplaining to riot about how they're liable for something they have absolutely no control over is a little silly, if not childish.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Dr Inkduff (OCE)\n - about an hour ago \n\n5 \"I suggest you get over it\" is great advise, if you don't think about it.
