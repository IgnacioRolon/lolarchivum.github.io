Ping doesn't make a player THAT bad. I was able to get gold with 300 ping when there was no OCE server.\n\nThere are even challengers with 150 ping who stream.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-05T13:49:06.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much the ping itself (within reason), but more the stability of it. 300 ping that is constant and doesn't fluctuate is playable. Ping that is jumping between 80-350 not so much because it's unpredictable. I like the idea of a ping checker, not so much the idea of a ping restriction.","replies":[]}]}]}
