After say 2 minutes (enough time for them to have logged back it if it was a accident or unfortunate D/C) players who have selected the &quot;Substitute&quot; option get a notice to enter the game playing as the champion who AFK&#039;ed. It would provide you a short overview of the scores and game time and you could enter the game and take over the champion.\r\n\r\nNow in order for people to actually want to do this there needs to be some kind of incentive. So I would suggest that perhaps there is no LP penalty in terms of lost points for a substitute player and yet if their team wins they get a percentage of the LP based on the time since they took over the champ. Obviously the player who AFK&#039;ed would still receive their LP loss.\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with ranked games is losing LP purely because a played D/C&#039;ed, and sure it happens but this is a way to do something about it.\r\n\r\nRiot could even offer special rewards for substitutes like a banner, icons, maybe an end of season reward if you subbed a particular number of games in the season.\r\n\r\nI am sure there is a lot of technical stuff to be considered in terms of match making and how this might affect ranked games but personally id rather have a substitute come into my game then have to play the next 15-30 minutes with 4v5.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat do people think?","replies":[{"poster":"Critterous","date":"2015-04-03T08:51:17.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright\n---\nFirst off this has been mentioned before a while back but here is my opinions.\n1) Great Concept... Although it would be hard to find a balanced player to the one who just left\n2) Since there is no LP loss players could go and feed as there are no consequences to there actions. (Sure you could report but you still lose LP right)\n3) Smurfs... Speaks for itself\nAnd something else how would Player \"X\" get the option to substitute for Player \"Y\" who just AFK'ed, would it be an option in the menu screen or something or other\n---\nAwesome Concept hard to execute\n(Just my thoughts)","replies":[{"poster":"Todgins","date":"2015-04-04T06:58:39.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could also play substitute only and rank up indefinitely, granted it might take longer.\n\nWould I play as a substitute in this system? Yes I would. However I think the poll should be asking our opinions on if we think the system is good/flawed, not if we would use it in that state.\n\n-- A simple solution for all game modes would be to activate an intermediate bot (group focused) to alleviate some pressure. Although the AI likely needs some tweaking to be a reasonable substitute.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-03T10:59:39.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> 2) Since there is no LP loss players could go and feed as there are no consequences to there actions.
