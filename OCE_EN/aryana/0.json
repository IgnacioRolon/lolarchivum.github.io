I have already tried completely remaking the item sets and that does absolutely nothing. Is there anything i can do to be able to use my sets again?","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-04-21T16:06:54.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When in game have you looked where it says 'Recommended Items' there's a small arrow pointing down, click that and it should come down with the Item sets. Alternatively, have you assigned them to a certain champion? You may have attached accidentally an {{champion:103}}  Item set to {{champion:84}} by mistake. Hope this helps. \n~Catspeare{{champion:268}}","replies":[]}]}
