(games not found)\n\noh and for the scoring, im almost 100% sure its based off the lane your in + build path. like if i go bot with a support starting item, the system will score me as a support. or if i go jg, it will score me as a jg. but when you have 29 kills to 6 kills. that's a Massive difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Apexslide","date":"2016-04-02T22:24:16.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's make this into a Points out of 100 thing, where 0 is lowest gain, and 100 is highest gain.\n\nLet's say you're playing an ADC character, Vayne. Doesn't matter if you've taken her Top, Mid, ADC, Support or Jungle, you've rolled into the ADC category of scoring, meaning kills are going to be worth less points than usual.\n\nSay for example, the average points you get for a kill is 3/100, now they'll be 1/100 because the system expects you to do more than just gank and kill people.\n\nSo we've got kills at 1 point each, what's next? Ward placing and clearing, everyone can do this, so they're worth significantly less points. Placing is at 0.1 points each, but clearing is at 0.5 points. Upgrading your trinket at level 9 will net you 10 points flat, but upgrade it later in the game and you receive reduced points, based on level, meaning the lowest points you can get is 1 at level 18.\n\nNext up is deaths and assists. We'll put deaths down to -1 points per death, and assists to +3 points per assist depending on how many people attacked the enemy. If it were just you and 1 other person, that's 3 points, going down by 0.5 points for each other person assisting on that kill.\n\nNext is objective clearing. Towers aren't worth much, maybe 2 points each. Jungle camps are probably about 0.5 - 1 each, Dragon is worth 10 and Baron is worth 30. Inhibs are worth 5 each, and Nexus gives everyone (win or lose) a flat-rate of 10 points.\n\nNow let's give an example: You play as Vayne, you end the game with a loss, but you yourself managed 3 turret kills, 18 camp kills, 2 Dragon kills, 14 Kills, 9 deaths and 20 assists, being assisted by 1 other person for half of them, and never upgraded your trinket or placed/killed wards.\n\nThis gives you a point total of 99/100, giving you an S+, even though realistically you did terrible.\n\nOf course, this is just an example and theory, since the formula used hasn't been released and will most likely never be released otherwise people will exploit it.\n\nIn essence, it really depends on how much of a TEAM PLAYER you are, and the system DOES take into account how much you flame, feed, etc, as well as how you perform in game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"warzolo99","date":"2016-04-02T17:09:33.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"objective participation, ward clearing and placing and also the amount of cs.\nobviously this changes depending on the roll for instance support gets more out of warding than they do out of csing allowing for more even scoring towards them. also jg isn't really able to get a lot of cs early. also assists aren't bad for a ranking as it is considered the same as a kill (to my knowledge) as if an assist was only 0.5 of a kill getting an S as a support would be almost impossible.\n\nif you really want to get good ranks more often then start to participate in more objectives while still retaining a high level of cs and also helping with warding (all obvious). if you are able to do this even if not often you should get an S which means that you played exceptionally well that game on a solo and team level.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-02T16:43:55.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you cs more?","replies":[]}]}
