There are so many good things about it. From a game play perspective there is a lot to learn; champion abilities, items, buffs, de-buffs, team comps, laneing strategies, team fight strategies and map objectives. Its challenging with a very steep learning curve for new players yet gives a sence of accomplishment and mastery as time goes on. Recently I have been teaching friends how to play and I have been exposed to the joys   of playing with people I know. The community for the greater part is tolerable. Im watching the OPL at the moment. I just felt like sharing my love of the game with all you wonderful people and was wondering if anyone else felt the same.\r\n\r\nWhat do you love about the game? What do you hate?","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-30T14:45:32.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I shouldn't say this but I love playing selfishly... sometimes it just seems a more viable option then rushing in and dying like the rest of my team.\n\nWhat I hate is having to rely on others because normally they troll or play their role wrong and feed (ahri \"support\" buying full AP and tower diving for kills... plus getting 40 cs at 10).\n\nMost pro's will tell you to adopt a **YOU** first mentality and in many cases I agree because my team doesn't like listening to me anyways.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-29T11:36:26.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the other people around me, especially when they say more than \"gank me\" or \"b b b\"\n\nIt's nice to know there's a difference between bots who don't chat, and people who actually have personality, even if it leads them to insulting my openness or seemingly random comments.\n\n\nWhat I hate is myself sometimes. Sometimes I never do enough for my team, or I'm in a great mood and play to find out I'm not thinking straight, or I'm tired, or I just feel a bit dizzy from playing one game too many. I hate when I feed for these reasons and the things people tell me are actually _true_.","replies":[]}]}
