I started work as the OCE Recruiter, where I spent most of my day sourcing for potential Rioters. In July this year, I transitioned in to the Community Manager position. \r\n\r\nI come from a Sports Psychology / Teacher background and have some experience of working with elite sports teams in the UK. I&#039;ve tried to help our local esports teams (mainly The Chiefs and Legacy) to build routines and performance mindsets to help them succeed at the top level. \r\n\r\nI first started playing computer games from a young age when my Dad bought an Atari 800XL; my favourite game was Pole Position. I have been playing LoL since 2013, but am one of the more causal players in the office, so I&#039;m still really bad at LoL. Anyway my favourite champion is currently Pantheon.\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I have a young family (my daughter Evelyn is 10 months old), I&#039;m a big Chelsea FC supporter and love all forms of Cricket. \r\n\r\nSo that&rsquo;s a little bit about me :) Feel free to ask me anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-14T01:53:39.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favourite OCE Rioter?","replies":[{"poster":"Conquisitor","date":"2015-10-14T01:56:09.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This depends on my mood :)","replies":[{"poster":"Achenar","date":"2015-10-14T03:27:59.043+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is your mood 'not wanting to have things thrown at you'? :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-16T06:04:03.472+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sephyre, because she plays with Summoners that want their 1000th win with a rioter.","replies":[{"poster":"Golden Lee","date":"2015-10-18T23:52:57.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"?!!?!?!?

First of all a lot of us play lots of LoL (In fact I've played 583 solo queue ranked games this season). We feel the pain when there is this one player in the game being really negative and it sucks.\n\nLet me talk aboue some of the things we are working on to help address this problem;\n\nA while a go on all Riot servers globally we set up [Instant feedback systems](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/new-player-reform-system-heads-testing) in place which is an automated system delivering two week and permanent bans for verbal toxicity within 15 minutes. More recently we [powered up](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/instant-feedback-powers) this system. \n\n\"Now, we’re bolting a few new cylinders onto the instant feedback engine. Fueled by your reports on what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour (and some elbow grease on our end), chat restrictions and intentional feeding bans are now delivered and enforced within 15 minutes of a game’s end. Beyond those upgrades, we’re moving reform cards into the client and rounding out the design value trinity by rewarding positive players with an exclusive summoner icon.\"\n\nAND with this power up we added in automated intentional feeding bans.\n\n\"Through a ton of in-game metrics, chat logs, and even historical play patterns, we ensured the system understands the difference between intentional feeding and being crushed by a Riven main in solo queue. You shouldn’t need to worry about just having a bad game.\nLike with all new feature launches, the whole player behaviour team will hand-review the first few thousand cases to make sure everything’s working right.\"\n\nOn top of this we also have a [Leaver Buster system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ) in place for players that dc/afk games.\n\nWe are also working on a new champion select process. The goal with this is to prevent a common point of stress and negativity around role selection.
