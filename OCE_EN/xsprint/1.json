Do you wish to proceed? and I press yes. It comes up a few more times but finally it says Logging on but it disconnects me even though I&#039;m connected to the internet. I tried multiple times pressing no instead or using a internet cable because I use wireless internet but the outcome is the same every time. If I press no though it says attempting to recconect and the tab comes up again.","replies":[]}
