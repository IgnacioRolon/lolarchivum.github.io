You only have 1 rune page full, and that rune page is all tier 2 and they dont' really gel. Save up ip to get 2 complete tier 3 rune pages or at least 1 full tier 3. you could play with people and get carried through your next 6 placement games, but what happens after that? \n\nNot trying to be negative but I can see you ending up in a division you're less than happy with just because you're not well enough equipped for ranked at moment","replies":[{"poster":"xSprint","date":"2016-07-06T06:56:44.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback.
