Any Rioter can check my chat history over the past 50 games and you will see that in almost every single one of them there has been virtually 0 chat from me.\n\nToday I forgot to put that on, and in the one game where I get toxic teammates that flame me I retaliated. \n\nFunny side note, the game I played AFTER the toxic one I had the script turned on and I ended up playing amazingly despite my team still raging at me.\n\nWhat i'm asking for is a permanent chat ban, not a permanent game ban. I love league and even stream it too! www.twitch.tv/BirdyDan  As a player from preseason 1 who mains Anivia I cant just make another account knowing I had one that I had worked so hard to build up from the beginning.\n\nI&#039;d like to hear your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-06T11:50:06.215+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short of it is, you are being held responsible for your actions. You wouldn't have been perma banned for a first offence, so you've at least seen a 14 day ban in your history. When you received that punishment it would have been made very clear in the reform card that any further violations would result in a permanent suspension of the account.\n\nIf you want community feedback on the punishment itself, you can post your logs, but it seems you know what you did constituted an offence, and assuming that in that case the punishment was not falsely applied, it won't be removed under any circumstances. Punishments will only be removed if they are made in error.\n\nYou obviously took steps, and that's commendable, but you have to consider the effect your actions have on other players, not just yourself. There comes a point where Riot can no longer encourage reform in players, and simply have to protect those being negatively affected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BirdyDan","date":"2018-04-06T12:24:00.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I would agree with you, if my ban was because of in-game griefing or things which could not have been avoided with a mute.

If you have to mute someone, generally the damage is already done. Personally if someone is being a little salty I'm not gonna mute them unless it's bothering me. If I have to make the decision to mute it's because someone has taken things way too far and there's no point communicating with them anymore. At the point I have to mute someone, I'm going to report them.\n\nAll that aside, why does it fall on *other* players to be responsible for *your* behaviour. You are being held responsible. From the sounds of things you have received all three previous punishment tiers (2 chat restrictions and a 14 day ban). You say you deserved those because you made no effort to reform and therefore continued through the tiers. You made attempts at reform *only* once you realised your account was in serious danger of being permabanned. \n\nClearly you were made very aware that one slip-up would cost you your account, and even knowing that you could not control your temper to save something you supposedly care so much about. You have essentially proven to Riot, to the punishment systems and to the other players that you don't care about how you might be ruining the experience for others, only that yours has been ruined, and that's a little hypocritical don't you think?\n\nYou proved that chat restrictions weren't enough to prompt you to reflect, and the temporary ban only worked in a temporary effect. If even self preservation, with only you standing to lose something, still could not prevent you from engaging in abusive behaviour, what do you expect Riot to do exactly?","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2018-04-06T13:43:34.524+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BirdyDan,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=i3NVnfAb,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-04-06T12:24:00.486+0000)\n>\n> I would agree with you, if my ban was because of in-game griefing or things which could not have been avoided with a mute.

What a silly argument you make there.\n\nI'm trying to have a constructive conversation and all you are doing is performing in the way which made me receive my ban in the first place.

Get real if you don’t have the self control to stop your self then you have no one to blame but your self. \n\nAs for the whole drink driving thing did I ever say they were the same? No it was a simple example of why your idea is so dumb. If I’m consistently trying to drink drive then putting a breathalyzer doesn’t solve anything. It just stops me from driving it doesn’t help me manage my problem. \n\nSo in your case giving you a permanent chat ban just makes it so you never have to learn how to deal with the frustration. Basically what you want is an easy way out. \n\nAs for “I'm trying to have a constructive conversation and all you are doing is performing in the way which made me receive my ban in the first place. There is some irony for you.”\n\nNot really sure how the way I’m performing made you receive your bans since you know I don’t control your actions, I havent said anything nasty or mean to you. I haven’t called your anything mean I gave my option on the matter and if that makes you mad enough for you to act in a way that makes you get banned then that’s your own damn fault. Hell compared to some of the stuff iv seen people say if what I said sets you off you must have little to no self control.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-04-07T06:50:18.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BirdyDan,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=i3NVnfAb,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2018-04-06T14:11:15.813+0000)\n>\n> I deserved every single one of my previous suspensions because I did nothing to fix my problem\n\nAnd yet, that is pretty much the same situation as has occurred here, yet you adamantly claim that you don't deserve *this* punishment. You did *nothing* to \"fix\" your problem in this case, all you did was prevent the symptoms from appearing. The problem is still there, as clear as ever, as evidence by the fact that you chose to retaliate against flamers (resulting in the ban).\n\nAs Lakigr and Seras have said, this is an issue where *you* lack the self control to control your own behaviours. That is not Riot's fault, that is not the fault of other players, that is *your* fault (and, dare I say, the fault of your parents for not teaching you basic self control). If you want to prevent this same kind of thing happening in the future (with any situation, not just LoL) then it is up to ***you*** to fix the problem, not the symptoms.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"BirdyDan","date":"2018-04-06T21:40:56.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You make it sound like I was flaming people left right and centre and every single game consisted of me going off my head. \n\nNo actually I've played WELL over 4000 games in my career and if you're going to judge me base off the 0.001% of games I am toxic in and not the 99.9% of the ones where I have a good game then I don't know what to say. \n\nAnd if you want an ananolgy to compare and since Lakigr loves cars so much, this is like me caught speeding 10km/h over the limit one too many times over the course of 4 years.
