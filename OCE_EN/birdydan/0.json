If you see someone using it to trick people it's really not that hard to prove that it's just a neat little trick. You can even just use it each time you join a champion select lobby to show people how it works and that it is just a fancy way of using the chat.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-04-23T11:14:48.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen this in chatrooms.
