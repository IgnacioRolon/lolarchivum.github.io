I believe this is a really good standing, and more then enough of a challenge for players of plat skill level. Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to a couple of toxic players that were alienating their teammates, and a couple of players that never showed any actual interest in playing. So now i need a couple more recruits!\r\n\r\nIf you believe you fit the mold:\r\n\r\nplatinum season 4\r\nranked 5s experience\r\nmain top/jungle (bruisers/tanks)\r\n\r\nI'm really interested in getting a senior member on board to coach and inspire the team, preferably high plat/diamond season 4. This person will be solely responsible for team direction and critique.\r\n\r\nplease add me IGN: Neosinf","replies":[{"poster":"LP boxie","date":"2015-02-10T06:32:28.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\ni was gold 1 but didn't play much solo ranked last season, am currently plat 4 and climbing.
