I'm sure there are a million discussions like this but i was hoping to maybe gain some insight from some players that have been in similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo give a little bit of background I would say I am a some what mediocre player, last season I finished in silver V after carrying myself out of bronze.\r\nI wouldn't say my ranked stats are anything too special but In most cases I find myself doing better than my team mates/making plays, nonetheless there is a clear level of skill and understanding difference between me and the average bronze player so it seems, my previous game I found myself needing to constantly warn my team mates about various basic fundamentals to league \"we cant contest drag they are 10 kills ahead and 1 person up on us\", \"Rengar you need to stop chasing people half the distance of the map otherwise their team will just keep killing you\"\r\nI suppose this is more of a rant but it is frustrating to be in this position, especially when I give golds/platinum players a run for their money on occasion when i play norms. Most normal games I have really decent scores (so long as I'm not playing something like Zed support heh) but as most do, i take ranked more serious than norms and at times have real trouble turning games if some of my team mates are just utterly clueless or AFK for whatever reason, it is fair to say that my scores plummet more than they usually would in these particular games due to trying to salvage as much as I possibly can from a failed team fight. Regardless I understand some games cannot be won..\r\n\r\nSo I guess what I am asking is what worked for those of you that climbed out of bronze? what strategies did you use? \r\nOften I am taking steps to improve my play and support my team mates.. granted they are open to listening (often not the case in bronze)\r\nI invest a decent amount of time into this game, i love playing it, love watching it. but overall knowing that I am bronze frustrates the sht out of me. \r\n\r\nMain jungle/support\r\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/1474394#ranked-stats \r\n\r\nTake care guys","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-29T04:04:30.000+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Often the weakest link in bronze is the ADC. If you are serious about escaping bronze I would suggest picking up this role and specialising in it (as well as your already good jungle and support skills). \nClimbing out of bronze is also a matter of being patient, especially with those who aren't doing so well or aren't listening to your advice. Communicating openly and constantly with your team is key, using smart pings to try and increase map awareness (something bronze players often lack).\nAnyways... Good luck, i'm sure you can climb out of bronze eventually","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-01-29T05:15:17.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-29T05:55:43.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Especially because bronze is usually last pick, people who get stuck with it hate it and build 'carry support' often not itemising to cover the teams weaknesses/ actually warding the map.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-01-29T09:58:49.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I noticed, your get locket in every game.

I personally find the gameplay down here much more relaxing and \"casual\", and trust me, enjoying the game can seriously help with your performance, and at least have fun in the games even when you lose.
