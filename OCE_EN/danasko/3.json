This makes the hard work done on login screens reappreciated and I'd love to get the season 4 championship login screen back. I'm guessing this might be difficult to implement though. Another drawback would be that riot can't promote new content through the login screen but that can be avoided by forcing you to use the current champion login as they are released for a bit.\r\nThanks for reading and I hope to hear your thoughts down below.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-03-07T20:45:23.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While this is a cool feature if you would really like the season 4 championship login screen back you can manually set it if you search up how.","replies":[{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-03-08T05:13:52.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah i do know there is an alternative way to use login screens but it is tedious so i thought maybe if riot can support this feature it would help everyone out.","replies":[]}]}]}
