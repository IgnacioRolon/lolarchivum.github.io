Lets say if you play a certain amount of games as a champion (lets say 20) then you can use their icon as your summoner icon? I think it would be a really cool addition to LoL. Doing the same thing with skins could be quite cool to increase their value and incentive to buy a skin. True this may lower the value of the ultimate skins icons / store bought icons but people would really like this addition and it probably isn't difficult to add into the game. Maybe adjust to make it so you that champion summoner icon becomes unlocked in the store then which you can buy it for 100 or 250 rp or something, So that there is more money to be made by riot. After playing a bit of Dota 2 and HOTS, i really think LoL's icons are lacking in customization/personalization and this could be an appropriate addition.\nThanks for reading and please post your thoughts.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-06T11:23:24.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds decent. but riot want money, this won't be a source of money, more like a loss, therefore it will never happen, the end.","replies":[{"poster":"DiddlyDonger","date":"2015-03-07T08:23:46.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd agree with this if there weren't already an opportunity such as this. When you play in draft mode in a certain position for about 5 games I believe, you receive an icon.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-07T13:07:06.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no he means like the champions not the roles.. like a icon for garen or as he etc..","replies":[{"poster":"DiddlyDonger","date":"2015-03-08T12:04:48.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I know what he means, I did read the post you know :) What I meant was that your point about Riot 'wanting money' is invalid due to the fact that there are already (free) icons available for similar reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-03-08T15:06:16.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is only like five... the rest cost rp...","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
