If you notice someone is very close to leveling up then you could play them that game or maybe if you have very little mastery on another champion could try that champ out for a game or two. I just find it a little irritating to have to look at my champion collection after a game to see where my champion mastery is at while it could be easily implemented into champion select. This is a very simple addition that can go a far way for champion obsessed players like myself.","replies":[]}
