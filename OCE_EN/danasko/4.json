This is true for your top 3, but beyond that, not really. I&#039;m sure people are starting to get more than 3 level 5 champions but because it is limited to your top 3 champions, your 4th, 5th etc champs don&#039;t gain any spotlight and your other champions that you don&#039;t play as much are representing you and your champions. This really annoys me and several other people. This will also lower the incentive to get a champion lvl 5 and keep it level 4 so that it doesn&#039;t disappear off your profile. I really think this change would help put value on playing your favorite champions and be proud of presenting them in your profile.
