Not even sure what sort of program riot has accused me of using, but I wouldn&#039;t even know how to install or use one, nor want to. Pretty fair ban, I can tell riot really investigates when they permanently ban someone.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:40:46.509+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you are telling the truth, more than likely you either shared the account with someone who used cheats (usually a booster or a**hole friend) or your account was compromised. \n\nIn the case of the first, you aren't going to get the account back. \n\nIn the case of the second, ticket support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and explain the situation. They will ask you to secure your account (change your PW) and will ask you a whole bunch of ownership verification questions. Once the account is secure and ownership is confirmed they'll give the account back.","replies":[]}]}
