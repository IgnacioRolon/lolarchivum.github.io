I went adc and my support was a brand, and my first thought was &quot;brand just hit Lucian with &quot;W&quot; and did half his hp?&quot; so i thought it was a bug at first then  their mid laner roamed bot we one the fight but then annie&#039;s tibber 1 v 1s  me (had half hp and it procced thunderlords???). Also i dont know if the  new hextech items are strong but their alistar that went that item 1 shotted me several times. So I dont wanna sound like a total pleb but this patch mages seem a big too strong, hopefully the mages will be nerfed pls rito.\nThanks\nBlinez~\n\nP.S - Also because of this patch, adcs seem very underpowered compared to the new mages :c","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-04T11:24:07.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"mhm Maybe, what's always separated mages and adcs is that Mages relied mainly on a combo to deal burst damage, this meant that they relied on snowballing early to mid game and push the advantage where as ADCs can snowball pretty easily too, but they really shine late game with a full crit build. But right now if we were talking about high levels of play, the current meta revolves around mid-game and short matches.  Because of this meta we see ADCs opting for guinsoos rageblade(not sure about now but that was definitely the case pre 6.9) for a stronger mid game. \n\nThat being said, when it comes to late game most mages kind of fall off a bit if the enemy team is smart enough to build some MR into their comp, where if they mess up their combo typically they become useless for a few seconds, where as an ADC as long as they are alive, they will continue to deal damage because they rely more on sustained.\n\nHonestly, wouldn't surprise me if mages were a bit more overtuned this patch.  I mean this update was huge!","replies":[{"poster":"brion","date":"2016-05-04T12:23:06.432+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yea i m not surprised the mages are bit over powered this patch I was pretty much expecting it, BUT what right now i m not even going to touch my main role (ADC) because i feel completely useless as my support deals out more damage and i even asked my support if he wants me to just build support. Also the hextech items seem very strong if you are willing you could check my match history of the recent vayne game (im terrible at this game btw)  and see the alistar that was 14/12 who was wqing and auto proc thunderlords and killed me at like 12 minutes in the game\n\nSo this patch has completely tilted me ahhaha i m hoping they nerf the mages soon enough!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-05T09:51:22.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously havent met malz\n\nno counters anymore, can kill you from 100% hp at lv 2/3 with just w and e.","replies":[{"poster":"brion","date":"2016-05-05T09:59:08.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahhaha yea i havent played league for a while as I think the mages are a bit too strong for me haah","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-05T12:54:24.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Blinez,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=TwEGIE48,comment-id=00040000,timestamp=2016-05-05T09:59:08.770+0000)\n>\n> ahhaha yea i havent played league for a while as I think the mages are a bit too strong for me haah\n\nYou played less than a day ago.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TurokBarkas","date":"2016-05-04T16:19:20.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to main adc (especially hyper carries like jinx, ashe etc.). But now its just like getting one shotted by any other role, even by the supports sometimes. I almost always win the laning phase only to get deleted later by mages or assassins, and even against tanks u have no chance except maybe in late game when u have finished your full crit/ last whisper build. i played now like 4 games in a row, where everytime the mages (veigar, brand, zyra, malz) had by far the most damage in game. veigar had 1300 ap and one shotted 4 full hp champs in a 1v4. its like since season 6 began, adcs got nerfed every patch, soon u cant even qss zed ult?! and i dont understand why mr items got nerfed when mages have become stronger... sry for crying so much, but u fucked the life of adcs rito...","replies":[{"poster":"brion","date":"2016-05-05T10:06:37.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was fine with playing adc against assasins and mages last patch but this patch i just cant do anything if i accidently misclick i get instant deleted, i was fine with qss not working on zed as i can dodge his q's and the tanks i can shred because i m a vayne main but its just the mages who 1 shot me and i cant do anything against them :/ and i agree adcs are literally body shields now..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Raff Endorf","date":"2016-05-05T09:20:41.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"u fked every mage , u keep life steal for ur adcs etc and u take spell vamp out , mage players arent ur tools malz has a good game play spell vamp his abilities worked better in game play than now , cassiopia shes fking useless her alt misses target or do no damage to little ,uclearly like ur fking darius and sht thats fine leave the mages alone (fking noobs)","replies":[{"poster":"brion","date":"2016-05-05T10:04:34.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont even know what you said in this but i think ur saying that this patch is ok because adc's have life steal? if you did ur pretty dumb because life steal doesnt matter anymore because i m gonna get 1 shot by veigar ult which l i cant dodge please tell me how to counter this bronzie :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xanexadonis","date":"2016-05-05T04:30:38.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really dislike these op mages. it makes it extremely difficult if not impossible to kill them no matter what mid to late game. getting close to them is basically suicide. I've even tried full tank builds and still get shredded. Idk if this is a problem for everyone else, but it seems as though once a mage gets a kill or two early game the game is over. I stopped playing ranked because its just teams stacked with the new mages. I wish this had some balance but at the moment I cant play virtually any assasin. smh\n\neven full tank mumu got blown up by a comp with zyra, malz, and annie. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"brion","date":"2016-05-05T10:01:20.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea man i m disliking this patch i got 1 shotted by an alistar ahhahaha i cant play adc anymore 1 shot by any mage :(","replies":[]}]}]}
