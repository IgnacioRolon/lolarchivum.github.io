It is predominantly used by players to verbally abuse other players, blame other players, order around other players, or otherwise express negative feelings about the game or their teammates.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a player uses chat to say something nice, or communicate useful information. I'm absolutely willing to sacrifice these infrequent instances of positivity, if I also no longer have to watch human beings tell other human beings to kill themselves, throw slurs at one another, and generally degrade each other and themselves in the process.  Even when it isn't targetting me, it is disheartening to see people who likely have a lot in common be so thoughtlessly harmful to one another.\r\n\r\nLeague now has pings, emotes and other ways to communicate with teammates, chat is no longer a necessary feature for communicating key in-game information. Teams who want to communicate can use Discord or another tool of that kind. Chat is obsolete and is more harmful to the game than it is good. Riot should consider removing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-06-01T13:14:06.041+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"kinda agree, the toxicity levels keep increasing not enough is being done about it","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysticaI","date":"2019-06-05T05:33:13.601+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its called \"/mute all\"{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-06-03T12:19:23.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot knows that chat is only ever used in negative ways but wont remove them because people wont get permi banned and make new accou ntd and buy more skins its all about the money not the players","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-03T15:34:23.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have my doubts about the 0.06% of permabanned players being the big moneymakers for Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-06-08T09:58:17.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=TxURP7TW,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2019-06-03T15:34:23.963+0000)\n>\n> I have my doubts about the 0.06% of permabanned players being the big moneymakers for Riot.\n\nyeah im sorry but the 0.06 has been used for so long that number is complete and utter bs lmfao","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-08T10:01:15.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even if you assume that number has quadrupled.

The system is, unfortunately, useless, and noone i spoke to at riot seemed interested in fixing it.","replies":[{"poster":"Potato King","date":"2019-06-03T06:03:19.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Had the exact same thing happen with a duo of trolls in one of my matches, i posted in a thread about trolls and got ridicules by some pleb who thinks he runs the forums, i even owned what i said and posted my chat log. I got a 10-Game Chat Restriction after defending myself against a troll duo that literally told me to Commit Suicide in Real Life. They walked away scot-free.\n\nI sent in a report on the support site as well as a post game report, and Blitz Bot's response was that nothing would happen because i had already reported them and i need not report them again. I just recently requested a human to go back and read the logs because those 2 trolls continued games for the next few days without repercussions. From what I've read HERE on the boards, Suicide Encouragement is supposed to be a 14-Day instant ban. Yet RIOT's amazing auto bot system can't detect it?!\n\nI went as far as to do one of the RIOT Support Questionnaires that pop up after a game and mad sure they knew exactly my feelings towards how half this community is and i gave them a suggestion on how to fix a lot of the toxicity issues. I definitely will not recommend any of my friends to play League. It is a cesspool. Always has been and it definitely hasn't gotten better over the past 9 years.\n\nWhat fucks me off the most is the fact i can't get my money back, otherwise i'd be filing for full refund and i would never return to this trash game.","replies":[{"poster":"BlackestFury","date":"2019-06-12T04:36:32.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are in Australia file to ACCC for a breach in LOL's obligation to protect it's customers from mental harm (eg people who encourage suicidal thoughts).
