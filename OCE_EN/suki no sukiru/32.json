Atm he has too much damage without any scales, a full tank will allow him to win most fights because he does so much and is so tanky.

What's his playstyle? He just seems like some weird debuff-based mage but the %health true damage goes against that, he can't be a super burster and also have mad tank-busting skills. At 400 ad that ult is doing something like 1500 damage that you cannot build against, BEFORE including the %health. Also, this entire champion cannot be built against. You can't have a champion that scales off AD but all his abilities deal high magic or true damage. Because what happens his, his auto attacks are gonna chunk for a lot of damage, but then his abilities will do other damage. Building armor and MR is useless, against this champion you might as well just stack health, and even then the % damage on his ult gets you. It just leads to unhealthy play, where this champion can basically 1v1 anyone with little real counter play, and also chunks the shit out of towers. Maybe rethink and come back?","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-02-21T10:41:32.036+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well, his playstyle is channeling until they die......","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-02-11T08:38:41.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can he move in his q channeling?\n\nAlso, the \"At rank 5\" stuff is exactly syndra's passive, it's just there as his abilities passive, so that's way too overpowered.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-02-11T08:42:10.849+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, his R can potentially have a higher cool down than flash. The R is wayyyyyyyyy to overpowered, no matter how you think of it, and it's not fair at all.

THis is what would happen and in my opinion even though he only has channels he is stupidly over powered like wow","replies":[]},{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2016-02-06T21:40:23.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the horrible pixels on the picture, i really tried......","replies":[]}]}
