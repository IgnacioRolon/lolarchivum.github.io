Also, i think the range of healing for his w should be slightly smaller and the time should be 5, 6, 7, 8 at all ranks, but just change the amount healed? E should be probably just 3 champions max and 3 other units e.g. minions. I think the ultimate should just be like tryndameres ult except on an ally and slightly heals. E.g. makes an ally invulnerable to all sources for 5/6/7 seconds and heals for 10/15/20 % missing HP... ???","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Æ’amous","date":"2015-10-01T05:34:56.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So does Nami.","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-01T06:20:04.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well nami isnt full heal either.. she has quite the offense","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
