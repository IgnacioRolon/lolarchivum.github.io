Up to 50.\r\nTake 7+ 7% Reduced Damage, Deal 7+ 7% Increased Damage killing a unit restores 7 Health and MANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Strikers Impaler. New Tier 2 Jungler Item.\r\nCost 500g.\r\n\r\nYou first attack / Single target spell against any monster deals 20% damage as True Damage.\r\nSmite now deals 50% Damage instant and 50% damage over 3 seconds but heals you for that over time amount over 5 seconds.\r\nOn champions smite silences for 0.25 seconds and attacking them 4 times within 5 seconds deals 12% of their MAX HP as Bonus True Damage and impales them on the spot, rooting for 1 second.\r\n\r\n4. Soul Eater ( Not Too clear what is should be )\r\nKilling a monster lays down their corpse for 5 seconds, Soul eater can be activated on the corpse to restore &quot;Health&quot; base on monsters maximum health, however this puts their soul to unrest, causing the camp to spawn 10 seconds slower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Captivating Sphere.\r\nCost 150 G Can be used 3 times.\r\n\r\nActivate to capture a Plant.\r\nReactivating places the plant.\r\nCan Also capture wards {{item:3649}}  from enemies and turn them into you own and they will count to your max wards.\r\n \r\nThis can be bonded to boots to create Capturer&#039;s boots.\r\n\r\n6. Capturer&#039;s Boots\r\nBoots + Captivating Sphere  + 800G.\r\n\r\nGrants 40 Movement Speed and the Ability to capture plants and wards and placing them as your own.\r\nWith this upgrade it is now infinite use and can also be used on traps and allied objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are just some ideas and some suggestions and opinions would be nice, they may seem a bit op but as a jungler main ive been pretty hurt by the changes.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-01-31T02:15:01.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are all the same as the general shit we see in here in terms of item's/champions.\n\n>1: Leashers Shuriken\n\nSo basically, your support is now required to buy one and get only one potion at the start of the game, or the enemy jungler wins, and the jungler's both take 2 of these instead of potions, making the good junglers better and the worse junglers even more unviable.\n\n>2: Enchantment: Forest's Wrath.\n\n50 Move speed is way too much, the base stats are way too high, and the health/mana regen on the passive are way too high as well.\n\n>Strikers Impaler. New Tier 2 Jungler Item.\n\nSilence's are already being removed, so why would one be on an item?\n\nAlso smite doing more damage than BotRK but in true damage? let's not.\n\n>Captivating Sphere.\n\nYou now always carry the explosive plant, and always have a way out, yeah let's not, especially not for 50g a pop.","replies":[]}]}
