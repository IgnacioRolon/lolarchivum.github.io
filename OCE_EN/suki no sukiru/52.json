Easy ganks with ult, just run up behind and push them all the way under your lane turret and is Flatten the Weak followed by Show them who is boss to secure a easy kill.\r\n\r\nIn teamfights just flash from behind and push the enemy ADC or Main damage outpu into your team so they get slaughtered, but do be aware they must be outside of a certain range and not right in front.\r\n\r\nCounter tips. JUST GET ARMOR. he cannot do much shit to you if you  have armor. But if you dont, prepare to get melted. \r\nBe aware of his mana amont. His spells cost alot of mana.","replies":[{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2016-03-06T13:35:43.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They took Teemo's increased sight range from him for a reason.
