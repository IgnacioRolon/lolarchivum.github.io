He carries a shield and a mechanical spear that has a drill instead of the sharp end.\r\n\r\nHis roll should be a fighter or tank because he has great tanking and soloing potential.\r\n\r\nNot doing stats but he should have High Health, No mana instead using a new system called POWER, Medium damage, High Armor and Extremely High MR.\r\n\r\nHe has a max of 500 POWER. Generating 1 every second. Basic attacks generate 15 power on minions and 30 POWER on champions.\r\nKilling a minion generates him 50 POWER over 10 seconds and gives him a 10% Speed boost during the time. Killing a champion generates him 150 power over 10 seconds and gives 20% speed boost over the time.\r\n\r\nPassive: Drill strike.\r\nCorax attacks drill into the enemy. Dealing 90% Damage on contact, digging his weapon into the flesh of the enemy and over 0.6 sec deal another\r\n30/35/40/45% of his AD as Bonus damage +3.5% every 10% Bonus attack speed.  Ticks once every 0.1 seconds. \r\n\r\nQ: Drill  17/15/13/11/9 seconds.\r\nPassive: Consecutive attacks lower the enemies Armor by 4% up to 40% for 2 seconds.\r\nActive: Corax lunges forward up to 600 spaces, pointing his drill forward dealing 60/130/200/270/340 +90%AD to units he pass through, but if he hits a champion, he is halted in front of the champion with his drill inside them. Drilling into the enemy champion, they are stuck onto his drill. Taking 6/10/16/24/34 + 10/12.5/15/17.5/20%AD and 1/1.5/2/2.5/3% of their MAX HP as Physical damage every 0.2 seconds for 2 seconds. \r\n\r\nW: Energy Barrier. \r\nPassive: Grants him 2/4/6/8/10 Armor and MR every 50 POWER he has.\r\nActive (Toggle): Channels his energy into a shield over 0.75 seconds.  Draining 20 Power every second and granting him a barrier that blocks 60/65/70/75/80% incoming damage. He cannot attack in this mode though and can only use abilities. However for every spell it blocks, it returns 20% of his MAX POWER.\r\n\r\nE: Lance Lunge 26/25/24/23/22 seconds.\r\nPlacing his shield in front of him he starts charging towards the cursor location. He gains 20/25/30/35/40 movement speed and every second he gains 20/25/30/35/40 speed again but with 10 more speed. He deals damage to all units he passes through after he has gained more than 120 speed in this effect, he deals damage equal to 100/150/200/250/300+50%AD Physical damage and knocks them up if they are not a champion. \r\nIf he hits a champion, he will deal 70/110/150/190/230 +125%AD damage and stun them for 1/1.25/1.5/1.75/2 seconds as well as taking 20% reduced damage from the champions hit for 3 more seconds. \r\n\r\nR: Power Burst    Cost 500 power 20 second cooldown.\r\nPassive: Power generation increased to 2/5/7 every second instead of 1.\r\nActive: Corax starts to channel immense energy out of him. Channels for 4 seconds while decreasing the brightness of the rift from draining all the power. If he can complete the channel, he releases a huge burst of light the blinds everyone temporarily and deals 400/600/800+125%AP magic damage to units within 2000 units of him.
