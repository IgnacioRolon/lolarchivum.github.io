Also note , how does R reach rank 5 when the champion max level is 18 .\nIn summary :\nYour champion passive : I like the idea you are putting out, it's basically a Graves aa I presume ; with the base damage and the AP ratio , I presume the passive is a mix between Lissandra passive and Diana, it could be fine but the it could be extreme broken if build Lich Bane, you either need to tune down the number or make it harder to appear, because 0.75s cd on passive if use spell and aa is ridiculous broken since the variety of AP item giving stats will make that extremely broken ( IMO: tune down the number or make it harder to get passive)\n\nYour champion Q : A combination of Brand passive which a tuned down % health with an Anivia E like capability and Caitlyn Q damage reduction, this itself is already broken ; considering the ratio 120% AP which make it more broken even with a low base damage, the Q itself would be able to decimate a champion late game, the passive itself is not needed but added to oversize the champion already destructive damage (IMO : get rid of the passive and nerf down the AP ratio)\n\nYour champion W :  I don't know what broken , 800 magic damage worth of that or an extremely long ass slow ; this isn't DOTA not alot of cc last this long, and considering this is an AP champion, with this kit the Q itself would take down a marksman like it's fries, and with the slow scaling as well it make it extremely hard to balance this champion with ratio, I know you are trying to be creative by mixing Nasus W and another champion ability but legit it would be extremely hard to get away from this champion , which make firstly OP as well as anti-fun.\nThe passive itself make this champion not blue reliant, a free ability is basically Lissandra passive and that take up a skill and only take up a few bit of time ; considering a free skill + restoration of mana ; this W itself is more broken then Riven whole kit ( IMO : get rid of the passive because you're overloading the kit , secondly % missing mana is vital late game which make this champion scale extremely hard with great early; get rid of it or tune down the orignal number , by that I mean fix number for slow or AP ratio doesn't scale and stay at fix and low % ) \n\nYour champion E : Oh boy ! Where should I begin ? An E that is already better then Braum R with that you bring along Rammus ability into it making it seem like Chernobyl. It is broken from the ratio itself , imagine early game with per sec tick ; you basically can go all in on anyone and just leave it here because they can't kill you with that extra armour and mr as well as the damage reduction they are going to receive , legit the most broken ability after your W ; I thought your W was overtune , but this bring it to the next level of \"balancing by Riot\" , the passive it overloaded and it's not even needed since the champion itself is obviously gonig to build AP and by that a Zhonya perhaps , he doesn't need extra MR or Damage Reduction what he need is a mobility spell or something along damage without killing the hope of Rumble and Braum. (IMO : Change the god damn thing , I can't even think what someone can do to make that balance)\n\nYour champion R : Jax ult on an AP champion , I have a problem with 70% reduction mainly because Maokai ( the tree) will probably cry in a hole because of that reduction , I know it's not flat damage reduction but this game has since evolve and many champion now has AOE and Dot abilities, if you are gonna reduce 70% of those damage off , you are left with what someone call \"broken beyond repair\" , 120 MR and Armour is a huge number, considering an ult can't be level 5 times anyway because max level is lv 18, so i don't know what you were thinking but it seem to me that this kit is heavily loaded with what someone call \" You can't kill me but I will smash you in 2s rengar type of thing\" , with that much resistant , this champion will be contested in both top,mid,jg and ad carry and might as well as support since the utility it brings (IMO : Tune it down, change it completely to something worth using , remove passive because that is more broken then any champion that is currently in League ; 100% sure that increasing your Q which was 120% to 150% would make someone easier to one shot , esp late game where 1 shotting people is not meant to be easy stuff)\n\nOverall : An overtuned champion that is inspired by a product of many other champion , abilities need to be changes completely, the concept itself is great using element and all that but the effect of it make other champion R sound like a joke to this champion . If this concept be considered , I recommend tune down on number and change some ability work esp Q , W , E \n\nTL;DR : Nerf it before it kill you","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-11-29T10:39:20.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea.
