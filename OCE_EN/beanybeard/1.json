Opening the crates and seeing what you get can be really fun, especially when you can unlock and awesome skin and only have maybe paid 195rp or a crate from a game. If you have three champ shards of champs you own or have no real thought of playing at the time, you can re-roll shards for a random champ. This is a really cool feature and I got myself a champ I was looking into.\n\nWith all this random rolls is it a bit too much. The only reason is that I sacked two legacy skins and a legendary skin (of champs I&#039;m not interested in playing) and got a skin for a champ I do not own. I&#039;m not 100% sure how I got the chests the the skins came from (I do buy some chests and earn them from games) so wasting some skins to get a skin for a champ I don&#039;t own or intend on playing is a kick in the guts. Also the disenchant value is less than  a legendary skin. Would it not be better to have a random skin for a champ you do own, or have the option for complete random or random own. I think this would make hextech much better and you don&#039;t have that feeling of risk with possible great reward. Considering how many skins there are people should have a better idea of what they are getting with re-roll skins.\n\nThank you for ready and remember to grow a beard and stay awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-27T22:44:23.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you're saying, but you've got to look at it like a Roulette table or a lotto scratchy. Owning champs or skins does not remove the set number from the RNG chance so you have a better chance to get what you want. Otherwise the system would over-ride the store as you could in essence trade up to where you want to be for less RP than just buying it from store.\n\nIt's supposed to be a lucky dip, that simple. Otherwise people will slowly steer towards chests/keys as a whole as it has access to legacy skins and works towards Hextech annie etc. \n\nI know them feels bro, i really do. But i can't really agree with you in the heart of it. It's supposed to be a gamble, not a way for you to randomly complete your collections.","replies":[]}]}
