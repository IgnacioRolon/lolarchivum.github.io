I decided not to jump straight into ranked and get stuck with the lower end of bronze. I have had a friend taking ages to get out of bronze. So I have been doing research into the champs I am taking. Sadly I need CDR runes. Which would be better getting the flat CDR runes for 820 IP a piece, or going for the scaling ones for 410 IP a piece? Considering how long it would take to get 9x flat CDR runes I was wondering if scaling ones are worth it. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading and remember to grow a beard and stay awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2016-05-01T21:06:22.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy what you feel is best.\nConfining yourself to copying a build off the net isnt the best so buy what you feel you need, not something that you find completley useless","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-05-01T19:20:05.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice would be to invest in the Scaling CDR runes first. If you're only playing ranked for the first time now, it's much easier for you to invest your runes into the cheaper and more efficient rune. \n\nFlat CDR is good for early game aggression and pressure from champions, however the scaling CDR is amazing in the mid to late game. By the time you are level 9 it has become more efficient than the flat runes. I personally like the scaling runes a majority of the time anyway, as level 9-11 is when you really need the CDR to increase your dps, due to your spells reaching their highest base damages. \n\nIts up to you and your playstyle though, and if you haven't experimented with these runes before, i would suggest the scaling so you don't bomb out all your IP on flat's and then have troubles adjusting to a more squishy but aggressive playstyle. \n\nBest of luck to you! I'd love to know hwat champions in particular you're talking about so I can suggest some specific runes for you :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-30T10:40:06.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I run 9 scaling cdr blues on like, 95% of my mid laners. Pretty much all of them to be honest. That coupled with Morellos or Athene's gives you 35% late game. 9 scaling CDR IS the standard right now.\n\nYou COULD run 9 flat and just take CDR boots instead of Sorcs but I'm not always a fan of that, Sorcs just always feel like a really good powerspike.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-04-30T05:18:01.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what you play like really if you are very passive and go for late game go scaling and have 15% late game but the early 7% is good for early game champions like Riven, Panth, Rengar to say a few","replies":[{"poster":"BeanyBeard","date":"2016-04-30T05:21:25.792+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice dude. I am a pretty aggressive player as early as I can. If I can't it normally tilts me a little.

I think there are also IP boosts that might help if you're prepared to spend real money to speed it up","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-30T07:07:40.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends what role you play and who you play.\n\nIm personally a big fan of flat. Flat 10% from runes helps a lot early game and most champs that want CDR itemise it well. Especially with the new item changes next patch, flat is the go i think.","replies":[]}]}
