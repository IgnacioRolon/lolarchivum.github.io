Always the same M.O. ... 3-4 letters 3 numbers and poorly coded bots that just feed and make the experience a mo******ing pain in the rear. YOU know it&#039;s happening, why are you not doing anything about it?","replies":[{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-10T08:07:10.431+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\ntehre used to be about 60% of the players on aram where bots.\nThey usally bot the accounts to earn states game after game for them. Or then they would sell the account on ebay for a crap ton of money. \n\nPlease be sure to report the bots. If no one reports it, Riot have no idea. \nThey will take action on them once they get a few reports. I'm sure they will get those reports very quickly too!","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-14T15:24:08.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They need a \"Report Bot\" function. \n\nBut i have to say though.. Without bots id never get my other accounts leveled past level 15. Seriously they seem to be the only ones playing low level games for me, its annoying for newer players i agree as you can have like the 5 man mid bot team. But as a vet player, i can 1v5 easy agaisnt bots and its really funny.\n\nI had one game i played Kayle and got a level 4 penta. Kayle is so good against bot mid spam :D.\n\nBut yeah unless they increase the early IP and EXP gain i dont want bots dealt with untill its fixed. Even with bots atm on OCE it takes 2-4 minutes to get a game at low levels. Imagine it without? That means i get 100IP every 1-1.5 hours and dick all exp. No thanks i don't want that. At least bot games are over in 20 mins or less.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-16T12:13:26.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It comes under the 'cheating' category as far as reporting them goes. Just note that it's a bot in the comment section if you remember as it helps out the system and anyone who looks at the report. I'd still suggest reporting them, even if you see the advantages of them being there, it's too much of a negative experience for new players, and it can be hard enough for them as it is with the high number of smurfs (but at least with smurfs if they watch closely they can learn from the experience).","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-18T14:50:11.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah that's true but with the current wait time for the low level que im not too bothered by bots as i said. I do report them but i dont go out of my way to tell everyone to report them. \n\nReally i think they may as well merge some servers for OCE for low level play. Though the lag might hurt it would be better than waiting 10-20 minuted for a damn game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T08:14:06.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.
