I just went up vs a level 30 yasuo with 2k+ games and ranked. The runes and masteries alone are a massive disadvantage. It was a complete stomp. The other low level he queued had obviously just made a new account with him to get easy games. I looked up their history and every game they played was a complete stomp. Why is this allowed? All the normals I have played have been massively one sided because one of these players are on my team or the other. It is completely pointless playing normals. Why even have levels? Why not just give everyone all runes and masteries and go off the mmr alone? It would make creating new accounts pointless.","replies":[{"poster":"RHIN0","date":"2016-02-16T00:06:04.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"whats wrong with a lvl30 playing a game of norms with his friend who is new to the game?","replies":[{"poster":"Lalna","date":"2016-02-17T13:58:43.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will likely lane against some new who has no idea how to play.
