Plus they said they would regulate the skin prices to be accurate to what you are purchasing, yet they still haven't fixed The Magnificent Twisted Fate, Red baron Corki and many others. So you'd be an idiot to trust their word for it.\n\nso tbh i am bewildered that you are actually expecting something from them O_O","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T02:24:12.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They massively increased their quality standards in the year DJ Sona came out. They made an honest mistake on past experience (that became invalid when their standards changed) and apologised for it, making it very clear that it would not be the case. Likely they intend to up the quality of the skins you mentioned rather than reducing their price which will be why they remain in that state, but they have to try and keep up with those projects in addition to their rework schedules, new champions, new skins and everything else that goes on in the game for the art/animation etc teams.\n\nI think you're being unduly harsh, given that they have a difficult and very time consuming job and this is a free to play game. Money doesn't make good art, in their case it only gives them the resources to do so faster, but in the end it is time and effort that makes skins/champions/reworks etc, not money and magic like you seem to think. Try seeing it from their side for a change m8.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-07T11:40:27.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I never make an argument without thinking about both sides m8. \n\nAs a matter of fact money does buy quality, quality and speed, you can pay 1 person $100 an hour to design skins or you can pay 50 people $100 an hour to design skins. the more people you have on something the faster it gets done and the more money you put in the better the artists you can hire and the more of them you can get. (this is easily proven, look at the artwork and quality of the champs/skins when the game first came out and had little money, and look at them now that they are rolling in it) Riot has that kind of money. It is a free to play game yes, but you can pay and you DO pay, and they earn a LOT! I'm not saying its bad that they earn a lot, i think good on them! its an honest job they are doing and they deserve it.\nbut they do make money and a LOT of it.\n\nAnd for the amount of money they make they are remarkably bad at keeping to their own rules. They publicly stated that all Legendary skins would feature unique voice overs, particle changes, and model changes. Yet the ones that already existed that didn't meet that criteria had no compensation (and still haven't) and they also publicly stated that they will release an Ultimate skin EVERY year. (and this was all several years ago, and they still haven't fixed the old legendary skins)\n\nSo as it stands as simple fact, not 'all' legendary skins feature what they are supposed to, AND they failed to release an ultimate skin every year (in fact they failed to release one the very year they made that promise)\n\nAs a company if they make a public statement, it is their obligation to fulfil it. So instead of updating a champ like Shen that nobody wanted updated in the first place, they should have been putting their efforts into fulfilling their promises. (promises made several years earlier) \n\nWe know it takes remarkably little time to create a skin. We know from the world championship skins that come out and from Cosmic Reaver Kassadin. \n\nBut as it stands, Riot have no intention to update these skins, as quoted: \n\"Yo ZylotheWolfbane!\nSo, short answer is that skins team currently has no plans to go back an update older skins.\"\n\nthe quote can be found here incase you want reference:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/AEAgtaJU-an-open-letter-to-riot-games-heading-into-season-6\n\nThe only way they will ever be updated is during a champion update, (which is never a certainty of happening to a champ) and seeming Corki got updated recently and his skins were not affected, there is little chance of his false legendary skins being changed at all.\n\nSo how am i being unduly harsh? \n\nThey made promises (that we didn't even ask them to make, it was their idea) they haven't lived up to the promises and have stated that they have no intention of doing so. \nSo from where i stand, i have stable ground in saying that you shouldn't trust them to give out an ultimate skin when promised, because looking at their history they haven't lived up to their promises. Whats harsh about that?\n\nin-fact they don't live up to their promises of 'clarity' either which has been their main battle cry ever since the new SR. \nhere i have two examples of clarity not functioning properly In a major way:\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/wa8IEEIg-i-have-proof-now-riot-you-might-want-to-take-a-look\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/LPpx2EiU-anivias-q-indicator-size-is-wrong\n\nBoth clearly have proof of something (not minor) failing to work as intended, neither receive any riot attention at all and certainly aren't fixed.\none of which being reported months ago.\n\nSo if they fail to acknowledge and fix actual gameplay bugs, as well as refusing to honour their prior promises regarding legendary skins, AND fail to release ultimate skins in the timeframe they promised. \nThen yes, i have fair reasoning to doubt their word.\n\n(the funny thing is i don't care at all about the skins not being updated or that an ultimate skin doesn't come out every year, i only care because they said they would do it, and they haven't. If they hadn't said they would, i would have no problem with them not doing it.)\n\nWords are powerful things, and if you say something you should be prepared to back it up, either with action or with an apology for a lack of action, riot has given us neither, and therefore lack my trust in this area.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T12:02:29.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> As a company if they make a public statement, it is their obligation to fulfil it.\n\nThis isn't a rule anywhere, it's good practice yes, but not a rule. The only obligation they have to us is the bare minimum to keep people playing and spending money on the game essentially.\n\nThe creative process is a lot more complicated than just get more people on it. Different people have different styles, and someone suitable to designing say, a pool party skin, may not be suitable to design a battlecast skin. They have to be as versatile as possible yes, but this kind of art usually comes from the original idea of ONE person and then fleshed out by others. It's not something you can throw people at and assume it will get done to a satisfactory standard. Not to mention they have to split their art teams to continue delivering other content in the mean time.\n\nYou mention the world champ skins, but even if they don't start animation/rigging or asset dev until after the winner has been decided, I think you'll find they have at least loose plans for the skins before hand. Not to mention, the world champ skins tend to take at least 4-5 months to complete, are being worked on simultaneously, and are only 750 tier skins. So for a skin like DJ Sona, just how much longer do you think that takes? Cause I can tell you it's more than a year.\n\nIn a company as large as Riot there will be a few disconnects around. Maybe we wouldn't be witness to those disconnects if the Rioters spent less time communicating with the playerbase, but that's part of what makes them so special as a company. They're people too and people make mistakes. Riot is a fairly unique company and they reap the benefits but also pay the price of that.\n\nYou are entitled to your opinion and your lack of trust, but my opinion stands that I think you're being unduly harsh, so I think perhaps we will have to agree to disagree on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-02-07T21:55:59.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what the creative process is, i have been studying it for 3 years, and a lot of the time it is done under speed, it is a tool for coming up with ideas under pressure, they don't say \"Ok go to Hawaii and come back once an idea pops into your heads\" its more like \"ok lets all sit down in a group and brainstorm\" it takes significantly less time than you think.\n\nLets look at Cosmic Reaver Kassadin, It was announced that Riot Marauder had an idea that the skins team liked and less than 2 months later BAM a 1350 skin was on the market, you give them too much leniency, think of a franchise like Assassins Creed, in a single year they come up (not only design, but also code) an entire new game, so unless RIOT is super inefficient it will take them significantly less time to create a single skin for a single champ.\n\nNow I'm in no rush for an ultimate skin, i play mostly unpopular champs so the chances of it being for a champ i play is significantly low. So i don't really care when it come out, and personally i think they should prioritise (if they hadn't already said they weren't going to) updating the fake legendary skins, before they even start entertaining the idea of a new ultimate skin.\n\nYou mention that they take a long time to do things because they talk to the player base? thats bs, theres what maybe 6 rioters max that ever post on the boards (not including special guests) and none of them are part of the design team. The splash artists almost never come to the boards (not even the NA ones) remember the ones that talk on the boards its part of their job, and in reality yes they do talk to the community but never about actual issues, they reply almost instantly to \"wahhh i didnt get my free icon\" or \"insert bad pun here\" but when its a legitimate problem with the gameplay (the two links i provided earlier are just 2 of many many similar threads) riot never shows up. either its because the rioters on the boards don't have the authority to sign it off as a bug and take action, or they just don't want to deal with it and so leave it alone. Either way its not an effective system.\n\nits good that they talk to us, it makes for a far better game than game companies that just leave you out to dry, but remember that community friendliness is part of their advertising, they don't do it out of the goodness of their hearts. Im not saying that the rioters don't care about us or the game, but they talk to us because its in their job description and its part of the image of their company, \n\nBut i do think we will have to agree to disagree.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-08T00:12:44.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> You mention that they take a long time to do things because they talk to the player base? thats bs, theres what maybe 6 rioters max that ever post on the boards (not including special guests) and none of them are part of the design team. \n\nWhat I said was\n\n> Maybe we wouldn't be witness to those disconnects if the Rioters spent less time communicating with the playerbase, but that's part of what makes them so special as a company.
