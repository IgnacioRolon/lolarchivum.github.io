I wouldnt say i am a beginner at this game as i get the occasional carry game. But i usually find myself with low kills compared to team mates. I was hoping for some advice on poking and knowing when to attack your opponent. I do poke at opposing laners but i always find myself not being able to finish them off either due to lack of strategy of out of mana. Any help i will be grateful for.","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-08T02:34:40.522+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it really depends on who you are playing. which champs are you playing where you are running out of mana? and what lane?","replies":[{"poster":"Leaguepro1998","date":"2015-05-09T07:16:31.913+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i usually play mid and at the moment and  i am trying to learn ryze.
