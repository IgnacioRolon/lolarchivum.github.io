Idk why I should lose LP I feel like I deserve nothing. No LP gain for me. Not lose LP","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-03-05T10:24:14.796+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Your team won yes, but you didn't exactly help them get there. In fact, you were a detriment to them. They didn't win with you, they won despite you. This is true regardless of how long you remain in the game before leaving.\n\nNow don't take that the wrong way. Shit happens, that's a fact of life. That's why you don't get LeaverBuster on your first, second or even third afk. \n\nThat said, when it comes to ranked games, it's still very much not fair to your team. That leave could have easily cost them LP, and while winning every game isn't an expectation, having your whole team present for the whole game is. \n\nWhen you queue up for a ranked game you are committing to that expectation. If it's a once off, that LP loss will mean near nothing in a few games time, whereas leniency lends itself to abuse cases.","replies":[{"poster":"Void Reaver","date":"2019-03-06T08:29:14.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like you are jumping to conclusions. There are many scenarios where a player can force their team into a hugely favorable position to the point where if they leave for a little win is still largely due to their earlier contributions. \n\nAn example could be a jungler who rampaged the early game and got every single one of his lanes massively ahead then had some issue and forcing him to leave. If it wasn't for him his team may not have been ahead therefore even tho he left he made a massive contribution to the win.\n\nIn the long run it wont make any difference if you are not going afk regularly and I dont think there is a fair way for riot to decide contributions while afk. But saying you are 100% a detriment just cause u had to leave is unfair. I know many people who ive carried despite spamming ff15 in chat and flaming/inting all game. They are the real detriment yet riot gives them LP when u carry them. ","replies":[]}]}]}
