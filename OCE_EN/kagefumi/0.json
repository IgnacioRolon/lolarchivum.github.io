(Zyra support)","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*(Long post ahead, TL;DR at bottom)*\r\n\r\nI just finished a normal game as Zyra support and came out of the defeat feeling doubtful about the way I play her as a support. I had gone duo bot lane with a Vayne, who from my previous experience, is quite an aggressive champion, or at least after level 6 anyway. Having laned with several  Vaynes countless of times before this match, I felt that my support (snares and pressuring) would've been somewhat adequate enough for her to farm safely and even secure some kills early game. As someone fairly new to the game, I am probably not too comfortable with overall mechanics and expectations. So, while Vayne was farming, I was hitting all the full HP minions once - not taking her cs, not last hitting, just hitting anything that was at complete health once with auto attack. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, Vayne wasn't too happy about this, telling me to 'stop' and that I wasn't 'helping at all' because I was taking her cs. In no way did I find myself last-hitting any minions at all, but since she stated it, I backed off and ended up not hitting anything while running around as she tried to farm - I came out of the match with a mere 25 CS. As we started to engage (in which I could not poke at all because any skills used would've 'stolen' her cs), I felt that she was playing fairly aggressively as she would constantly tumble up to two enemies while I was still quite a distance behind. To match with this, I started playing more aggressively again, using snares, my Q and seeds to help Vayne secure at kill. At first, Graves (alongside Fiddlesticks who we played against) were running away, but my flower managed to shoot Graves dead somehow. I apologised, of course, seeing as Vayne would probably get mad at me for ksing. She did say it was fine, so I maintained an aggressive playstyle.\r\n\r\nHowever, during a midgame event, Vayne was getting chased down by both Graves and Fiddlesticks with approximately two more shots before she died. I snare the both of them, popping a Q and W just in case Vayne were to get killed before the opponents died as it was pretty clear the both of them still had skills available. Vayne secured a kill while I took another. Evidently, this wasn't going to work for her as she said 'Now that was bad. I could've gotten them, Zyra\", to which once again I apologised and explained that I had no intention to ks and that they would have probably taken her down as they had skills available.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the match (which we lost for various other reasons added up), I stopped being aggressive and played it passive. Even now, I'm still conflicted as to whether or not I should keep playing Zyra as an aggressive support. Was it wrong to assume that with Vayne as an aggressive champion, I should too be able to play as an aggressive support?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Played aggressive Zyra support, auto attacking full hp minions once, ADC says to back off. Couldn't poke/initiate/create opportunities without accidentally 'stealing' cs or ksing. Should I play more passively even though the ADC is a fairly aggressive one?\r\n\r\nSorry about the long post and thanks in advance for any input :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-02T07:03:35.159+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Listen to your AD. If they say don't push then don't push. Your job as a support is to support them, you're the babysitter until they are strong enough to be alone.\n\n2. Some people (and champions) just don't have good synergy and have a hard time laning together. When this is the case, help your AD get a lead or freeze the wave in a good position and go roam.\n\n3. Do people still say \"KS\"? LOL most people don't really care anymore unless its blatanlly obvious like flash auto to get the last hit so you get the double buffs 8)\n\n4. Just because you didn't last hit the minion doesnt mean you didnt fck up the CS. You might have made it so too many minions were low so her auto attacks weren't fast enough to hit them all in time or something along those lines.\n\nZyra is a poke/counter-aggressive support. She pokes with Q and her Plants and her Ult is to prevent people diving on her. You shouldn't be \"fishing\" for snares with her like you do Morgana unless you already previously poked them down and want to go for a kill.\nIf you want an aggressive \"playmaking\" support. Blitzcrank, Thresh and Leona are playmakers. Alistar can be too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-02T03:11:21.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Points coming from someone who considers themself a support main.\n\n1. Your level 20, Vayne doesn't know what a good support should be doing, ignore her, probably giving worthless stuff.\n2. Some ADC's actually don't like the lane pushing, Vayne being a complete late game champ is one of these, not autoing minions is the best call, however a bit of crossfire onto the minions well hitting the enemy, well she can get over that, it's part of your job as a support to zone them away from the CS.\n3. Taking a kill doesn't really matter that much unless your blatantly trying to last hit them, fact is you helped him get the kills, if one of them is gotten by you it really doesn't matter\n4. You shouldn't get any amounts of CS, if anything you get the CS to freeze lane at your tower while vayne is backed.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-02T03:35:02.824+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1: vayne could be lvl 30, or a smurf. you dont know. but yeah, the vayne was just %%%%%ing\n2: no ADCs like the lane being pushed by a support AAing the lane. unless the enemy is not there and you need to reset the wave onto the tower, or push the tower down. really, a support should only attack the minions if the ADC isnt there, and thats only to get the CS/stop the wave pushing into the tower. so again, all accounts of a support using AAs on minions is situational.\n3: true. no such thing as kill stealing. it still gives gold to everyone involved. and it shares gold.\n4: bad dynamic of the game since the end of season 1. 0 CS support is a really bad mechanic. but, thats how people see the game is won easier these days. its not ingrained into the heads of even lvl 5 players. even in bots games low level players expect someone to be 0 CS support...","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-02T04:06:14.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

As a vayne the opponent shouldn't ever let you push the lane, but if they do you get to freefarm to level 6 without any pressure and proceed to win lane effortlessly","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-03T11:48:07.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play mostly Vayne if i'm forced to ADC*.\n\nAnd tbh, i'm not a twat.\n\n*- It's my worst role.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-03T02:47:34.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh, i'd just try and engage with either ult (that's if there's a team fight) or your E.\n\nAs a support main, i don't touch cs unless i have {{item:3302}} with me.\n\nYou are the mother of your team (without the shot calling command)","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-02T03:25:15.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why would you push the lane with AAs? that is essentially ALWAYS a bad idea. if you learn to freeze the lane/let it push onto you, you can stand at an optimal spot to always AA and snare and Q the enemy laners. or just let plants do it from a longer distance.\n\nzyra is a disengage support rather than an aggressive one. she counters aggression. very well infact.\n\nas for the KSing, dont listen to %%%%%%s who say that %%%%. unless you specifically stole a kill on purpose and it was very obvious, nothing is a kill STEAL, its a kill secure.\n\nthe best way to play zyra is to push forward in the early levels, as you can massively poke people under their tower with plants. and get more gold for your frost queens claim. just you need to be wary of ganks. in which case, keep E for if anyone tries to flank you. and ward lots.\nwith vayne, your main priority is to protect her from being engaged on, so again, WWE any attempts on the vayne and you should be fine.  for poking under enemy tower, Q and W just before it expodes up, so they have no chance to step on the seed. the plant should focus a champ and get 1-2 shots off easily before the tower 1 shots it. if you time it correctly just after the turret changes targets, you can usually get a full 2-3 seconds of plant hits, proccing all of your spelltheif procs.\n\nand on the situation with the vayne being chased by graves and fiddle...she is %%%%%%ed, a fiddle fear would have ruined her, especially since its about the same range as her AAs, and a silence would have stopped her from being able to tumble away in her best case scenario.
