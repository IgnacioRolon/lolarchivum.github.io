Not even a task manager?\n\nEither way, if you truly think you need that, then what you should do instead is just close all other applications that you're not using during the time you play League, like Skype, word processors, internet browsers, etc. If you do that, just about all your resources will go to running League anyway.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Falling Leaves","date":"2015-03-28T03:15:07.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's no task manager that i know of... and i do close unnecessary things while i'm on league but i think it would be more helpful to make league a high priority so i dont lag as much since my brother is off in his own world on steam and stuff~~","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-28T06:20:25.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What do you mean by that? Do you and your brother use the same computer at the same time?\n\nIf it's just both of you using the same network, then setting League to a higher priority on your computer will not increase its speed/reduce lag at all. You'll need a way to configure your router or whatever you use to connect to the internet, and each one from each manufacturer works in a different way. Your Mac would not be able to increase the data transfer for solely itself, you'll need to change this from your router, if you have one.\n\nAnd on that note, why do you want to decrease the network speed for your brother?","replies":[{"poster":"Falling Leaves","date":"2015-03-28T08:51:47.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"we're connected to my monitor, and i dont want to increase the data i just want to concentrate it (since it isn't 90-100% on league). and i wouldn't mind decreasing the speed for my brother, he plays more games than i do and doesn't do well in school ^^ he would even pretend he is sick just to play games~~ tbh it would be nice if i could control my downloads while on league, being able to shape would be nice.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-29T04:43:33.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After a quick internet search I found that the Mac equivalent for Window's Task Manager is named Activity Monitor, and it should be in all versions of desktop iOS. You can launch it via Spotlight.\n\nNot too sure of its capabilities concerning prioritisation, though. May want to fiddle around with it a bit, maybe try command clicking stuff.","replies":[{"poster":"Falling Leaves","date":"2015-04-01T11:11:50.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok ty, ill have a look around","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-01T11:32:23.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't actually know where one goes to get new software on their Mac.
