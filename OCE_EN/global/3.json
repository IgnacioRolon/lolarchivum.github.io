I'm looking to gain a larger viewer base and expand my stream over time. I answer all questions in chat and am always happy to help. I'm going to be giving away 2x $10 RP cards to two random followers when I hit 150 followers, and a $25 when I hit 250, and no I'm not streaming for income, I don't want any donations or w/e but if you want to support me and help me on my goal telling your friends about my stream and/or upvote my thread :) would be awesome and most appreciated ^.^\r\n\r\nIf you want a chance at the RP cards, all you have to do is follow my stream and stay followed at the time of when I hit the goals, and I will draw it live to avoid the 'rigged' comments :)\r\n\r\nSo come have a geeze if you want to see some quality solo-queue gameplay and viewer games eventually, and chill music. Thanks :)\r\n\r\nwww.twitch.tv/global_lol\r\n\r\nGracias.","replies":[]}
