It goes to a new level of horrible when you find out that most, if not all, of your team or the opposing team are players using  bots to level up accounts! \n\nI never had this problem this bad on my stint years ago on the NA server, and particularly with ARAM at the moment, it seems to be such a ridiculously common problem. And its not just me. I have had other actual PEOPLE playing who have agreed that a game with actual people is so much more fun (and satisfying), that this silly 'computer' playing. I even had a {{champion:78}} in one ARAM match admit that she was having her 'friend' {{champion:238}} (who I suspect was a bot due to bot player patterns), feed purposely so that she could level up quicker.\n\nIts behavior and things like this that make this game the frustrating place it can be. After a few instances of this strange behaviour, watching summoners run in and just die, I did a google, and found out about the many programs that can be used to hack and abuse the game >.> I mean, google 'League of Legends bot' and they're all there. \n\nIt makes me not want to play, and you really should do something about it, because reporting doesn't seem to do anything. \n\nAs you can see from the picture attached, the summoners particularly being a problem at the moment always have a z on the end of their names, and always have {{summoner:32}} and {{summoner:6}} as summoner spells, and the behavior is very quickly picked up. (The particular instance this screenshot was taken, was one of the first times I suspected there was something going on- you;d have to be stupid not to notice the pattern, and initially I had changed the summoner spells to match my team due to OCD). \n\nPlease do something about it, or at least look more into the issue, because I am almost at my wits end. >.<\n\nThanks for reading, Jess.","replies":[{"poster":"Wam Bam GG Mam","date":"2015-12-23T02:56:39.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My worst experiences are when you're doing bot games and players on your team seem to have randomly generated names, such as Yellow3456. Take this game for example:\n\nhttp://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/116145621/201470132?tab=overview\n\nThey are clearly bots, non-responsive and always heading to the mid lane to feed, as well as letting off their summoner spells at seemingly random times. When multiple people feed like so, it's almost impossible to win against particular bots with hard CC that group together. People often tell me things like \"It's only co-op it doesn't matter\". But it does. Not only is it in the principle, but as a level 30, ranked player, I'd prefer not to lose to Intermediate bots when trying out new champions. I don't want to play OP champions like Darius or Fiora in every co-op game in fear that my team is unresponsive and will feed to the 'enth degree.\n\nJust my two cents on the matter but I'm pretty sure a lot of others would struggle with these \"automatic feeders\" in Co-op as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lawlerga","date":"2015-12-23T01:11:32.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This does seem to be a much much more common problem on OCE than other servers. And I agree with the OP that something needs to be done about it. OCE isn't the most populated of servers so you can wait a lot longer between games compared to NA etc and then to find that the game you are in 60%+ of the other players are bots is just sickening. The grind to 30 which is when you can actually start playing the game properly is a mediocre experience to begin with, having this bots issue actually speaks that there is an issue with the game itself. \n\nThere also doesn't seem to be much point in reporting players as there is no apparent action being taken. \n\nIt would be nice to know if there is something being done about this issue as it is starting to seem that to play and enjoy this game you download the game client, get the third party software and sometime in a month or so you can actually play the game. If you want to sign up and play the game you will probably quit in frustration due to the bot software issues that is plaguing the server.","replies":[]}]}
