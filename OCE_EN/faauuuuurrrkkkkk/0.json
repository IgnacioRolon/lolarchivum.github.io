Now I was thinking of playing a game and this time after a short update once I logged on I got a notification that I had been &quot;permanently banned&quot;. I&#039;m not sure which email address I linked with my account as I made it so long ago so I can&#039;t check an email to see the problem.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t really imagine a reason why I&#039;d be banned other than occasionally leaving games when my internet disconnects or computer stops working. I don&#039;t think I get into too many arguments. \r\n\r\nJust curious to know why I&#039;ve been banned and if there&#039;s anything to rectify my account.\r\n\r\nThanks,","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-09T02:23:42.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support, it was possibly due to the third party banwave recently, which if you haven't been playing, likely means your account was compromised. If you get a response that says you were banned for third party/scripting and you didn't use any such thing or give your account details to anyone for any reason, then submit a new ticket for Account Recovery (make sure you are logged out of the support site to do this) and go through the process there.","replies":[]}]}
