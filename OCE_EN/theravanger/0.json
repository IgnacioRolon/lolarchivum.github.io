Unless you have a physical handicap, why would you be low ELO while having such a high level of understanding?\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, maybe you do have challenger level understanding, but no one is going to take you seriously until you can prove it, which would take time and a high level of trust. And honestly, why would any ambitious players bother to place that trust in you when you're a wild card with no track record?\n\nGood luck with your search anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"TheRavanger","date":"2014-11-28T09:52:58.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Completely fair assumption. And trust me, I am NOT one to complain about elo hello when it doesn't even exist, yet just a term used as an excuse and mental block for players not willing to put in enough time to actually learn.\nThe reason I like to believe that I lack mechanical skill but have a higher understanding as a whole is because I play less than I read about abilities/champs/counters/plays and watch coaching/LCS, OGN, LPL etc. Of course I wouldn't say I have a challenger level knowledge but I believe that I possess enough information for a team/player to get past that mental block to get them higher in ladder. And once again I wouldn't say I have this knowledge or even compare myself to him, but L.i.E.S one of SKT T1's coaches is low gold division, yet their team won due to his teachings and mass knowledge.\n\nOf course, I'm not bound to get hundreds of answers, hell, I'd be happy with one reply. But I have to get my name out there, and this seems like a good enough place to do so.\n\nCheers, man.\n:)","replies":[]}]}]}
