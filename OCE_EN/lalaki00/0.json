This i feel is like total downgrade compared to the normal client and now looks really cheap. I think Riot should return some of the original elements (such as waving banners) of the ranked game lobby screen because it looks better and would actually suit the new interface.","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2016-11-07T00:29:48.703+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OP,\n\nAs the client that you're using is still an ALPHA, there are a lot of things that are still being worked on and not implemented, and that includes visual polish (so animations and details).\n\nI LOVE that type of stuff so just like you, keen beans for it to finally all get in there!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Morrigan","date":"2016-11-06T15:01:08.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"NikitaPoop","date":"2016-11-06T05:27:48.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]}]}
