Games are won or lost on who has more bots on their team, not on actual gameplay.\n\nIt&#039;s fucking pathetic, and bot detection needs to be made a higher priority on Rito&#039;s list.\nThey put all their focus into top level play that is under 1% of the player base, while ignoring the 99% of us who are casual scrubs.\n\nNEWSFLASH: If you neglect the common/casual player, they will quit and the game will die. Pro&#039;s don&#039;t keep the game running, the masses of general public do.\n\nI understand that champion balance must be done in regards to top level play, but where Rito directs their resources needs adjusting.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T00:34:40.628+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is what sucks, I don't get to choose when to play, I'm forced into a window.\nAll because of bots.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-09T00:35:57.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't worry, i also experience this because draft is down after 3am, and i hate blind.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T00:47:11.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1eLL8qEK,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2018-01-09T00:35:57.329+0000)\n>\n> Don&#x27;t worry, i also experience this because draft is down after 3am, and i hate blind.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0bOH8ABpco","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"a grub","date":"2018-01-09T16:15:04.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"https://i.redd.it/5pbjr0hivu501.png\n\nSource is the MMR graph on https://na.whatismymmr.com","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-10T03:03:35.332+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh btw, you also have to take into account Real players who are botting now because leveling is uncapped.\n\nEDIT: And that also doesn't track OCE","replies":[{"poster":"a grub","date":"2018-01-11T16:17:48.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh true, yea i didnt take that into account","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-09T00:21:50.800+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah your window for playing is probably 12 PM-11 PM.\n\nAnd it'd probably be a point where, you may as well turn the queue off because of the bot population when there isn't enough players.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-09T00:27:09.333+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=1eLL8qEK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-01-09T00:21:50.800+0000)\n>\n> Yeah your window for playing is probably 12 PM-11 PM.\n\nWhich timezone?

But also lower population at an off peak time of day means matchmaking gets wider means a bigger MMR bracket is affected.\n\nAlso ARAM isn't exactly the most serious mode, and you'll often get champions you have little or no idea how to play, so winning more isn't exactly something you can just do, even if you make a concerted effort to improve.","replies":[]}]}]}
