I&#039;ll start:\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Received a ward placed for mission 3 of first mission chain, after an ARAM game where there are no wards.\r\n\r\n2) Queue for game. Get champ and set runes and summoners. Wait. No one dodges. &quot;Sorry, we were unable to start your game&quot; or some shit.\r\nNext game starts and completes, I get the same notification at post-game honour screen. WTF?\r\n\r\n3) You introduce all these new features that just don&#039;t work!?!?! Cool skins tab in collection... it doesn&#039;t work!\r\nIt reads 5 chromas for me, when I have about 20? WTF?\r\n\r\nThis is just from a day, for one player.\r\nThink of all the random shit you&#039;ve seen over the last few days, multiply that by the number of players.\r\n\r\nFix LoL Rito, entire pre-season has been buggy as fuck on top of trash changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T01:27:41.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Little dune buggy, in the sand","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-30T03:55:58.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essembie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ipwEwmmY,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-11-28T01:27:41.962+0000)\n>\n> Little dune buggy, in the sand\n\nPotUSA","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2017-11-28T22:46:08.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot must be lazy as shit or paying $10 an hr to kids in chinese sweatshops doing updates.. Cause really, how much money does riot make and how much do they actually do for the game? They're making skins and one new game mode, can't update the other game modes though.. Or the client. Go into  a game, get out of the game and then go back into one, will bug it out till you wait for it to understand wtf it's doing","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-28T22:54:25.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh you mean the new game mode that plays like shit?\n\nThat's blood moon except ADC's, yeah totally original.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2017-11-29T00:02:08.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it's good for a few quick games to smash some of those challenges, but gets stagnant quick. I pretty much don't even bother with any game modes except Urf, Ascension, aram and that thresh hooking one. How hard is it to update those maps, make some champs relevant (like Gp's passive in ascension since there are no minions).. Riot has had years to do this shit, yet really I can't see any improvements.. Maybe one lil thing here and there, but really? The billions riot is making and they can't afford to do anything to the game making them money? I've spent $1500 on this game and that's the end of all they're getting from me","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CritTheClit","date":"2017-11-27T23:18:11.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"upvoted dam bugs are pretty weird wish they would also let some of us have a try helping with client code","replies":[]}]}
