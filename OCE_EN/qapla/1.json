Whichever team has more of this, will have a higher chance of winning. ARAM is a gamble though, both in teammates AND in gameplay. You can't really plan, or do much about it. But there's one thing you can do. \n\nControl both the middle bushes. They're really helpful because the enemy can't see what's in there.\n\nAlso Sion is an instawin (in my experience) on this mode due to his rediculous cc and health. Once you reach level 16, ult into their nexus towers for the rest of the game and watch them call you a tryharder and playing to win. They either block you,(and die) or they let you go and lose the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-12-28T01:30:34.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really depends on which champs your team rolls vs what the enemy has. Certain champs are more 'OP' and suited for ARAM in my opinion. So use that reroll option if you can't play the champ you've been given or try to swap it.","replies":[]}]}
