I will simply AFK.\r\nIs this wrong?\r\n\r\nEvery incident I have had over the last few days has not been started by me.\r\nI ask simple questions that are game related (and intended to be helpful), and get abused repeatedly by the player they were directed at.\r\nI have a carry (building full damage) that is 5/10 abusing me while I am full tank at 6/6.\r\n\r\nI swear Australians are the most hostile people, you don&#039;t see this behaviour from Kiwis very often. Even Yanks are more chill than the Roos.\r\n\r\nI have had at least half a dozen S grades in the last couple of days, while playing on a complete toaster (1GB RAM and no graphics card), I can play this game.\r\nWhat I can&#039;t do, is handle this community.\r\n\r\nI am honour level 5, but if I get a ban for my recent experiences, I&#039;m done with LoL.\r\n\r\nRito please.

Instead of retaliating, and simply making the situation worse with each response, you choose to remove yourself from the situation, and focus on you. That shows a genuine attempt at doing the right thing (at least, the \"better\" of two wrongs), in my opinion. That said, I'd still say that it's *much* better to keep playing and trying to win, in spite of the abuse.\n\nAs for what consequences could come of it, the most likely possibility is that you'll continue to accrue LPQs, as LeaverBuster doesn't typically result in bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-15T13:06:51.439+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"AFAIK LeaverBuster does not and cannot issue actual bans, only LPQs. I pretty much agree with you. If the whole game has gone to shit, everyone is yelling at everyone else, frankly I can't find myself begrudging the AFK. \n\nIf there's still one or two players trying their heart out, AFKing is pretty bm, but it's usually pretty clear if the game is going anywhere or not, and if it's a pretty guaranteed loss, again, not gonna judge too hard.\n\nIf the game is winnable, then I'd say muting and sticking around would be the way to go until it really goes downhill, but all of this applies to normals not ranked.\n\nIn ranked, I'm of the mindset that you should have fully committed to that game, and that if people are being toxic you just need to mute and get on with it. Engaging them isn't going to help, but ditching the other players in a competitive environment really crosses the line in my eyes.\n\nFrom what QAPLA has said, I can't really find fault with the behaviour, I don't believe they play ranked at all.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Canc","date":"2018-10-16T04:46:07.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, but i thought you only play aram?","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-26T00:26:59.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Canc,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=sXqgl6qK,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2018-10-16T04:46:07.513+0000)\n>\n> wait, but i thought you only play aram?\n\nYou think ARAM is an exception to toxicity, bans, and leaverbuster penalties?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-10-26T00:25:18.008+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are carrying (and I mean 2/3rds of the teams kills), started the surrender vote, and multiple teammates are like 0/10 and refusing to surrender, that deserves an AFK. You're too heavy bro, let me get a different game going.\n\nIf someone harasses/abuses me for trying to be helpful, I have no desire to get the 'W' for them.\nExample: I say \"Their whole team is AD, try getting some armour\" (directed at someone who is feeding, and has NO armour). They reply with \"fuck you and your mother\", or some other rubbish, I AFK. I also add them to blocklist.\n\nThe mute system is terrible. I have an extensive block list of players that have had a negative impact on my gaming experience in the past. If I _/mute all_ then it unmutes those on my blocklist while muting everyone else. It also doesn't do pings.\n\nAnyone who pings 'fall back' or whatever on me, while I'm already falling back, on full health, and on the frontline because I'm tank anyway... but wait! They don't ping once, they ping until they can't ping anymore.\nAll pinging should have a few seconds cooldown timer. Ping spam may not be abusive but it sure can be distracting when people act like \"pingtards\" all game.\nCool ping button buddy, did you get that for Christmas?\n\nSo if I want to eliminate negative behaviour effectively in my game, I need to manually mute up to 10 players individually, and then mute up to 5 players for pings...\n\nI don't want to auto-mute everyone, sometimes you get great banter going on.\nI wish there was a way to check/link how many times I've been honoured in the last day or two, to lend credibility to my statements (it's a lot).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mister Xenos","date":"2018-10-16T02:16:18.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The toxic behavior is really starting to put me off, ranked solo seems to be the worst.
