Min required specs to play the game, and I run on lowest settings. I would upgrade it with components from my old PC, but I have this crazy weird high body static thing (I kill digital watches, etc) and I don&#039;t go near the inner workings of a PC, even though I know how.\r\n\r\nStill good enough to get S grades, even when my flatmates cause me to have 250+ ping for an entire game.\r\n\r\nI just want to share with you all, some tips on easy S grades, for your masteries, chests, etc.\r\nI have had a whole bunch of S&#039;s lately, on champs I barely play, and I want to share how to get them.\r\nSupports are so easy to get S grades on in ARAM, just build damage.\r\n\r\nJanna is the easiest champ to get S on in ARAM. Build full AP, keep your deaths low (through your amazing move speed), I manage S grades on Janna around 50% of the time (usually A+ if I don&#039;t).\r\n\r\nSimilar with Nami, build full AP, always buff yourself with E, use W to attack, not healbot your team, get an easy S.\r\n\r\nLulu, now this is funny. Got my Lulu S today. Go AD Lulu. I use a runepage of attack speed with hybrid pen quints. Start sheen and boots, then build BotRK, Runaan&#039;s, and then finish your tri-force. If the game goes longer, get Wits End if you need MR, etc. Attack speed, not AD. Always use your E to shield yourself, your W to polymorph your target, and don&#039;t forget that BotRK active.\r\n\r\nNew Yorick is an easy S, get in before he gets nerfed. I got my S on new Yorick second time I played him.\r\n\r\nSwain. Don&#039;t build RoA, you fucking muppet. Get the hextech thing that builds out of catalyst{{item:3030}} . Also Ryalis, Zhonyas, Abyssal, etc. Don&#039;t go tank in build, with items like {{item:3065}} , get hybrid damage and defense items. Use spell vamp quints if you have them.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but I&#039;m getting bored. Please share your tips on achieving S grades with various champs, so we can all revel in the glory of free stuff. ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-13T13:01:51.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i used to enjoy going full ap{{champion:37}} and everyone who i played against or with that did full ap went really well. you just start snowballing to the point were your q+auto are nearly  1 shotting anyone who isnt a tank then sit back and be like.\nhttps://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NJUDROnWGBY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADg/wQPQCU5QO7g/photo.jpg\n\n{{champion:30}} is my fav aram champ, you literally snowball in at the right time, do some damage, die then ult, boom 1 death for multiple kills and just repeat.\ni remember i got 36 kills one game just by doing this for most of the game.","replies":[]}]}
