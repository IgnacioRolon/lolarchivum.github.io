At this point I have all the skins I'd want for my mains, so anything extra is just kind of a bonus, and the OE value of those reroll skins is so low it's better value to reroll even for a random skin for me.\n\nI understand making the values low for free stuff, but it makes buying chests feel not so great. Perhaps if they put some extra OE in Masterwork chests or something like that I dunno.","replies":[]}]}]}
