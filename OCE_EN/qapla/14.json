One of the statements in the support article seems to indicate that Riot is still working through the information to figure out exactly how all of this will change things (and I quote \"*we’ll have more info soon on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and how we’re changing the way we process your data.*\"), so it may take some time still until we get the full scope of information relating to the changes.\n\nI'd imagine there will be some kind of announcement or notification when they do have more information posted, and even so you *may* be able to find out more sooner by contacting [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). At the very least, you'll be able to find out what information they have stored about you and even request it be removed, so it seems.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-24T04:01:12.945+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine the transparency and accessibility will likely be related to the existing privacy.riotgames.com stuff, or at least be a similar idea. Essentially it sounds like, a whole buncha changes coming to EU and they need to make more data more accessible and figured they should just expand that to everywhere. What specific data we'll be able to see after the change who knows.\n\nWhich I guess you kinda covered but privacy.riotgames used to show more than it does, and I'd be keen to see if stuff gets added to it if only out of interest more than a particular care from them knowing any of it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-28T09:49:04.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen these privacy policy changes on many online things lately, throughout the world.\n\nWhat happened?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-28T12:07:01.953+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To put it simply, the EU has implemented legislation (known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) regarding the privacy and security of internet use, which has changed the way companies are allowed to control and use data, as well as how people have access and control over data that companies have on them. It's something that, at this point, only directly affects the EU, but because of various reasons, companies are simply applying the necessary changes globally. Bottom line, the EU changed something and it's having a \"domino effect\" internationally.","replies":[]}]}]}
