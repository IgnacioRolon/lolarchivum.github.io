I guess you can just start the game by muting everything one by one, but that&#039;s my point. You can do that, but not auto-disable chat in client options menu.\r\nBecause disabling chat would harm teamwork right? That&#039;s been Riot&#039;s reasoning for years.\r\n\r\nI see more abuse in chat, than teamwork related comments. I&#039;m sure many of you see the same.\r\nI have not played a single game in weeks, that hasn&#039;t included some form of abuse from one player to another.\r\n\r\nEven comments (from me) like &quot;they are 5 AD champs, buy some armour&quot; gets a response of &quot;fuck you, you tryhard fuck&quot; or some such (from my own team).\r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;d really like, is an option that auto-mutes everyone, but I can manually un-mute them (for when I queue with friends).\r\n\r\nI&#039;m playing less and less LoL these days (sometimes I only play a couple of times a week, rather than everyday, because it&#039;s just not an enjoyable experience a lot of the time.\r\nIt&#039;s not just people abusing me, I mute and blocklist a lot. But others on my team (that I have muted) abusing someone else on my team (that doesn&#039;t use mute) and tilting them out.\r\nIt ruins the game for everyone.\r\n\r\nAnd all these bans, what % is from toxic chat? Most of it for sure.\r\nChat should be deleted altogether, and you can only chat/mic with people you queued with. Or, you have to (click) accept messages from others.\r\nThe health of the game would improve significantly.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not quitting until I hit my 4k ARAM wins, after that... who knows?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-04-25T07:18:04.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you played CS:GO?","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-24T03:00:34.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay, so a 747 over head means you don't get it, the point is why have ingame options to do that, but not a client side option so it's automated?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-23T09:25:42.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"/mute all ..... only been there since season 2","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-23T20:23:15.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=FJl0Yxfi,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-04-23T09:25:42.765+0000)\n>\n> /mute all ..... only been there since season 2\n\nThe point is a 747 flying over your head.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-04-23T21:17:19.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is no option to just disable chat, you have to wait for the abuse and then manually mute each player for chat/pings/etc separately. \n\n\nIs this not /mute all tho, also I donâ€™t get your metaphor.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-23T20:19:59.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seras, you aren't playing ARAM I guess, which _should_ have _less_ toxic behaviour, as it's a casual mode.\nBut no, it is rife with abuse.

Of those I've played, ESO was probably the least (even in PUGs) and the worst is honestly probably Overwatch. In saying that though, some of that definitely had to do with the baffling pastime of propositioning random internet females over voice chat, and telling them to play support, and not to worry cause they'll definitely carry you, and [insert demeaning bs here] etc etc. Text vs voice and all that.\n\nHonestly I don't experience toxicity in League all that much. At least not that much that stands out. You see tilt a lot, maybe they'll make one rude or shortsighted or asshole-ish comment. But true toxicity is pretty rare in my experience. Out of a few games a day I'll see something noteworthy (i.e not forgotten in less than a minute) maybe once a week at most, though I also only play premade (duo or trio mostly) so my chances are lower by default. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't call League the most toxic game, and I think perception varies a lot by which game you're playing the most (play one game of x and 100 games of y, you're obviously much more likely to encounter toxicity in y). But then I also personally don't see why it's difficult to just...not be an asshole. Like if nothing else, what even is the point?","replies":[]}]}
