You must try toplane, you will learn a lot about farming and about the rift. When I started playing on pre season 3, I did just play at twisted treeline por several years until season 5, and I always played as support for my cousin that teached me the game, but he insisted on me to play on the rift and finally I did.

Does the mission explicitly state that it has to be a \"standard\" or \"normal\" SR match, or does it just state \"SR\"? If it doesn't specify that it has to be \"standard/normal\", then you should be able to complete the missions via ARURF, which is a lot more laid back than normals (and, in my opinion, the single closest featured mode to ARAM). I'd be happy to queue with you for some ARURF (or even normals) if you'd like.\n\nAs for making missions map dependant, there was a section regarding that aspect of missions in the recent [Ask Riot](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2017/08/ask-riot-missions-and-tacos/) post, where they said something like \"queue restricted missions were a noticeably failing trend\", so it may be that they're trying it out with SR queues rather than ARAMs, since that tends to be more popular. Not to mention, the Arcade Accents may have played a part in them wanting to \"push\" players towards SR based modes.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-11T08:44:36.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It definitely seems to be no specific queue, as long as it's on an SR map, so URF included.
