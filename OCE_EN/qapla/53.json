The team is all ruffled and talking about someone on the team being a dick,  then I realise I HAVE THEM BLOCKED ALREADY. They cause the whole team strife on a regular basis.\r\nI don&#039;t want to be teamed up with players I already have issues with, put them on the opposing team for sure, but don&#039;t team me up with players I have blocked because they are salty, abusive children.\r\n\r\nNow, I&#039;m not saying I&#039;m always &#039;nice&#039;, but I never start it. I don&#039;t abuse players on my team that are failing, I offer advice. I only ever abuse (on rare occasions), in response to abuse.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s funny, I tend to notice that whenever I&#039;m teamed with someone already on my blocklist, they cause troubles within our team. I don&#039;t notice due to them being blocked already, but it&#039;s the same salty, negative douchbags that I already have blocked, that piss off the other teammates. Report system seems inconsequential, dicks will be dicks all the time without punishment.","replies":[]}
