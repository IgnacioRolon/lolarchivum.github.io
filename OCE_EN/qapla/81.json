If I want to farm, I&#039;ll go play Path of Exile or Diablo.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m so sick of ward skins from hextech chests, when I can&#039;t place wards in ARAM. Instant disenchant  into OE (such a pitiful amount too).\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t care about missions I can&#039;t complete in ARAM (dragon/wards/etc), I play games for fun, not as a chore.\r\nRewards aren&#039;t going to make me play what I don&#039;t find fun.\r\n\r\nI did open a chest to get Pulsefire {{champion:81}} skin (not shard) today, so that&#039;s kinda cool (not that I play Ez), but this is about the first positive thing I can say about the game in a long time, and all it was... is luck.","replies":[]}
