Not a rework, a total replacement.\nWhy not keep old Swain and add this new Swain as a new champion? Galio was the same, only the Q was similar, but even that changed.\nStop being lazy Riot, make these new champs, stop removing all my favourites from the game.\n\nI think I&#039;m done with buying RP, everything Riot has done in the past year is bad.\nI&#039;m playing less and less, often I just play for FWotD, then logout, but even that was busted for a couple of days.\n\nAs far as gaming goes, I&#039;m rocking oldskool atm, Diablo II (with Median mod). It&#039;s a far more enjoyable experience than the current state of LoL.\n\nOh, and as far as Lunar missions go, I get 26 tokens from quests achievable in ARAM, which doesn&#039;t get me shit.\nI hear there are 96 tokens available for free, but only 26 for ARAM only players such as me.\n\nIf I could just get 44 for something actually worth redeeming, is all I want, the other 52 are whatever.\nBut no, Riot has to enforce the one game mode, which denies them any further profits from a long time player like myself (since season 2).\n\nOver 7k ARAM&#039;s played, and pretty close to uninstalling unless the game shows some improvement soon.\n\nDo Rito think they are the only f2p MOBA on the internet?\nI know a big part of this is being bought out, but that&#039;s no excuse.\nShort term monetary gains through exploitation will never exceed long term revenue through a sustainable service/product.\n\nBut you can&#039;t teach that shit to people who only want the quick buck.\nEconomics is simple if you only have half a brain.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-13T03:33:54.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was going to do this too, but then I realised I'm not poor and I don't care whether I buy RP or not.\n\nDaddy gives me his credit card xx","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-12T17:58:14.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, fuck the blue essence rates.
