So many people just use it to troll their own teammates.\r\n\r\nI tell them to just not ult me (because they can&#039;t do it right), but they keep fucking up my game.\r\n\r\nI will now insta-afk every game that a Kalista binds me without asking, and I&#039;ll get punished for it.\r\n\r\nRito plz.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-05-14T08:38:21.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe they know you.

Would be nice if people took an approach a bit more like that, but that doesn't mean Riot couldn't implement a \"simple\" feature that allows players to \"decline\" the bind on their own (such as walking away), as that would help address the base issue.\n\nBut yeh, I find that most people who end up with Kalista simple don't care whether someone else wants to bind or not, and they pretty much just ult when they can and not when they should.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-15T21:09:28.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4AUeklUq,comment-id=000300000000,timestamp=2018-05-15T03:42:05.413+0000)\n>\n> Honestly, whenever I *do* get Kalista, I *always* ask who wants to bind first.
