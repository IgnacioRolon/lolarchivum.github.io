Of which, you were given pretty explicit reasons as to why your posts were removed. You can access these notifications in the notification panel, next to the My Updates panel in the top toolbar. \n\nJust for good measure, though, I'll take this post as an opportunity to remind you that harassing and blatantly disrespecting other players on the Boards is not allowed, and if you continue with this behaviour, we'll have to escalate your punishments with Boards suspensions. Telling people to \"eat [your] dick\" and throwing out insults to people you encounter is probably one of the least effective ways to get your point across. \n\nWith that being said, if you'd like to continue this discussion on Boards Moderation, I'd like to direct you to the [**Player Behaviour**](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour) sub-board and I'll be more than happy to address any questions, comments, or concerns that you may have.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-21T06:49:03.133+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"op in a nutshell\n\nhttp://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eHwWVpe_Vd4/UFM0TmrNMoI/AAAAAAAAC6M/CBOhHh6Snxg/s1600/trollface-dancing.gif\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-21T07:13:23.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-21T07:20:13.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0IpBH3I1NDM/VFF1SzAr21I/AAAAAAAAgAk/ZOqC80vTV64/s1600/My%2Bfriies%2BCould%2Buse%2Byour%2Bsalt.jpg","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-21T06:51:26.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Cheesyleeks is the biggest troll on these forums, why is he/she not banned?","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-09-21T06:53:40.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"proof?\n\notherwise\n\nhttp://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/throne_of_lies_elf.gif\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-09-21T07:14:06.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"this guy cant even meme, that should be bannable enough","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-21T06:21:08.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just delete this, like you do everything else that shines a bad light upon you.","replies":[]}]}
