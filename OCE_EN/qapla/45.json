Her (stage)name is Dr Mikannibal.\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re gonna skin a metal guitarist into a game, pick someone like:\r\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/65/92/e8/6592e8e61ce78acbbb57706f6a9b2796.jpg\r\nKerry King of Slayer, or\r\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/654796845688815616/TlhvpJKn.jpg\r\nDimebag himself. \r\n\r\nThe whole concept of Pentakill is flawed... manufactured music is for pop, that&#039;s why it turned out terrible when you tried to manufacture metal.\r\nThe only people who like it, are people that aren&#039;t actual metal fans.\r\n\r\nI wrote a song for the music contest you had a while ago (never submitted because I have no recording gear). My &quot;Howling Abyss&quot; will have children running in fear to their mothers and keep them from sleeping at night. Not pop-metal trash.\r\n\r\nNow here&#039;s two songs for your Pentakill Kayle skin to listen to.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6_zsJ8KPP0\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M2163dgfPc\r\n\r\nPeace out and rock on.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-10-26T08:22:25.778+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, consider the audience the skins were made for. \nThey weren't made for diehard heavy metal enthusiasts.\nThey were made for the average 12-15 year old who wants to feel edgy and cool while playing one of the nerdiest games on earth.\n\nI think any true die hard metal fan who thoroughly embraces the the hard rock way of life, probably won't be spending their Friday nights sitting in a bush with bunch of 12 year olds, playing Sona in a nerdy ass computer game. So they are hardly the demographic Riot will be aiming for.\n\nReal heavy metal fans, are probably out there head-banging at concerts, rather than critiquing a pixel band created to sell micro-transactions in a MOBA.\n\n_____________________\n\nIts like sushi, everyone loves Japanese Teriyaki Chicken sushi, except for the _Japanese_ of course who haven't got fucking a clue what Teriyaki chicken sushi is.\n\nThat doesn't make Teriyaki chicken sushi any less tasty.\nThe west has taken a popular concept and adjusted that for the targeted consumers.\nSushi chains wouldn't last long in America or Aussie if they only sold raw shellfish and fish eggs on rice, etc. Yet that is what 'true' sushi is.\n\nPentakill isn't trying to be 'true' or 'pure' or _whatever_ kind of metal, it's trying to make a sound that appeals to the majority of players, while selling them the theme of a rock band. No one ever stated it was supposed to be die hard metal. And no one ever said it had to be historically accurate either.\n\nPyke and Rengar perform the Haka as their dance, and neither of them have anything at all to do with NZ, Maori or Rugby, does that make them a disgrace? No, it makes them have a neat head nod to something most countries see as cool.\n\nYorick has Slash's hat, so what? it's a head nod to a good musician.\n\nIt's a fictional band ffs.","replies":[]}]}
