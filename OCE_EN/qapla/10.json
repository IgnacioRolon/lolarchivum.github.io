It should be no problem for Riot to add this information both into the client and onto the website, considering a lot of it is already available *in-game* (which is usually when you have the *least* time to figure stuff out). Only part I'd disagree with is \"have it done in an hour or two\", but honestly I think everyone can agree that it would be well worth the time and effort if it took a week or so for several people to add this stuff.\n\nClarity should always be an important part of the game, especially considering it's coming up on *150* different champions, with all kinds of mechanics and abilities, and now even having a \"chameleon\" among them. Knowing that there's several 3rd party websites that provides so much more on a single page than everything (collectively) presented by Riot is just ridiculous, and needs to change.\n\n*Personally*, I'd also like to have that information available in champ select, for the currently selected champion. As someone who prefers ARAM (from among the \"full-time\" queues), it's *extremely* annoying and inconvenient to have to try and \"cram\" ability information during the time it takes for my champ to get from fountain to the outer-most turret on HA (which really isn't much time at all), and having that information view-able in champ select would help immensely in that respect (especially for champs I rarely play and/or aren't familiar with).","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-26T07:31:14.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HeartVine,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=BhEOit3d,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-24T10:40:39.308+0000)\n>\n> As someone who prefers ARAM\n\nI just used this in a previous reply in another thread (to someone who couldn't hold an account for more than 3 months without it getting banned), but it works here too.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3WdaODe#XDpOKQ5\nIt won't be long before my ARAM game count is \"over 9000!\" (that's since OCE existed btw, I actually don't play as much as many others).\n\n\nAnd to everything else said in this thread...\nI'm so glad this started a truly constructive discussion.

Where is the clarity if we don't have access to the information about the champs?\n\nAlso, the accuracy of the descriptions needs to be looked at, there needs to be some standardisation.\n\nLike, what is the difference between an immobilisation and a root? Is there a difference? why are some abilities labeled as 'immobilises' others as roots? Are they the same thing as a snare?\n\nIn Morgana's in client ability description on her profile her Q is described as _\"Forcing enemy units to the ground\"_ What does that even mean? Should that affect flying champs but not walking champs? There is no mention of 'snare' or 'root' or anything, that's the only description it gives.\n\nVeigar's stun tent is described in client as nothing more than a stun. Completely missing out the fact that it stops dashes, _(which, ya'know is only a **SLIGHTLY IMPORTANT** piece of information.)_\n\nZac's old ult was described as a knock-up _(even in the in-game tooltip)_, when in fact the ability actually knocked you _back_, I brought this up with a Rioter, and their response was along the lines of _\"Ehhhh it's close enough.\"_ No. No it's not, it affects the situation completely differently. For the sake of changing one word, why allow such inaccuracy to remain?\n\nJust recently, in the latest patch, they stated Lissandra's new passive as \"When an **_enemy_** dies near lissandra\".

Root is the official term, Snare is _usually_ used in flavour text only and immobilise is a hold over on some older champs as far as I know.\n\nI believe Morgana's Q used to (maybe still does?) have the 'Knockdown' effect (Poppy being the most clear example, it's the dash cancel), hence the odd description. This is the same effect present on Veigar's E that isn't listed. It seems to be listed on other champions with the effect (like Jinx) so not sure why Veigar missed out.\n\nEverything I'd read for Liss specifies champion, the wiki, client and website all agree. The only place I found that 'champion' was missing was in the patch notes, which I agree is an oversight, but also isn't a long term source of info.\n\n___\n\nBlinds and Disarms aren't the same, hence the different terms. Blinds cause basic attacks to miss, Disarms prevent basic attacks entirely.\n\n{{champion:39}} {{champion:145}}{{champion:85}}\nDisarms are typically a component of a greater CC, hence why we don't see the term very often, Irelia being the only obvious example (Kai'sa and Kennen self disarm in their E and R respectively).\n\n{{champion:32}}  \nEntangle (mummy ult) is Root + Disarm. \n\n{{champion:266}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:117}}\nPacify which is typically self inflicted during charge ups or state changes is Silence + Disarm , examples being Aatrox, Varus and Xerath , but it is also a component of Polymorph.\n\n Some notable differences are in {{champion:236}} R and {{item:3075}} . \n\n* Luci ult will miss if he is blinded, but will cancel if disarmed. \n* Thornmail calculates its damage before damage reduction (which includes misses), so Thornmail will still hit a blinded target, but not a disarmed one.\n\nI believe there is also a difference with Voli Q. His Q damage is prevented by blind but not the effect, I believe disarm prevents both since you can't attack at all.

Why not just make Teemo's blind a disarm, or Irelia's disarm a blind?\nIt's just confusing, and to my eye; unnecessary.\nUnless the entire counterplay of blinding champs hinges around thornmail, I don't see the point of them being different.\n\nAnother example of things being almost the same but treated differently are abilities like Xearth's Q and Lux's R. Why does Xerath's Q have clear hitbox indicators, while Lux's R doesn't.\n\nWhy can Anivia re-activate her Q as soon as it leaves her body, but Aurelion Sol can't.\nThe distinction needs to be either clearly explained, or removed.\n\nThere needs to be some standardisation.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-25T08:14:04.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the same reason stuns and knockups are different. Stuns and knockups are functionally more similar than blinds and disarms, but visually for some abilities knockup makes more sense than stun or visa versa. In the same way that a blind wouldn't really make much sense with the feel of the Irelia ult, a disarm seems a strange choice for a poison dart.\n\nIt's also more than likely that's it's a future proofing mechanism. Having that distinction in place and having players familiar with it opens the door for Riot to develop more creative abilities from it, and/or to use it as a component in more encompassing forms of CC. In other words, building a foundation.\n\nHitbox indicators depend largely on counterplay. Lux's laser is pretty obvious, and pretty ubiquitous, so a full indicator isn't really necessary, you hear the sound and see the death line and you gtfo, however something like Illaoi Q for example, isn't clear from the start of the windup which direction it's going (only indicated by what direction her model is facing) hence the full indicator. The same is true for Xerath. Until he actually fires his Q the direction isn't clear, however Lux's is from the moment she starts the windup.\n\nVisually it's nicer not to have indicators, so indicators are used only when the information is necessary to understand the ability, be that direction, range etc. An indicator isn't going to help you with a Blitz hook, you know which direction it's going from the moment the ability is fired, so it's irrelevant information, but a Nami bubble travels in an arc and can go pretty much anywhere from her character so the indicator is necessary information.\n\nAnivia vs Aurelion Sol, simply because it's a distinction in their kit. Aurelion's influence lies in his stars, his inherent weakness to offset his heavy sustained damage and strong zone potential is that once an enemy is past that barrier of influence he is vulnerable. \n\nAnivia on the other hand has an inherently defensive kit, with all her tools being designed to control and area and keep enemies off her, she doesn't have the capacity to chase that Aurelion Sol does (E + R), she trades it off for increased defensive capabilities (Q proc + W).\n\nI agree that Aurelion isn't in the best spot balance wise at the moment (high skill cap champions are always going to be shaky there) but that's just champion design. \n\nIf were to standardise every similar ability champions would lose all their character. Would you really want Lux, Zyra and Morg snares to all be the same? It would break those champions, they would need complete redesigns to make them work again, and it would make the point of picking one over the other sort of nonexistent.

Unlike stuns which allow the continuation of the dash and then stun after for the remaining duration _(note that the dash time is included in the duration of the stun)_.\n\nKnockups _(or more specifically the knock-back variety)_, are movement displacing which means they interact with various champion abilities such as Taliyah's rocks or Poppy's W\n\nKnockups also are entirely integral to a certain somebody's kit. It'd be absolutely fucked if Yasuo could ult off regular stuns, so the distinction between the two is very important.\n\nSo far the only difference between blinds and disarms is that thornmail still works with one of them and not with the other.

Anivia's does damage even while flying, and Sol's grows bigger the longer it travels.\nBut the way the abilities are cast and reactived should follow the same logic.\n\nTake skill shots for example, they either hit all targets they fly through, only hit the first one, or travel through multiple targets but only hit champs.
