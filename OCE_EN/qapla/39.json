In my opinion, all champ being free to play in ARAM is the *best* option, because it eliminates the possibility of \"ARAM accounts\" which only own the champs that are best for the mode (for example, Ziggs, Xerath, Lux etc) and gives players ample opportunity to play champions they might ignore under normal circumstances.\n\nEarlier today I ended up with Jhin and was pretty unhappy with that, However, when I was actually playing I came to find that I quite like Jhin and made the decision that he would be my next champion purchase.\n\nJust as a note (and not really touching on the fact that dodging is breaking the rules), dodging games because you didn't get the champion you wanted in ARAM is contradictory to the mode. It's *supposed* to be randomised, so what's the point if everyone just gets champions they want all the time?","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-30T09:32:59.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wanted to say this but I wasn't sure whether people would agree with me, aram only accounts and aram dodgers ruin aram.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-01-31T02:00:42.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, I seldom dodge, normally.\nBut  I'm often matched with plats, diamonds or higher.\nI'm not going to play Lee Sin for the first time vs that level of competition, it would not be fair on my team.\n\nAnd I may play ARAM only, but I own about 90 champs, not just those that are best in ARAM. My new champion purchases are dictated by hextech crafting, get a free skin, buy the champ. It's not abusing the system at all.\n\nAll I'm saying, is that reroll points should match the champions available, as was the way before Ocean Week.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-30T10:00:15.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> he First Boss \"Reward\" Is Actually A Handicap To Me \n\nhttps://daughterbydesign.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/world-doesnt-revolve-around-you.jpg","replies":[]}]}
