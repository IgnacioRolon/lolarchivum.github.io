Most kills on team, and most assists overall.\r\nBut I feel it was the CS that earned me the S grade, which seems bullshit.\r\n\r\nWhy can I not get S when I carry hard with a non CS champ, but I can get S for an average performance with an ADC that CS&#039;s well.\r\nRito plz, ARAM needs separate grading balance from summoners rift.\r\n\r\nYes,** I am **bitching about getting an easy chest, so sue me.","replies":[]}
