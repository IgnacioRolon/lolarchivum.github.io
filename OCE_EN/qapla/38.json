End of S2, sometime early S3? I honestly don&#039;t remember.\r\n\r\nNow the whole system seems to be geared towards being able to 100-0 an opponent (in under a second), with little to no chance of escaping it.\r\nIt&#039;s funny how what was deemed as &#039;unhealthy for the game&#039; that many years ago, is now the standard.\r\nIt just shows how retarded (as opposed to advanced, nothing to do with mental health), the game currently is.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember how they removed Force of Nature item, because the regen was deemed OP, and years later they make Warmogs do the same thing 10x better?\r\n\r\nShare your own &#039;remember when&#039; ironies.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-12-04T12:37:15.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"at least ardent meta is over. You have to admit that was cancer, I got forced to bench my nautilus, alistair and zilean support, in lieu of janna, sure she had a 70+% winrate but it wasn't exciting at all, sit in lane with gold/s runes, really intensive gameplay there. If you didn't pick an ardent support, no matter how well you did, you'd always be outscaled by an item.\n\nI miss when shield supports built full damage though, and when roaming as a support was meta. Ganking midlane at lvl3-4 after your adc took a bad/good trade and backed, and watching a yasou main tilt hard enough to change the seasons, was very fulfilling. \nI miss when mikaels crucible was a good item, I miss smite buffs.\nI miss when a random offmeta pick didn't just mean you were putting your team behind (I swear it feels like champion pick diversity has been slowly declining).\nI miss when champions had semi-viable dumb builds like ap kogmaw, ad maokai, jungle teemo, movespeed/crit rammus, ap sej, lightning shen, ap zac, tank jungle karthus, tank locket shaco, ap varus, ap sivir, ap yorrick, jungle alistair, onhit crit nunu, to name just a few.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-04T04:34:20.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember when assassins didn't have lethality?\nLiterally their whole purpose is to kill champs who build damage _(e.g. not building armour)_, Riot: _\"Bro, what if they could kill tanks too? hashtagbalanced!\"_\n\n____________\n\nRemember when AP champs were allowed 'lifesteal' too?\n\n____________\n\nRemember when Jarvan was a tank?\n\n\n____________\n\nRemember when tanks couldn't 1 hit you?\n\n__________\n\nRemember when Lee Sin wasn't strong....\n\nOh wait.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-04T04:36:25.826+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember when the % pen wasn't so fucking good that tanks become useless after 30 minutes?\n\nI sure as hell do, because i like playing ornn and always have games that go over 30 minutes :( {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-12-04T07:06:37.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^\n\nIt's especially heartbreaking seeming Ornn's passive gives your team a big gold advantage in late game. the problem is, if you make it to late game, you pretty much make yourself redundant.\n\nLike really, in the current meta, there is actually no point playing Ornn or Naut or Rammus when you can just play Shyv or Rhaast or Darius, and be 85% as tanky, but have 400% more damage.\n\nBecause resistances don't counter damage anymore, the only counter to damage, \nis **more damage!**\n\nSo much fun....\nWhat's even the point aye?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-12-04T05:30:39.515+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Member when Valor was melee, and you actually had to think about when to use Quinn's ult, rather than just use it whenever you need to travel?\n\nI member.\n\nGood times.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-05T02:52:46.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You all (or mostly) missed the point...\n\nThis was about ironies, things that LoL _unmade_ in the past, only to _remake_ stronger in the future.\n\nThanks for trying though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-04T01:36:57.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember when they removed Oracles Extract and Mana potions from the game?","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2017-12-04T04:53:10.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"remember when they removed revive?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2017-12-04T02:23:32.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea I remember.
