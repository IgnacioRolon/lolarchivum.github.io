Each time it occurred about 15-20 seconds into the game.\r\nIt wasn&#039;t a bugsplat, it completely froze my whole PC, so I couldn&#039;t even manually (via OS) shut down the program. Hard resets via power button and such were required. Each time it took several minutes for me to try and get the crashed game to close, and then end up restarting PC and client before getting back into the game.\r\nThen the client freaked out after the 3rd game it happened in, and reverted patches, only to update them again.\r\n\r\nJust now, I dodged a queue with time on the clock, but when I restarted client to check the timer, the game was in progress but I have a message saying I &quot;have been removed from the party&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis better not count towards leaverbuster penalties, because I have no control over buggy patches that clearly weren&#039;t tested before implementation.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-18T21:55:00.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah Seras, integrated is 'no GPU', it just takes a chunk of normal RAM and uses it for gfx processing.\n\nI have not had this issue recently, so I guess it has been fixed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-19T08:33:54.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha all I can say is tech *really* isn't my area, I only know what i've picked up from answering threads and from experience so I'm more than happy to concede on that one.

It never happens late game, only at the start. All I can do is ctrl-alt-delete to bring up task manager, then go to processes (because closing application won't work), and kill it from there.\nIt freezes my whole PC.\n\nIt's the last patch, why do you never test anything properly before implementing it?","replies":[]}]}
