You don&#039;t just say Q: gains 1 million AD _/Dr Evil pinky to mouth_, that&#039;s not design. Numerical values are determined and balanced through testing, which is where most player created characters fall short. They create champs based primarily on stat boosts, and give them ridiculously high numbers. Design is a more subtle thing, create a champ for a role, create abilities that fit that role, and keep to a theme. Numbers come later and are easily adjusted.\n\n\nThe concept is a mental asylum patient.\nHe wears a straitjacket, and attacks with kicks and headbutts.\nHe is an AD/tank based champ suited to top or jungle roles.\n\n**Passive: Ward of the State/Paranoia.**\nInmate XVIII cannot gain vision from wards. Instead he gains vision (in brush and across walls) based on a % of his vision range, increasing by level.\n\n_I&#039;m not sure if this fits into the coding of the game, but I guess that seeing as enemy wards don&#039;t grant you vision, it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to implement given existing framework. Obviously team communication would overcome this, but that&#039;s a positive thing, right? _\n\n**Q: Schizophrenia.**\nPassive: Every 10/9/8/7/6 seconds (or w/e), Inmate XVIII&#039;s next basic attack adds a status effect of fear/stun/taunt/silence at random.\nActive: Inmate XVIII&#039;s next basic attack leaps to the target, dealing bonus (physical) damage.\n\n_I think I worded it right, that the passive is not effected by CDR. The leap range should be less than Jax&#039;s Q, but more than Illaoi&#039;s W. The bonus damage doesn&#039;t have to be flat or scaling, or even %, etc. Perhaps something interesting like %crit damage. It would apply the passive effect if it was available, and reset the timer. I know Riot don&#039;t like &quot;randomised&quot; effects (see removal of dodge from ninja tabi&#039;s), but I think this could work._\n\n**W: Medication Time.**\nOver the next _X_ seconds, Inmate XVIII heals for_ a/b/c/d/e_ health (_+x%_ of bonus AD) and restores _a/b/c/d/e_ mana (_+y%_ of AP).\nDuring this time, Inmate XVIII deals and receives _X%_ less damage.\n\n_It&#039;s a sustain ability, but makes you deal and receive less damage during it, as is thematically sound for medication._\n\n**E: Solitary Confinement/Lunacy**\nIf there is an allied champion within _a/b/c/d/e_ range (decreasing with level) Lunacy is active. Otherwise Solitary Confinement is active.\nSolitary Confinement: Lets out a scream in a cone, applying Schizophrenia&#039;s passive if it is available (does not reset the timer). Deals _a/b/c/d/e_ magic damage (_+x%_  of AP).\nLunacy: Incites riotous behaviour in all nearby champions, dealing _a/b/c/d/e_ (_+x%_ bonusAD) physical damage to enemies (in a circular AoE), and increases all nearby champions attack and movement speed (allied **and** enemy) by _a/b/c/d/e%_ for _x_ seconds.\n\n_The solitary confinement range should be like Warwicks E, but in reverse scaling._\n\n**R: Spiraling Descent Into Madness**\nChannels for 2 seconds, gaining a charge for each enemy champion within _x_ radius, then damages enemies in an AoE equal to _a/b/c_ damage (_+x%_ of bonus AD, _+y%_ of AP). Inmate XVIII frees his arms from the straitjacket and for the next _x_ seconds, Inmate XVIII&#039;s attacks gain AoE (similar to tiamat effect), _+x/y/z_ AD and _+a/b/c_ attack speed.\n\n_The ult channel includes all enemies within the radius at any point, if they exit the radius is not important. The charges increase the effects of the initial damage as well as the buff._\n\n\nSo this is my constructive contribution to player creations, I could add a thousand more if I cared to.
