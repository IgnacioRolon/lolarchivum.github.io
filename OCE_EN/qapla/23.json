And I understand why.\r\n\r\nGreat job 10cent, take the best game and run it into the ground to try and gain profit.\r\n\r\nYou&#039;re cool. Two Fonzy thumbs up.

Posts used to get like 200 views, but 25 comments. Now most posts break 1k views but have 0 comments.\n\nThere used to be the 'regulars' that came to the boards all the time and participated in lots of the conversations, as well as a lot of people who participated in a few conversations every now and then, but not often enough to be recognised personalities, and together the community wasn't large but it was certainly lively.\n\nNow the majority of posts are ban appeal pleas, and everyone knows those are dead-end posts to begin with. The regulars have given up, and everyone else comes to the boards just to check announcements.\n\nI haven't had a good rumble with Talon12 for months... what is this? xD\n\n**I think you're right, season 8 has killed everyone's excitement in the game.**\n\nFor one thing, nothing stays the same long enough anymore for anyone to have an opinion on it anyway.\nIt used to be that a single champ got a slight stat change, and we would have a 50 comment long thread on it that'd stick around for weeks.\nNow something massive gets changed _(like an entire time pool)_ and everyone just thinks _\"Eughh thats a bit shit, but nvm, ill just wait for them to rework it again next month.\"_\n\nI honestly don't know why they see the need to change the game so much so quickly now.\nAnd when they do change things, they never address the problem directly, _\"Some ADC's are too strong? Better rework the entire item-pool instead of clipping a few wings here and there.\"_, \"What? Some mages were pokey in lane? What's that? Re-work the entire mana system? Good idea Jeff!\".\n\nLike I understand they don't want to play whack-a-mole with problem champs. But their attitude atm seems to be _'when one mole pops up, ignore it and use the hammer to smash in and dent all the other holes so no more moles can pop up.'_.\n\nSeason 8 isn't as bad to play in as the tank meta, but it's killing the game much more effectively.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-05-15T01:15:47.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"personally I thought the issue with tank meta was a combination of courage of the broken and the fact that tank item gold efficiency was too high, as well as some particularly overtuned abusers. The meta was actually kind of interesting... for about 2 weeks, but the issue was the tank meta lasted waaayyy longer.\n\nThere are definitely too many changes to discuss at the moment, but alot of us are also burdened by university workloads and jobs and such. League's community is getting older, with more responsibilities, and less time rich youths to maintain a baseline level of activity here.\n\nI haven't been on the boards much for a while, and that's not due to lack of love for this community, as flawed as we are, but uni's been taking priority, in the same way I'd imagine is the case for many others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2018-05-15T16:36:46.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly post on NA boards and Reddit honestly.\n\nThe problem with non NA boards is that there's practically no reason to go there unless it's a region specific topic or you don't speak English","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-05-14T22:56:20.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes dead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-05-14T20:23:55.803+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyone I know who plays (or used to play) League is over 30.\n\nKids play CoD and stuff like that. Mostly on XBox/Playstation. PC gaming is generally for the older gamers in my experience.\n\nAnd as for the state of the game, does anyone bother with item sets anymore? I gave up because items get re-worked too frequently to make them worthwhile. Remember when Morellonomicon was worth buying? Remember when it was called Necronomicon? Damn that item has changed so many times.\nKlaatu barada nikto!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-14T12:41:37.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunno about season 8 but the last few days have definitely been slow.
