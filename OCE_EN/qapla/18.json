So far as I know the reason for not getting tokens in ARAM (or any other gamemode) is that SR is the primary gamemode, and the skillset you'd need with a champion to be considered 'good' for your rank is going to be way different from SR to ARAM (ARAM is more about mechanics, SR is about a bit of everything).
