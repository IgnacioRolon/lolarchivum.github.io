Also i don't think riot really want people to only play aram, otherwise the game wold be balanced around that instead.\n\nAs for the shop, in 3 years I'd never seen anything i wanted, but this time i bought 4 skins. Luck of the draw buddy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-10-02T21:37:27.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for delayed reply, I don't get on these forums much.\n\nI get that these missions are to celebrate worlds, that isn't the issue.\n\nIt's just becoming a habit of Riot's to exclude ARAM from missions/events.\n\nI know many of you think I'm a 'special snowflake' as an ARAM only player, but you'd be surprised at how many players either main, or _only_ play ARAM.\nSeriously.\n\nI just don't like the whole 'farm for first half of game' mentality. Team fights are the best part of LoL (IMO), and that's ARAM start to finish.\nIf I want to farm I'll play a game like Path of Exile (in which I had a max roll legacy Shav's. Found back in beta, not bought).","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-02T23:27:27.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an ARAM player myself, I understand your concerns, even share them to an extent. I'm sure there are plenty of TT players out there thinking the same thing, even RGMQ players (I'm sure they exist, somewhere). I am hoping (perhaps against my better judgement) that Riot isn't going to be throwing out SR exclusive missions every time, that they'll be keeping them in the wings for when it makes sense, like with Worlds. Hopefully Riot aren't going to just throw away half the community (and I'm fairly certain it's close to half) just because of how they've chosen to restrict missions.\n\nThat said, missions is still a largely new feature, it hasn't had much opportunity for growth. We'll probably be seeing a lot more concepts with missions that many players don't agree with for the next few iterations, at least. Hopefully the numbers will support that consistently restricting missions to any single map/mode doesn't work, forcing Riot to be more flexible.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-09-24T08:34:36.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to agree with Peppsy on this one. These missions are to celebrate worlds, worlds is played on SR, so it makes sense that these missions would be restricted to SR (at least, for the most part). If you're really interested in the missions system, go find some like minded players to work towards them with. Use the Team Recruitment sub-board, jump on one of the community discord servers, check on the LoL sub-reddit if you really want to.\n\nWhen it comes right down to it, worlds is a different situation to the arcade event. I understand why Riot went with SR exclusive missions there, though I didn't necessarily agree with that. One reason was that they were trying out how SR exclusive missions would be received, another being that the arcade accents were exclusive to SR and Riot probably wanted the player-base to see all the work they had put into it. Don't try to compare these worlds missions to the arcade missions, it doesn't work.","replies":[]},{"poster":"MÄ± Ke","date":"2017-09-24T07:49:47.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only possible missions being able to work on Howling Abyss are Kills/Assists within a certain minute and winning with a specific amount of gold each team\nThat is so boring.
