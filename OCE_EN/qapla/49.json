Now it is rarely seen.\r\nIt has been replaced by {{item:3285}} as the staple AP item.\r\nItems and builds should be more situational (depending on team compositions), rather than just &quot;this is what you buy, in this order&quot;.\r\n\r\n{{item:3083}}  is an item that has been in and out of ARAM (it was removed for a while, and has changed as well), and needs to be modified in order to be balanced for this game mode. The regen per second, or time delay before it kicks in, needs to change.\r\nI would suggest either half the regen rate, or twice the delay.\r\n\r\nThis is just a start, I would like to hear from other ARAM players about what they think about certain items, and how they aren&#039;t balanced correctly for this game mode.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-09-04T14:47:37.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I rarely see ARAM games where Warmogs was a deciding factor, it's more of a nuisance and a feels bad item for the enemy team by the time it becomes relevant. Imo Triumph is the real offender in ARAM.\n\nOther than that, it's actually alot of work rebalancing items to have different stats or functions in ARAM since items are kept in libraries separate from the map, and having different item libraries, whilst a good idea at first can often lead to a lot of bugs (just look at the way some nexus blitz items behave strangely, such as the altered jungling item refusing to upgrade sometimes), and ends up being a real mess when you consider how old league is and how poorly understood the code is at this point after 9ish years of constant patching, small tweaks and rushed fixes. \n\nLeague code is more a messy patchwork rag than a well set out tapestry.","replies":[]}]}
