Not Worth $ in Current System?","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, as a player who recently got messages from  Riot saying &quot;you get 108% more honour than the average player&quot; or something, I have collected a lot of keys.\r\n\r\nBut since the changes to IP/essence, it doesn&#039;t seem worth it.\r\nLike, I could spend $10 on 8 chests to unlock (or more for the stack of 18 keys, not fragments, sitting in my loot), but how many will have skin shards, and how many shards need to be disenchanted to craft one?\r\n\r\nIt is currently cheaper to go into the store and buy a skin of your choice, than to craft a random one (that may be worth very little in terms of RP).\r\nHow does this make sense to anyone?\r\n\r\nI&#039;d like some clarification on how this whole hextech crafting thing isn&#039;t just one of those &quot;freemium&quot; scams now.\r\nTencent gets no cents from me.","replies":[{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2018-02-28T12:18:28.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah bro just a total money grab. I spent $400-600 on the system, it all turned out to be absolutely worthless and I came to the same conclusion, especially getting doubles or things I already own.. Or champs... When I own all champs.... No point wasting the dollars honestly goto the store and buy what you want","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-02-28T03:32:33.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, the orange essence changes were stupid. It will cost me 2 legendary skins to craft a 975 skin. I have about 6k OE saved up but I don't want to use it until they reconsider their disenchant values. \n\nA ♥♥♥♥♥♥ emote should not disenchant for more essence than a legendary skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZoeIsLegaltoFap","date":"2018-02-27T00:41:18.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you hextech crafting is the most fucked up thing riot has done trying to get all our money.. stupid company dumb ideas","replies":[]}]}
