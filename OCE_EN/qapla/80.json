It&#039;s not like this was Diamond 1 and they&#039;re up for promotion, this was ARAM.\r\n\r\nI swear that the rift/abyss/treeline are all located in Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a reformed player. I had my first account perma-banned back on NA server in season 2 (before OCE existed).\r\nI learned my lesson and I have had no issues since. I&#039;m generally friendly, and make frequent use of mute buttons when needed (rather than replying to toxic scum).\r\n\r\nWhy can&#039;t people view a game as a game (especially casual modes), not as serious business? /hugs","replies":[]}
