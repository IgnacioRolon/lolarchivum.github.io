I wasn&#039;t a tank champ.\nI built not a single point of AD or AP (not even from runes), and tanked 4 times as much damage as a player in the game with the same amount of deaths. I did not have the highest deaths.\nI still dealt as much damage as three others in the game, including a [champion]  on our team, who thinks her 23k healing is more valuable than my 200k dmg tanked. She reports me, and encourages another (enemy) to do so too.\n\nI got honoured twice, and reported twice. This makes no sense, wtf is wrong with people?\nSurely 2 honours outweighs 2 reports, amirite?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-28T12:40:39.915+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean it depends on what the reports and honours were for. If it was two honours for carrying and two reports for being an ass all game I'd be in the report corner there, but if it's two honours for closing the whole in the comp and two reports for \"troll picking\" in an *ARAM* then it's a bit different isn't it. \n\n2 honours over 2 false reports and I think it should be obvious which outweighs the other. For consistency and fairness's sake I'll add the obligatory \"assuming you didn't leave any key info out\".","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-05-29T06:29:28.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm fairly sure even false reports affect your honour (just less then proper reports), whether that outweighs it or not is probably something that a rioter that has access to the inner workings would have to say.\n\nEven if the algorithm finds a report to be false, it would make more sense for the report to still have more weight then an honour (because for example, intent feeding without chatting would come up in the system as false, but should still outweigh the honour regardless).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-29T07:22:05.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I can't pretend to know the details. I'm not even sure what relationship honours have to reports or if you even have to be reported for you to be flagged as negative for a game and receive little/no honour. I understand the logic of keeping it vague though, makes it near impossible to avoid the (honour related) consequences).\n\nI'm also not sure if QAPLA was talking about a player perspective (how much value do we place on honours vs reports) or system perspective (the actual effect on his account).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2018-05-28T10:27:26.571+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's hope","replies":[]}]}
