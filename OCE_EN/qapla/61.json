It seems thematically perfect.\n\n2) Trollface group.\nThat classic trollface meme as a facial overlay (always facing same angle, regardless of character direction) would be great on several champs. {{champion:23}}  while ulting, {{champion:53}} when his shield pops, {{champion:27}} at practically any time, but maybe just while ulting, etc.\nIt could be done as an add-on, rather than a skin, so it just gives you the trollface over whatever skin you use when conditions are met.\n\n3) Cat in The Hat\n{{champion:76}}  {{champion:107}} , whatever. Could be a laugh.\n\n4) Shedding Skin {{champion:69}} \nI&#039;ve suggested this before, but it was ignored. Each point in ult changes Cass&#039;s snake skin to a different pattern, getting more deadly (based on irl snakes) as she levels. Level 3 ult would be Black Mamba or something.\n\nI could go on and on, but I need to jam some guitar, I&#039;ll add more later.","replies":[]}
