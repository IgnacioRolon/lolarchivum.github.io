There's nothing in the rules against _\"shitposting\"_ or posing meaningless content. So under the current rules this post is pretty much fine (it could possibly be removed for _\"wrong category\"_ but that's it).\n\nSomething we should also consider is the right to free speech. Should **QAPLA** be able to post as he pleases provided it doesn't harm or insult anyone?\n\nI'd be more than happy to push for a boards rules amendment if you guys want it though. Maybe we could have a democratic poll?\n\nJust sharing some thoughts :P","replies":[]}]}]}
