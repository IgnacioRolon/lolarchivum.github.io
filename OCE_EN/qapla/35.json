Bad attitudes, lack of teamplay, all the things that made me quit are still so abundant.\r\n\r\nJust playing ARAM for a few games, I see ADC&#039;s that build nothing but damage bitching at me (when I&#039;m  playing/building tank or support) for being like &#039;10/13/lots of assists&#039; or something, not bad stats, I just wasn&#039;t going for kills. And their complaints are entirely hollow. If I wasn&#039;t tanking/supporting for them, their stats would be shit too.\r\n\r\nThen I get a team of 3 ADC&#039;s, a tank (Sion) and I roll Swain. I take AP runes/masteries (as the only magic dmg champ on team) and then find the Sion going AD. I build tank and get rekt trying to protect the ADC&#039;s, while our Sion does nothing but try to snipe kills. Whole team is bitching at him, while I&#039;m apologising for not being able to AP and tank at the same time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the reminder of why I quit, I swear the LoL community is the worst in any online game I&#039;ve ever played.\r\n\r\nWhy bother playing a team game if all you want is personal glory?\r\n\r\nPerhaps one day back is enough and I should quit again for another few months...\r\n(oh, and I&#039;m getting queued with golds/plats, not bronze 5&#039;s, so they should know better)\r\n\r\nBack to HS for me, maybe I should reinstall PoE? It seems LoL is terminal, and just gets worse over time.","replies":[]}
