By using that formula we can figure out the possibility of each chest containing what they did (skin shard and chest/key for the first, emote and chest/key for the second), then just multiply the two together to get the end result (as with the earlier examples). Using that we get:\n\n> Chest 1\n> (0.5) + (0.1) - (0.5 \\* 0.1)\n> 0.5 + 0.1 - 0.05\n> 0.6 + 0.05\n> 0.55%\n> \n> Chest 2\n> (0.1) + (0.1) - (0.1 * 0.1)\n> 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.01\n> 0.2 - 0.01\n> 0.19%\n> \n> Both chests\n> 0.55 * 0.19\n> 0.1045%\n\nThis is, of course, assuming I'm using the correct formula and that my math is all correct.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-08-17T08:51:48.678+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Barry, so I'm looking at a 0.05% chance of that luck I had today?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-17T08:43:01.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/riot-reveals-hextech-chest-drop-rates-season-8-21484","replies":[]}]}
