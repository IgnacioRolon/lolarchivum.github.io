Forum bans should be global.\n\nJust my opinion.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-16T10:23:11.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban evading in that manner is disallowed, though we do have to action it manually. We don't always ask the NA/EU peeps but if we suspect they're posting on OCE for that reason we do.

I was under the impression they'd fixed that so we could post on their English boards but I also never actually tried it.\n\nI guess my question would be, do you think stuff like gameplay discussion (which is universal) should also be prevented, or just stuff like \"I got banned\" or other PB stuff that they should really be using their own boards/community for?","replies":[]}]}
