I only play the game mode I like best.\r\n\r\nSo with these worlds missions, I completed all that could be done in ARAM. No &#039;rift only missions&#039;, no &#039;login to esports&#039; bribery and no &#039;pay for more&#039; (worlds pass) scam.\r\n\r\nWhat do I end up with?\r\n275 tokens, not even enough for a single orb. That&#039;s just sad.\r\nDo Riot/10cent think this encourages me to spend money? It has the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nI will not redeem any of those tokens and simply let them expire, as a protest against the current system. Idgaf about an emote, ward or icon, I don&#039;t need key fragments or some pitiful amount of BE.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ll buy something better than this toaster PC at the start of next year and just move on to other games, LoL is only going downhill.\r\nIt&#039;s kind of sad, as this was once a great game, seasons 2 and 3 were a fantastic gaming experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-12T11:42:41.224+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I feel the worlds missions may have been a bit excessive but I *love* missions as a whole. They appeal to my need for targets and organisation and all that fun stuff. They add an extra element to games that I really thrive off of. I think that comes down to market, you can't please everyone, and a feature that pleases one group might miss the mark with another.\n---\nI understand having missions that can't be completed in other gamemodes, SR is after all the main gamemode. While it'd be nice to have missions that could be completed in every mode, it limits what kinds of missions they can set, and can get stale, so I can appreciate both sides of that argument.\n\nGiven that a lot of missions have alternate completion options, it doesn't seem unreasonable to have at least one completion requirement be open to all modes.\n\nWhat annoyed me about the worlds missions chiefly was that they couldn't be completed in 3s. The requirement on all the missions was 5v5 PvP but for the life of me I couldn't see a reason 3s couldn't be included, even by the individual gimmicks of each mission.\n\nThe watch missions were... kind of whatever for me. I literally just opened two tabs and let it run, which while hardly being an inconvenience, kind of defeats the purpose, and felt redundant. Those that were going to watch, are watching already, and those that weren't, aren't going to be actually watching it.\n---\nSome rewards did feel rather skewed. The orbs were unusually expensive for what they were and really just seemed like a token sink for pass players, which seemed very strange to have given the high costs of the unique rewards. On the other hand though, the value of the items you could get with the pass exceeded the cost of the pass itself, so if that's your thing, I feel the price was reasonably fair. \n\nThe rewards for ftp were pretty lackluster, 2 ward skins and 4 key frags is pretty meh for weeks of missions. Events in the past imo have been pretty good for ftp rewards, but this one felt *too* much like you were being pushed to buy the pass.\n\nYou should be hitting both markets, make the pass worth it, but don't make the ftp players feel bad for not spending money. If they didn't buy the pass it's either because they can't afford it (so you aren't getting their money whatever you push at them), or because the rewards weren't appealing enough to warrant spending the money (same deal) and forcing them will just make them less likely to give you money for something they do want later. \n---\nI still adore League, and I'm not going to stop playing anytime soon. Maybe I'm not really their target market anymore, I don't have anywhere near as much disposable income as I used to (isn't adulting fun?) but it's also true that things have changed. Some for the better, some a little sideways, and one or two that I think are honestly a step backwards, but as a whole I can't really object.\n\nThe game will change as the market does. Passion project League may be for many Rioters, it's still a business and will still follow the money. So the strategy remains the same as with any business, speak with your wallet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-11-12T10:42:14.553+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This whole event was a travesty.\n\nIt turned something that should be fun, into an endless grind, where you know from the beginning that you still won't be able to get ALL the things you want, especially if one of them is that f*cking skin.\n\nI was a collector up until this event, the last limited edition thing that slipped through my fingers since I started playing was original Championship Riven, and that's because I was only a month or so into playing and didn't realise what it was.\n\nNow because of the sheer volume of limited crap they pump out, and the 10,000 hoops you have to jump through just to get a small piece of it, I physically cant maintain my collection _(Like even of I wanted to, I physically don't have enough time and money)_, and so won't bother with getting future items either. _(what's the point collecting if the collection can now never be complete?)_\n\nSo that's a crapton of my money that league won't be getting from now on. Just because they got a little greedy.\n\nI have never despised this game as much as I do right now, for so many reasons.\nAlmost every major decision they made this year was so wrong.\n\n_PS. Remember when to get a border you just had to buy a skin (for the normal price) the first week it came out? and not spend $50 on a bundle with horrendously designed chromas, and like 6 icons you'll never use.
