I don't think I could go back from 100 now, at the very least not without a long adjustment period, but it's not unplayable. If it's what you're used to, it's at most a little uncomfortable or unresponsive to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-01-30T01:39:05.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah whatever you say mate you're full of crap. Anyone who plays on 20 fps will adjust to 100 after one game, anyone who plays on 100+ will not be able to adjust to 20 fps. It literally screws with your brain. Not only that but you wont be reacting faster than other players. Its not to say your bad at the game but if you're playing ranked there's no way you're going to carrying with an s rank on 20 fps.","replies":[{"poster":"Driggz","date":"2018-01-30T02:37:27.559+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please... I've also played on both 20 & 200fps and although I much prefer 200fps at maximum fidelity, 20fps on low is still doable. In fact, every time I reinstall league, I have to remember to reset the fps limit because it is automatically set fairly low. When I first started playing league there wasn't any mastery or in game history but I'm 100% certain I would have had a bunch of S+ games then. Back when it was farm lane until 20 mins then teamfight... The good old days.\n\nBack to OP - I never played league on a absolutely toast machine for too long but prior to league I used to play WOW on a real toast of a laptop because my tower couldn't run it. Then eventually I managed to install a private server on the same laptop. 5 FPS was good on that.\n\nAlso on my previous laptop during WOW raid boss fights, on low my FPS used to drop to 1 frame per 3 seconds during intense moments. That was almost unplayable, almost.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-30T02:10:17.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so you know you can't play with 20 fps I guess, doesn't mean noone else can.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T22:20:11.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still play (modded) Diablo 2 regularly (Median).

The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly great either. Not super deep and pretty cliche which is fine every now and again but not all the time. \n\nI'm keen to try Monster Hunter, don't know if it'll be my kinda game but at least it's something different (for me anyway as I never had it on Nintendo anything), and I've heard many many good things about Horizon. Beyond that, there really isn't much I'd put very high at all on my list of games I want to play PS wise.\n\nLost Sphear looked interesting but got some pretty average reviews so I'll probs give it a pass, at least until it's dirt cheap.\n\nI'm definitely a lover of good visuals, but I definitely agree that they shouldn't be the main focus (even if I hold them higher than most). It doesn't have to be hyper realistic to look nice. Journey was a gorgeous game, but also simplistic. Cuphead was made by a tiny ass team and has hella unique visuals. You don't and shouldn't ever need a big budget, or to forget about the rest of the game to make the game look good.\n\nOn a side note, if you liked the old Sega games, I found out the other day you can actually use the old cartridges in the Mega Drive that was released recently so you're not just limited to the games pre-installed which is nice, and they're not all that expensive (under 200) relatively speaking.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-29T12:32:46.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm definitely a lover of good visuals, but I definitely agree that they shouldn't be the main focus (even if I hold them higher than most).
