Almost every AP Nunu I see in ARAM tends to fail, and I get many honours for going tank Nunu while dealing insignificant damage, even when you hit your ults.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion, that only applies to ARAM, is that I would like to see an option for getting back a champ you rolled after someone dodges.\r\nFor example: You roll your fave champ in ARAM and someone dodges. You cry a single tear. {{item:3073}} \r\nNew lobby. You use an ARAM reroll to regain that champ you rolled from the previously dodged queue. Only the last champ you rolled, and only if the game was dodged.\r\n\r\nI had half a dozen more suggestions, but I forgot them as I&#039;m having Monday funday (on the piss @ 10am), lmao. I&#039;ll add them once I remember.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-19T02:42:21.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problem is when you give tanks good damage you end up with Ornn. An annoying unkillable bastard who can 1v1 anyone.\n\nThat being said I think all Tank junglers at the moment are in a bad spot. Other than Rammus most of them have a negative winrate and a fairly low pick rate, so maybe something needs to be done with the tank jungle item.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krispy Migraine","date":"2018-11-19T06:36:29.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"suggestion: make full ap nunu meta i just went 3/1/9 on ap nunu and its so fun but its in bronze so","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-19T06:57:21.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=TheeKingKrispy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=91wnHGF1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-11-19T06:36:29.295+0000)\n>\n> suggestion: make full ap nunu meta i just went 3/1/9 on ap nunu and its so fun but its in bronze so\n\nI was 4/4/37 in 15 mins, but that's ARAM...","replies":[]}]}]}
