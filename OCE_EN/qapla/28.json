Even Warwick seems like a completely different champ.\r\n\r\nAgain, why?\r\n\r\nAs an ARAM only player, I don&#039;t have a &quot;main&quot; (unless random counts as a main), but Swain is my highest mastery champ, and I always try and trade for him, giving up great ARAM champs like {{champion:99}} {{champion:115}} etc, for the chance to do &#039;Swain things&#039;.\r\n\r\nIt seems like Rito is taking these champs with a unique identity and play style, and just mainstreaming them to be more like every other champ, which is fucking boring.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not pre-judging how good (or bad) new Swain will be, I just don&#039;t see why it isn&#039;t a new champ rather than a replacement.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T00:14:19.840+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Old Swain press R walk around like a headless chicken .... unhealthy...\n\nOld ww, press R and you have best gank in game.
