A clean reinstall can take a long time, because it has to uninstall and remove all game files, and then you have to go through the re-installation process, which will be limited by your download speed among other things. It's not a short process, but it's the best way to make sure everything is running properly. \n\nDoes the Tool give you any errors or anything? It's entirely possible it's just still running it's job, not doing nothing, and closing it preemptively may well cause further issues.\n\nIf you're still struggling, I'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Warden LNG","date":"2018-06-04T01:22:23.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then can u help me ?\nthis direcx doesnt work i installed latest version","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Prime Miev","date":"2018-06-01T13:45:14.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I installed the update but after I logged out it and tried to log back in it said LeagueClient.exe - Entry Point Not Found","replies":[]}]}
