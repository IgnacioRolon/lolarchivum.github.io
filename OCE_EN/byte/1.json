Yes I could have just gone bot instead to end the argument but I didn&#039;t due to his attitude. The premade Zed and Janna flame me all game and use all chat to tell people I instalocked and should be reported  non stop. \n\nMy question is, am I at fault here? I take it some of you are going to say &quot;yes why didn&#039;t you just go bot&quot; but I don&#039;t see why we have to always give into the whims of trolls/instalockers? Was it perfectly fine that I refused to go bot and stayed mid? I&#039;ve been punished in the past (1+ year ago) and my next punishment is a perma ban so its important I don&#039;t break any rules.\n\nMatch History:\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Byte\n\nGame where Yasuo is Byte and Zed is **name removed**","replies":[{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2017-09-29T05:24:57.182+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Should've just run it down mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-10-16T09:24:01.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankfully , we now have unranked draft, to get rid of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-09-29T03:24:30.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole lane calling system is stupid don't worry about it, draft pick is being tested in OCE and will hopefully be a permanent thing so you won't need to worry about instalockers anymore.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-09-28T22:03:20.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope. I haven't been seeing a ton of Insta lockers but my usual attitude is if you go to another lane your giving them what they want so thee just more encouraged to do it. \n\nOf course if I'm not super set on a role I will sometimes change.
