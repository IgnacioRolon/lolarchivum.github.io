In the client, they are detected fine and I can use the button to bind things via the client settings menu.\r\n\r\nThe actual buttons work fine in Windows and all other apps.\r\n\r\nUsing borderless window mode.\r\nMouse is Logitech G900.\r\n\r\nAnyone else experienced this at all?\r\nTested for 3-4 games and same thing each time.","replies":[{"poster":"Byte","date":"2017-07-18T03:18:10.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay managed to fix this.
