Now I'm wondering is it better for me to try to finish all 10 games before the reset on Jan 21 or I'm I better off keeping my 4 wins in a row in credit and finish my placements after the reset ?  If my incomplete placement games are simply deleted on Jan 21 then I'm obviously better off finishing them all now.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know for sure what happens in this situation?  Please don't respond with \"I think this happens....\".  I want confirmed facts only please.","replies":[{"poster":"Arcanopulse","date":"2015-01-16T07:41:01.508+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You always have Elo, even if you haven't played any ranked games, if you won 4 out of 4, your elo is probably around 1300-1400.

I've heard people say that your normals MMR/ELO can affect your ranked MMR/ELO when you first play ranked but that is just rumour as far as I'm concerned/aware and, aside from that, I know that they have no effect whatsoever on each other. Though I, personally (I know a few people who feel the same also), feel that ranked MMR should affect normals MMR to some extent to avoid situations where high ranked individuals/teams are matched against low ranked individuals/teams.","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-01-16T08:50:38.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are different things.

Your elo starts at 1200. Your elo is 1200 even if you aren't level 30. You just can't play ranked games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GZedBot","date":"2015-01-16T11:24:01.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the info on normals elo verses ranked elo.
