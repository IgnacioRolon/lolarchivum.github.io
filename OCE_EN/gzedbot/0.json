There seems to be almost no extra weight placed on your primary pick.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a Jungle and Support main.  I always choose Jungle Primary and  Support Secondary.  I would estimate that I get my secondary support pick 9 out of 10 times. \r\n\r\nToday this was annoying me so much I started picking Jungle-Mid.  I got Mid two games in a row!  Secondary picks again!\r\n\r\nThe system is easy to fix:\r\n\r\nThe system should calculate that if a player has played 2 or 3 games in a row with their secondary choice then it will guarantee you your Primary pick.

Usually I choose \"Fill\", and 95% of the time I get support. But this week I chose \"Top-Support\". Guess what? About 90% of the time I still get support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GZedBot","date":"2016-05-22T10:39:18.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eg0HF7FN,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-05-14T10:29:03.038+0000)\n>\n> Yeah let&#x27;s do that so we have enough time to watch both Star Wars trilogies during queue wait time\n\nFalse logic.  Part of the reason why queue times are so long is that people who are willing to play support sometimes, may not choose support ever, because it just guarantees them support.  If you could choose support as secondary and at least guarantee your primary say 1 in ever 4 games then I think more people would be willing to put support as secondary.  It might even improve  the queue times.\n\nSomething has to change.  Even if its just the name, because calling it secondary but getting it every time is just laughable.  At least change the pick boxes to pick 1 and pick 2, because there is no difference and that should be clear.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Narwhal","date":"2016-05-14T08:43:49.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you get given what is available in the queue, you get mid and support because those positions become available in the queue before jungle.  \n(ie more people have queued up before you for jungle than mid and support)\na reason for this is it significantly reduces the queue time if you are willing to play two different roles","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-14T10:29:03.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah let's do that so we have enough time to watch both Star Wars trilogies during queue wait time","replies":[]}]}
