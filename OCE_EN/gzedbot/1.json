That last game was unwatchable on \"source\" quality and I refuse to watch it on any lower quality.\r\n\r\nI love watching LoL International games on Azubu and Youtube, but OPL on Twitch....nup, not doing it, which I feel sad about.","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-02-09T12:48:34.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you cant watch it is cause Riot has to cater to multiple Bitrates. The 1000kbs rate is for medium-high to high-source quality, and for those who can download it that quick. If you cant view source, its because you cant download as quick as the Bitrate they use to upload. You want to watch without buffering? Then you lower the quality to where the bitrate matches what you can download. Dont want to down the quality? Tough Titties.\n\nIf you want to change that then get better internet, and if you cant due to the infrastructure you have, then either move to somewhere that has it or lobby your local MP to get funding for better communications infrustructure. Good luck if you can, cause the current government wants to like in the 1950s.","replies":[{"poster":"GZedBot","date":"2015-02-12T07:06:32.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rubbish.
