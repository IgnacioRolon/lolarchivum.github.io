(e.g. this season i started bronze 3 and quickly rushed up to gold 5, but due to this my mmr was to high for my current ability, i mean they felt the same, but the people i was versing were generally smarter and it kind of put me on a higher loss than win steak for a bit until it evened out). \n\nTl;dr more games you win the more skilled player you verse, but when you lose, you still play against those players for a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KiwiTorque","date":"2015-10-09T05:37:37.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes same exact thing happened to me. Managed to climb to bronze 1 and now i'm in bronze 5 again. At first I thought it was because school holidays started and I was playing with a bunch of kids but after doing some research it seems Riot purposely tries to keep players at a 50% or lower win rate. I'm not sure how people end up in Diamond with 50% win rates but viewing player profiles from different divisions this seems to be the truth.\n\nIf anyone has a strategy to circumvent this I'd love to hear it.\n\nSeems awfully coincidental that 50% of my games I can carry fairly average players and 50% of the time they are afk/non stop arguing/flaming/not even trying/feeding intentionally etc etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"HoppyC","date":"2015-10-05T09:49:08.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i have experienced this same issue. I have analysed the matches players and all. I have determined that the only reasonable explanation for such occurrences is that riot is punishing you for massive improvement by matching you with teams of lower mmr than your opponents. Riot is not transparent with the workings of the game and i believe that this is a bug that tries to halt your progress in the hope that by matching you with worse teammates will place you in the tier you belong.\n\nRiot will not respond to this problem.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-10-05T10:10:49.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe there are other problems to deal with like specific champion balance issues that affect normal and bot mode players too?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"jomoko2012","date":"2015-10-05T08:58:33.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same thing climbing from bronze 3 to silver 3.
