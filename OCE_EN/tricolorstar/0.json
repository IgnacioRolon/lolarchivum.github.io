From the sweep of the grass to the twist of the clouds, she was able to enjoy pretty much everything life offered her. Although being the Aspect of Twilight had its perks, it had downsides, too. She always had a job to do, always had something that she had to be telling people. She remembered the holy mathematics swirling in her head had mentioned something&hellip; purple? She really liked purple. Not too pink, not too orange. One of her favorites, really. But before the voice of Targon could finish saying whatever it was saying, she was already gone, dashing through a time-space portal of her own creation and entering the next world.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Runeterra.&rdquo; She said to herself, sounding out the words as she emerged from the portal, stepping onto the soft sand. &ldquo;Roon-terruh.&rdquo; Her face was making strange shapes as she felt the funny words on her tongue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny name!&rdquo; She giggled to herself, taking off one of her sandals to feel the warm sand between her toes.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ooh&hellip; sand!&rdquo; She laughed again, kneeling down and cupping the earth in her hands, laughing even louder as she threw into the air and let it cascade down onto her pink-orange hair, closing her eyes to protect them. \r\n\r\nThe portal she had created collapsed behind her. From now on, she could only make small jumps from her to there (until she finished her task, anyway). What did Targon tell her to do again? Zoe was always sent to herald some sort of impending danger, so it was probably that. Why did she appear here in this desert? Who knows?\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; She said out loud. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have some fun!&rdquo; She stood up and began gleefully cartwheeling down the sand dune, righting herself at the bottom. She saw a village in the distance, not too far from her current position. She readied herself to create a portal, but then remembered it would just lob her back here. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Ugh.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;re walking.&rdquo; She was sad about it for a moment, then she remembered how awesome it would be to take off both sandals! She did so, folding them under one arm. Then, she began to skip happily towards the village.\r\n\r\n\r\nZoe crossed the village border easily. Normally, she would have been stopped by wary guards, afraid that she was a vengeful spirit of some sort. No guards, though. One less unpleasant thing to deal with, she thought, still skipping. The stone-earth buildings and huts were all abandoned. No townspeople at all were here, much less guards. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Must be on vacation.&rdquo; Zoe mused. She didn&rsquo;t blame them either, it was so hot here! She remembered her brief visit to the Frejlord a few rotations ago. That was a nice trip, lots of cute animals and nice people. And the snow! Oh, snow was so fun. Almost as fun as sand, really.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; She called out over the whistling of the wind. &ldquo;Anywhere here?&rdquo; Her voice echoed throughout the empty town. Nobody answered. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zoe!&rdquo; She continued, undaunted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to visit! I&rsquo;ve got a message or something!&rdquo; She shouted with confidence, even though she didn&rsquo;t know what the message was. &ldquo;Hellooooo!?&rdquo; She called again.\r\n\r\nNow she was getting annoyed. Targon promised her purple, and all she was seeing was dumb brown. Not purple at all! \r\n\r\nShe huffed angrily, stamping her foot down. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ignoring me, I&rsquo;m gonna get mad!&rdquo; She yelled.\r\n\r\nStill no response. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; She turned her back to nobody. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s how you&rsquo;re gonna be, I&rsquo;ll just go home then!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nBut just as she was about to leave and head back up the sand dune, she heard a rustling come from a nearby home. A small, earthen hutch that had a larger opening for a door and two smaller ones on either side for windows.\r\n\r\nZoe&rsquo;s face broke into a smile immediately. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; She began shouting again as she sprinted towards the house. She crashed into the window-hole and leaned over the edge happily, peering into the darkness for the source of the sound. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zoe!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nA small girl was huddled in the dark. Her ragged clothes were pulled against her. She shivered, but Zoe knew that it was far too warm out for that. The girl had dirt and blood streaked against her face, and cowered from Zoe&rsquo;s loud voice and fast approach.\r\n\r\nHer smile fell. She lifted herself out of the window and rounded through the door. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; She asked, trying very hard to lower her voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Zoe.&rdquo; She said once again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a friend!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe girl looked at her with horror, and drew further into the corner. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;You must get away.&rdquo; She whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wake them up...&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; Zoe said, ignoring the girl&rsquo;s warning. &ldquo;Sleeping is waking, and waking sleep!&rdquo; She looked at the girl again. She was very pretty, if messy and dirty. Her hair was so nice, kept in neat braids (although they were a little frayed). \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Zoe asked. &ldquo;I like your hair! Mine is too long to keep all braided like that-&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Shh!&rdquo; The girl hissed. &ldquo;You will doom both of us!&rdquo; She attempted to wave Zoe away with both arms. &ldquo;They are hunting!&rdquo; She was beginning to panic. The closer Zoe got, the more frightened she became.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Who are hunting?&rdquo; Zoe asked, cocking her head. &ldquo;Is this a game? Like hide-and-seek?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nBefore the girl could answer, a low rumble began to emanate from the earth. The foundation of the house shook, bits of stone and dirt crumbling from the walls and ceiling.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Oh no...&rdquo; The girl breathed, her chest heaving as she leapt to her feet. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re here! You woke them!&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Woke who?&rdquo; Zoe asked, her own voice shaking from the vibrations. The girl tore off out of the house, leaving Zoe behind.\r\n&ldquo;Wait! You didn&rsquo;t tell me your name!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe girl didn&rsquo;t answer as she ran into the courtyard.\r\n\r\nShe didn&rsquo;t make it very far.\r\n\r\nA monstrous maw, colored purple and crackling with pink electricity, rushed out of the ground. The girl was unable to stop herself in time, and she met the creature at full-speed. She was gone in an instant, her legs disappearing down the multi-tooted gullet almost painfully slowly.\r\n\r\nZoe stared at the thing with a blank expression as it hauled itself out of earth completely, revealing a long serpentine body. She looked down at the hole it emerged from. It seemed to extent into infinity, swirling purple biomass and raw energy spiraling deep within it. \r\n\r\nThe thing had a loose-fitting, segmented exoskeleton that clacked loudly as it roared at Zoe, intent to make her its next meal.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Zoe yelled, gathering herself. &ldquo;Give her back! She&rsquo;s my friend, not yours!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nThe creature roared, charging at her with incredible speed. Undeterred, Zoe twisted space-time, creating a bubble that she launched at the monster. It bounced on impact, splattering twilight all over the chitinous carapace. For a moment, the monster slowed down. Its past and present became one, the mental state of its future and the physical presence of its past overtaking the now.\r\n\r\nZoe smirked at the creature, who hovered above the ground in the ultimate sleep. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; She continued. &ldquo;Give me back my friend!&rdquo; \r\n\r\nShe searched for the girl&rsquo;s life-pattern within the monster. It&rsquo;d be simple to create a portal and reach in to quickly retrieve her.\r\n\r\nZoe&rsquo;s smirk faded. There was no life-pattern. Even if she had died, there would&rsquo;ve been a cosmic thread or spirit-vine left behind&hellip;\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing. Nothing left of the girl. She had simply&hellip; vanished.\r\n\r\nCeased to be. Become one with the thing that had consumed her.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in 3,000 years, Zoe felt fear. This creature was unnatural, not of this world. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;What&hellip; what are you?&rdquo; Zoe whispered, beginning to shake. The child-self was beginning to take over. The Aspect was overwhelmed. This didn&rsquo;t make any sense.\r\n\r\nTo exacerbate the situation, the monster broke free of her twilight-bubble, continuing its stampede. Zoe screamed in fear, conjuring a meteor-star from the sky. The monster swiped at her, only managing to scratch her arm as she raised it to protect herself.\r\n\r\nThe star impacted the monster, cracking its armor and making it howl in pain. Any other creature would have died instantly, but it simply turned and scurried back into the hole from which it emerged, leaving the ominous swirling pit behind.\r\n\r\nZoe watched it go, then examined the wound on her arm. Deep purple welts were left in her skin that were already healing from her Aspect&rsquo;s protection. She knew that if she were mortal, that wound would have been fatal.\r\n\r\nThe she remembered what Targon had said.\r\n\r\nSomething purple. A warning. A message. The twilight of Runeterra was beginning.\r\n\r\nZoe clenched her fists as she turned away from the pit and began walking, off to find the next village.\r\n\r\nPurple was no longer her favorite color.","replies":[{"poster":"IndieFlash","date":"2018-03-24T05:31:41.905+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the way in which Zoe's voice changes throughout this, from really bubbly to terrified, really well done :)\n\nOnly thing is in the part where Zoe is afraid (\"To exacerbate the situation, the monster broke free of her twilight-bubble, continuing its stampede.\") you use quite long sentences and words. To create a more scared tone, you might consider using shorter, more frantic sentences to display that change in tone a little better. Other than than, a few typos (\"It seemed to extent into infinity\" should be extend* and \"the multi-tooted gullet\" I think is multi-toothed but I really hope that mouth had many toots in it)\n\nOverall, really nicely written and a fun piece of writing :D good length and tidily wrapped up, had fun reading it, well done!! good luck for the competition, hopefully this helps","replies":[]}]}
