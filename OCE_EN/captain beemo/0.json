I have more than enough orange essence to upgrade my Tribal Ryze skin shard into a skin permanent, but for some reason the option is unavailable to me and clicking it does nothing. I 100% own Ryze, and he is not free-to-play this week. I&#039;ve added a link to a screenshot of what my issue is. \r\n\r\nSo far I&#039;ve tried restarting the client a few times, but with no luck. Hopefully this is one of those glitches that sorts itself out with time, but if it isn&#039;t then I do hope somebody could help me out with this!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-27T12:11:22.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because you already own the skin.

I thought that meant I owned the champion.

I used to dabble in mystery gift trading a lot and don't know all the skins I own, so I've been there.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Axes","date":"2017-10-27T12:24:54.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you able to help me with my support ticket?
