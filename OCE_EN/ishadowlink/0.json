Any codes that are in the box will be invalid. That said though, I'd recommend submitting a ticket to Player Support about it. \n\nIf you can prove you have the physical code, and they still have the means to prove it was never used, they might be able to simply credit you the content. I'd say it's worth looking into, but defs submit the ticket before you think about opening it.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nFYI The login for the support page and the website (boards) are seperate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[{"poster":"iShadowLink","date":"2018-05-22T03:33:26.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much i will check it out","replies":[]}]}]}
