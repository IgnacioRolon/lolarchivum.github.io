I&#039;m not very good at seeing the effect of some of them with some characters skills, so what I was going to suggest may be useful would be to have the capacity to change the runes inside the practice tool so we can try out different runes and see the effects.\r\n\r\nRune Choice Layout\r\nWhen you&#039;re not familiar with the runes it&#039;s quite an arduous process to go through them all see what&#039;s available under each and what&#039;s available if it&#039;s selected as a secondary. I&#039;d like to see an alternative layout that we could switch to that would let us see all the runes and their options side by side, configure the primary runes in this way and then see all of the secondary runes on the next screen or something like that which will allow us to get a better side-by-side feel for what the main categories have to offer.\r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration.","replies":[]}
