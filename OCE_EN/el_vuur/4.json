See, they do have a major influence over this. Repeat the face palm for short sightedness lol.\n\nI would rather like to avoid starting a flame war, but I will say that Riot do punish regular AFKs. The reason most people who AFK won't get punished is because it was a one off, and said person rarely ever AFKs.\n\nI'm not being short sighted, I just think it's unfair how you blame this entirely on Riot. It's like blaming a teacher at your school because another student decided to start being a total arse. What control did the teacher have over it at all? \n\nMaybe a better title would be 'EUGH, you won't believe my luck with these AFKs' and then go on to talk about how Riot should better enforce the tribunal system.\n\nNo hard feelings tho dude, I'm sorry that I came across as an arrogant uptight fuck in my original comment :/.","replies":[{"poster":"El Vuur","date":"2017-02-04T06:09:19.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look, I don't mind the occasional AFK, but they are currently common which is annoying, but tie that in with the absolutely ridiculous number of bots atm and I'm only getting the chance to fairly win a game 2 out of every 10 games. . I'm not just talking about this week, this has been going on for a long time now and I'm getting to the end of my tether. I don't have a problem losing a game if it's a fair game, playing 4v5 (or worse) with a BOT feeder for 45 mins just makes me hate the game so much when it used to be enjoyable. It is RIOT's responsibility to clean this up, if I could clean it up I would, I thought I was making a difference by reporting over the last few years but it's not making any difference to my experience.\n\nI see where you're going with the school analogy in that it's more than just the schools responsibility, the parents also need to ensure the child is being suitably disciplined, however I don't think it fits, there is no parent in this scenario to manage the behaviour, and the other 'kids' in this scenario can't do anything either (per the 2 game post example I gave, the reporting did nothing), only the school (RIOT) has the power to do anything. In the current scenario in a class of 10 students, 1 kid mucks up and all of the students get punished with them, simply because they are in the same class.\n\nTo be clear, I also don't like playing against a team that has a bot or AFK on their team, it ruins the game for all involved, there is no enjoyment in winning for the sake of winning.\n\nAnd what are RIOT doing about it? Do they get a 6 min time penalty slap on the wrist if they AFK too many times? I'm not sure of the exact timings, but the worst I've seen is 20 mins on some players. How about spending some RP to get back into the game after the 1st offence? doesn't have to be a lot, perhaps the RP could increase each time, start at $1 and increase by $1 each time. Might be more motivating to stop the AFKs and then script kiddies would have to pay to level up their bots which I don't think they'd want to do.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-02-03T21:08:13.049+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have control over bots though, when they've been reported at least 3 times in the same week for intentionally feeding.\n\nIt's called a nuke button.","replies":[]}]}]}
