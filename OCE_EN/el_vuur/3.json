Surely you see my point? The free rotation allows you to try a champ before you buy them. You may not be able to try ANY champ, but that's still the main purpose of the free rotation.\n\nBy no means am i saying that this is a bad idea. Should they replace the free rotation with this, then I'm sure most people wouldn't notice a difference. However, implementing this at the same time as the free rotation seems redundant to me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-07-20T08:13:28.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda defeats the purpose of the free weekly rotation","replies":[{"poster":"El Vuur","date":"2017-08-16T03:49:35.260+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The weekly rotations allow you to play a champ in PvP or bots","replies":[{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-17T05:24:34.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It allows you to try a champ before you buy them. Sure, you have to wait until they become available and that's inconvenient. However, why would anyone use the free rotation if they can try out any champ they want in the training mode?\n\nSay you're considering buying a champ. You have 6300 IP so you can buy anyone. You're not sure who you want to buy, so you look at who's free in the rotation. You get one week to try any of those champs and then it rotates and you get new champs to try. But if this existed, No one would need the free rotation except for new accounts that don't own many champs yet.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea. In fact, it's beneficial for the majority of the community. What I'm saying is that there is already a feature in the game that (almost) accomplishes this.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-17T05:32:01.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is, however, a fundamental difference between the Free Rotation and what El Vuur is suggesting, being that one is explicitly restricted to the Practice Tool (which is nothing like an actual game) while the other is accessible in every mode (excluding ranked). I seriously doubt such an idea would make the Free Rotation \"useless\", since one of the ways the Free Rotation can be used is to get some \"real world\" (PvP) practice with a champion, which is simply not possible in the Practice Tool (or even Coop, for that matter).","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Psylock1234","date":"2017-07-20T12:11:47.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like it but i wud also like 1v1s in it so u can try ur uild against anothers cos why is there a grayed out invite button anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Å¡imon","date":"2017-07-17T17:22:10.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually a really good idea.\n\n+1","replies":[]}]}
