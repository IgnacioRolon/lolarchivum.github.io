Having a top-up purchase option may also increase impulse buying for you guys, esp now that you can buy skins from the match making screen.\r\n\r\nI get that $5 for 520RP is not budget breaking, but would be nice to be able to clean up RP and be able to put it toward a skin rather than buying something that has no value to me in the game.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-07-04T23:41:43.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a deliberate marketing strat bro. Use a secondary currency that is scaled diff to make it a little confusing and divorced from \"real spending\" and then make the amounts you buy odd to the cost of anything so people always have left overs and they keep topping up more to use the left over but then are left with more leftovers that sit there tempting them to top up again.","replies":[]}]}
