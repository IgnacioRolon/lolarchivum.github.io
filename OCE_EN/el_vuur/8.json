The problem is, I've got a lot of keys now and nothing to show for my sportsmanship other than being able to go into my loot and look at my key count.\r\n\r\nCan you please introduce a trade-in system, 9 key fragments / 3 keys trades in for a chest, or something to that effect, so that we're actually rewarded with something more than a tally.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-01T12:53:48.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sportsmanship is only meant to be part of the equation though.\nIt's a 2 part system.\n\n1. Be honourable, to get key fragments.\n2. Play well, to get chests.\n\nYou seem to have the sportsmanship part covered, but if you want more chests just go out and play some more champs.  You only have to get 1 S a week _(on a different champ)_ to earn 52 chests a year _(not including missions)_, thats not too much of an ask.\n\nYes obviously its very important to be honourable, but players should be rewarded for actually playing the game too, and striving to reach goals on different champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-11-02T08:43:56.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cept, when you play heaps, you can get only so many chests. \nA system where we can trade keys/key fragments would be great for people like me, who always have 0 free chests because they are so easy to claim.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-11-02T09:42:18.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Remember that hextech crafting is primarily a money-making tool for Riot.  You're not supposed to be raking in chests.\n\nBe patient, you're earning 52 chests a year.  They don't always come at once, but they do come.  You'd have to be consistently racking up a lot more than 156 key fragments a year to make a proposal like OP's worthwhile.  And if you're managing to do that, well I suspect you'd be one of the few!\n\nI think the most likely situation why people have more keys than chests, is because they aren't actually collecting every chest when it's available.\n\nBut if that isn't the case, and you do happen to be a shining beacon of chivalry, then your reward is being able to open those 52 chests as soon as you get them, and not have to wait ages for the game to decide to give you 3 key fragments like the rest of us.  I'd much rather have an excess of keys than chests. At least you can actively work towards earning chests!  Rather than typing nice things in the chat, crossing your fingers and waiting.\n\n_______________\n\nI don't think OP's sentiment is inherently bad _(I'm never opposed to making loot boxes more available)_. But my worry is that it might well do the opposite, it could actually make them less available in the long term.  Because people who do have an excess of keys will trade in keys for chests in the short term, which could well screw them over later when the standard _(which seems to be earning more chests than keys)_ catches up with them, and they realise that they traded away the more difficult resource to obtain.\n\nThe Holy Paladins that earn an excess of 156 key fragments a year, will be fine.  But as I've never even heard of someone earning that many, I suspect they may be few, and it's everyone else that has the potential to get bitten in the butt when they unwittingly trade their keys away.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-11-03T10:01:24.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering how ridiculously easy it is to get frags, and loot boxes, what are we meant to do with the excess of frags/keys?\n\nI've currently got enough keys for the free chests rest of the year, and frags to make a few more. \nThere's still the 7-8 boxes left for the year, lvl 5 honor chests and event tokens to use for frags/keys to go through which I guarantee  will still give us probably 5 more keys give or take. Probably more. \n\n>They don't always come at once\n\nThey pretty much do though if you go on break for 3 weeks at a time. \n\n>You'd have to be consistently racking up a lot more than 156 key fragments a year to make a proposal like OP's worthwhile\n\nYou can make that many in a couple months.

Thats one of the many hooks that will drive players to invest money into the boxes.\n\nRiot want you to have excess, they don't want you to have perfect numbers of chests and keys. _(notice how everyone here has an excess of either one or the other, no one is perfectly balanced)_.\n\nThe free boxes serve a 2 fold purpose for players.\n\n1. A substitute to earning IP to purchase champs _(albeit a poor substitute, but a substitute none the less)_ \n2. A chance to earn content that would otherwise only be available through $$ spending. _(to whet the appetite, as it were)_\n\nIt doesn't matter what you have in excess, chests or keys.  As long as you are earning both, the chests do all they are required to do to allow the player to continue to progress in the game.  \n\n**In short: The boxes work.**\nThey may not work exactly to your favour, but that's the whole point.\n\nIt is in Riot's best interest to keep you wanting more, which you have clearly proven you do.  And some players will purchase what they need to sate that craving.  Perhaps not you or I, but clearly enough people are falling for the trap.\n\nSo why would they change it?\nWhy would they cut a segment of their income, so some players can feel better about having less keys?","replies":[{"poster":"El Lthar","date":"2019-11-09T11:33:06.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know you're right, I get RIOT is in this for the money, still, there's a point of giving up to get 1 chest open, if I give up 3 keys to swap for a chest, plus another key to open this chest (4 keys total for 1 opened chest), that's 3 unclaimed shards RIOT can right off my profile as never being claimed.\n\nIdm, is just an idea.
