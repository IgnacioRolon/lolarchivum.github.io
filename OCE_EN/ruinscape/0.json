I haven&#039;t played in a while (4 days) and today I got an email saying my account had been &quot;banned due to the use of malicious 3rd party programs or modifications to your League of Legends client.&quot;\r\n\r\nI get it, I get it. You&#039;ve seen hundreds of posts of people saying they have been banned unfairly, as have I. The thing is, my account sucks and I don&#039;t even have a good match history, I have in no way, not even attempted to use malicious 3rd party programs. I assume this is shit like aimbots on csgo but on League of Legends, I have never even gone looking for such things and I never knew these even existed. I don&#039;t have anything installed onto my League and the only thing I have ever installed onto league was 2 years ago and it was Curse Voice. (also, that was on an old PC)\r\n\r\nIf I had done the deed, I wouldn&#039;t be here and I would accept my ban. I cannot stress enough the fact that I have never ever ever once touched any third party software. It really upsets me that I got flagged for this. I built my PC myself I know there is no such programs on here. The only League of Legends program on my machine is League of Legends itself. I have basically a perfect record except for minor chat infringement from way back, and so obviously this is honestly a surprise to me. I feel hurt that they did this to me and at the same time I have seen so much posts of people saying they got banned unfairly and never took any notice of it and just was happy it wasn&#039;t me. I never thought anything like this would happen to me.\r\n\r\nI would say I demand proof of it, but there is no need for that because I know it didn&#039;t happen. All I ask is that a Riot mod looks into the infringement that someone placed and notice that it is completely frivolous and a ridiculous accusation against someone who has always been a loyal helpful member of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-11T09:53:00.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nif you've not yet [submitted a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support I recommend you to do so to have this issue looked into further.\n\nHave you ever shared your account with anyone?
