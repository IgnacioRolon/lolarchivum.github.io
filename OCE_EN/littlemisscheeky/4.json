I&#039;m going to be hanging around for the next few hours answering anything you&rsquo;d like to know about me and what I do :)**\r\n\r\nHere&rsquo;s a bit of background about myself&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been into video games ever since I got my first Atari 5200. My fondest memory comes from playing the original Nintendo Game Boy where I was able to play 2-player Tetris by connecting my Game Boy with a friend&rsquo;s via a cable. Back in the day that blew my mind! I&rsquo;m a HUGE Street Fighter fan and my arcade stick collection is a testament to my &ldquo;small&rdquo; obsession. Before playing league, you&rsquo;d normally find me playing a lot of first person shooters. \r\n\r\nI&rsquo;ve always wanted to work in the gaming industry but I started my career as a graphic/web designer at an agency. I&rsquo;ve been at Riot a little bit over 6 months now and this is my first venture into the gaming industry. Before this, I&rsquo;d been in digital marketing for 9 years. I kept my passion for games alive by organising corporate gaming nights with other agencies and other gamers in the corporate world. \r\n\r\nMy favourite champions are currently Morg, Susan, Ahri and Jinx. \r\n\r\nOutside of gaming, I love Taylor Swift, snowboarding, Nerf, as well as going to Ninjutsu and hip hop dancing classes. \r\n\r\nSo that&rsquo;s a little bit about me :) Feel free to ask me anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Benji","date":"2015-08-19T02:23:12.172+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who is your favorite Rioter?","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-08-19T02:33:11.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Loote OFC","replies":[{"poster":"Emú","date":"2015-08-19T03:13:40.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Obviously Loote.

You can also find someone that is already doing your dream role, reach out to them on LinkedIn etc. Ask them for tips. Find out how they formed their career to get to that position. Can you do the same or something similar? This approach might sound a bit out there, but I've done it a number of times.

I do this because I like to know what I'm doing ahead of time, plus it helps me be organised. Because social media doesn't sleep, a typical day for me consists of being on social media for much of it, whether it's planning out what to post, replying to msgs/comments and thinking of ideas to level up our social media e.g. integrating gamification into the OPL broadcast. But I am also involved in other areas such as Community and eSports, so that takes up my time throughout the week as well.\n\nHow do I plan my day/week? I generally split activities into 4 categories:\n1. Important, Not urgent\n2. Important, Urgent\n3. Not important, urgent\n4. Not important, not urgent\n\nI don't do point 4. I try and spend majority of my time doing point 1. When point 2 comes up, I do it ASAP.
