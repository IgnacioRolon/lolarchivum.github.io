I get that Riot isn&#039;t pushing for Threes as a competitive environment, but I&#039;d still like to compete against people and get a ranking for the Twisted Treeline map. I think we should treat the Treeline as its own map, rather than some random rotating game mode.\n\nPreviously, the only way to Treeline was to do it as a Ranked Team, but having Flex Pick in 3s will make it a lot easier to queue up people against equally skilled teammates. Even pairing a Solo+Duo against a Premade 3&#039;s wouldn&#039;t be too disadvantageous, because co-ordination with a smaller map and less teammates is much more efficient.\n\nI really think OCE should have Flex Pick Treeline. While the queues are a little crowded right now (Flex, Solo/Duo, Blind Pick, ARAM, Rotating Mode), giving Treeline that chance as a competitive map and allowing it to have a queue will give players another reason to keep playing the map.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-22T04:26:51.313+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"God i hope so, 2 less people to worry about on my team.\n\n2 less people i have to find to fill out a team if i want to not tear my hair out.\n\nvisually more pleasing map.\n\nId legit give up the rift to play only tt ranked.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Karthhus","date":"2016-11-22T06:03:46.729+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do this Riot {{champion:30}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jhin The Violin","date":"2016-11-22T06:05:48.658+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or maybe just add flex q when we get given TW in the week. :))","replies":[{"poster":"Ruby Crystal","date":"2016-11-22T07:13:06.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm 100% for this as well.
