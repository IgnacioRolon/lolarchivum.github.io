The goal is for your coach to watch your game and evaluate things you can do to improve your win rate. We cannot expect to always have proper team. Yes, I understand your frustration. But once I accepted this fact, I started focusing on myself instead of my team. My gameplay improves, my score improves, my cs improves, my kda improves.\n\nThink about this. How come a challenger player can carry low elo team, even 4v5 and win the game with over 90% win rate?\nIf what you complain is really the case, then the challenger player should also have the same issue, but they dont. How?\n\nYou can do it too. Get a coach, spend a few hours with him, instead of spending (wasting) your time playing ranked and going up and down the ladder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XzMln","date":"2019-11-14T21:37:23.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is, you're at the elo you deserve and it's due to your gameplay.","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-14T21:51:55.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DÃ©sired Name,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=wPkMrL9H,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-11-14T21:37:23.901+0000)\n>\n> Thing is, you're at the elo you deserve and it's due to your gameplay.\n\nnah, hate and trolls are too plentiful, dunno about what Norb did though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-11-14T18:39:27.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/NBhEWAwE-i-just-met-a-weirdly-disturbing-shen?comment=00010000000100000000 https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/tQ98FEZG-its-not-really-skill-if-you-keep-custom-teaming-in-a-reliable-team-and-get-s-rank-or-purposely-keep https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/kB5tm0y9-i-downloaded-a-match-due-to-a-toxic-person-for-the-5th-match-today-in-ranked-but-its-not-even You should pick champs that can wave clear safely, solo carry, can help allies without risking yourself, others or the match and always help until 1hp at the most to see who the backstabbers are + giving tips, not going rage mode and using all report options to filter out the buttholes","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-11-14T10:36:00.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  same team of losers every time \n>game getting put with hella fucktards that just intent to feed afk or just dosent help team \n\nWhy is everyone else a fucktard and you are the only shinning light?
