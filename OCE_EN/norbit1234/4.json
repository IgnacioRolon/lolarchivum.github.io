Get up, have something to eat / grab a glass of water, then come back. By that time, they've probably got their next game started - and you won't be matched with them.\n\nAlternately, switch game modes. If fighting players isn't fun, have a round of vsAI - earlier this evening, I was matched up with a Tahm Kench ADC who wanted to just mess around and have fun. \nLike, they were a good player so it worked out just fine - and we had a newbie trying to solo top lane, so it was good to go help out the other players as we roflstomped the bots.\n\nIf neither of those are working out, close the game for a while. Come back the next day, if you'd like. Do something else that's fun and take time to un-tilt yourself. **Ultimately, your ranking in a videogame is not a measure of your worth as a human being - and is not worth losing your mind over**. :-)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2019-08-07T23:57:38.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe you don't report enough, i'm not joking, sometimes people are so bad there's no space to type anymore in reports or it feels like there's troll teams purposely being weird e.g a match with 4 allies 2+ deaths already in 5min of start","replies":[]}]}
