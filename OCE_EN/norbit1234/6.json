Learn how to get carried (if u are auto-filled  just don't int and be a slave to your carries)\n2. Know that there are games that you cannot win and accept that( also there are games where you are carried and not the difference)\n3. Small champion pool (2-3) on main role and know how to play 1-2 champs on auto fill roles\n4. Learn 1 role unless ur a fill God player(which ur not) and instead play one role and not the flavour of the month role you think is OP\n5. Learn to cs better, you don't need to average 10cs per min but like 6-7 is good enough to get to gold on OCE (i know because I did that)","replies":[]}]}
