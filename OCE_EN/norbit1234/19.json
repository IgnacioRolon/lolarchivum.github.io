In life where a job is beyond a person's cognitive means of pursue. No matter how hard they learns and tries, with the limited capacity they are born with; There is no way they can be consider for the role when pit against others who are better intellectually. In the competitive field, hard-work will not beat talent.\n\n\n**In league.**\n\nEverything you've learned, you are replicating them at a very low %. If this was work, your results is simply appalling when comparing efforts+time to progress. \n\nYou and everyone else are on the same boat. The reason the majority of them got up while you are in stagnation, is ability. Your pace of learning...is simply too slow for what you want. That is the harsh truth, just because this is a game doesn't mean people can achieve whatever they want. \n\nEven if the playing field is even; Cognitive factors and personality traits play a big part in success as well. \n\nAnd lets just say, success is not born from ignorant. This is as easy as i can say it.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-27T11:24:40.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well any tips to escape elo hell cause thats where ive been for the past 2 years lol ive been gold for 4 years but then been stuck in silver for a very long time lol ive practise but i guess it dosent make it work when i put it in play i need to come up with another stratergy i guess ive been flaming for a long time but i want to get better i guess","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2020-01-28T07:29:06.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Well any tips to escape elo hell cause thats where ive been for the past 2 years lol ive been gold for 4 years but then been stuck in silver for a very long time lol ive practise but i guess it dosent make it work when i put it in play i need to come up with another stratergy i guess ive been flaming for a long time but i want to get better i guess\n\nOK, i hate to correct people's English online but please, learn how to use comma and full stop. It will serve you better in life rather than pointlessly ranking up in LOL.\n\nI have no tip to give game play wise. If you've watched pros replays and self help ranking videos often and numerously. The chances of someone giving you a new insight is really slim. \n\nThe issue is what you've learned you are barely replicating them to standard. You might've tried many things, but consider the aspect of you not doing it right on very single ones. So go back and try to make upgrade on each of those.\n\nBut know that what you've learned in this game, the in&amp;out, tricks and knowledge of the game; It's all useless and will contribute nothing toward the real world. This is but a hollow glory.\n\nBut i could be wrong. You could still be a kid in school trying to gain clout and awe through gaming. And that might have some utilities. But overall, most people you'll meet in life wont give a shit what game you are good at mate. If this isn't your career, then treat it as entertainment, nothing more.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2020-01-26T08:06:47.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find that when I have a losing streak, I get into a bad mindset, and then that only makes things worse.  \nI start to only see the flaws in other players and not all the good plays they do as well, which makes me focus more about their playing and less about my own, which causes me to make mistakes too, and only make the problems worse.\n\nSometimes it's good to know when to step back and say _\"okay, today didn't go as planned, let's play something else and come back fresh another time.\"_\n\n________________\n\nA trick my friend does, (he's a very skilled player).  Is he makes a note of everything that impacts his ranked games.\n\nHe writes down every time his team has an AFK, and every time the enemy team has one.  Every time he carries games, and every time he gets carried.  Every time his team stomps the enemy, and every time he gets stomped. \n\nWhen you see it all written down, you become less mad when you have an AFK, rage quitter, feeder, etc, because you can also see how many times the enemy teams have had them as well. \n\nIf you don't write it down, you only remember the times it negatively impacted you, not all the times it helped you out.  So this trick relieves a lot of the \"The whole world is against me.\" mentality that many players get after a bad series of games.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-27T10:08:28.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man i am trying to get out of silver but so difficuilt being put with trolls and afks ive noted out of my last 8 losses 6 of them were afks so hard being put with bronze pkayers you try and hassle them to carry on even when are down but end up just leaving reporting system does not help either","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-27T09:01:10.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2020-01-26T07:20:43.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Monkeys are out today.
