I only got promoted into S4 a few days ago and so far I have not encountered any trolls. I hope it stays that way. In Bronze though I have experienced trolls and omg they are horrible. There are also countless times where i've been matched with the same players from the previous game. It really annoys me that league does this so I always wait about 5 minutes and sometimes restart the client to make sure i don't get matched with the same people. \n\nI really enjoy the adc role but I'm not very good at cs so I cop some flack for it from team mates. I primarily play support now just cause i don't need to focus cs. all i have to do is keep the adc alive and everyone is happy.\n\nDon't give up though. I have had massive lose streaks before and then I bounce back with lots of wins.","replies":[]}]}
