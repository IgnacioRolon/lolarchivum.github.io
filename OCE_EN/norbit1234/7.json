You are playing in Bronze MMR games whilst in silver, so until you consistently start winning games / playing at a higher level, you will continue to lose more LP than you win.\n\nIn your last few games people have been ranked IRON. Of course you're going to win against them. You need to maintain consistency to stop yourself dropping further, assuming you maintain around 60%+ winrate your MMR should come back to around silver and then you'll get better LP gains","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-01T04:25:44.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The simplified version is essentially this: \n\nYou are rising above where the system has established your skill level to be. If your skill has improved and the climb is earned, then you will win more games than you lose and slowly climb and prove to the system you deserve to rank up. If your skill hasn't improved, then you will be winning 50% or less, dropping you back down into the rank the system has now confirmed you to be.\n\nI believe we've discussed this before, but you've hit your plateau. Simply playing more games won't get you anywhere at this stage, you have to be actively improving your skill if you want to climb. Ultimately, rank is a measure of your skill (overall, not game-to-game) relative to other players. If your skill doesn't improve, your rank isn't going to either.","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-02-01T12:31:23.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its so fucking annoying i keep going up and down bronze i get promoted to silver then i get demoted to fucking bronze again its happening alot of times cause of excessive rage quits and afks how the fuck is my skill suppose to improve if this kind of shit keeps happening 4 games now ive had afks and still i get demoted so fuckking unfair im really pissed off is there nothing that can fix these unfair matchmaking bullshit is there ?????","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-01T12:58:19.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said, your rank will reflect your overall performance, not the game to game. You are the only constant throughout, so if you improve, you will climb and in the long run, your rank will reflect only your skill regardless of any unlucky games you get.\n\nThe enemy team is also *more* likely to get such players since they have 5 opportunities and your team only has 4, so keeping your cool and knowing how to play from behind (because you can't win every lane) gives your team much better odds of victory. You still won't win every game, but you really shouldn't be expecting to.\n\nEven in a lost game, you can improve. Are you checking you map after every CS? Are you warding effectively or just dropping them in the nearest bush? Are you farming properly or just distractedly auto-attacking them while you are in the shop or some such? Are you paying attention to where *your* team is or just the enemy? These are the kind of questions you should be asking yourself.\n\nSo long as *you personally* are improving, any other influencing factors will flatten out over time just by virtue of how averages work.\n\nAlso, understand that tilt and distraction have an *enourmous* impact on your performance. If you are consistently playing while tilted, you certainly aren't doing yourself any favours. If you're on a harsh loss streak, *take a break*. Play normals, play URF, play a different game entirely, but don't keep beating yourself against the wall expecting something to change.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Chopnblok","date":"2020-02-01T04:43:56.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You win games get ahead then the match making system pairs you with teams so you're at a disadvantage to make sure you stop climbing.

They cant do their job right, they cant do anything, it is so frustrating that they are holding him back. \n\nAm gonna predict with this sort of personality, in his everyday life.
