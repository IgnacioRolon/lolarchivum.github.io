Because looking at the time stamp in your match history, i don't think you go to work during the day. And if you are the latter, that would explain why you have so much time to kill and poured so much care into this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"2manysooks","date":"2020-02-01T16:12:16.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry your not the only one.\nI am usually gold 1 and hover between gold 3 and plat 3 but this season I started in bronze 1 and am stuck around silver 2. From a 6kda midlaner it is extremely frustrating to lose games id say about 30% ish from feeders, trolls or just insane picks. Soraka jg is a fine example.\n\nI have to mute because if I respond to abuse im usually the one who gets reported so communication is almost always out of the question. Damned if you talk back to someone oooooo report HIM REPORT HIM he talked back to me. I digress.\n\nYou wont find it any different from silver to gold to plat dude, its all the same. youll just get outlaned more the higher you go","replies":[]},{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-29T07:36:31.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just an update ive just been demoted from silver to Bronze so i dont give a fuck anymore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2020-01-29T23:38:02.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Half your games, you have a negative K/D ratio and very little active KP with awful vision score and CSPM. You are also bouncing around roles and champions for no reason at all. Stop playing Vayne, she's trash. Play Kai'Sa or Xayah instead. Less effort, less skill, and better champions overall. You also went on a six loss streak and you got progressively worse during.\n\nYou also aren't getting MVP as much as you should be if you're crying about bad teammates.","replies":[]}]}
