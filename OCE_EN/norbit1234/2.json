I've been getting reports of you complaining about your co-workers. Having seen the statistics of your career's history in this role and all the inadequacies that come with it, not including your co-workers involvement, my evaluation of your record is that of incompetence. \n\nhttps://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=NORBIT1234\n\n* You've been consistently failing to outperform lower ranking competitors \"that are 2-3 levels bellow you\" in the majority of your matches.\n* You dont have any optimal build path for most of the champs you play to enhance effectiveness.\n* You have 5years+ of experience and failed to out compete people that just started out this year, or in the recent time frame of 1-2years. \"Let me make a side note and remind you that the iron equivalent of league in education, is that of a primary school student's qualification and knowledge\". To emphasis the fact that you are unable to use your 5years+ worth of accumulated knowledge to get an edge, is simply appalling.\n\nIt is plain as day from taking all these points into consideration that you are not qualify for this job and your attitude is damning to the rest of the team. Your dismissal is effective immediately, you have 1 hour to pack your belonging and i wish you well on finding a different career better suited to your **aptitude**. \n\n--------------\n\nComplains all you like and ignored your own mistakes. Once you land a job, all of these habits you've developed, or innately; Wont do you any good. \n\nI and most HR departments personnel would not hire you at all judging on your personality and comprehension, if you were to apply for a role that need any more than 88IQs+. Because you can't learn it effectively and will most likely output poor performances, without, or slow, improvement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2020-02-21T10:13:58.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It has been proven by science that increasing IQs in a person take LOTS, AND LOTS of resources for a minuscule grow. \n\nYou don't have the resources and are aiming too high for what you can do...
