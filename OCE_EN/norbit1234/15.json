Last week I had 4 games in a row legitimate afk's and trolls taking other peoples lane. Then again the same today but you know what? It happens to most people at every level.\nI think when you have any issues that continually reoccur the best way to handle it is to not think too much about it but take the time to watch you're games back, make a list of mistakes you made or things you missed. Focusing on the negative is not a good mental state to have but instead to turn it into a positive and use it to drive you to improve. Sorry if it sounds like a lecture but I do feel like this is mostly a mental issue. \n\nAs for the game and it's matchmaking, you need to report the trolls and afk's with a detailed description to give the system more information to make a decision. That will help weed out the trash. Also, if I may suggest, try talking to people. Sometimes people tilt, sometimes they are having a bad day. If you talk to them like they human too you might be surprised at the response you get. It wont always happen that way but you are better off trying it than not trying.","replies":[]}]}
