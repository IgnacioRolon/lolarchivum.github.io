After losing 6 rank games in a row now cause of this i dont know what to do anymore especially with the season just starting and im afraid it may continue. Playing since season 3 i have seen the game over the years get worse and the feed back i do consistently not being heard by these so called riot people. Investing 1000's of hours on this game over the years and my long term goal trying to reach diamond its hard to reach with being put with budget people who dont help nor communicate with muting does not do anything aswell.\r\n\r\nAny professionals out there want to give me a hand as i am consistently trying but my team aint trying aswell\r\n\r\nKind regards \r\nNorbit1234","replies":[{"poster":"Warmth","date":"2020-01-19T21:45:54.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-19T22:20:01.893+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚was just explaining the obvious and all i want is help on getting better no hurt on that  i guess you are one of those lil kids who trolls aswell","replies":[{"poster":"Warmth","date":"2020-01-19T22:44:35.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2020-01-20T00:44:00.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You not seen that ive been gold for 3 of those years ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ dumb ass and i have seen you just joined so dont talk to me scrub i need people who are in diamond and above need assistance on improving not your negative feedback","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
