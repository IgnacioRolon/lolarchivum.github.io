I dont understand how I get in a game with them when its their first ever ranked game?","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-03-10T20:03:05.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo hell is engineered by rito.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2016-03-10T22:00:56.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to start somewhere, and that somewhere is right around silver 5, where you are. If you match new players up with other new players, you still have no idea how good any of them are relative to the main playerbase, so you cant place them until they start playing games with people who are already ranked. You're not gunna get new players in your games that often (the really bad ones will drop down alot after losing their first couple of games), and you will win just as many from having these guys on the other team every now and then, so it evens out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-03-10T13:25:28.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"0-6 isnt that bad considering they could be 0-20.\n\nLow Silver is the same Elo as new accounts.
