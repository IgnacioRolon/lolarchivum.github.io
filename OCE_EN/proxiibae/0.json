Is it because of the duo? I'm up quite a bit in my win loss ratio and i seem to be getting 8-12 LP a win, then losing 25-35 a game. I've had win streaks but ofcourse we can't win them all. After 3 or 4 wins I go back to 0 LP, is there a way to fix it?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T23:23:37.931+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When you duo queue, the client treats both you and your partner as one entity with a single MMR. This MMR, by default, is the average of both of your MMR scores. As you win or lose games together, your duo MMR will rise and fall appropriately. Duo MMR has negligible effect on your solo MMR.\n\nIf you're duoing with a person that has significantly lower MMR than you, you would be experiencing what you've just described. Try playing ranked solo and see if that fixes it.","replies":[]}]}
