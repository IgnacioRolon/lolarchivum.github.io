My internet was 100% working as I re-logged several times whilst in a discord with my duo and I lost 19LP as a result! From my experience this can only be a client related bug (Which I have never had from 5 years)... What can be done as compensation? (I have everything recorded as well in relation to what happened) I have to say I want my 19LP back, that&#039;s a good 30+ minutes of a game I need to play to get back to where I should have at least had a chance at winning that game which was remade. Since this occurrence I have re-validated my files and all seems okay.","replies":[]}
