It's a bandaid for the victim, not a deterrent for the aggressor. And, unfortunately, I have little faith in the Riot Support Staff when it comes to doing what they say/said they would do with players who break the Summoner Code and that you report via tickets (my own experience there, off topic and too long to go into here). \n\nThis game has gotten huge since I first started playing in S2 and, even though Riot have done amazing research and work in the area of Player Behaviour, I think this is the #1 area in which Riot are faltering when it comes to honouring their promises and meeting the needs of their wider community. \n\nThe only solution I can see is Riot putting more in-house resources into the judiciary side of Player Behaviour, even if it costs them funds to do so. League of Legends may be one of the most popular games played with an enormous playerbase, but Riot are losing a steady amount of disgruntled customers because of the rampant negativity of a growing number of players lacking in basic self-control and who, without care or second thought, act out in ways that would not be tolerated if not for the fact they are safe behind their keyboards. These players simply need a transparent and immediate reason not to. And it would be beneficial to all if Riot could come up with a workable solution sooner rather than later.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-18T21:09:45.219+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot gives 0 sh its! \n\nYes they have a shi tty automated ban system \n\nBUT GUESS WHAT!\n\nTAKES 10 SEC TO CREATE ANOTHER ACCOUNT AND THEY CAN CONTINUE TO BE TOXIC AGAIN!\n\nBAN DOES NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Peroxis","date":"2016-09-08T14:43:45.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do wonder about this every time i see players with thousands of wins that are still toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icy Spectre","date":"2016-09-07T14:31:12.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, probably that's why my account on EUNE is permabanned, because riot does nothing about toxicity to protect kids from me, who are at least 10 times more toxic than I am.\n\nRight?

That is definitely true in some cases, but in **most** cases people are just having a very rare \"bad day\" and they flip-out in chat.\n\n               That doesn't make their actions excusable of course, but it's important to remember that people you meet in League have real lives with real issues. _**Not everyone who seems at first toxic is always like that.**_\n\n\n_Just because you didn't receive [this](https://i.gyazo.com/e44989b804b8e645eb113ba47155ec45.png) notification, doesn't mean your report did nothing._\n\n + You only get that notification if the person you reported gets punished within a few days of you reporting them. \n\n Sometimes you'll report someone but their behaviour wasn't severe or frequent enough to warrant punishment. But now thanks to your report, it will be easier for that person to be punished at a later date.\n\nMost of the other points you made were really good though. Toxicity **definitely** still a looming issue that needs to be fixed. **Riot**'s got the new tribunal still in the works which should help, and there's now also talks of a honour rework later on, which might encourage more positive behaviour.\n\nThanks for bringing this up :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-09-06T08:48:25.028+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Words wont hurt you sweetheart\nToxic players are ones who troll pick, feed, etc.\nBecome an adult, it lies within you.","replies":[]}]}
