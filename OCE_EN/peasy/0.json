Never have I been close to fitting into a small.\r\n\r\nAnyone else who made it having similar/any problems with it?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPeasy","replies":[{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-25T13:06:07.697+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trade with k1ng - he's probably got a few jackets lying around that you'd fit into.","replies":[]}]}
