So after games I like to look at the game statistics in the match history and a part of that is looking at the team gold advantage graph, so my problem arises from the fact that I tend to fill which obviously means I play a fair bit of support but as it doesn&#039;t show who assists in the kills I find it hard to see where I&#039;ve actually managed to impact the game. So I feel adding little icons for assists next to the larger kill icon would allow supports to better analyse their games. Does this sound like a good idea or just a meaningless addition which would bring no value? \r\nps. would love to actually hear a response from riot on this","replies":[]}
