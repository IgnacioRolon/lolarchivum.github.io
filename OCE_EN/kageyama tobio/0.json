My usual role on the boards is devils advocate, so I'm not exactly a saint.\nI just want it, and for lack of anything else to say im going to list why I want it.\n\nI want it because it is limited-edition/legacy, and I absolutely despise limited-edition/legacy content because there is no reason for any line of code to be 'limited'. But that doesn't stop me from being a collector, I have every legacy skin in the game _(with one painful exception that I need to wait til valentines day for)_, and collect every limited skin I can when I can _(and riot does not make it easy....)_\n\nIf I do not find a way of getting a code for it, I will NOT be able to get the skin, plain and simple, despite how badly I want it.\n\n1. Because not only do I not live in Melbourne where pax is, nor in fact do I even live in Australia, I do not even live on the same continent! So needless to say, the chances of me making it to Pax without winning the lottery are quite literally nil.\n\n2. Because I have earned every chest from every mission and from every weekly S gain, likewise with Key fragments. Plus I have bought every gemstone when available _(with 1 xmas exception)_. I have never spent a gemstone, and only have 8 gemstones total. Meanwhile my friend is also on 8 gemstones.... AFTER he bought hextech annie with his first 10. So I am not a lucky guy, and **will not** have enough gemstones to purchase Sivir before she retires.\n\nI have argued with riot at every turn about there being a 'limited time' skin that 90% of players will not have access to. And I disagree wholeheartedly with there being such a skin in the first place. But I will do whatever I have to in order to obtain it, up to and including making a fool of myself on the boards in a last ditch attempt to win it. And should that fail, I will have to turn to begging pretty much everyone on the boards, should that also fail, ill be emptying my already empty wallet into every fake code on eBay until I find one that works.... :'(\n\nIm desperate, and I'm trying every avenue I can to get it :S\n\n_________\n\n_PS.

I was unable to attend to Saturday's event unfortunately as much as I always wanted to go to PAX however the tickets sold out... Fairly unlucky on my behalf... considering that the day I was given the opportunity to purchase the tickets... It became sold out. I guess it was just my fate ;-; I was also unable to attend on other days due to appointments that I have made in previous weeks... If I was ever given the chance to purchase the tickets early... I would have done so. I guess just not my day haha. Sivir has always been my pocket pick as I have a 100% win ratio on her over a fair amount of games. She has very great wave clear and lane pressure as well as damage output in team fights including her ultimate which also gives the team a fair amount of utility. I love playing her and receiving that skin would allow me to make use of that skin to it's full potential :c I would love to receive that skin.
