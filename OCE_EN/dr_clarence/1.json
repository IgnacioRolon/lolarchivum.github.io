You cannot blame all your lost ranked games on your team mates, your too blame too. Everyone has their place in the team. \n\nThe mmr system is in place to place you at your skill level. So maybe the player on your team are having a bad game? maybe your mmr is low? Looking at your recent history I would say that's the case and take a wild guess that you tilt easily as well. Nobody likes to be called \"inable plebs\" or being called a \"toxic f*ck\".\n\nYour never going to climb ranked with your attitude. You may be annoyed that their is toxic people on league (and on your team) but your being toxic too. Play passive and learn to adapt to the game no matter how poorly your teammates are playing then eventually as your skill level rises so will your mmr.\n\nSeason 8 is a Soft reset. So use pre-season to improve your skill and de-tilt, play normals to learn new champs or to get away from ranked and have a chill fun game. Your only 300 below the average elo level, not to hard to fix that.\n\nHere are my tips that might help win you games:\n\n1. Play only when you cool. (Not tilted)\n\n2. Play ranked when you are winning - Meaning if you lose 2 or 3 games, stop playing ranked and play norms or go read a book until your in a better mindset.\n\n3. Listen to music whilst playing - Helps me a lot.\n\n4. Mute any player that's trying to harass you, if you cannot hear them you cannot fire back.\n\n5. Your cs is not too bad but try improving on that skill, aim for 100 cs per 10 minutes.\n\n6. Swearing and carrying on will only aim to tilt you even more, So don't carry on.\n\n7. Lastly, play champs in ranked that you know you can play well. Learn every role and have 2 champs for each lane.\n\nIf you need more help just ask bro, no need for the swearing especially on the forums","replies":[]}]}
