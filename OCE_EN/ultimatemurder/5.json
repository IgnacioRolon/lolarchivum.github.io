It seems to only be League of legends which this problem occurs. Pubg has no issues. I&#039;ve done speed tests and everything is fine and my download speeds are consistent. I&#039;ve turned the firewall off and on and still have the issue. I&#039;ve changed my settings in game and this hasnt fixed anything. I&#039;ve uninstalled and reinstalled and did a repair and nothing has changed. My internet is fine. Its just league where the MS is an issue.","replies":[]}
