I've left 1 game in 3 months and i got 5 match 10 min low priority queue, Previously i left many games which i regret. The fact there is no reset on your profile even when you made the effort not to leave,  is quiet frankly shit and an unfair scheme in which players are not rewarded for making an effort to change.It is a blatant 'forget' about the player attitude taken by league. Also i notice when I play with my group of friends that  is when i get reported most.

If you do, then that can typically fall into a few categories (or a combination of them).\n\nFirst, it may be because you consistently make the conscious decision to leave games, in which case you have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nSecond, it may be because your internet connection doesn't meet the minimum requirements, in which case it's up to you (as the players) to address that (for example, by contacting your ISP and addressing the issue with them) *or* accept the risk of LPQs (since you are still being a detriment to other players experience with the game).\n\nThird, it may be because you experience issues with the client/game itself, and while Riot is *in part* responsible for that, it's still up to you (as the player) to recognise that you're having those issues and seek solutions, such as looking for work-arounds and/or fixes, contacting Support for help etc.\n\nTo be clear, LeaverBuster *does* give players a chance to get their account back into a neutral standing, however that occurs over *significant* periods of time, and consistent play. It doesn't happen overnight, because that would make higher tier punishments useless.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-03-18T07:27:17.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leaverbuster has nothing to do with how you feel about leaving the game.
