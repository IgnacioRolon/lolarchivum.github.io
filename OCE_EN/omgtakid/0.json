Once i re-connect, &lt;5mins or so i crash again. I thought it was due to me playing BB (Butcher&#039;s Bridge). My first thought was that my computer (i used a mac, i know its a stupid platform/computer), so i lowered all my game settings to as long as it can be. \r\n\r\nBUT the problem is still there, so i thought i should play a normal game 5v5, assuming that it was not my computer&#039;s problem but the game mode itself. Unfortunately It still happens. So it did conclude to me that it is the patch.\r\n\r\nHas anyone solved/fixed this problem, or is it a waiting game for Riot to fix?\r\n\r\npeace!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-07-23T22:07:12.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey OMGtaKid,\n\nCan you give the solutions on the [Bug Splat and Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) Riot Games Support article a try?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2015-07-23T13:35:45.267+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My girlfriend has the exact same problem!
