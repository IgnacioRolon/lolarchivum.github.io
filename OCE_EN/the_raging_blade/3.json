So this time I'll try to be as specific as possible. Hopefully we can clear things up :D\n\n__*\n\n\n> in addition, when u let people who feed to 0/3 blame me cause i was 1/2 under heavy ganks for feeding, what is the so called best sports man like game?\n\n+ **Riot** doesn't \"let people\" feed in your games. Just like everyone else, they have no way of knowing who is going to feed in a game. The best they can do is punish the player afterwards and stop them from feeding or being unsportsmanlike again.\n\n May I suggest that you find some friends to play with as a premade? It might make your in-game experience far more enjoyable.\n\n__*\n\n> and also dear fking leader of the board, answer my questions before delete all the things and disable discussions\n\n+ Dear Raging Blade, please stop cussing and insulting others and we will be glad to answer your questions. \n\n You're not doing to bad ATM actually. Keep up the good work!\n\n__*\n\n> how the fk the other team get diamond and plat rank while my team only gets bronze or silver most of the time?\n\n+ In normals, the MMR variance between teams is greater. Especially if you queue up **2:00 am** (like you often do). Also since you're not the platinum player yourself, it's more likely that the platinum player will be on the other team.\n\n If you're looking for competitive matches with better matchmaking, I recommend you try playing ranked or try playing at different times during the day.\n\n__*\n\n> and when u say not be a jerk, why dunt u delete fking those who say my english is bad?\n\n+ Good question. \n\n Posts that are considered severely offensive will be deleted. In your case, your posts were deleted because you said multiple times _\"go fk urselves\"_ and _\"go fk ur mom\"_.\n\n When people insult your English they do not attach it to any racial insults or make it strongly offensive by cussing. However, you if see someone who has crossed the line, feel free to report it and I'll remove it for you.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-08-23T10:30:35.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls do not lie to pp here i normally play between fking 8-1 in night, so do ur fking search ok? in normal times u just team me with bad people and dunt use something extreme as excuse","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-24T04:08:58.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not sure what time zone you're in, but many of your games with Gold and Platinum players (that I saw), were played between 12am and 2am (AEST) according to OP.GG. \n\nI'm simply listing it as probable cause as to why you might be encountering higher elo players as often as you say.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-08-24T14:42:08.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and also now fking u team me with a group of damed people that report me for afk while they feed since 30s, so after game they got no punishment while i am punished for \"afk\" your dear shits must enjoy discriminate me so hard,\n\nor in other words if u play with friends u can frame others and your fking system do not even look in to cases! good system","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-08-25T02:56:39.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know why you keep blaming board moderators for matchmaking issues.
