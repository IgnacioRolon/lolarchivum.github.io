But he team does NOT function with an Azir mid, and a selfish Zed who says \"i called mid, so fuck you guys, fuck the team comp, I'm going mid.\" because then you lack a support and so your ADC is fucked, and have two underlevelled and underfarmed champs mid, so basically you are 3 champs short, so its basically a 2v5 because you were too selfish to think about what the team needed and instead focused on getting your lane at all costs.\n\nAlso the Calling lane system e.g. Mid, Top, ADC, is not actually part of the game, its community made, there is no need to follow the calling lanes system at all, its not against the summoners code and the 'lock in' button (which tbh serves no other purpose then to allow instalocking) still exists even after all these complaints. \nits just etiquette that people do follow it, its like how all bus drivers wave to eachother when their busses pass, its like an unspoken rule, but isn't actually a rule. They arent required to wave, they just do. \n\ntherefore Riot does not punish instalockers because according to the summoners code, they aren't doing anything wrong. \n\nHowever in saying that, the calling system is the most effective thing to date at sorting out the lanes, and so people who want to play properly should follow it,\nits like how you don't HAVE to use pings, but it helps the game if you do. So people who don't follow the calling system are hindering the smoothness of the game.\n\nInstalockers are low! but if you are too selfish to give up your lane (even though they were in the wrong) then you are even lower, because that means its you who is screwing the team comp.\n\nI personally never instalock, and hate people who do, but I'm not going to ruin the game for the other 9 people just because i wont take one for the team and go support (or whatever is left)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-12T18:29:40.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they dont punish leavers,trolls and what not harshly enough....
