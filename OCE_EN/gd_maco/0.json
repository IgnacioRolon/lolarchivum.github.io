Riot NEEDS to fix this.\nI mean look, it&#039;s nice to use this technique to get players to play more but 1 game can run up to 30 mins.\nOverwatch does this because 1 game can only run up to 5-10 mins, it really feels like a grind and the game becomes boring now. This way, you're attracting more scripters or botters which makes the game more trashy.\nIt&#039;s either make the champions free and just earn your money through the skins or give us back the old cash system with the earning BE or IP with every game.\n\nRIOT, LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYERS, PEOPLE WHO JUST STARTED PLAYING THE GAME GETS BORED AFTER A WEEK OR TWO SINCE THEY CAN'T ENJOY THE CHAMPS THEY WANT. LEAGUE IS NOT EVEN A GAME ANYMORE, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE SEE IT AS YOUR BUSINESS.\n\nYOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FORCE PEOPLE TO GRIND A MONTH FOR A PENNY? THEY QUIT.\n\nWE'RE NOT EXPECTING INSTANT CHANGE BUT DONT WAIT UNTIL ITS TOO LATE\n\nPLEASE RIOT, TAKE THIS IN A POSITIVE WAY WE'RE HELPING YOU TO MAKE THE GAME BETTER.

I've encountered more bots recently (last couple weeks or so, while doing Project missions) in coop VS AI than I had in the months prior. It's really got on my nerves, especially when I end up playing a match on my main, get a bot or two, then switch to my smurf to play a game (both for FWotD) and end up with one of the bots I just played with. And believe it or not, I've recently encountered a \"jungle bot\" (which apparently exist now), which *only* killed the Gromps, then walked back to base and waited for them to respawn.\n\nLike I understand that sh!t is dealt with in waves, but it's really starting to get ridiculous how many bots I'm encountering, as well as all the people complaining about the amount of bots they encounter. Riot really needs to step up their game with bots, otherwise they're just going to lose the \"VS AI\" and \"ARAM\" groups of the community, and considering the \"VS AI\" accounts for basically all their new players, they'll have to do something if they don't want to go under.","replies":[{"poster":"GD Maco","date":"2017-12-03T18:10:22.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, the runes are great and all but the in-game cash(BE) becomes so hard to get and they expect people to just play with the champs they don't want to use.
