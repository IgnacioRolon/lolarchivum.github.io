I did the calculations with empowered w which did less damage but provided cc immunity which worked well because he'd 1shot, be tanky enough to survive any retaliative burst whilst being impossible to lockdown or peel and he'd run away with stormraiders; but now without cc immunity, his empowered w combo isn't really that good for diving and is more defensive and this means he's alot more manageable.\n\n\nStill, unless you're a pro, rengar should still be building half tanky with say a deadmans, spirit visage and GA or other defensive item because he doesn't need that many damage items to be able to kill a squishy target with a rotation of  spells.\n\nAn assassin doesn't need to build full damage, optimally, the assassin should build enough damage to 'assassinate' the target and then build the rest with as much durability as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-02-13T11:54:30.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cc immunity? what cc immunity.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-13T07:50:28.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also assassins generally can't burst tanks, unless riot really screws up with their numbers. Current rengar is far from able to 1v1 a full health tank nautilus, though I'm not sure about when he had that bug with rengar passive back on his reworked version release. \n\nAnyways rengar is far more tame now and they've nerfed everything I personally feel was broken about him and maybe just a little bit more, so until I get my face ripped off by a mastery 7 knife cat, I personally feel he's not at all broken.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
