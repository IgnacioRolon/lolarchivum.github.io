Sure i did badly early 10-20 minutes in but we could have easily won that, and i mean easily, our ashe was doing enough damage to legit kill the whole enemy team especially when we peeled for her and i used an ult on her or our tanks. But our warwick was unleashing a barrage of hate and abuse unto me and it made the game impossible to win.\r\nSure, i reported him but i feel like thats not going to do jack...","replies":[{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-10-11T23:44:40.451+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mute and report is your best bet. And you did report him so that's good.\n\nAs for winning, from stats it looks like WW was carrying pretty hard. You need to focus on your builds a little more, going for all that attack speed probably wasn't your best bet. You spend alot of money on potions you could look at getting a refillable potion which is 150g and refills every time you go back to base or corrupting potion for 500 gold which holds 3 charges. You ended up spending 1050gold on potions alone. I know thats a bit beyond the point you're making but little things like that can also help you win the game","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-12T01:15:16.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thanks for the advice, i'm not really a kayle player but the thing was ww wouldn't go in with me, he legit would refuse, it was a 2v1 with me ww and i would go in with ult up and the ww would just bm and run away, like wtfff","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-12T01:52:31.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report, don't mute unless it's really triggering you just don't type back. They may have some useful information about the match(rarely but sometimes). Not enough people take reporting seriously generally if someone is quick to flame unprovoked 9/10 times they do it almost every game and you report them you'll find that if other people do the same for as little as 3 matches you'll receive a card saying they've been punished. In bronze and silver especially people say they'll report someone but just instantly jump back into queue forgetting it entirely.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-12T04:45:13.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, it was just pretty much just flame lol, he was quick to flame our mid laner for \"not letting him gank\" and bot for not helping him or whatever so eh","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-10-16T04:08:44.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it was pre 6 that he was trying to gank, the mid-laner has every right to not let him gank.
