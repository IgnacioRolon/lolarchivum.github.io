I mean i dont even know how any top laner might be able to play against that... She just pokes me down so low and i can&#039;t engage. if i try and e, in, w, q, then e out she blinds me and then does that thing where she hits me and propels herself back. Who the hell would beat her in lane?? i can see a decent quinn easily beating  {{champion:122}}  {{champion:240}}  {{champion:266}}  {{champion:92}}  {{champion:83}}  all of those melee champs. I dunno man. How can i beat a champ at top lane like quinn?","replies":[]}
