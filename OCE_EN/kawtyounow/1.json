He was zoning me off cs and i found it hard to do anything however i managed to hit level 3 and full fury up i prepared for a full health all in, before i knew it i was chunked down to half hp and i was dead before i could chunk the Graves at all, me finishing the game with a 0/9/2 score. I am not calling Graves unbalanced in any way, it&#039;s the same for Renekton with ANY ranged top laner matchup, excluding teemo. any  ranged champ you can think of has beaten me in a stomp top lane with Renekton on my side. Quinn. Vayne, Tristana, Jayce (although he was an easier matchup but definitely mechanically better than me). How can i cs correctly whilst also hitting fair/reasonablyfairtrades while laning against a ranged top laner? With Teemo i find it different as i just rush banshee&#039;s or visage or both and then find it easy to stomp that lane matchup however it isn&#039;t so easy with a champion like vayne who does true damage as soon as she hits 3, constantly harassing me before level 3 and making Renekton&#039;s level 3 power spike absolutely useless. Again, also not saying Renekton is unbalanced. Just looking for some advice on how i should play a top lane matchup against a ranged laner, do i ask for Jungle pressure? Do i just stick it out and let the ranged cs freely until i hit six?  \r\nSincerely Kawt, All advice accepted duly ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-11-17T14:26:37.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The things I advise you to do especially in top lane in this sort of match up us make use of the brushes in the top lane. Since you are ranged and the enemy champion is melee they will have to walk into the bush if they want you out of it, then putting you in range of it. Even then if they truely want you out of the bush they will use their trinket, then giving you the ability to communicate with your jungler that the river is not warded and they can come top for a gank where the enemy laner will not be able to see it coming. \n\nI do very much encourage you when you can to ask for the jungler to come. He can help you in the match up a lot and put you in a position where you can win fights, but just make sure you aren't damaging your other lanes with them not getting ganks from your jungler. Over all the main thing to keep in mind is with the CS that you do go for consider that if the enemy champion tries to trade with you when you go for it how much HP are you going to be trading for that one minion. Put some thought into is that amount of gold worth possibly having to go back and miss 1-2 whole waves. The main thing is that you stay in range of XP so that you get a high enough level so the range gap with a champion like Renekton having a gap closer doesn't matter so much once you are in the higher levels. While CS is nice and the gold is very much nice to have, its ok to sometimes give up CS if it means staying in lane a bit longer, try to teach yourself when these situations arise so you can make use of them to get the advantages you can to come back in a losing matchup.\n\nApart from this advice also consider your item builds. You have two options you can either build damage and go high risk high reward. What I mean by this is when you go full damage like this you risk possibly not doing really anything in team fights because of how fast you die if you don't pick off a few kills before mid lane, but on the other hand if you do manage to pick off kills you will probably be extremely useful in team fights dealing massive amounts of damage. On the other hand you could go tanky which is the safer option, this will help you to CS easier and gives you more options as to what you can do in the lane, and in team fights with the limited gold that you have even if you don't pick off a few kills. All up always consider your team composition when building items, going a full damage build when you already don't have a tank on your team when you can build tank, is usually not recommended.\n\nI hope this advice helped and if you have any questions for me or any clarification on what I said let me know. Good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-11-18T12:43:44.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually just stay in bushes and go out just to last hit a minion. NEVER push their lane because they are just gonna freeze it and your cs would be atrocious and you will barely have any affect towards outcome of the game. Just last hit and stay in the bushes cause if they try and trade with you, they are gonna have to facecheck or go near enough the bush to place a trinket there which is a good opportunity for you to trade with them. Communicate with your jungler and make sure you don't get frustrated over the csing because csing against a ranged champ as a melee champ is very difficult. Once you have the items, you should be able to trade with him/her easily. What I do when I go up against a ranged top laner is that I don't get trinkets but rather sweepers so that anytime that he/she wants to ward the bush im in, I can simply sweep the bush and do what I mentioned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lezgodx","date":"2016-11-18T05:22:50.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"always grab a dorans shield so autos do less to you  :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-17T12:28:24.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need\nGhost\nCc \nGap closer\nPhage\nSwifties\nQuick trades no sustained fights early on.\n\n\n\nIn all honesty you should have smashed graves","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-11-17T02:53:31.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who recently picked up Graves and Jayce top, i appologise, HOWEVER:\n\n1. Graves is ranged but his autos are blocked by minions. Fight him inside the wave, avoid his Q returning and you will win the trade.\n\n2. You are Renekton. A lane bully with strong early game damage. You can beat a Graves with equal items in the early game.\n\n3. Build Damage. As a Ren, you aren't going to be able to beat a Graves with a full tank build. With a Deaths Dance and Phantom Dancer, Graves gets very tanky with lots of lifesteal and so has to be bursted down. Graves will almost always win long trades since he kites and heals.\n\nHOWEVER. Against champions like Quinn, Vayne and AD Teemo, rushing Ninja Tabi and Thornmail isn't the worst. At level 6 you can usually win as long as they aren't super fed.\n\n4. EITHER take flash ignite. Ask for a gank at level 3. Snowball OR take Flash/TP, play like a pussy, freeze the wave deep so your opponent has to play scared, take \"bad\" trades then TP back in full health and get lane control. Or if you find it impossible. Get level 3 and roam. Ren has great gap closer and CC. he's a pretty good ganker.\n\nRenkton does have his double dash, but quinn, vayne and graves all have self peel/dashes. So flash is almost a necessity to making sure you can stay on top of them.\n\nAs someone who used to play a lot of Renekton, Darius and Nasus, i know the scurge of playing against \"no skill\" ranged top laners. Pain in the ass. It is very hard to win without jungle pressure.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Struggle","date":"2016-11-17T00:56:10.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lets start with looking at your opening items. You probably shouldn't have started long sword and pots, dorans shield and pot or cloth armour and pot probably would've been better starting items for you. I see you sold that long sword at the 5minute mark.\n\nYou won't always be able to favourably trade in every match up so you will have to learn to play more passive at times. Allow them to push the wave to you and try to last hit at or very close to your tower. If they are continually pushing like this then call for jungle help or let the jungle know that they are pushing and can be an easy target to gank.\n\nMaybe look at changing ignite out for flash in some situations. Or if you're confident without flash then think about exhaust maybe.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-17T01:00:54.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, at 5 minutes i tilted and just decided to try going full tank, the olaf did come but he got outplayed and the graves doublekilled us, it was probably miscommunication as i didn't stay in after i used my combo, but then olaf got chunked down and yeah :/","replies":[]}]}]}
