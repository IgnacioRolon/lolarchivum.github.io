Against a riven. That wasn&#039;t even level 30. \r\nSo i think you can imagine i was ready to down some chlorax after that game and it felt pretty bad because i felt so helpless in lane, if i tried to towerfarm, she&#039;d just towerdive and i&#039;d be down in 3 seconds flat. It tilted me a lot.\r\nPLease tell me how to play gnar because i am absolutely clueless. All advice will be duly Appreciated. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-13T07:11:22.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Due to his deceptive range and low health pool, Gnar is actually somewhat weakish in the really early game, his 'range' makes you feel stronger and people tend to overextend, I would say play safe early and the rest of the game should be fine :P\n\n{{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} {{champion:150}} \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-13T07:13:50.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats true. as soon as she stunned me i was as good as gone lol. i cant cs very well with a hands on champ such as darius or say renekton. any advice for them?","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-09-13T07:21:05.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play safe till after Lvl6, by then you should have a balance of health and AD items, only then can you fight them head on. You can ask for ganks/camps but otherwise playing safe is key. Two things I don't like about Gnar though are, he's awkward to use, especially his Rage mechanic since it's so unreliable, including his R which is fine on its own but it's full potential is when you're near a wall. The other thing is, is that your W passive, Hyper decays really fast, faster than other 'marked' damage passives. People like Kennen, Varus, Vayne etc have that 3 proc things, whereas Gnar's decays faster than you expect, I would have 2 stacks and by the time I get through the minion wave's unit collision to fire off a Q or something it would've disappeared.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-13T07:09:11.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IDK man, I only bought Gnar due to free skin via hextech crafting, and I went just as miserable as you.\nHe seems a difficult/awkward champ. I think it's just one of those \"requires practice\" things, not like a champ such as xerath, which you can free week play for first time, and go 20/5.","replies":[]}]}
