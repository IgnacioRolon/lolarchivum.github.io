Now i usually do pretty well in lane, sometimes with a few ganks from our handy jg or sometimes alone however, since lulu is a relatively hard champ to play and her damage(ap) isnt incredibly high i just find it hard to &quot;hard snowball&quot; into late game. I mean i can be up to 4-5 kill ahead and maybe roam bot help them get a few kills or whatever, but i feel like i could be snowballing so much better/harder. Does anyone have any help for me? i&#039;d really appreciate it! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-20T10:33:41.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play AD lulu when I roll her in ARAM.
