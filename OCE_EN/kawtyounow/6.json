If i play a darius against Riven, i find i usually come out on top as well with Renekton but that could just depend on a skill matchup i suppose. Who counters Riven and who does RIven counter?\r\nThanks for taking the time to read, leave some advice, it would be duly appreciated!! ^_^","replies":[{"poster":"Xuízunä","date":"2016-10-11T10:50:11.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello KawtYouNow! Riven main here! I would like to help you out :) with builds, I highly suggest always a bc first item. I don't care if you are 5-0 on your first back. It is essential to get a bc because of the armor pen and tankiness. Go for a hydra second and if you are vsing a tanky top then get lord dominics. Last 3 items are situational and how you want to play. I am an agressive Riven and like to make plays to win the game hence I need a one shot build which includes a deathstance or a bt and if you play defensive get a GA. Now in regards to playing her, I highly suggest you learn animation cancelling. It separates crap rivens from pro ones and also this is the only way in getting the most damage out of her. Watch some youtube videos on animation cancelling and watch BoxBox. He explains every matchup and what to do with her! Hope this helps :) if you need anything else, please ask :D","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-11T21:57:34.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do know only that her e cancels her ult but i am going to watch some videos on animation cancelling with riven.

You can replace merc and ga with items such as dead mans, maw or banshees. any-type of defensive item. If you are really fed you can get rid of merc if they don't have 'ANY' cc. or ga otherwise for another offensive item like {{item:3046}} . I do always s recommend getting 2 defense items though. It's just better for your survival if you get cc'ed or rooted. You can also swap out {{item:3036}} for {{item:3033}} if you are against a {{champion:50}} , {{champion:16}} or {{champion:420}} . Even {{champion:106}} if he is becoming a problem. If you are ahead in lane you can get a tiamat first back if you want for the extra combo damage.
