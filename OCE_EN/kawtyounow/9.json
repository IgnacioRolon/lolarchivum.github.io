Keep an eye on your jungler especially during the first clear as there a good indication of where the enemy jungler is, use this information to position your ward on that side and position aurelion so that you're hitting the minions with a good distance between you and other enemies. Since your lane Auto pushes your enemy laner will be csing under tower alot. Giving you ample time to roam using comet of legend and star surge for a potent ganking tool. Taking Flash ghost is highly recommended Aurelion is all about positioning. His standard playstyle is all about shoving and ganking that can include his own lane.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-08T00:06:07.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thankyou! i was taking ignite and it felt so wrong because if i thought \"if im close enough to ignite i must be doing something wrong\" so yes i wont take ignite anymore i was thinking it was a stupid summoner spell. Now with his e, im a bit confused about when i should be using it, should i use it to get out of my lane and into river or should i be using it once i approach the bot/top lane and speedily rush in?","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-08T05:25:12.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think of your E Q combo as a slow moving Ashe ult, that gains size over distance traveled. You want to be close if your ganking botlane using it near dragon is pretty decent. Baron pit for toplane, it is possible to use it further back creating a HUGE stun but your likely to mispredict where they are going to be in 5-8 seconds. The way you use his ultimate is to hopefully knockback enemies into your Extended passive range and kite them with it whether you use rylais or GLP-800(usually this). But if you come behind enemies on a gank feel free to use it to knock them further towards your team","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-08T19:48:13.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, i haven't played him since i made this post but i think i am emotionally ready to give him another go lol.
