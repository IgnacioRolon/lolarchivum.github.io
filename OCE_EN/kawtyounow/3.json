His early game is however somewhat critical to avoid a slow start:\n* save mana (dont spam w or ask your jg to give you an early blue)\n* farm while moving around and let your passive do the work\n* if you're playing against someone that can jump at you easily (see {{champion:84}} {{champion:39}} ) play safer\n\nAfter 6, your ult is crucial and you have to be quite intelligent on how you're using it. I generally let {{champion:238}} {{champion:84}} {{champion:157}} jump on me, then shout them towards my turret. the panic in their faces is a precious thing. If you are ahead, ganking is basically you second highest priority.\n\nLate game pushing and teamfights are a piece of cake, just be mindful of when using the ult, as it is ur only close range defence, if you get caught out (and you should aim not to be) or your \"slow all the enemy team and push them away from the carry\" move.\n\nWithout the first couple of core items {{item:3027}} {{item:3116}} (or {{item:3030}} ) and {{item:3009}} he feels a bit odd, but once you have these you'll inevitably contribute and split push like a udyr.\n\nI prefer thunderlords' just because it helps with those problems early game mentioned above. But again, play smart and you'll be fine.\n\nGood luck!!\n\np.s.: his voice actor is soooo great, it should be the top reason to play him","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-05T20:51:49.167+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"one question, an item i usually build on mana hungry champs is morellonomicon (see {{item:3165}} I was even thinking of swapping that out for rod of ages {{item:3027}}.

I'm unsure how bad the recent round of nerfs hit him but the base of his kit is still there, which is the ability to hard push almost all match ups and then get his roam on. creating picks around the map and assisting your jungler is what you should focus on more so then 1v1 your lane opponent.
