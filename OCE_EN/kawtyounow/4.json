Preferably easy.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all, i have posted a few discussions about different champs that i want to play. I was recently thinking about picking up a ranged top laner but i decided that my mid laner champ pool needs a bit more variety. I was going towards one of the three following champs. {{champion:63}} {{champion:90}} {{champion:69}} I&#039;m actually mostly leaning towards brand as his ultimate is one that can turn tables of a teamfight. Sure Malzahar and Cassiopea are strong too but i feel like brand is one of the strongest of the three due to his massive area of influence, and his utility in his stun and his burning. \r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-11-14T04:57:57.038+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For mid Lane champions to learn to get better at the game I would recommend Ahri, Annie, Lux and Orianna. For my reasoning behind this let me explain a bit more in detail for each champion.\n\n\n{{champion:103}} \nAhri is a very important mid Lane to learn in that she will teach you many mechanics that can be transferred to other champions. When you are leaning she will teach you how to poke between cs using autos and abilities through her Q poke. She will teach you how to take advantage of fog of war and dance around vision to catch off targets. If you need practice with skill shots she will also give you practice with those.\n\n\n{{champion:1}} \nAnnie is a very simple champion in concept but can be very effective when played correctly. Her passive has some Interesting things that you can take advantage of in Lane such as holding the amount of stacks you have at a certain amount to play mind games with your opponent. For example sitting at 5 stacks ready to stun will make your opponent scared to fight you, whereas sitting at 1-2 will often make them be aggressive making it easy to bait for ganks. Plus on top of this a good flash tibbers in a team fight is always rewarding.\n\n\n{{champion:99}} \nLux is great for teaching you mechanics such as how to combo your abilities and being able to burst down targets in one combo. You can play Lux many ways such as defensive looking for picks or offensive making flash binds so she is very adaptable to the current in game situation. She will again teach you about skill shots but will also teach you how important positioning is. While Ahri has 3 dashes to get around Lux has no natural escapes or moves to chase.\n\n\n{{champion:61}} \nOrianna is the last Champ on the list. I advise you to get used to Lux before you try Orianna as they are very similar in what mechanics can be transferred over with positioning and combos. The good thing about Ori is her raw strength in team fight if you hit a good shockwave but a lot of people find controlling her Ball hard so that will take practice.\n\n\nAll up let me know if you have any questions. I have listed these champions because they are relatively easy to pick up and they will teach you global mechanics. Hope this list helps!\n\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-14T21:55:49.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand is currently on free week, i played 2 games with him, beating a mastery 7 yasuo in lane and then beating a malzahar in lane with him, losing the first game but winning the second. Thanks for taking the time to comment. Do you think Brand is a viable mid laner to play? As he is very high damage and high magic pen.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-11-16T08:20:55.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I think that Brand can still be very strong in the mid lane. Coming in with the season 7 changes nothing is set in stone though and we will definitely have a shift in metas when it comes to the mid lane with how the assassin rework is changing the state of the game. \n\nThe main thing that is important though is that if you think you can handle the changing state of the mid lane playing Brand. He has a very high damage output and can very much carry team fights and games. However with the new assassins coming in are you able to survive the mid lane matchups that you will get and be able to snowball into mid game from them. That is the question that you have to ask yourself, league is always changing and looking for new ways to play the game. If you can find your own niche way of playing the game that works for you, stick with it and see if you can make it an effective strategy for climbing the ladder.\n\nHope that answers your question and helps, if you have any more questions feel free to let me know and good luck with your ranked adventures.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-16T22:02:05.509+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Elam!\n I did purchase Brand, and i find myself doing quite okay, with him. Thanks for taking the time to give me some information, and i feel like if i put some decent time into Brand i will be able to lane him quite well against champions like Talon, perhaps Kat etc. One champ that was a tricky matchup for me was Malzahar, i found that his voidlings were harassing and i couldn't get out much damage onto him without being badly traded due to those voidlings. Any tips for a Malzahar matchup for Brand?","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-11-17T14:14:28.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest I really don't have a lot of experience in this matchup as I don't really play either of these champions very often, but what I can offer as far as advice goes for it is possibly consider what items you are building. Things like Abyssal will work really well because of how short range Malzahar has to get to you to use his ult along with other abilities lowering his magic resist and making him think harder if he wants to go for a trade or not.\n\nApart from that look for opportunities for when you can hit both him and his voidlings with your W as brand. If these two pieces of advice do not work though, always look for chances to roam bot lane. Roaming is a very big thing that you can do on brand because of his high damage and his stun. You can really destroy a bot lane a few times and snowball a lead off of it, leading to more gold letting you trade with Malz easier.\n\nOther than that you could play around with fog of war and try to catch Malz out when he doesn't expect it. A good example of this is if river isn't warded you could fake roam to another lane, prompting him to follow you and then ambush him from one of the bushes in the river.\n\nI do apologize for not being able to give too much information on this specific matchup but I hope this advice helps and let me know how it goes.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-14T01:32:41.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:103}} {{champion:134}} {{champion:38}} {{champion:127}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-11-18T13:12:57.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy Mid Champs: (To name a few)\n\n{{champion:1}} is very very easy as she has a stun that is not a skillshot. Annie is great for teamfights and can turn a teamfight around with her ultimate. Annie also has great mana sustain in lane because if her Q kills a target, it regains mana.\n\n{{champion:126}} is surprisingly easy, you just have to make sure you use the right things at the right time, first time I used jayce I went 15/2/13 and he was really easy.\n\n{{champion:105}} is one of those champions that you love when he is in your team but hate when you're going up against one. His E makes him really dangerous because he can basically all out you and just come out without a scratch\n\n{{champion:38}} was really easy for me, you just had to maintain your mana use.\n\n\nMid champs that can hard carry: (To name a few)\n\n{{champion:84}} despite people saying she is bad now, she is super strong if played right and can literally 1 v 3 easily.\n\n{{champion:238}} oh lord, this champion does so much damage that you can delete a tank with 300+ armor or even a full build adc.\n\n{{champion:1}} size don't matter, she is so strong that she can turn a teamfight around with her ult.\n\n{{champion:131}} she can snowball so hard that if she gets fed, it's basically 45% of the game already decided.\n\n{{champion:61}} she hurts.\n\n\n\nThis is just my personal opinion of champions, there are many other mid lane champions that is easy or that you can carry with and i'm just naming a few that I thought was easy or you can carry with. It all comes down to your playstyle, in the list, I prefer zed because I like champions who can deal a huge chunk of damage and can come out easily. I personally think that each champion here teaches you things to help you win games for e.g,\n\n{{champion:238}} teaches you to go in at the right time or else you are dead, {{champion:238}} also teaches you to position correctly and to analyze every situation before doing something\n\n{{champion:103}} she teaches you to hit your skillshots or you are close to useless.\n\n{{champion:91}} teaches you to make sure that you are aware of your surroundings and what you can use to help you win some fights.\n\n{{champion:4}} teaches you to make sure you look at the map a lot for potential ganks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-11-18T02:14:49.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:55}} {{champion:238}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-17T23:36:34.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my suggestions will be: \n{{champion:1}} - because I don't think there is a better champion for beginners to midlane.\ntank {{champion:105}} - because he's hard to kill and is slippery and can build tanky whilst still turning enemy champions into fishbait.\ntank-cdr-rush-q-farm {{champion:45}} - because being a tank who can also 1shot the enemy tank is so much fun.\n\nAll simple, easy to pick up, infuriating to try to play around and can carry a game very hard. On the mage side, the choice between annie and veigar is whether you want to go aggressive in the earlygame or carry the lategame, since annie is slightly stronger during the earlygame, but as the game goes on veigar becomes nigh unstoppable. Fizz is just annoying, powerful and hard to play against, and with the changes that came with his rework he can now build tank viably again.\n\nMy nonmeta picks will be: \n{{champion:74}} - because getting ganked by the enemy is a good thing.\n{{champion:36}} - rush spirit visage against ap, rush sunfire against ad and watch the enemy midlane assassin or mage have an aneurysm. \nAP {{champion:81}} - not really a midlaner but just in case your botlane decides to try going darius adc we got ya covered (you never expect this to happen until the day comes when you meet someone dumb enough to try and this pocket pick is for that day).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-16T08:23:03.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:112}} is one of my personal favourites.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-16T21:58:06.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor is quite challenging to play though","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2016-11-14T01:15:08.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I suggest Talon as he has a very powerful snowball if he gets ahead and he can easily catch up if he falls behind","replies":[]}]}
