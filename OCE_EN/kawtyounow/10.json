My last two ranked games, i played against a Fiora in lane, she&#039;s incredibly snowbally and quite hard to beat. I feel like im playing Renekton at a standard pretty good level of play but is there things i can improve on? I usually build up fury while letting the opponent push up, when i hit level 3 and full fury i e in, empowered w, and empowered q , if i can get an easy kill i e through them again getting in front of them or if i need to back off i just use the second e to get back behind minions. There&#039;s many a time when using his ultimate can let you outplay a gank from a jungler. Now i feel like this is all fine and dandy. But another example is when i played against a voli bear, i underestimated the crap out of him and went all in and i forgot about his passive that saved him. He snowballed really hard from there and i found it really hard to lane and i just didn&#039;t have the tankiness to come back and win in lane, i was just constantly being towerdived by the voli and a lee sin. Thats beside the point, im just asking, what makes a good Renekton? What seperates the high elo Renektons from the lower ones. If some higher tier players could leave some advice on how i could further improve with this champ it would be duly appreciated :D\r\nanyways thanks for reading if you took the time to.","replies":[{"poster":"Supa Top","date":"2016-10-03T07:39:47.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not high elo but i thought any review is a reveiw, i main top, i dont play renek but there are things ive seen that have helped me get better. one thing is taking exhaust ghost or ignite flash. these. combos in my opinion are probably the best thing in the world. now u may be wondering where tp comes into play. WELL fuck tp. honestly the amount of times ive attempted a tp gank in my ELO (s3 atm) and they have just fell on there arse. so the only person im gonna take tp on will be nasus (for obvs reasons). now i feel that i like the take exhaust into duelists like fiora for instence, this will destroy her and she is also quite quick so thats why i take ghost aswell.\n\n\n{{summoner:3}} {{summoner:6}} against duelists, this will cut there defences, speed, AA, base dmg. while giving you the speed to keep up with them and escape from ganks\n\n{{summoner:14}} {{summoner:4}}  against other lanes, this cause your opposing lane to be underpressure from the ignite dot and flash can allow you to cheese another abilty in or such. \n\n\n\nnow with these combo's and the way im saying to sue then you will most likely never have these up for escapes and well. if you do have them up for escapes your probably either allready snowballing and dont need to flash or ghost for kill or your not play the lane right and to scared to go for the kills.  \n\n\nNow asking for help from higher ELO players is fine but there are better ways around it. for one watch higher elo players of askign them for advice there are plenty of top mains on youtube that would put the people you could ask to shame. also read renek guides if your unsure about your skill. READ THE FULL FUCKIGN THINK ASWELL NOT JUST THE BUILD its a guide not a shop keep.   while im not exactly high elo i know what it feels like to be in low elo. and adopting this skill is a neccesity. dont hate your team be nice, suck some dick but never donate your elo in hopes that they will carry you. now if you can give someoen the kill over you perfect cause you are \"good\" enough to get solo kills in top. splitting is the easiest way to win ranked games in low elo. get early kills on renek by playign with the super agro summs but also play smart never give a free death in hopes for a kill as you can get that kill with ease as soon as you return to lane if you just back.\n\n\n\n\nthis is pretty long but i though if you read it all you might understand what im sayign and i hope that if any HIGH ELO players read this message entilted \"Renekton.\" at first i though you were just gonna shit talk the champ you should probs change the name to somethign more inviting and asking for help. and also if you read the full think some feedback im trying to become a positive figure in the boards answering as many posts as i can with detail\n\n\n\n\nGOOD luck with yoloq but you should adopt a more im the person that is goign to carry this team behaviour taking better summs","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-03T08:58:54.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This was pretty good man. I completely agree about tp. and i feel like i might just permanently take another summoner spell like you said. I will change the name of this because i do agree that it may sound like im going to complain of brokenness etc. This really opened my eyes a little bit, thanks for putting your time into assisting me, i really appreciate it. thank you. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-03T09:07:15.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just checked, dont think i can change the name of this post :(","replies":[]}]}]}]}
