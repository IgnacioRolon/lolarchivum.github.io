Im not sure just drop me a few suggestions on fulfilling champs to play.\r\n\r\nP.s i tried xerath and he&#039;s fun as but i want to play him when i get a lil better at league at later times.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-09-12T12:11:51.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar is definitely fun. Just got back into him after a few months of pretending to be an ADC and forgot how much fun he was.\n\nNothing quite like losing being in a losing trade, then going mega and turning it around and deleting your opponent.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-12T20:19:22.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"haha i will think about playing him. is he still ok after his last nerf?","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2016-09-13T04:31:27.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't really noticed much of a nerf to be honest. My build has changed to make Frozen Mallet a priority item so maybe that's having an impact.\n\nAt the recent IWCQ in Brazil he was one of the most heavily banned champs so you could take that as a sign that he's just fine in his current state.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-13T07:06:48.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how tf do i play him! help!? i got him and went down 1/10 against a riven that wasn't even level 30!!! i was so tiltmilliated xD.

It's simply more enjoyable (for me).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-09-12T11:03:34.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven, Gnar, Irelia, and Rengar\n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-12T20:20:11.963+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers, i think rengar is getting a rework. so i might put him on hold for a while, until his rework ofcourse.","replies":[]}]}]}
