Before i say anything i want to state that im a bronze 5 so dont judge me too harshly. I&#039;d probably just like some advice from more experienced and better players than myself.\r\nI played a ranked game against a garen (as renekton) and i found myself losing the trades.  My first item was tiamat and so i usually went with the combo: aa, w, tiamat, q, aa, e, aa, (then e to get back out or to chase according to the situation) i found garens silence shredded a hole through this combo and before you think im crying im not lol. I&#039;d just like some advice on how i could counter a really annoying champ like garen because i can play against most champs pretty easily with renekton but garen will always outplay me with his ult, and massive health regen.\r\nAgain not crying, just want some advice on how to play renekton better, and how to counter garen. I know Renekton is a lot stronger than Garen and obviously i am not that great but how could i really nail him as a champion?\r\nThanks for reading if ya did, all advice will be greatly appreciated.\r\nSincerely KawtYouNow","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-11T06:12:33.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play both garen and renekton \nHeres a few tips:\n\n1) obviously don't engage garen with his Q up.\n2) Try not to get caught in his E because will hurt like hell.\n3) Garen is kinda like some other assassin's, his ult will destroy you while his Q will silence you for like 1.5s which is enough to drop you dead and unable complete your combo on him.\n\nAs renekton {{champion:58}} :\n1) Since you play renekton, do the E + W and Q and back out with your second E, distancing yourself from garen.\n2) If your E is on CD and unable to escape (say your flash is on CD) and he's coming straight at you, then try to trade him because once he use his spin and silence thats his only damage output. ( BUT NEVER TRADE WITH REALLY LOW HEALTH MEANING ANYWHERE BELOW HALF HP BECAUSE HIS E WILL BURN SOME OF YOUR HP AND FOLLOWED BY Q THEN HIS ULT.\n3) If your behind just build tank items + black cleaver {{item:3071}} (for that health and armor pen).\n*) Sometimes when I cannot get farm I would try to steal away a few creeps but never allow the enemy laner to get fed) \n4) request for ganks, the earlier the ganks in the game the better chances garen will die, oh and save your second E to gap close to garen since he has his Q +flash.\n\nOh and consider his W which increases his defenses (so maybe try to bait his W out and when it is off, have your jungle go in for the kill.\n\nAnd get your ADC to build Mortal Reminder{{item:3033}}  for that 45% amor penetration.\n\nAs for garen {{champion:86}} \n\nWhen he's about to use his silence is usually when he gets unclose to the middle of the wave so distance yourself a bit more than usual. If he is coming straight at ya then try to W (stun) before {{champion:86}}  Q's.\n\nIf you have your E, save it to 1) if enemy jungle ganks 2) he's really close to you and damaging you, use your E to back out. So your E is pretty much either a gap-closer or an escape ability.\n\nGuardian angel {{item:3026}} is a good way to bait out his ult unless he's paying close attention to you. But it is usually fights where he will ult the lowest hp on your team. (speaking of low-elo). Whereas high-elo, he will save his ult for your carry .\n\nBut its hard to play against a garen as renekton since {{champion:86}} counters {{champion:58}}.\n\nHeres a link to countering him:\n\nhttp://www.lolcounter.com/champions/garen - The general tips for countering him","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-11T07:26:07.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks a lot. didn't expect such in-depth advice. cheers bruv :3","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-11T07:56:14.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No probs.

You can bully the late quite well with a lot of champs, I find myself playing against a lot of Tryndas, Rivens and Renektons when I go top. So if you play smart with Garen, you can bully the lane with your trading stance and even zone them off completely.\n\nAnd I can personally say, getting ganked early or even just having a camping jg on their team really puts me behind. So against a Garen, as mentioned by Chobi call for early ganks, or frequent visits from your jg to even scare him off. This is one thing that I personally struggle with when I know the jg is camping me.\n\nI guess it's all about putting your lane opponent behind really, once they are, they gotta work hard to come back.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-12T07:58:35.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers bruv. <3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"iDEC","date":"2016-09-11T04:40:04.125+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ban garden.","replies":[{"poster":"iDEC","date":"2016-09-11T04:40:34.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-09-11T03:15:07.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fight while the garen silence is down, not while it is up.\n\nOnce Garen hit's his Q, E out, wait for it to run out or be used, then E back in and finish the trade.","replies":[]}]}
