Its not fun, it makes league not fun and i know it makes the game an absolute sh*t game for everyone else in the lobby. I don&#039;t like to lose and i know i need to learn how to lose, because i can&#039;t continue playing like this.\r\nI have not received any punishments due to my tiltedness in games as of yet but god do i deserve one or do i deserve one.\r\nI&#039;m really not trying to be a smart alec here, how do you not tilt? How do you emotionally detach yourself from a game so that you don&#039;t give a sh*t about the outcome or whether your team is good or bad because it&#039;s really something i can&#039;t do and it just makes me even more tilted.\r\nI know of the reasons i get tilted is because as soon as i start playing bad, oh guess what, this one&#039;s going on your match history... have fun explaining that to people. I&#039;m not sure how to put it into words but i hate getting tilted, i hate it, i don&#039;t like getting angry at myself or my team.\r\nBasically i want some advice. \r\nHow do yall not tilt your faces off? How do you keep your emotions in check? \r\nThanks for reading :/","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-10-14T20:16:32.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tilted so hard because of negativity and I'm back on a win streak and the only thing I changed was my attitude.\n\nOh I also had a look at which champs were statistically my strongest,  tweaked and updated runes / masteries, and made sure I researched the best builds (I was doing a s5 build on vi which was no longer good with the absence of sated and the nerf on botrk and I picked up a new Diana item). I became a 2 trick pony.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-14T23:10:48.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how did you changeyour attiutde?

That stopped me tilting them.\n\nI also muted all for a while so that others would not tilt me.\n\nAnd I stopped giving up if we got behind.

What are you doing to make bad plays are you going balls deep with no vision are you chasing kills you can't finish off. If you think your tilting just take a break or play an Aram or some other game.\n\nHow to emotionally detach yourself from a game? You realise it's just a game and that there is no life or death consequences for making a mistake or having a bad team one game or playing bad yourself. What's the worst thing that can happen? You lose lp and get demoted, but is that really something to get so emotional over?\n\nEnd of the day it's just a game","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-14T23:13:59.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.

That is a lot of losses over the course of a career. And remember, they will play 1000+ games a season.\n\nEveryone has bad games and everyone has losing streaks. It happens. If you think you're playing badly, take a break. Even if its 15 minutes, you'll feel better. Set yourself a goal to do something better each game (CS, ward, not feeding). If you reach that goal put the game to down as a win because you played better.\n\nRemember, your match history is no worse than anyone else at some point.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-14T23:12:29.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like a good idea. Perhaps setting myself a death count of under 5 or a cs count of above 250 by the end of match. I think this helped. I mean obviously it's not going to happen overnight but i am going to try to change my attitude and perspective.\nThanks for taking the time to leave some advice ^.^","replies":[]}]}]}
