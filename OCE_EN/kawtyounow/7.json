Please assist me!","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all, gunna start playing adc {{champion:51}} as i have seen her high damage scaling and good kit. i got her in a hextech so i am probs going to yaknow unlock her, but i have just built my third runepage which is full AD. now from what  i&#039;ve read, if theres anyone to put these runes on, its caitlyn. So does anyone have any tips for playing this champ? I do play adc tristana a bit and im pretty decent with her, not that tristana is a hard champ to play adc i guess. \r\nBut yeah in conclusion, caitlyn mains please leave me some tips, would be duly appreciated. Thanks for reading :DD","replies":[{"poster":"0jS1Mps0n","date":"2016-10-08T18:11:26.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but i have just built my third runepage which is full AD\n\ni recommend Attack speed quints with AD reds on caitlyn, and most adc (Lucian I prefer 15 ad). But I think 14% attack speed + 9 AD is better than 15 AD on most ad carries .\n\nthe main tip is taking full advantage of your range and abusing it in lane, she has a longer auto-attack than an champion in the game (besides lategame trist i think).  I feel like the first blood turret gold was a nice buff to caitlyn and lane bullies in general.  Your first goal of everyg ame should be iwn lane and knock that tower down.  I think she is a great champion for solo que right now, very safe, great seiging and scaling.

Thanks for ur advice but i am going to keep the flat ad runes which are actually 21 ad. i can understand why something else might be better, but i want the output damage and also cannot be bothered to make another (4th) runepage. But yeah, i think i've played 6-7 norms with her now and lost 1-2 she's so strong in lane, usually when i proc my passive i'll use it on the enemy adc, or the sup if the sup is a non tank support. As soon as we  get that first tower blood, if no one else has pushed towers i'll usually take the next tower, if not ill roam mid get them a kill, get the mid tower etc. Caitlyn is amazingly fun and i love playing her after like 6 games!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-07T09:28:47.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"E+Q+AA combo.

Just make sure you get {{item:3085}} pairs so well with {{champion:51}}  passive i also get {{item:3094}}  but that's just me other than that gameplay wise depending on who your support is you're flexible enough to play passive or agro but yea i dont have much other than that glhf.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-10-07T08:09:37.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers man!","replies":[]}]}]}
