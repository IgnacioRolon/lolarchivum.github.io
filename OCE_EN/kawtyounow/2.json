Besides the point, i was thinking of a different top laner i could use and i thought about Vayne since she is Cancer in a matchup for Renekton, Cancer in a matchup for poppy and even darius perhaps. She is a good top laner if you have a tanky support IMO. What do you guys think?? Feel free to leave tips on what skill i get first and also. How should i build her in the top lane? \r\nP.S If you don&#039;t think Vayne would be good, what about Quinn? She is also a bad matchup for Renekton and Poppy. \r\nWdy guys think Quinn Or Vayne? \r\nLastly, leave tips for both champs so i can get a good idea of how i should be building/playing them in the top lane!\r\nThanks for taking the time to read :D","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-11T08:26:45.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinns really good at harrassing thanks to q or e, landing harrier(passive) then getting the as and ms buff from w passive\n\nHer abilities proc harrier even if its on cd which make for great damage combos.\n\nAnd her ult gives her such great roaming potential.

But if you want a ranged top for certain matchups, Jayce or Graves would be ok too.\n\nI personally think Vayne top is garbage. She is all about being cheesy with her range and damage. I've vs'd a few vayne tops with Flash/Exhaust and simply, if you can get the advantage vs her, you will snowball and she cant do crap. She is also easily camped if she doesn't have flash in the long lane alone.\n\nVayne wins any Ranged v Melee matchup early. As most ranged champs tend to with a few exceptions. Renekton at level 3 and Yasuo at level 2 will gladly kick your ass and continue to do so the rest of the game.\nAs Vayne top, if you don't have a huge CS lead or a couple kills before 6, you are doing something wrong.\n\nTo be fair, with the item changes I heard Vayne is busted, but i haven't seen it yet. So she might be more viable top now (and in season 7).\n\nQuinn is different purely because of her ult and roam potential. I don't like her style, but she is a better top laner than vayne. She has her W for vision if she is pushed up, her vault and blind so save her from ganks too.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nI used to play a lot of Renekton, Nasus and Malphite.\nI recently (in the past month) started playing Graves top with a lot of success. I have a 19-7 record with him in ranked playing Jg/top (mainly top).\n\nIf you are going to play an ADC top, you have to make sure of 3 things.\n1. your team is not full AD (if your enemy has good tanks)\n2. your team still has a somewhat tanky champion\n3. your team has the peel/engage/follow up (depending on who you play) to help you play.\n\nFor example, Quinn can engage, but if she does so alone, she can get focused and destroyed. So your team needs an Ali or Ori or someone else to follow up with CC or damage to help you out.\nIf you are vayne, you need the classic vayne things. Your team to engage then peel for you.\nIf you are Graves, you need your team to have engage. You have enough self peel and innate tankiness to survive on your own but its hard to start fights as graves without simply walking into the enemy.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-11T04:01:23.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can i please say that no Renekton at level 3 cannot beat vayne. Vayne has her condemn (the one where she shoves u away) to stop your and e and by then you are too low to try and commit to anything without instant death. Thank you for your time on assisting me. I think i might go with Quinn. ^_^ I will think about Graves and/or Jayce however jayce is a lot harder to learn and a lot different from many champs due to his kit so i will lean more away from jayce.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-11-11T02:38:49.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quinn is better than vayn top imo.
