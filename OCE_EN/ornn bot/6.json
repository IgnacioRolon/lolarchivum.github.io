But if you want to compare you can look at kha who relies on isolated q damage to kill his targets since that is his major form of damage. Auto attacks often are used to proc other forms of damage which may come from items or passives which scale with level. Hence, if you allow them to get ahead to the point they can kill you without their major abilities, then you are garbage at the game. \n\nI mean you comment on my knowledge about balancing but seem to think that assassins shouldn't be able to assassinate?
