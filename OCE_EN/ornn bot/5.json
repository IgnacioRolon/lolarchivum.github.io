It's kinda what they do.\n\nThat said, they certainly shouldn't be able to do it to most any opponent, rather to the squishy ones, and even then circumstantially.\n\nHonestly, I don't think the issue is so much the balance team itself, but rather the general \"mood\" Riot, as a company, has taken on over the past couple years or so (and is likely to continue into the foreseeable future). Riot just doesn't care as much about player experience and creating a good game as they did several years ago, all of that has been pushed aside to make way for profit in recent times. *IF* Riot were to go back to the good old values of the early season, we'd likely see a sharp increase in the overall quality of the game, but I doubt (as most do) that that will happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-04-27T09:29:43.619+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Why aren't riot doing anything, because their entire balancing team is ranked gold or lower, and have 0 comprehension of what is and isn't broken\n\nThe team needs to be MINIMUM Dia+, for them to understand the difference between broken and not broken.\n\nAnd to add to their uselessness, most of them play 1 game a week","replies":[]}]}
