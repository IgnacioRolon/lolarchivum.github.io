In order to use your internet you must agree to your ISP's Terms and Conditions, which involves acknowledging you know who they are and what they stand for. If you're using it without knowing this, then you are breaking those conditions and can be sued.\n\nNot that any ISP would be bothered to hire the private investigators to actually do that, though.\n\nTo find out what ISP you're using, check your memory for when you brought your internet connection. You would of had to have faced them at some point. If you are using someone else's connection (such as your guardians') then ask them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
