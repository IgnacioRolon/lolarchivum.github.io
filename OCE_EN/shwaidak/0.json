I'm sorry but do you not recognize how weak one auto on a minion was before nerfing it this nerf? I tried him after this update and farming is now near impossible. +aoe of q is now smaller, thanks.\nwhy nerf q tho? main poking ability and u nerf it?\nbiggest issue however is the E shield removal. this is what blew me. wanna nerf his damage and aoe, fine. but you can not take away his shield. I don't get what you mean by grants a shield on enemy or minion hit.\n\nat this point I don't think the champions playable. just dropped from an S or A tier to a C tier.\nthank you very much riot.{{champion:517}} {{champion:517}} {{champion:517}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Teenai","date":"2019-06-13T05:34:20.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"they want you to get kills over minions lul","replies":[]}]}
