Blade does nothing against armour, it's based on health, gl doing damage against a thornmail you definitely gonna be laying down the pain and it obviously works on any ad champ right???? Yay for Blade Talon, Garen, gp!! No mr items is a joke, build banshees/spirit viasge/locket and somewhat decent amount of health and congratulations you just countered almost every single ap champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-04-22T11:38:35.355+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Ah yes, build 4 MR items and you get the magic reduction equivalent to the physical reduction of one armour item.\nLast I checked burst mages don't care how much MR and health you build, they still walk through you.\n\nTalon doesn't need Blade of the Ruined King because he already takes three penetration items.\n\n\nThornmail isn't built enough for it to be a problem, the only time you'll ever build it is if you're facing a 100% AD team.
