(You need another computer for this)\r\nUn-install League of Legends (LoL) on your main computer and make sure the (Riot Games) folder is deleted from your computer.\r\nIf you have another computer with windows operating system on it, download League of Legends (LoL) on that computer and make sure the updates install.\r\nGet an external hard drive or USB drive. (Must be at least 4 gigabytes to be sure it will fit the files)\r\nCopy and paste the (Riot Games) folder from your second computer onto the external hard drive.\r\nCopy and paste the (Riot Games) folder from the external hard drive onto your main computer's hard drive.\r\nIn the (Riot Games) folder there should be a folder named 'League of Legends'\r\nInside that folder their should be 3 folders and and 2 launchers.\r\nConfig\r\nLogs\r\nRADS\r\nlol.launcher.admin\r\nlol.launcher\r\nOnce you have moved the (Riot Games) folder onto your main computer, double click on lol.launcher.admin\r\nThe game should open and take you straight to the Launch screen for you to log in and play some League of Legends.\r\nNow go kick some rift scuttlers or something. You're welcome!\r\n\r\nIf the problem persists, don't be shy to add me on League of Legends or to leave a comment on here and I will try my best to get back to you as soon as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T10:16:14.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um\n\nyou don't have to uninstall League from the main computer\n\njust copy the files in \"RADS\" to the main computer\n\nbut unfortunately not everyone has a second computer that works perfectly fine lying around","replies":[{"poster":"Tiny Duckling","date":"2015-01-24T15:53:58.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks buddy, nice to know there is more support out there about this problem.\nThank you for telling me that :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-24T23:32:42.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait, that means nothing if the problem lies in your connection, of which you might be using for both computers.\n\nI think you should clarify that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
