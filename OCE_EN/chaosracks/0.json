It's literally impossible to get a punishment from them. Also, \"behabiour\", lol.\n\n>i havent recieved an email\n\nAre you sure that you've checked the e-mail that you assigned your League of Legends account to?\n\nAs Huebo said, you're best off just leaving this as a support ticket. In fact, the guidelines (on the left of every page here) state:\n\n>**DO NOT** post content regarding account suspensions here. [Submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) instead.","replies":[]}]}
