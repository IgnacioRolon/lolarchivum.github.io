Our team was pretty low so he popped his highlander and charged us. i instinctively used fear on him, but instead of doing that lanky fear run, he sprinted at full speed into his tower!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if this is intentional or not? cuz, like, he ran pretty damn far away","replies":[{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-23T02:51:46.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes it's intentional.
