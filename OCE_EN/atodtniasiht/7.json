I think the system in itself is a little inaccurate from time to time, I don't know about you guys but I've been in situations where I've been reported for sticking up for players, simply refusing to surrender because the win is far more important than a kda and I've had games where ragers have absolutely dampened my spirit... but point aside these people are reporting us as well. I would not be surprised if in some way I've been reported by enough people that disagree on some point or another, especially from my climb from silver -> gold, but in any rank.\n\nP.s.
