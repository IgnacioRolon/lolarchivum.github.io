Make sure you're logging into this website http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/\n\nMore information is here > https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207896486\n\nIf the above is not the cause of your issue, try changing your DNS server. The reason I suggest this method is because you are not only unable to log into the League website but you're also not able to log into the client which could be the case that it relates to the connection. \n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\nStep 1. First of all, in your windows PC go to the Control Panel and select Network and sharing center.\n\nStep 2. And there click on Change adapter settings.\n\nStep 3. Now there you will see all networks, select the network that you want to configure for Google DNS.\n\nIf you have decided to try out Google’s DNS and want to change ethernet settings then simply right-click on Local Area Connection and then select Properties.\n\nStep 4. Now click on Networking tab and there under This connection uses the following items select the option Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and then click on properties.\n\nStep 5. Now choose the radio button Use the following DNS server addresses there and there will be written some default IP, simply clear them. Now there fill the value of google DNS value that is 8.8.8.8 OR 8.8.4.4 and then simply click on “OK” and then restart your network/computer.\n\nPlease let me know if you're still experiencing this issue. :D.\n\nThanks\nSwhyper","replies":[{"poster":"saviour098","date":"2017-08-15T06:41:23.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you ill try this now","replies":[{"poster":"saviour098","date":"2017-08-15T07:05:01.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok tried it and its the actual account that wont be accepted, i made sure i was on oce  for the website and thats how i use this account \non both the website and game sign in its kind of a pain when an account you put abit of time into cant be accesed for no reason given\nive sent two tickets to riot support so hopefully they can help just wanted to see if there were any other ways or reason of why it how it happend\n","replies":[{"poster":"         Swhyper","date":"2017-08-15T21:22:28.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good Morning Saviour,\n\nNo need to thank me, I'm here to help.
