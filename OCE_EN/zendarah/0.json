There area a couple of possibilities that are worth checking out - Black screen on loading into game can be a sign of a couple of things: \n\n1. Connection issues with the LoL game server.  See [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) for some things you can try here.\n2. Driver issues or a corrupt LoL install.  Check out [Bug Splat and Game Crashes](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes) for things you can do to make sure your install is clean and computer fully up to date.\n\nA further step I'd suggest if these things don't work would be to [get in touch with player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n\nLet me know how you go\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zabanya","date":"2016-08-04T08:00:22.514+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still have the issu now, still not working after repair and reinstall","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zendarah","date":"2015-10-27T03:52:51.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am still waiting on some help with this.
