It's possible Honour wards are going to take their place, or we will get both again, though given nothing is mentioned on the reward page, it seems likely there isn't one this year.\n\nLast year you had to be Silver+ in 2+ queues to receive the Victorious ward skin. If they do one this year I imagine the requirements will remain the same.","replies":[]}]}
