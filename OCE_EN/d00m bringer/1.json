I would very much question why you are getting a permission request, and I would certainly decline it/prevent that access.\n\nIf you submit a ticket to player support they may be able to give you some insight if it *is* something unintentionally caused by League, but it could also be something spoofing itself as League. I would certainly run an anti-virus scan as well.\n\nhttps://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"D00m Bringer","date":"2020-01-16T08:16:37.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it is league because I get the notification every time I open the client.
