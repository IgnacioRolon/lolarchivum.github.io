Win some RP with your mates and possibly skins.\r\nAlso any questions can also be posted below and I&#039;ll try my best to answer all of them!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,**\r\n\r\n{{champion:1}}","replies":[{"poster":"Cyrup","date":"2016-03-14T07:33:08.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome idea! \n\nWhen the ULoL groups idea began I was a little disappointed because I'm not currently at Uni (or Highschool, haha) but I'm sure plenty of people would appreciate the chance to be apart of something that is more available - there being plenty more Highschool students than Uni ones and all.","replies":[]}]}
