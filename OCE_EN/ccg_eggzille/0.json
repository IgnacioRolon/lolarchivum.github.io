We are a serious team under a gaming community which is growing rapidly. CCG Storm as a team recently won a tournament and are looking for a jungler who is willing to be committed as we would like to win much more.\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a mature player who will voice his mind when need be. We as a team understand that we will go through things which maybe hard and we want to work through it as a team. In saying that you must be able to communicate and mould with the team so that our admins can help you out. \r\n\r\nYou must be able to take critisim and put in the effort to improve for the team. The owners of CCG have been around since season 2 and have made challenger team before and hence have the experience and resources to make a challenger team from scratch. The post is look for a Plat + so hence you will need to improve heaps to get to challenger. \r\n\r\nWe mention this because many players have changed their attitudes once they made diamond and as a result have been removed. \r\n\r\nYou must be +18 as you may be required to travel if you are not in Sydney if there is to have lan tournaments organised. Please do not worry about costs we have those already sorted. Whether you are in Perth or Tas we have the resources to get you to sydney if need be! =)\r\n\r\nFinally we hope that you can see that we want to grow as a team to be one that will work through any issues when they arise. This has been the teams core value because we believe in intense situations, such as tournaments, this will allow us to come through when we need to the most!\r\n\r\nPlease comment below\r\n\r\nIGN\r\nYour experience in r5 or previous teams:\r\nwhy you should be picked:\r\nYour strengths:\r\nYour weaknesses:\r\nYour Goals:\r\n\r\nAdd CCG Eggzille if you are interested.\r\n\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Turlo","date":"2016-05-07T03:55:40.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"long live season 4 CCG overlords","replies":[{"poster":"Makkam","date":"2016-05-16T01:25:14.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the days","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"you me","date":"2016-05-08T07:01:30.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump, was the previous  Jungler.
