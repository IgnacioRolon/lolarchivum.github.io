Just had one question, which is the better trilogy in your eyes Twilight or Lord of the Rings? I'm personally leaning toward twilight just due to the fact that there's way better \"best girls(tm)\" (see: Traps) and Lord of the Rings has a cringy little CGI orclet(TM) based off of Penders physical characteristics, who is also voiced by Jappa Jones and has kleptomania for hand jewelry. Anyways sorry about the rant thanks for reading Tgun, big fan of you and the rest of the Avant Garde squad. Will be tuning into every HoN game of the next OPL split and rooting for youg guys!
