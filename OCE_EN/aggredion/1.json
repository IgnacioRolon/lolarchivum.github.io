I lost my Silver 1 series and another game due to this issue even after restarting my computer and league of legends. No bug-splat report popped up.\r\n\r\n(see the link and last 2 games, remade due to me not being able to connect)\r\n\r\nThis is not a network issue on my behalf, and I've narrowed it down to either the client or the game. The client has been buggy of lately and that undeniable. I've taken dodge timers and other punishments to players who dodge simply because the client bugs (such as being stuck on the \"accept/decline\" game pop up before champ select).\r\nI'm going to repair my client, but am I able to reclaim the lost LP at least?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-05T14:05:22.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The short answer is no.\n\nLP is not something that can be edited by *anyone*, and it is designed this way very specifically. This prevents abuse of the system, but also prevent some real backend grief with matchmaking and future LP gains. \n\nConsider also that it's extremely easy to spoof internet or PC issues, basically making it impossible to verify when a leave is actually the player's fault or not, and the fact that, intentional or not, you have still destroyed basically any chance your team had of winning that game.\n\nIt's especially frustrating when something happens in your series, but the cost of \"fixing\" it, is too high. Far higher than the cost of simply earning back that LP/series.","replies":[{"poster":"Aggredion","date":"2019-10-06T04:34:04.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, I thought this would be the answer.\n\nAlso to add to the issue, the repair tool did nothing, reinstalling now :/\nThanks for responding :)\n\nEdit: Reinstalling didn't work, going again","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-06T08:48:31.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try running a clean reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool: \nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends\n\nThere could be some sneaky config files causing you grief, and a clean reinstall should catch everything.\n\nIf that still doesn't fix your issue **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they should be able to help you further.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
