I propose a rework where annie is in her teens and her abilities have progressed further and tibbers also is older. if this isn&#039;t possible then I want to at least see a skin where she shows her age I mean we all have to grow up sometime right?\r\n\r\neither way I enjoy playing Annie and she hasn&#039;t really had her ability&#039;s updated much except for the occasional nerf or buff to her. and it is time to change it up. \r\n\r\nlots of luck for the future everyone and vote on the poll to tell me what you think.","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2017-05-11T14:08:21.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An older Annie would be cool! Maybe OG Tibbers is far more worn, with some hectic patches and a torn-off arm from years of love? Or even has some modifications? Do you think she'd be better at controlling her power now or barely able to keep them contained?\n\nThe problem with the ageing factor is that none of our other characters age (room for a grandma/grandpa line anyone?). To me, Annie is so unique to League because she's a little girl with a hell of an attitude. If she were to become a teen, we'd be stepping on Jinx's territory and I think we'd lose a lot of what makes Annie... Annie. An older gen skin line could do it, alongside a teenage NuNu and a left out, un-aged Amumu (forever alone), but that steps on academy territory. This would be more than a skin too, as it would be a complete character rework with a new model in-place; the old animations wouldn't fly for a taller character... which brings us back to the previous issue.\n\nBut these are mere logistics! I'd be keen to see some fanart of older Annie, or a short story at least â€” because now I'm intrigued: just how does a dangerous little girl with fire powers, a temper and a giant bear for a bud turn out?","replies":[{"poster":"datswagchicken","date":"2017-05-11T23:32:51.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what your saying but what about for a game mode time called time warp. different characters gain new skins of them being older because zilean or ekko screwed every thing up. so the teams fight on a new map (maybe an older league of legends crumbling stadium). the story behind this could be that zilean or ekko made 2 separate old timelines intercept and the only way to fix it is to take out the opposing time line so they can return to the past.\n\nas you said after annie will go back to being annie and the rest of the characters. but they all have cool skins as well as ekkos' character being less hollow and more story behind him. again this is an idea and annie is a very iconic character and the rework Idea was because her graphics are starting to look older and you can tell she has had a lot of love from the creators but she has kinda been ignored and since the rework on warwick came out so awesome (seriously I love the new warwick) that I wonder how much better her character could be if her graphics were updated along with a new cool looking skin.\n\nagain I love to play annie she was the first champion I bought and she is still fun now. but ideas can still stay idea and innovation from the public can make league of legends an even better game.\n\nall the best riot!","replies":[{"poster":"The Hanshmear","date":"2017-05-16T04:27:01.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds pretty great! Kind of like DBZ's History of Trunks where we get to see a 'future that could have been' timeline with grizzled LoL champs.  Who else would do you think would fit in this mode? \n\nAs far as reworks go, I myself am especially down with the Galio one, as each skin now feels like a legendary one. Enchants (*ahem* Blue Buff) Galio looks ace.","replies":[{"poster":"datswagchicken","date":"2017-05-16T11:28:26.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well ekko and zilean are the main characters in this maybe they fought and time was destroyed and ezreal. vel'koz and kassiden were caught up in it too. the last 3 would work very well story wise aswell, vel'koz because he was very curious about zileans tower of magic, ezreal because he was searching for the 'object' that made the mass energy to sell or something. and finally kassiden because he wants to hunt down the void i.e. vel'koz.\n\nthis I feel could work very well and the thought of these champions looking older would be very awesome. but then again annie and others could be caught up in it as well but these examples are just the ones that storys could match up with the event.\n\nbut for the game mode itself maybe the fight takes place in zileans tower or around it the teams need to take objectives until the tower on their side opens then the first team to reach the top of the tower wins.\n\nthis gamemode is a race against and with time as the objectives each team needs to take Is on the opposite teams area this could cause huge fights and would require a lot of team work.\n\nanyways hope you like this idea","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"M4ST3R0FPUPP3T5","date":"2017-05-10T23:35:58.179+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"An older Annie would be cool.

When she dies she screams and bursts into flames. When she flings Tibbers out, the fire, burning so so much that it deals great damage to her as well. He spawns and roars, scorching the earth around him. He can jump in bursts of flame, but whilst around anyone, including her own minions, but not her teammates, she deals damage to them, herself included. When he lands he explodes into a fiery, demonic creature that tears himself apart, along with everyone else, a force to be dealt with, but a delicate force, like Zac and Vlad she uses health to cast her abilities, as she gets lower on health she gets more scorched and more fire writhes out of her scars. Because she deals so much damage to herself, after teachings by an expert of draining life, she can now drain the life fire out of anyone, bursting their bodies into flames when she kills them. Her abilities would all be so much more powerful, but at what cost?   SOOOOOO HOW DO YAH LIKE IT.

Why risk breaking a champion that has worked well since 2009, just for the sole purpose of making her new?\n\nNow admittedly Annie isn't my favourite champion. her ability to last hit every minion from half HP with no cost, coupled with her ability to nuke a single champion into oblivion without counter play, is a little unsavoury for my taste. But she's hardly a menace to the game like other champions such as Lee or Yas.","replies":[{"poster":"datswagchicken","date":"2017-05-11T02:31:43.774+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a skin would work just as well, I didn't say they needed to change her. but it is strange that she never ages though.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-05-11T06:27:34.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=datswagchicken,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=EBqnonhU,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-05-11T02:31:43.774+0000)\n>\n> a skin would work just as well, I didn&#x27;t say they needed to change her. but it is strange that she never ages though.\n\nSkin for this is more suitable.
