The last game i played my comp froze so i restarted it got back into the game and came back to carry my team to a close victory and then get a Low Prio Q. so is there a way to have it so that people that actually come back to the game dont get a low prio.\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-11-12T02:27:57.144+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"no, because even if you leave for only like 5 mins they can still throw the game heavily in the opponents favour, causing you to lose when you would otherwise win.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-11-12T08:42:24.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"STORY TIME! A few days ago I had an ARAM game, was winning, took Inhibitor first with tower and inhibitor left, one of my team went and DC, VERY quickly our game turned around and we lost, like 2 team fights later we had lost all remaining buildings and only had Nexus left.\n\nOn top of that the enemy team were ass holes, giving us shit for losing so easy, even after noting we were winning and had an AFK they still continued to give us shit.\n\nNow, you are getting the low Q for a reason, that is all. I for one wish it was more punishable, having even one game turn around that quick because of someone not being there is annoying enough, imagine it happening enough to get punished for it by the system itself? How would you fell if every second game you had someone go AFK randomly for 2-5 minutes? Yeh, I thought so.\n\nNow onto your problem, why are you using a toaster for? What is the actual problem you are facing with your computer? And advising what type of computer you have would be fantastic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nerv","date":"2015-11-12T05:01:43.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, it's hard to differentiate between an AFK/Quitter and a person with genuine computer problems. They just put a blanket rule over it. If you're having computer problems, I suggest you fix it or look at other games that may be better suited to your computer functionality.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fanz","date":"2015-11-12T02:32:46.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im not saying everytime i win when i come back, just saying its a bit stupid when the person/s return to the game after having a error or a comp problem, so that the team doesnt lose. Overall you have a 50/50 chance to come back and win or lose the game. i'd just find it a bit nice if they actually thought of the person who does leave not on their own.","replies":[]}]}
