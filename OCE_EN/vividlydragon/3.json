Need an assassin? Zed and Talon are arguably safer and have much more mobility thanks to their movement options not relying on other abilities in their kit, just cooldowns.\r\n\r\n2. Need an **AP Assassin?** LeBlanc&#039;s got you covered, she&#039;s ranged meaning it&#039;s a bit harder to bully her out of lane, has better waveclear and has her escape tools built into one of her main damage sources.\r\n\r\n3. Need a durable sustained damage fighter? Darius does everything she does better thanks to his passive doing damage over time and granting him bonus stats, and he even scales pretty well too because of his true damage execute which can be recast on kill. He&#039;s not particularly mobile but the movement speed bonus from Black Cleaver (which is basically mandatory on him) give him a bit of a boost.\r\n\r\n4. Need a durable sustained damage fighter **with good single target damage/lockdown?** Camille is literally built for that, her ult even singles out a single priority target so the rest of her team can easily follow up.\r\n\r\n5. Need a durable character with sustained damage but scaling with **AP?** There aren&#039;t many who fill this role but Vladmir scales super hard and is borderline unkillable late game. Swain is in a similar situation as Vlad but requires a deeper understanding of the game to play at a similar level. Shen is a pure tank so he&#039;s not the best example here but he can pump out some pretty decent damage himself thanks to his Q percent health damage and he&#039;s got great utility thanks to his ult and taunt. Lissandra is the tankiest character there is, however she&#039;s short cooldowns letting her pump out moderate damage and brings a lot of utility thanks to her ult and W being such massive lockdown tools.\r\n\r\nWith these above points in mind I&#039;ve come up with some ideas that will either tune her towards being a better assassin or being a better AP fighter.\r\n\r\n**Assassin Diana:**\r\n\r\n**Passive - Moonsilver Blade**\r\n\r\nIf Diana basic attacks a target with the _Moonlight_ debuff she deals additional damage based on her AP and level. Additionally if **Diana procs 2 stacks** of _Moonlight_ within 3 seconds all currently active stacks of _Moonlight_ are consumed and deal **2.5% of her total AP** to all the targets afflicted with it (Each stack applies this damage individually, Moonlight stacking will be expanded upon).\r\n\r\n**Q - Crescent Strike**\r\n\r\n_Unchanged._\r\n\r\n** W - Pale Cascade**\r\n\r\n**Shield duration reduced to 3 seconds.** Rather than her shield being refreshed upon all 3 orbs being triggered she instead applies _Moonlight_ to all targets hit by the third orb.\r\n\r\n**E - Moonfall** \r\n\r\nSlow reduced by 10% across all ranks, instead** gains a small AP ratio** (perhaps 10-20%).\r\n\r\n**R - Lunar Rush**\r\n\r\n_Unchanged._\r\n\r\nI recognize there are potential issues with these changes, it may overload her damage by quite a bit or make her more susceptible to being instantly deleted before she can get her combo off but I believe they would benefit her more overall. My main issue with her current kit from an assassins point of view is that she has a 3-hit passive entirely reliant on basic attacking, which means you need to either sacrifice a bit of potential damage for some extra attack speed or lose out on damage thanks to her attack speed being pretty low.\r\n\r\nNow, onto **Fighter Diana:**\r\n\r\n**Passive**\r\n\r\nAP Ratio reduced, otherwise _unchanged._\r\n\r\n**Q**\r\n\r\nAP ratio reduced, otherwise _unchanged._\r\n\r\n**W**\r\n\r\nShield no longer has an AP ratio and instead scales with **5% Max Health**, additionally Diana gains a small burst of movement speed for 3 seconds upon proccing the third Orb.\r\n\r\n**E**\r\n\r\n**Slow reduced at all ranks** to compensate for her gaining movement speed from the third orb of her W.\r\n\r\n**R**\r\n\r\nAP ratio reduced, casting R on a target afflicted by moonlight **reduces the cooldown by 40% rather than completely resetting it.**\r\n\r\nI can see potential issues with this as well, Diana could become way too mobile for a fighter thanks to the movespeed buff from her W combined with her R, but I think it partially balances out with Black Cleaver granting movespeed to AD fighters for casting their spells too.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s far from perfect, but I hope it gives you all an idea of what I&#039;m trying to aim for, input on these ideas/expanding on them would probably benefit us all more.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-06-06T22:58:43.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sound like a rework for reworks sake to me. I don't think there's anything wrong with Diana's kit at all. Her stats could probably do with a little bit of tuning but she hardly needs a rework. \n\nAccording to oce.op.gg she has a 47% winrate. Which is definitely not good but in itself doesn't mean she needs a rework. Interestingly she has high winrates agaisnt some of pro meta picks right now in Galio, Syndra and Tayilah. Her winrate against Tayilah is almost 60%. Where as her weak match ups agaisnt velkoz, Annie and Anivia have winrates of 31%, 35% and 36%. Which suggests she has both strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThen there is her win percentage by games played. It hovers between 45% to 48% until you hit 40+ games. Where upon it jump some up over 51%. So that low winrate is at least partially because of people new to the champ rather than the champ itself. \n\nSo yeah, maybe you could tune her stats a bit but there's no way she needs a rework. Hold your horse buddy.","replies":[]}]}
