Now as we know Sivir is all about that gold, and On The Hunt is more or less a glorified disengage. As such I think they should either do 1 of 2 things to Sivir's kit.\r\n1. Change her passive to give her say a 25% increase in gold earned from unit kills, so she hits her late game faster, if not harder.\r\nOr 2. Give On the Hunt a 30-50% increase to gold earned from champion kills and assits to Sivir and her allies for the same reason.\r\nOf course this would likely need to be balanced out by adding a longer cooldown or reducing the movespeed buff when it comes to her ultimate, but I personally think it's a relatively painless way to make Sivir a bit more viable and put her on the same level as other ADC's.","replies":[{"poster":"Merciless","date":"2015-01-19T20:00:12.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or something where she can target a specific enemy champion in a relatively large radius and the killer of the target will get bonus gold. Some sort of \"Mercenary Contract\" Idea. Though i think your ideas would be overly strong, even after we point out that sivir is one of the weakest late game adc's comparitively. Her ult at the moment is more Utility than anything else, and while ive seen teamfights one due to it I agree that its not quite as strong as an ADC would hope. Shes highly team reliant, and while in teamfights her bounces means she gets off considerable damage still, she has little 1v1 trading/duelist strength","replies":[]}]}
