That's right i'm talking about Resident Evil 5, and more specifically the creature known as Uroboros.\nWhat is Uroboros? [This Thing.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/residentevil/images/f/f6/Re5-uroboros-concept.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090326221509)\nTerrifying right? And the nature of the creature fits in with Zac's abilities too! Stretching his limbs, exploding chunks of his body to be absorbed later and being the product of a experiment suit Zac rather well, even if Zac is a nice guy and Uroboros hates absolutely everything. Of course it would only be loosely based on it so Riot doesn't get their ass sued and Capcom doesn't completely lose their minds, but it all works rather well, hell you could even add a new joke on account of all the Rule #34 Zac has been featured in such as: \"I've been in enough hentai to know where this is going.\"\nOverall, I think the two designs would work rather well and should be considered to appease the mass of Zac fans. (Of course the joke is completely optional.) I've added a poll with multiple options to see what you guys think.","replies":[]}
