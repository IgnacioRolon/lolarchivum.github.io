Lee Sin has been a consistently strong champion ever since I started playing in Late Season 3, while this in itself is not a bad thing the reason behind this fact is that he&#039;s simply to powerful.\r\n\r\nLet me bring up my PoV: Lee&#039;s damage output is above average when compared to other fighters, unless he&#039;s up against an extremely strong 1v1 champion in the late game (Such as Aatrox, Jax or Irelia) he simply cannot be traded with. This translate to his clear speed, which is also on the same level of champions meant to have above average clear time such as Shyvanna and Udyr.\r\nHis kit is mostly to blame for this with its absurd ratios and the bonus attack speed from his passive,** he has a 90% bonus AD scaling on both casts of his Q, along with an 8% missing health bonus on the second cast. ** This gives him a grand total of 180% Bonus AD Scaling from one ability.\r\n**His E has an 100% bonus AD scaling** along with revealing invisible champions around him, the reveal isn&#039;t too much of a big deal however because not many champions can utilize invisibility at melee range anyway.\r\n**His ultimate alone has 200% bonus ad ratio** at all stages of the game along with a flat 600 damage at max rank, **Veigar&#039;s ult only does 50 more damage** to a target that&#039;s below 33% of their health and has an 150% AP ratio at the same point.\r\nLets assume Lee has only gotten a Black Cleaver and Warrior enchant as his damage items (this math will assume he has no runes and masteries), **his Q gets 99 bonus damage** on both casts along with the 8% missing health on the second cast, his **E gains 110 bonus damage**, and** his ult gains another 220 damage** to its already high base damage.\r\n\r\nHis raw utility is nothing to sneeze at  with an ultimate that can displace an entire team, an AOE Slow and a small shield to tip those skirmishes more in his favour.\r\n\r\nLets not forget how mobile he is too, the second cast of his Q is a dash with a pretty big range although its escaping potential isn&#039;t as high as it is for engaging. His W also has a dash which he can use to jump over walls and it&#039;s got a fairly big range as far as dashes go, on top of the meh shield he gets. Lee&#039;s also got one of the highest movement speeds in the game due to his nature as a melee champion, only being outclassed by Master Yi and Pantheon.\r\n\r\nOn top of all this Lee Sin is pretty tanky to boot, with his base magic resist being on the same level as a Shen at level 18 while his Armor is actually higher. The shield from his W is pretty meh aside from the fact that it can be applied to two people. The big problem here is the second cast, which grants him up to** 25% Lifesteal _and_ Spellvamp**. So not only is Lee healing from his basic attacks but he&#039;s also healing off of his abilities. Dump that on top of at least two tank items in a standard Lee build and Lee isn&#039;t going to be easy to kill.\r\n\r\nMany people compare him to other champions that are &quot;proficient at everything, yet master of nothing&quot; like Thresh or Warwick, but they have very specific drawbacks that make them balanced compared to Lee Sin. Thresh sacrifices a lot of potential damage by going tank, but building damage leaves him barely any room to make mistakes due to his sheer base squishiness. Warwick has practically no impact on the game until level 6, and even then he still needs items to truly start being an unkillable murderer.\r\n\r\nI know there&#039;s probably a lot of Lee Sin players who don&#039;t want him nerfed and think he&#039;s fine as he is, but there&#039;s an equally large and perhaps even bigger group who want him to be nerfed. He&#039;s simply too versatile at all stages of the game, he simply never falls off like people seem to think he does which is completely insane considering how much he can do.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Lee Sin is broke as fuck.","replies":[{"poster":"bloodmoth","date":"2016-05-24T21:30:16.220+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot are not allowed to change him, they made a really solid rework a long time ago that trimmed off excess power (ward jumping etc), reduced his ratios and increased his sustained damage (bonus attack speed after spells), then the boards collectively went nato in a way that has never been seen before or since.\n\nBesides who else could fill the role of tanky marksman mage assassin support fighter?\n\nI think the actual biggest problem for him is that he, like many champs, pays nothing for his mobility, well that and he is just straight up overloaded...\nIf he keeps his utility, his energy costs should be higher, having 7 abilities available to you and being able to use all of them is ridiculous..\n\nActually he just straight up needs changes, he is possibly one of the most mobile characters in the game while being good at nearly everything else, you cant have a specialty if your core identity is versatility, something has to give!\nEither remove his specialty of mobility, or remove his versatility.\n\nI actually think that all form swappers should have energy too in order to limit 6 spell combos so that their individual abilities could have more power, but thats another topic...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-27T08:39:24.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's get real here.... most Lee Sins (below Diamond 1 that is) are just feeders. Hit the Q... take the shot!!!!! (99% of the time, and die). They wanna be big heroes, make Insec plays, get lots of kills. But what they really do is, jack around and don't help the team, feed when they spot a kill in a no vision area, and don't build tanky enough to be relevant in teamfights.\n\nIf he was broken, he would rank inside the current meta's top 10 junglers.

I mean, there are only some reason your probs bitching bout lee:\n\n1. You got your ass handed to, by a main or a person who knows (out of common sense) to use the champ properly\n2. You're crying cause your bad @ lee\n3. You're winning a lot and you are saying 'Needs to be nerfed, he pretty shit to main'\n\nBut here are some ways to fuk lee up, need it be top or jg:\n\nTOP LANE LEE:\n\n- Get your jg to gank your lane (obvi)\n   - Get your jg to gank from tri bush rather than coming from river, forcing him down the river and getting mid land to cut him off\n   - He's pretty dangerous, if he's going either tanky or full ad, so if ur a marksman at top (E.G: Quinn, Teemo), your a good counter\n- Outplay Lee, or outsmart him xD\n\nJG LEE:\n\n- Steal his farm, invade, invade, invade.\n  - Yi is a horrible choice, shaco or eve would be more preferable really.\n  - Don't try to steal his red, unless he's really ( hp < 200) low, then try stealing it\n  - Vi is also a pretty good choice, as you can legit do a hit and run technique\n\nTLDR - Stop bitching, learn his mechanics, counter, conquer, win.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-05-25T07:18:29.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you really think Teemo is a good pick against Lee?
