I thought i was the only one. Friends who are also Gold IV with 0 lp are also showing silver borders during loading screens and a silver banner when you click on the Ranked Tab on profile. Can anyone tell me whats going on?","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2019-01-18T21:48:58.528+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only in norms and solo que it should show your gold border. \nRanked flex will show your rank flex rank. \nDon't quote me, but I think you can choose the border in other modes that dont have to reflect your ranked status.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeson","date":"2019-01-19T09:56:20.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, I already had the gold border until I believe season 9 started. Its been 2 weeks i think. I noticed my border went back to silver and i was playing norms draft. Even if you look up my account, its Aesonpogi and when you click my ranked tab, My gold IV helm will show, but the banner underneath is silver which is weird. It could just be a glitch hopefully.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-21T09:14:45.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a known issue that should be fixed next patch cycle. Basically anyone who had an artificially increased (Div 5 to 4) rank as their highest are having display issues with those highest ranks, and it's showing whatever other rank you have instead. They would have had to take down ranked mode to fix it so given it was only a cosmetic bug they made the decision to wait.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-21T09:38:19.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, next patch cycle (in 4 days I think), we'll be in Season 9, and with the live ranked border update we won't have ranked borders from the last season anyway.\n\nSo technically it'll never get fixed, they'll just brush over it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-21T10:24:53.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banner borders (which afaik will be visible in loading) will still be previous rank, ranked armour will reflect current.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Martzy","date":"2019-01-19T05:39:16.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depending what rank you finished on at the end of ranked season will show your border. So say if you are plat 3 solo/duo queue but are gold in flex, the last ranked game will determine the border that appears in the loading screen and waiting in lobby. So if your last ranked game was solo it will show your plat border however if your last ranked game was flex it will show your gold border that you acquired at the end of ranked season. However when people will view your profile it will show your highest rank even if it is flex. So if your last ranked game was silver for your example it will show the silver border in loading screen and lobby. \n\nHowever if you say that even tho your highest rank is gold 4 and it isn't showing on your profile  it might just be a bug. {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}} \n\nHope this helped to explain things :D","replies":[{"poster":"Aeson","date":"2019-01-19T09:57:27.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is, I already had the gold border until I believe season 9 started.
