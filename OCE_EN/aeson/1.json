I'm gonna give this one a shot as I think this might be a worthy topic and also, Im not 100% sure if anyone has said the same thing, so If anyone has thought of the same thing in the past, pls lemme know.\r\n\r\nLB's gameplay/lore/theme opinion:\r\nSo, as we all know Leblanc's intended gameplay was supposed to be a deceptive AP assassin who relies on getting kills early on in order to snowball and end the game quickly. However (and as we all know), Live LB is so different from this. Firstly (this is all in my opinion so pls correct me if Im wrong), Leblanc's gameplay in streams/high elo games is so different from the gameplay we see in LCS/Worlds. For example, in casual games we all know how she can easily dominate when she's ahead, however, like the majority of games in LCS/Words, she gets counter picked a lot and pro players will play safe to deny her easy kills. When she gets counter picked. she either plans a set up with the jungler to get kills, or farm until late game where she can still burst people out. That kind of gameplay contradicts her intended gameplay. Thematically, I think LB should solo any champion instead of asking for help.\r\n\r\nLIVE LB's Skills:\r\nHer only 'deceptive' tools only comes from her W and passive. I honestly think that her W is fine so I'll leave it. For me, her passive doesn't give you any satisfaction at all, especially at times where you're winning lane/getting easy kills. When you're winning lane or having an easy game it almost feel like LB doesn't have a passive skill, because what happens is you're now bursting anyone in the enemy team before they can retaliate back. In saying that, her deception tools only narrows to her W. However in counter match ups/harder games, that's where LB's passive mostly kicks in. For example, when you get caught out or it's late game where you're opponents now have a standing chance against LB. However (However word kill incoming), you only trigger your ult once your HP depletes to 40% and after that what happens is you usually head back to restore health, fight again then that's it. It only seems like LB's passive only serves as a free jail card right? However, I've seen gameplays where the LB's passive is triggered, then she flawlessly repositions then fights back again and I think that's how it should be all of the time, not only during moments where she only has 40% left or close to dying.\r\n\r\nNew Passive Idea:\r\nMirror Image now triggers when LB lands any of her abilities on the enemy. ( I wanted a 30 sec CD but I think that's way too op?) CD is 1 min just like LB's Live passive. So just like her current passive, she disappears for 1 second then with the new passive, she reappears with a clone that is gonna use a fake skill (Remember reworked leblanc and her R passive where everytime she activates R followed by q, w or e, a clone also appears and does a fake skill. Not to be confused with activating R twice to send a clone anywhere on the map). \r\n\r\nSo when Leblanc triggers her mirror image by landing a skill, for this instance Q, this allows her to disappear for 1 second ( by being invisible, she can now reposition herself if she has to, then she can W to the enemy safely or land E without hitting any minions in the way), then she reappears with a fake clone that will hopefully confuse the enemy. She can still do her traditional fast bursty combos, i dont see how this new passive can affect it in a bad way. I think this will allow leblanc to be more pro-active in lane and has a chance to get solo kills especially during counter match ups. This new passive opens up new combos in lane, such as her Q-E. We all know how hard it is to land a chain, 1 second of invisibility is more than enough to reposition herself and land a chain successfully if done right. \r\n\r\nFInal thoughts:\r\nI do think that this proactive version of Mirror Image allows LB to deceive/confuse the enemy before she kills them. It's kinda unhealthy that LB is always relying on her W to make plays, to burst and to get herself out of harm. Having Q as her main trigger for Mirror image ( I will assume so as Q allows you to poke from a distance) allows her to scare the enemy and confuse them with her fake clone.\r\n\r\nAND THAT IS IT. LB MAIN HERE TOO THO IM ONLY IN GOLD AND A NOOB :( \r\n\r\nLAST TLDR: \r\nNEW PASSIVE MIRROR IMAGE: NOW TRIGGERS WHEN LEBLANC LANDS ANY OF HER ABILITIES ON THE ENEMY. LEBLANC BECOMES INVISIBLE FOR 1 SECOND THEN REAPPEARS WITH A FAKE CLONE THAT IS GONNA USE A FAKE SKILL ON NEARBY ENEMIES OR ENEMIES CURRENTLY HIT BY LEBLANC'S ABILITIES. 30 SECS CD IS WHAT I WANTED BUT MIGHT BE OP. SO 1MIN CD","replies":[]}
