I don't even know what's the point of reporting player behavior if i can't write their name but w/e.\n\nThere are 4~6 players who win trades around diamond 2~ Challenger tier. \nA lot of players have reported them, but suspensions are not made. \nThey appear around 3AM ~ 11AM\nAt least 3 win-traders are in a single game.\n\nSo this is how it works. At least 3 people Que up until they are matched in to same Que. \n\n2 win trader meets on same team, than that team wins no matter how bad they play, because enemy win trader just ints and plays so bad. \nThey don't purposely run down mid lane because they know they will be penalized very soon when riot looks at the VAR, \nSo this is how it works, No communications and all pings are muted. The guy builds whatever he likes and doesn't look at the map at all. \nPings are made, but  the guy walks in to the place or nearby so he can get caught by enemy team, eventually enemy team takes advantage of that and snowball through out the game. (Master tier btw). These guys plays so obviously but because their account needs to not get banned, sometimes they take on initiative actions and gets a kill as well + usually skills shots are on shot. \nIf you read this you might think, um..... maybe the guy is having a bad time or his tilted w/e. But if you look at the match history every game is being abused. Like every single game. Some people might say just dodge or w/e but they constantly changes their name so players won't recognize them so they can abuse another game for lp. \n\nAlso just on note,       Win-trading player names were exposed on OCE league Facebook but as it got bigger win trader changed their name, also players weren't suspended.\n\nI'm gonna write a name anyway even though it's going to get censored. \nThere might be more players but just take note. \n\n[NAMES REMOVED - [REPORTING OTHER PLAYERS](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-05T14:57:26.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Names are removed from boards for a variety of reasons, but essentially, a public space isn't a great place to report people.\n\nIf you feel post-game reporting isn't adequate because it's an odd or nuanced case (which win-trading often is) then you can submit a report for manual review through support:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-06T07:08:41.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And then they 'encourage' people to post idea's and the issue on the boards. it's actually a endless trap. if players are intentionally sabotaging in any form they deserve to be named if they don't get punished for it","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-06T09:45:16.088+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What if I were to say, \"Shinobigatana is a cheater and here is proof\" with a doctored screenshot. If the fake is convincing then by your argument it should be allowed to stay because you are apparently sabotaging the game and thus should be shamed. If you aren't a regular boards-goer chances are you will never see that post to be able to defend yourself.\n\nAs I said, there is a wide variety of reasons boards does not allow naming and shaming, but defending bad behaviour is *not one of them*. Privacy, protecting the incentive to reform, preventing slander/defamation, etc etc.\n\nAs for support encouraging people to post on boards, they aren't encouraging you to name and shame, they're encouraging you to discuss. If you want to report someone, then support is the place to be, but *discussion* is not their function. They don't have the time or the resources to have more than the very basic discussions with players, hence the recommendation to post here.\n\n**Tl;dr Have a report? Send it to support. Want to have a chat or discuss a behaviour? Come to boards.**","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-08T13:59:01.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"To be fair, Players that troll, Intentionally feed and intentionally ruin game play, they do not get penalized over singular game, it takes multiple games, and it takes time. However you say anything in chat, you get chat banned.\n\nMy most recent chat ban I was trying to explain to a player what he should've been doing instead of perma-pushing his lane resulting in him getting camped, I wasn't abusive until the game was over. that player said when he had 4 deaths at 8 minutes he would int, and that he did. He didn't get penalized appropriately, otherwise he wouldn't be playing games. yet im the one that get chat banned for being 'unsportsmanlike'.\nI never said that, but there is so many issues wrong with the community on OCE server at least, that is continuing to happen and be let off with, other games have had the same issues in their past yet they work out a way to greatly reduce these 'game play' issues.\nThe way the game is, it encourages people to edit the out come of the game in a negative matter. and they will get away with it most of the time. Use chat log one time and get upset with these players, you don't get a second chance you will be penalize from a singular game I have been chat banned 7 times since the end of last season 2 of the is because their system believes that asking the team if they want to ff is unsportsmanlike.

You say \"quoting Riot\" or something to that effect a lot, but then when prompted for a source you offer only your paraphraising not what was actually said verbatim. \n\nIf a support agent is giving false or misleading information then that needs to be addressed.
