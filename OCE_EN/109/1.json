One trick who only ganks bot with Elise regardless of other lane including her jungle camp. \nSo this is how it works, Elise does 3 camp that includes golem which makes him lvl 3. \nSoon as he hit lvl 3 he only goes bot, just constantly regardless of people asking him to stop. \nBecause it's a diamond 1/2 elo, and there are not many people, enemy jungler takes advantage of EB's  ganking path.\n\nElise comes bot, enemy jungler counter gank her. \nBot loses. \nShe goes bot again, enemy jungler counter gank her. \nBot loses \nShe goes bot again, enemy jungler takes rift \nBot loses 3vs2, because enemy bot is fed. \nElise goes bot again, enemy jungler counter ganks her and uses rift. \nBot loses til 2nd turret. \n \nProblem begins here, if bot laner or other teammate asks her to stop coming bot, she starts to verbally assault her teammates\nSuch as, \n* I'm a smurf anyway, you guys don't deserve to win \n* Spam Pinging a player who said something to her. \n* stfu idiot\n*So bad (SB)\n*why are you so bad \n*You are disgusting\n*hard-stuck\n*Loser, you are shit\n\nLike what the heck, I understand players who have bad game and they get upset, but she's doing this everyday. It's unacceptable and every time we try to report her and hoping she gets a chat restriction or 15 day ban, she's back again next day and start doing the same thing. \n\nI can hardly understand her game play, but I can understand because it's a solo rank and she has her own way of game style. But enemy junglers are having advantage of it and even though she knows it she continually goes in. Now an innocent player like me and others has to dodge several games when we meet her in same team, and there are players who's willing to troll when they meet EB on a same team. \n\nIs there any way she gets penalized, or players like me just have to dodge every game when i meet her. \nPlease see a VOD of her gameplay and let me know if I'm saying anything wrong. \n\nKind Regards, \nPlayer who doesn't wanna meet EB","replies":[{"poster":"Ulfsark","date":"2019-10-28T21:53:30.573+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"for what its worth SB = sha bi not 'so bad'","replies":[]},{"poster":"AkgDrink","date":"2019-10-28T17:56:46.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to see or play with players like that, I didn't play league for weeks after meeting players who trolls.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-28T22:14:39.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering how common it is, wouldn't this mean you permaquit?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ã­nstagram","date":"2019-10-28T18:26:34.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, as a high elo player myself, I have experienced the same issue with this certain player.
