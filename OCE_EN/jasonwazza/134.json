Now he&#039;ll have 6,480 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.005%)\r\n\r\nThis is the chance of hitting the bad roll 9 times in a row.\r\n\r\n&gt;When Carl hits level 40, he would have earned ~8,309 IP in the old system. Now he will have 8,460 blue essence (if every roll was bad which is 0.002%)\r\n\r\nThis is the chances of 10 hits.\r\n\r\nNow lets work with the first one quickly, to find out the odds of a bad roll occuring multiple times, we have to start with the likelihood of hitting that role, and multiply it by itself 9 times.\r\n\r\nTo get to a roll of 0.005% the percentage of a low roll you need to start with is 33% to get to 0.0046% (slightly lower, so it needs to be increased.)\r\n\r\nAnd then doing it again for the 10th time we get to 0.0023% (slightly higher, so it needs to be lowered.)\r\n\r\nNow assuming Riot just went ahead and rounded the numbers of the Percentages, I have just given you the chance to low roll your BE acquiring the minimum output.\r\n\r\n33% chance, now lets add into this fact, that riot have apparently put counter measures in, to assure you don&#039;t get this many low rolls, and i would even guess that that would mean, that this chance is in fact higher, and starts to slowly lower the more low rolls you get in a row.\r\n\r\nBut all that said, you have a minimum of 33% chance, to low roll and get the worst BE roll in the game.\r\n\r\nI wonder why we should be complaining, because sure using the low percentage rates of the low roll multiple times looks good, but it looks worse when you get that to the original number.\r\n\r\n810 BE for a level is going to occur at least 33% of the time, and the only time this is beneficial, is if your consistently a casual player, and play only for your first win of the day, if your trying to grind for a champion, you may as well assume your going to low roll, because it is so damn likely to occur.","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-11T06:49:56.825+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"In case anyone is confused with this, the 9th root of 0.00005 (same as 0.005%) is 0.33274... (same as 33.274...%). \n\nAnd you take the ninth root since we currently have the probability of all 9 levels together. \n\nSo you are just under a third likely to get the lowest BE value.\n\nI also find it interesting how they conveniently left out the percentage for getting max BE. \n\n(P.S. Yay mathematics <3 )","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-11T07:44:40.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Another interesting Stat, they are Rolling your Essence you recieve, and then giving you shards, not the other way around.\n\n35 Champions are in the category that can give you the minimum roll.\n\nThere are currently 138 champions.\n\nTrue randomness would give you a chance of 25.4% to roll into the minimum hand out.\n\nEDIT: Which would also mean you likely have a 0% chance of hitting the new champion while they are out for 7800 BE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-11T08:03:21.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"pretty much any number they've thrown in that post is incorrect, based on an assumption that shouldn't be and/or twisted around in a misleading manner like you just pointed out.\n\nalso people need to be aware that they could change the actual %s whenever they want. they may feel they need to increase champion sales further and decide to increase the chance of \"low rolls\" by, say, 5% and they would not be required to tell anybody.\n\nand that to me is the biggest difference between the 2 systems. transparency (which ironically they claim they want to be in that post). they wouldn't be able to hide it if they lowered the IP gains per game/win in the old system. but now they can cleverly tweak and adjust things invisibly.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-11T08:08:14.968+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"They aren't \"incorrect\" or based on assumption, and while they can change it at any time, this is at least a baseline we can work off, to know our chances.\n\nThe only thing that might be \"wrong\" is if they have your low rolls decrease each time you hit one, then the initial chance of hitting a low roll is higher (potentially as high as 50%) and your chances as you hit more and more decrease the chance.\n\nThey would have calculated the odds on their end, saying that a rioter would post completely false info is just not knowing the individuals at Riot, they wouldn't be allowed to give us a lot of information, just the information that can be PR'd to look good.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-11-11T08:24:01.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was referring to that whole post in general, not just the % chances they gave. in relation to the chances, as you already pointed out, they gave that really small decimal number because it looks good and conveniently left out, in laymans terms, what it is for the initial roll. im not suggesting that the chance they gave is false.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
