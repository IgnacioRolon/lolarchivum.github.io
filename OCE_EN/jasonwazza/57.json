Riot probably don't even know themselves how much of the money will be be left to be donated after all those costs are done.\nand that cant afford to publicly say \"we have raised X amount\" and then when they hand the cheque over its for Y amount (after all the expenses) because then they will get all kinds of flak from people who don't understand.\n\nIts like when you donate $2 to buy water for children in africa, your whole $2 doesn't go towards water, some of it goes towards hiring a cargo plane to take the water to the children, some of the money goes to pay for the sign that told you to donate the $2 some of it goes to pay the salary of the person who organises it etc etc. you are only probably spending 10c on the actual water itself, but you don't ring up the charity and ask them exactly how much of your money went to purchasing the actual water do you?\n\nAlso when you donate your $2, the children don't get the water the very next day! it takes months for that process to happen.\n\nAnd its always possible (however unlikely)  that enough people were butthurt that they didn't get Vi in a kangaroo suit with a silver fern in one hand and a coconut in the other. That they didn't buy the skin, and so Riot didn't raise as much money as they had hoped and so are now trying to figure out how to proceed with insufficient funds.

Different people have different tastes, I love the skin, you hate the skin, we have differing opinion, saying 'it's a shitty skin because I don't like it' is about the most useless and invalid argument you can actually give so I really wish people would stop trying to use it as one.\n\n'4 months'? As Sesshoumaru said, **6** months is nothing for a company and he's right. I wouldn't be suprised if this took more than a year. Picking the right charity (i.e one that spends 90+% on the program and <10% on administration/transport/etc etc) is hard enough and takes long enough. Getting any of those charities to respond in any short amount of time is pretty much impossible. Charities are swamped with work and they often have a very minimal budget to keep things on track.\n\nAs for making an excel spreadsheet and crunching numbers, no they can't, because the numbers are still changing. It's not as simple as 'players gave us 30 apples so charity gets 30 apples' It's more like, 'players gave us 30 apples, now we give one apple to our lawyer, one apple to the man with the cart who is going to move the apples, one apple to the in house costs of doing so, there might be a few other apples we have to give out to various people along the way to keep things moving. The the charity might take a couple of those apples to cover their costs and in the end anywhere between 20-27 of those apples actually go to a program'. So no they can't just run a spreadsheet, because the numbers are still variable, and trying to keep that number as high as possible takes time.\n\nThe teams that work on patches (balance team/champion team/skin team etc etc) are all separate from the people working on the actual business end. This is not a valid argument, because these are completely different people you are talking about. The 'delays' which are non-existent as there is no timeline for this decision have NOTHING to do with preseason.\n\nWhy the bloody hell are we bringing this up again? If you care so much about it then get off your high horse and do your damn research into why such a thing would take time. You are keeping obnoxiously high standards of a process you all know little to nothing about with a company that hasn't done it before and has never given you any precedence for those standards. You can't just oversimplify and pretend that's how the world works. Why don't we just give food to the kids in Africa? Because it's not that damn simple. Are you gonna fly to Africa with your leftover dinner in an eski and give it to them? You wouldn't even make it through customs. Moving large sums of money around TAKES TIME. 4 months is NOT TIME. Not from a large business perspective. 1 year would likely be excellent work on their part. \n\nWhy do people on here like to just scapegoat Riot into the big bad? They are by far one of the most user friendly companies in the world, and you take the shit out of them like they don't do so much for you. Would you rather League was owned by a company like EA who would churn out low quality skins with no passion behind? churn out low quality champions with no story and no spark? Let the game's balance go to shit until people start leaving and they start losing money? Release a new version of the game with fancy new graphics every couple of years and charge you way too much money for it? Riot has become what it is because they have accountability. We get to communicate with the people who actually play the game. There is personality and passion behind it instead of just some cold money making machine. Riot CHOSE the free to play model and they didn't have to. With the new crafting system coming they are giving us more way to get content THEY sunk a boatload of money into FOR FREE. So why on this earth are there people who think it's 'right' or 'good' or 'valid' to treat them like they're freaking Satan? Because they aren't magic and can't do things instantly?

We have a bit of an easier situation here, you get allocated X amount for your whole life that can be used on any approved course, when you earn over a certain amount before tax you have to start paying it back, simple.\n\nNow looking at donations, how hard is it to contact the other organisation and make out a cheque or organise a transfer? Maybe if they were transferring the money from US to OCE somewhere it may take time, but even than it shouldn't take very long considering they are just giving money away and not making a deal that they have to pay something back or whatnot.\n\nI make regular monthly donations, it took 5 minutes to setup and at the end of the financial year I get a statement I can use for tax purposes, why is adding a few more zeros an issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-14T11:00:30.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be pretty easy to just transfer over the money, but neither side wants that, both sides want the publicity that comes with a large donation and that takes time to set up properly.\nPlus its easy to give money to a research institute such as a university, but making sure that they money you give them is spent on actually researching and not renovating the carpark is another matter, you need lawyers to make a contract in that case.
