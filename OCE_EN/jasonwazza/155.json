Get the timing slightly wrong and you'll  lose (as in that instance when Galio hadn't landed). I've grabbed Poppy twice as Blitzcrank whilst channeling her ult. Once the grab broke and I got knocked back, the other time, I got knocked back but dragged Poppy with me the whole distance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-03-06T14:25:09.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Considering that the canon ball that Kalista throws is untargetable until they land, I'd say it's intentional.","replies":[]}]}
