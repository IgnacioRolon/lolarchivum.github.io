You have to remember you are giving up an AP item slot for an AD item just for the passive? These champions don't really want AD nor need it for their damage to be ridiculous.\n\nChampions who auto during their \"combo\" anyway would benefit somewhat. Esp TF, NIdalee and Akali since they have some AD scaling.\nIt would just all depend on how strong the passive really is. Because you are basically trading building a Zhonya or Ludens or something to build an AD item.\n\nI can see the theory behind it, like a Le Blanc doing her combo then Autoing before distorting out for an extra pop. But again, would the target have died anyway if you had 100 more AP instead of 75 AD?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-10T11:57:00.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly all of the\n>Lux, Morg, Ori, Syndra, Anivia, Annie, LB\n\nCan get an easy auto off during their combo.\n\nAnd the main reason behind this is that it is 25% missing health scaling, which is ludicrous, 100 AP only scales so far, but 25% missing health off someone scales a lot harder.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-02-10T16:08:41.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe when enemy team is MR heavy?

Though it certainly could be core on TF (Mid), especially against melee match ups, potentially a first item, and it most definitely is over powered when used by ranged champions. The issue i'm having with it is that 9 times out of 10, when the item would have killed someone, they would have died to the champions burst anyway. I understand that the point of the passive is to allow  true AD or auto attack assassins (Zed, Rengar, Shaco, Ekko, Evelyn, Akali, Talon ECT) who classically have difficulty with tanks,  to more easily deal with tanks, but it is highly available for abuse by bruiser & ranged champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Keith Espinosa","date":"2016-02-10T13:52:04.758+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am aware that ekko, akali and eve are AP champions, but they are also assassins who use AA's as a primary part of their burst, who fit the intended item profile of melee, auto attackers with difficulties killing tanks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-10T02:24:43.787+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"75 ad , ms and armour pen, and now everyone gets a mini zed ult\n\nBalance","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dunkmaster Vi","date":"2016-02-09T23:54:55.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't know why they added this item its ad is way to high for its passive it should be something like 40-50 ad","replies":[]}]}
