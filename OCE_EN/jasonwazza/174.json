At first I checked the League wiki page for Hunter's Talisman which says:\n\n>Unique – Tooth: _**Damaging a monster**_ applies Health Drain, which deals 25 magic damage over 5 seconds while restoring as much as health. \n\nBut when I went to test it in game I found that it actually says:\n\n>Unique – Tooth: Damaging a monster _**with a spell or attack**_ steals 25 health over 5 seconds.\n\nSince Twitch's Venom Cask applies his innate passive, and technically does no damage which could be considered spell damage, maybe that means it is working as intended. I'm not sure if there are other, similarly applied, passives we could test this on though to make sure.","replies":[{"poster":"Pured","date":"2016-11-12T05:15:57.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana's passive doesn't.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T05:23:22.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow your actually right, this Tooth Passive is confusing and inconsistent.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T03:30:53.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brand Passive - Triggers Tooth (the passive refereshes as it does damage).\n\nThis first one is a 100% showing that it should work (I will just edit the rest into this comment)\n\nFizz W Passive - Triggers Tooth\n\nSinged Q - Triggers Tooth for as long as the poison lasts.\n\nTeemo E Passive - Doesn't retrigger Tooth.\nTeemo R Poison - Does Retrigger Tooth.

If they are \"technically\" not spells then the damage they do won't be considered spell damage. That was my theory at least.\n\nI just tested Brand and you're right his passive does reapply Tooth. I then tested Darius and his Haemorrhage did not reapply Tooth. There's a chance that the way Brand's passive works is different compared to Twitch and Darius. Also, the way that Teemo's E, which is clearly a spell, doesn't reapply Tooth might mean that its damage is the same \"type\" as these two, which we might call _not-spell damage._\n\nI think we're onto something here.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T05:19:07.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the difference here is, using Twitch's W due to the Passive not procing tooth, means that it won't actually do an AoE effect on it, however Darius already gets the Tooth passive from him using his Q to AoE effect the camp and use the tooth.\n\nIt's a fundamental difference between the damages that both provide that kinda cause Twitch to need his poison to proc Tooth, whereas Teemo and Darius don't.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-12T03:26:14.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i'm going to go testing, to check your theory that it's the fact that it's a passive burn (which again i still believe should trigger it as going W>E on raptors just to get the heal is counter productive, but you do need the heal cause you take crap loads of damage)","replies":[]}]}]}
