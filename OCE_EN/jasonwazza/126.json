You could be winning,  but you did something your team mate hated.... lose game. Instead of 1 annoyed person there is 5. Ban the word smith= problem better solved then and nothing being done. Your opinions are yours alone, but so are the others who take offence and complain. Offence is taken not given. If you wouldn't say it to them to their face in front of their family in public. Then probably dont be a brave keyboard warrior...

Permanent ban\n\n*Or*, for Leavebuster, punishments:\n5 minute LPQ > 10 minute LPQ > 20 minute LPQ > 2-week ban > 3-month ban > Perma-ban\n\nThis introduces another layer into the severe punishment tiers, which will give players another (perhaps unneeded) chance to reform their behaviour (which, let's face it, is something a lot of players have been asking for), but it's not the kind of punishment that people could just \"shrug off\" like so many \"troublesome\" players do with the 2-week bans. It actually means the players will lose access to the account for a quarter of a year, and should be a very good indicator for everyone that a perma-ban is imminent.\n\nI think there's a significant amount of players that understand the need for certain behaviours (such as suicide encouragement) to be taken more seriously because of their nature and the real-world implications they create, but at the same time it does seem like the system has gone into overdrive on the whole \"political correctness\" bullcr\\*p. There needs to be some kind of tempering attitude to the whole thing, not *every* case needs to be escalated straight up the punishment tiers, for most people one hit will be enough to trigger a change (and I do believe that one of the tips in the loading screen will support that sentiment).","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-19T03:11:13.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't know about 3 months, as that seems a little extreme (and would probably lead to people creating new accounts just to troll in that 3 months)\n\n>for most people one hit will be enough to trigger a change\n\nAgreed, but that change is less likely to occur BECAUSE of escalations, hell i'm hardly less of a dick in game, i just don't talk nearly as much\n\nYou escalate one word, and you piss people off more then you make them reform.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-30T21:53:04.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this has legs.\n\nI'd also like to see the current tiers being used properly too.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2017-12-19T15:13:45.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot is doing this?
