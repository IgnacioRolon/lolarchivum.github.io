Gangplank will just poke you down with Q and you can&#039;t do anything but take it, or all in him) and these lanes are just too often something that you will find.\r\n\r\nSome good examples:\r\nGangplank\r\nVladimir\r\nSoraka\r\nRek&#039;sai (i had a game of lane rek&#039;sai the other day, against a lissandra, she was poking me for 5 minutes, and was still not realizing that my health wasn&#039;t going down)\r\nZac (i&#039;ve played plenty of lane Zac, it&#039;s rare to see much beat it because interacting with him is basically impossible.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, some of these are really niche picks, but holy shit, GP is a massive pick, same with Vlad, and Soraka is just a core Bronze-Platinum pick.\r\n\r\nMy question is what is riot&#039;s stance on these sorts of lanes, where basically, interacting with your lane opponent is killing yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-11T05:36:00.304+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For me its nasus, all has to do is ignore trades build full tank and stack \n\nMost boring match up ever","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-11T00:13:08.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, champs with heals will have sustain, but it generally comes at a trade off. {{champion:41}}  can poke, but his heals have a long cd and if he spams that together with his Q then he will be oom very soon. At early levels, people will need to keep their distance, but he's also squishy and later on he is likely to be killed if someone like {{champion:122}}  reaches him.\n\n{{champion:16}}  has no damage - jumping on her without giving her a chance to get health back is the way to play against her. {{champion:421}}  has negligible poke and should be punished if she tries to go to minions and generate Fury to get heals.\n\nIn a long laning phase, with small trades and no ganks, these champs with sustain have the advantage. Therefore, don't play in that style - go in for bigger fights, get help from your team, or go roam (that will either help the other laners, or force your laning opponent to go roam as well).\n\nI agree with you on {{champion:8}}  though. Infinite sustain, lots of damage, able to get out of almost situation with his W... there are still ways to play around him (with the right champ), but it is much more difficult than the other champs in this list.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-11T10:27:23.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">{{champion:421}}   has negligible poke and should be punished if she tries to go to minions and generate Fury to get heals.\n\nYou clearly have never played against a lane Rek'sai, there is no punishing her, a gank just forces her to burrow and E, and any damage you can do can't really outscale her damage plus her burrowing heal.\n\nShe also has innate true damage in her kit (unburrowed E) and while you call it minor poke, 100ish magic damage every few seconds isn't as small as you think.","replies":[{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-08-11T11:29:34.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You clearly don't know what poke means; it means long-range damage. The only poke that Rek'sai has is her burrowed Q, which IS very minor poke, and is difficult to land. She can be punished by people who do have poke (e.g. Pantheon and Darius), especially when her unburrowed q or e is on cooldown. She unloads her damage strictly in melee range so I did not say  to get close enough to let her do that.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-11T12:03:49.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No one has enough damage from a poke range to screw her over, because her healing is rediculous and constant.\n\nDarius is maybe the only one to be slightly annoying, and that is more because his E means you have to play smarter around ganks, but outside that, it's your only real problem.\n\nAnd that said, her Burrowed Q isn't that hard to hit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-08-11T02:48:54.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nobody mentioned Nasus in this thread? xD","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-11T10:38:29.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming you don't pick an absolutely ass matchup into the nasus, you just kill him and zone him from CS, unless of course you let him get his first 100ish stacks for free, then your going to run into problems.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-08-10T11:47:14.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have yet to see a mastery 7 yorrick, teemo, zilean, garen or kayle.

Kayle just slaps you from a distance and you have to take it because if you jump on her and try to kill her she just ults and continues to e all over you until you die to her really high magic damage and mr shred.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-08-11T01:24:27.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see many Zileans, but I feel so scummy playing him.

Zilean get's dicked on by yasou and alot of enemy zone mages since he lacks much damage but as a support the power to land basically a sona ult on the enemy botlane every 4s and harass and cc the enemy and have a revive makes him possibly the most cancerous low elo support. Whilst your thresh is flashing and trying to land those 360 hooks and then missing this guy is dominating the botlane so hard his adc doesn't even have to try to trade with you anymore until you're stunned and then they run in at the speed of light to finish you off whilst you can't fight back. You call for your jungler and you die but you manage to pick off the adc and then ... oh the enemy adc is back up again and now your udyr is stunned and slowed and he's dead now too. ZIlean isn't really a good support and he's super predictable but he's easy to play and master to the point that in low elo there is basically no counterplay.","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2016-08-11T02:51:32.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"45% cdr zilean mid Banner of Command.

Banner is a good item but honeslty he can build whatever he wants so long as he gets cdr and a bit of ap, you can get a zhonias, zzrot, iron solari, righteous glory (run at people so fast) and against some heavy ad teams I stuck a randulins into my build because why not? I would not suggest tank but you know it's not like it matters. You scale into a ball of ridiculous simple to use utility lategame and the 99%slow-stun lockdown combo on 45% cdr is such a great counter to most top lane juggernauts. 5billion stack nasus? not a problem. Super fed darius? not a problem. Full Build Morderkaiser? not a problem, 23-0 yorrick? what how did that happen.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-08-11T03:34:57.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know what Riot's stance is on these types of champs, but when you have 120+ champs there is bound to be some unbalancing.

This would be why they are the 2nd and 3rd most banned champs (behind {{champion:120}} .\n\nThe others you mentioned like {{champion:16}}  and {{champion:17}} do have team counter play.
