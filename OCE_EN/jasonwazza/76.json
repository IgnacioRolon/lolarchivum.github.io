Answering Yes or no or on a scale of how much you agree gives them quantifiable stats that they can use to get the best image of what the community at large feels about x, whereas comments are very individualised and not quantifiable, and that may not be the kind of information they are looking for in this particular case.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-11T11:26:25.859+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":">As for why the comments section would be removed in this survey, likely they wanted information on a few specific things to work on that before seeking more generalised feedback again.\n\nSo lets start with this, the only specific thing that seemed to be added for this survey was a whole \"are we banning properly\" part.\n\n>Answering Yes or no or on a scale of how much you agree gives them quantifiable stats that they can use to get the best image of what the community at large feels about x\n\nUnless the question is entirely bullshit, and has to be answered one way unless you are being dishonest/trying to make a point (which is why i made a boards post telling them to put comments sections into each part so that their answers aren't defined by their shitty ability to make unbiased questions.)\n\nSure you can quantify how many beans are in a jar, but if you want to know how many are edible, you have to ask the right question.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-11T15:57:50.399+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I didn't get the survey so I was only speculating.
