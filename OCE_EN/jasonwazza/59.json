Removal of Green wards\r\n\r\nBasically what is happening is that one shot green wards will be removed, however there are a few extra things to note for this change, the main one being that Mandrake wards have been on and off the PBE this entire season, and could be part of this change.\r\nHowever here are a few extra&#039;s to add onto this.\r\nTrinket&#039;s still exist for your normal vision, and Sightstones also exist, Pink wards are apparently becoming cheaper, Trinkets are going to be free automatic upgrades, and a major change being that Trinkets will apparently start with 2 wards.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/whbJ5lH1-the-preseasoning-day-1-open-forum-discussion?comment=001b00000000\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ql575/preseason_2016_crests_the_horizon/cwg4n36\r\n\r\nB. The increase in cost of health pots.\r\n\r\nThis is a major change, but there are a few things to note\r\nStarting gold will be increasing to 500\r\nMajor starting items will have their costs reworked to suit this\r\n\r\nMostly this affects post first buy cases, however it has also come up that this may affect junglers poorly, but never fear because the changes actually are positive for them as well, in that they can choose to start with 3 pots (hey it&#039;s more then current) or choose to start with a reworked flask (Crystalline flask still exists), that has an upgrade that can hold 5 slightly smaller flask charges (60 health, 35 mana) that refreshes stacks by killing big monsters.\r\n\r\nHonestly this change is just as positive for jungle as it is outside of jungle.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EGgAWAPd-how-will-junglers-fair-with-the-health-potion-price-increase?comment=0018\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ql575/preseason_2016_crests_the_horizon/cwg8xfv\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Removal of Mana pots\r\n\r\nSo this one also has a positive side, in that champs that have Mana problems are having their mana regen/pool being changed to accomadate for this fact, the biggest thing this is going to force as a change is that some champions may have to get Mana regen based items first in the end.\r\n\r\nAs for junglers, one of the starting items actually accomdates this as well, they on top of their flask change, will actually have 2 choices for their starting jungle items, in fact i can honestly say i think jungle is getting a lot of love with these changes.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3ql575/preseason_2016_crests_the_horizon/cwg4wfv\r\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/EGgAWAPd-how-will-junglers-fair-with-the-health-potion-price-increase?comment=0018\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis post is mostly me just trying to dispel the negative issues that people seem to be having with this Preseason orriented post by going slightly more in depth with what they are doing around the major changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Aezuros","date":"2015-10-31T20:38:14.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your hard work in breaking down and listing some of the big changes coming up. I'm not familiar yet with all the possible changes coming up for preseason League but these ones listed here seem like good and fair changes. Obviously there will probably be some imbalances in the first few iterations of patches but I'm rather optimistic that eventually things will be in a place that Riot is looking towards and that players will be satisfied with! It will certainly help alleviate the problem right now of there being a monotonous opening build for the majority of champions (.e.g junglers all go machete and 2 pots, mids have dorans ring and 2 pots etc etc).","replies":[]}]}
