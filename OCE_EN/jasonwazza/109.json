If you are playing by yourself in Dynamic Queue you are putting yourself at an immediate disadvantage by not having voice comms or other players to seriously coordinate with.\n\nThere are one of 3 things you could do to fix this:\n1)) Bring back Solo/Duo Queue with (or without) the pre-lobby role selection.\n\n2)) Have dedicated voice comms in lobby and in-game for everyone on that team to use, or even just to listen in on what teammates are saying.\n\nHere is a good video explaining a possible implementation:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQFyqtwUK8E\n\nAnd here is a list of videos going on about wanting voice:\nhttps://www.google.com.au/search?q=league+of+legends+voice+communication&tbm=vid\n\n3)) Bring back Ranked Teams. Kind of half a solution, this would allow people to get diamond or whatever with friends has they rank up together, and would allow anyone (regardless of Dynamic or old Solo Queue rank) to play together.

You don't necessarily take it as serious.\n\nThis is an obvious one, there are a decent amount of people that take the game less serious than Solo queue (especially since Solo WAS announced) and don't actually play it competitive, this was a thing in Previous seasons however Dynamic makes it happen a lot more often due to its friendly nature of play with friends.\n\n2. Is your rank your's or your friends?\n\nProbably the biggest point, this queue has your rank mean nothing, if your platinium for example, unless you were there last season you could easily be pulled up by your team of friends and have not really earned it, yes you could argue that it's just as viable a rank due to \"playing with your team mates well\" but that's a fucking cop out, as if they did that, they would rise just as quick in something like solo queue, but that's not as likely to happen because they aren't your friend's.\n\n3. This queue means there is more luck involved in ranked than ever for Solo queuers.\n\nNo matter how much this gets argued against, it's a solid point and i haven't seen a legitmate argument against it (i talk on several sets of forums), A premade has a lot more influence over a game, to the point where if you're Solo queuing, you have a lot less control in any individual game, sure \"if you're massively better than your rank\" but again this is a cop out for people that are slightly better then their rank.\n\nThere are going to be games where you can go 20/1 or 1/20 and the game's state will never change because the premade is that Good/Bad and could win it/lose it without you.\n\nSo in the end if you're solo queuing it, you're going to have your rank mostly based on luck rather than actual skill.\n\n4. It creates an \"Us against them\" environment.\n\nWhile this isn't always prevalent, this is always going to become a thing with premades some premades will ignore the Soloers and go it with only their friends for better or worse (and flame the solo player though this is a smaller part of this point, as that SHOULD be fixed by you guys.) yes that's not always the case, but it's always there, whether it's said or not, and not only for one side of the game, but both sides (since most premades are evenly matched.) and basically goes into the above point where it's basically a war of premades.\n\n5. Mismatched premades.\n\nMy god is this an annoying one, but this happens in Solo queue to an extent as well (and makes me hope to god people don't keep their rank if we eventually get Solo) where premades are just mismatched whether it's in the simple fact one is trying and the other isn't (point 1.) or whether it's because they just aren't as good as they think they are (Point 2.) you get premades that are just mismatched beyond belief, again all players in solo would be mismatched but it's to a lesser extent as it's generally not all blanketed to one side.\n\n6. Dynamic queue is not competitive TO A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.\n\nPoints 1/2/3 make this point hit home, Dynamic queue isn't as competitive, and hell i know for a fact that a lot of professionals will be pissed however for this point.\n\nThis queue will make it a lot harder to be picked up in a professional scene because of things like 2, and especially 3. \n\nBut what it does make happen is the fundamental thing we get told these days \"It's not what you know, it's who you know\" and that is a terrible thing to bring into league, especially for a competitive scene.\n\n7. Ranked 5's\n\nBack when Ranked 5's was a thing, it was an actual competitive environment where you could play with anyone and join a team, and this was a completely different Dynamic than solo queue because often times it came down to shot calling rather than anything else, this has spread into our natural queue now\n\n8. My final point i'm going to bother with, the more people in one group the more balance issues.\n\nFact is you can't tell me that there isn't going to be blatant balance issues with this premaking\n\nWith the above announcement, i had done a game the night before because a bunch of friends kept asking me my response ended up just being \"Fine i guess solo should be up long enough for me to climb anyway, but i'll likely not play as well cause i haven't for ages.\" (And yes league has fell off for me as a thing because of dynamic queue, i actually planned to go for a hard climb this season.)\n\nHere are the ranks.\nSilver 1 (Me and i'm an ex-gold)\nBronze 3\nBronze 1\nUnranked\nUnranked\n\n(the 2 unranked are my mates, they sat around a Bronze 2-4 ELO last season)\n\nVS.\n\nSilver 5\nSilver 5\nSilver 4\nSilver 3\nBronze 4\n\nAnd of course because i was our jungler and had the communication with our bot lane, it was a wipe.\n\nNow if i was a Support/ADC/Top laner it probably wouldn't have been as clean of a stomp, but me being the 1 main highly ranked player showed fairly hard, and in my own role where i can influence the entire game.\n\nLike those ranks look unbalanced no matter how you look at it, and duo's made this happen as well, but to a less horrid extent.\n\nNow why do i bring this up?\n\nBecause not only is this a balancing nightmare for you (because that sort of balance doesn't exist) but it means as long as i pick the people i can effectively reduce me MMR for a huge amount of time if i really want and make games easier.\n\nSilver 1 currently, can still queue with bronze 5's and bring my MMR down here.\nGet to gold 5? play with Silver 5's to again bring my MMR down massively.\n\nThis is an easy abuse method, that again brings us back to \"it's not what you know, but Who\"\n\nIf you know a couple of half decent Rank 5 MMR players, then you can drag your MMR way down, while still having half decent players on your team, and matchmaking can't actually make these games fair, because it's just not possible.\n\nEDIT: And fuck the board's code, did i mention i hate that you guys moved us to boards?\n\nI HATE MY NUMBERS NEVER FUCKING WORKING.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-24T05:10:15.461+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol I found the last two sentences hilarious.

To be honest, I don't think there has ever been a point in LoL (in my experience) where everyone in ranked had the same serious level. e.g. I never BM near fountain, chase kills, pad stats etc because I want to win asap and reduce chance to throw. But inevitably there are always players that don't take it as seriously as me and get over confident , try to 1v5, BM by fountain, chase kill, dont end because they dont take it as seriously. This imo hasnt changed between any year I have played ranked. (like 4 years now?? man thats long)\n\n> you could easily be pulled up by your team of friends and have not really earned it, yes you could argue that it's just as viable a rank due to \"playing with your team mates well\" but that's a fucking cop out, as if they did that, they would rise just as quick in something like solo queue, but that's not as likely to happen because they aren't your friend's.\n\nI hope I understood this point correctly, but pretty much what you are saying is playing in a premade with better players means it's easier to climb right? My main view on this is it is actually harder to climb in a premade. Crazy I know but let me explain. To be successful in a premade team, your premade needs to consistently out preform other premades. This means two things;\n\n1) You need to do everything you used to do in solo queue, outplay mechanically, champion knowledge, game knowledge etc \n2) have more effective communication, shot calling and rotations (potentially TP timings, setting up split pushes etc)\n\nThe only way to beat other premades is to out perform them on both levels. (back when it was solo/duo you only really needed to out perform on 1). Adding this second dimension actually makes it harder. \n\nLets use something similar to the situation you are listing. (its easy to get carried in a premade). I'm Silver and I really want to climb I DESERVE gold man. Luckily I am social enough to always have 3-4 gold friends on all the time, whoo! Now lets assume our average mmr is low gold.\n\nwe queue up and for 100 games cause gotta get that sweet sweet gold border. 98.6 games are against another 4/5 man queue which means if I am not carrying my weight in the mentioned areas above 1) and 2) we will more than likely just lose most of the games because we are also vsing other premades\n\nI guess TL;DR what ever advantage you think you are getting from premade queue to climb is being negated because you are vsing a premade team who have the same advantages.\n\n> There are going to be games where you can go 20/1 or 1/20 and the game's state will never change because the premade is that Good/Bad and could win it/lose it without you.\n> \n> So in the end if you're solo queuing it, you're going to have your rank mostly based on luck rather than actual skill.\n\nFirst of all let me just say, and I hope you agree with me here, the sentence about some games doesnt matter if you're 20-1 or 1-20 the game state doesnt change because the rest of your team is sooo good or bad? That has always happened right? where else does the complaints of elo hell come from? How else do players always find those few games where they go 20-1 and lose to talk about how they are way better then where they are and should definitely be higher? This is one of the biggest complaints I see from players coming to the boards/social media, \"I do well but I still lose, League is BS, Match making is BS, ELo hell etc etc\". I've seen this my entire ranked league life from whenever I began in ranked till now. (I was probably one of them every once in a while on one of my infamous tilt streaks)\n\nThis is something that has always happened, I have 2 points to raise to this.\n\n1) Of course if you look at it from a game by game basis (1 game at a time) you can never have as much impact as the 4 other people on your team even without them being a premade. By definition in a team game 1 player obviously has less impact then 4 players. (unless they are a god tier challenger player or something haha)\n\n2) But if you look at it over the course of a season, just like the elo hell complaints or my team mates are always bad complaints. It balances out. The pool of players/premades is the same for both sides, they eventually even out. The only constant is your gameplay and how you make the difference every game. I agree the game overall might be harder this season because of the added need for shotcalling/communication etc. \n\n> Mismatched premades.\n\nNot sure I've seen anyone complaining about this. Would love to see some sources but what I can say is \n\n\"Match quality (defined by the average MMR difference between players on one team vs. the opposing team) has improved slightly, giving us closer, fairer games across all tiers of ranked play.\"\n\n> Dynamic queue is not competitive TO A PROFESSIONAL LEVEL.\n\nThis is an interesting topic, but from everything I have seen pros/high elo players dont like Dynamic queue because the low population up there means they feel a pain that they shouldnt.\n\n\"98.6% of the time, premades of 4 or 5 teammates are being matched against a premade of the same size (most of the 1.4% with more divergent premade sizes come from very high and very low MMR ranges).\"\n\nI believe the biggest complaint they have is because they come across solos vs premades much more than the general player base (once again due to the low population)\n\n> Ranked 5's\n\nI dont have any data here, but in my experience (I had a a few ranked 5s teams) that was NOT a competitive queue at all. The range of MMR in each team was much to high and multiple games there were silvers vs plats in lane, or just silver vs new formed plat team. But thats just my experience. I think Ranked 5's woulda been much more competitive if it had the ranked tier restriction.\n\n> My final point i'm going to bother with, the more people in one group the more balance issues.\n\nI dont have too much to say here, its probably harder to balance groups vs solos. But we kind of do it already. We need to keep the game balanced for LCS and general player base. As for groups vs groups its still all based on MMR's so your two teams average mmrs would have needed to be pretty similar.\n\nI've definitely focused on point 2 (listed below) I definitely think that is a lot of where the hate on dynamic comes from. From my point of view I see it differently (playing in premades actually requires more skills). So would love to have a discussion around that.\n\n> you could easily be pulled up by your team of friends and have not really earned it, yes you could argue that it's just as viable a rank due to \"playing with your team mates well\" but that's a fucking cop out, as if they did that, they would rise just as quick in something like solo queue, but that's not as likely to happen because they aren't your friend's.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-24T05:24:59.589+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Just as a note here is a video that sums up my feelings very well by RedMercy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahItzHevJxM\n\n(I'm going to edit the rest in as i'd really like you to watch the video)\n\n>Lol I found the last two sentences hilarious.

That has always happened right? where else does the complaints of elo hell come from?\n\nThis is a bit different to the ELO hell complaint as in solo queue your a lot less likely to come across unwinnable/unloseable games, whereas dynamic queue takes it out of the hands of the solo and puts it into the hands of a 3-4 man premade that has a huge majority control.\n\n>I dont have any data here, but in my experience (I had a a few ranked 5s teams) that was NOT a competitive queue at all.

I think Ranked 5's woulda been much more competitive if it had the ranked tier restriction.\n\nHonestly Dynamic is trying to be what Ranked 5's should have been, but it was a competitive queue where a lot of the games came down to shot calling regardless of how mismatched laning was (from my personal experience that is)\n\nAs a whole for your last point, i just don't feel that Dynamic in any way shows a competitive environment, and has honestly stopped me from playing league for the most part DUE to this point, fact is it's who you know not what you know, and it's basically impossible to argue against.\n\nSure it takes \"more skill\" to win in a premade, but to that same extent it doesn't because you're against the same people who \"need more skill to win\" so the net change is minimal.\n\nFact is i can do shot calling, and i do when i'm in premades, and that's why i have a fairly solid win rate in premades where we are 3+ but i can't do anything in the games where i am 1/we are 2 because those same premades have too much control of the outcome.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-24T05:49:34.655+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah that video and your main argument is exactly the crux of what I want to discuss.\n\nRedmercy's video's main point was it is easier for premades to climb than solos.\nI believe this is incorrect, because like I said earlier premades vs premades so their inherent advantages are gone. I.e. the \"who you know players\" vs \"the who you know players\" so their \"advantages\" are cancelled out.\n\nAs for the TL;DR of your point \"there is always going to be a mismatch, and as long as your in a decent premade your chance of winning is increased compared to the other team.\"\n\nThis is the same argument as Elo hell, \"whoever has the better team wins, me as an individual has no impact.\"\nMy point it if you are soloing sometimes you get the better pre made, sometimes you get the worst premade, sometimes you get even premade. but over the course of a season they even out and you are the one that impacts whether you win more games or not. JUST like in solo queue. Sometimes you get the better team of solos, sometimes you get the worst team of solos, sometimes you get even teams of solos.
