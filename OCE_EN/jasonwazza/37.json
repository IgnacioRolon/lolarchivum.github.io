(except the void i believe.)\n\n>You say Riot are putting less effort into lore? I'm pretty sure it takes more effort to produce an animated feature than it does to write two paragraphs of text.\n\nDude how many videos have you seen in the 8 months?\n\nBack when JoJ ran it was actually articles of stuff quite fucking often, instead we get SHITTY videos that explain shit all really, for 10 champions.\n\nThe rest of the champions?\n\nThey aren't even canon.\n\n\nIf they did more then a sentence and a video for the champs they did once every few months i wouldn't have a problem, but honestly, most of what is now actually canon, is the new champions rather then the old.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-05-09T18:04:59.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you've never paid attention to Renekton, Nasus, Kayle, Morgana, Taric and others coming from other world, or another land, or from far away in space?\nThe void is an actual place within League's reality, unlike the unexplained worlds that the champs I just mentioned came from.\n\n\nThe Institute of War no longer being canon doesn't suddenly make Lissandra, Ashe and Sejuani not hate each other. It doesn't suddenly make Graves no longer have a beef with Twisted Fate. It doesn't remove the lore of Warwic tricking Soraka into giving up her divine immortality.\nLeona and Diana are still the bodily marks of the Sun and Moon.\n\nThe champion lore isn't suddenly non-canon. It still exists. The champions still have their reasons for existing. Nowhere has it been said that Ashe is no longer Ashe, Annie can't be Annie anymore, Viktor can't Viktor.\n\n\nAnyone who actually pays attention to stories and knows how to weigh them will know that the Institute of War was quite a Deus Ex Machina.\n\nFrom what has been said all you can deduce is that Runeterra is still Runeterra, painted just as it was with all the old champion lore, but with shit that makes it inconsistent being removed such as the Institute of War, champions coming from other worlds deep in space (Renekton/Nasus/Kayle/Morgana/etc) are now coming from places in Runeterra.\n\n\n\nYou are ranting over shit as if you've been told that 100% everything you ever knew about something has been deleted forever, when in reality you've only been told that what makes the thing you know schizophrenic is being removed.\n\n\n\nMaybe it's just me, but the Shurima event videos tieing the lore of what, eight champions together in two videos and explaining their relationship that way is pretty damn cleaver and fulfilling. But then again I had a fair bit of grievance with the lore of a lot of those champions, so I'm somewhat bias in liking that they are cleaner now.\n\nSion's complete overhaul was fan-fucking-tastic. I shouldn't need to say more here.\n\nTaric's been slated for a rework, so I expect his lore will be updated then, I wont have to take issue with him being randomly teleported to Runeterra from a distant unknown land.\n\nUrgot is slated for a Sion level rework, so expect some awesome shit from that.\n\nI expect Kayle and Morgana's lore to be updated in the future, so that they don't come from Space Heaven/Hell.\n\nNow lets see, for the majority of the champions left over you can easily just remove any mention of THE FIELDS OF JUSTICE and THE INSTITUTE OF WAR and their lore will be perfectly fine.\nExcept Nocturne, he'll need some lore update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what would I know eh? I'm just some nerd who outside of University studies loves to wrap himself in books, and video game stories/worlds.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T07:03:50.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely think they should make the lore better and put more effort into it but that would delay alot of game features (if lore came soon or first), maybe even a stroy mode.. taking you through every hero (s) and villains story.. like what happened with shen's dad/master. but that is a massive stretch","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-09T07:13:01.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the game doesn't need to make sense.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-09T07:25:09.992+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"But it doesn't need to not make sense, in fact it's made sense up until 8 months ago with this change.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T07:18:19.780+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"LOL Why include lore","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-09T07:20:11.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its like battlefield 4 and hardline","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Narvuntien","date":"2015-05-09T13:44:42.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"R.I.P... the journal of Justice","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-05-09T12:19:31.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"On NA, this very same issue is brought up weekly.
