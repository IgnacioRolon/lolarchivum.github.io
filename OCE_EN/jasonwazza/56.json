I have a small amount of experience watching another company I was involved in look for a charity to give a donation to. It is not as simple as choosing a supposedly reputable charity in a given field. The charity system in general is deeply flawed and this causes problems when large donations are involved. A key point to note is that Riot will be looking for a charity where the funds will go directly to what they are theoretically donating to. With many charities that is not the case. Essentially what happens in many charities, is that large portions of the funds donated get lost to what essentially amounts to administrative mumbo jumbo. \n\nNow I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but essentially it amounts to the cost of upkeep for the charity. Some charities end up spending upwards of 40% of donated funds on upkeep. You have to play it smart to survive as a non-profit..\n\nSo essentially, assuming you were donating to cancer research, to find a charity that you can donate to, in a scenario where at least most of the money you donated goes to actual research is quite difficult. If Riot wants to find a charity that will ensure 90% + of their donation actually goes to whatever cause it may be as opposed to upkeep of the foundation or infrastructure of the charity itself, means they have to find a charity that is self-sufficient enough to provide that.\n\nHere are two examples for you from a site I would recommend for the more casual observer. The thing you want to look at is the percentage next to Program Expenses, because it marks how much of their funds actually go to the program they are supporting.\n\nhttp://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=13283#.VlLXpnYrJhE\n99.3% in program expenses.\ni.e 0.7% funds lost to administration etc.\n\nhttp://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=10512#.VlLYOXYrJhE\n56.3% in program expenses.\ni.e 43.7% funds lost to administration etc.\n\nOf course this is one source, and these are broad examples from extremes of the spectrum so take that as you should, but this is essentially why it is so hard to find a good charity for large donations. You have to do deeper investigations into each and everyone to determine their overhead and how much is actually going into the program. Larger donations are also treated differently that the average person's $2 donation so there is that to consider/research as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2015-11-21T10:57:52.200+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/cosmic-reaver-kassadin/ Near the end of this it says its going to a charity by a poll choice. \nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/champions-skins/skin-release/galaxies-crumble-cosmic-reaver-kassadin Here it says they will be donating to somewhere in Medical services / Research \nBut yes still no response on how much and if they even given it yet and where exactly did they give the money.\nGoing to end up like another Nautilus reef again lol ","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-11-21T11:11:43.085+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Naut reef makes sense because they can't just dump that shit, but this is no excuse available.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-22T13:44:33.429+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I would be curious to know how much was raised in the end and, when they decide, which charity the money will be going to.
