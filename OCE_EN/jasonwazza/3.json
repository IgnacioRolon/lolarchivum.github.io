They could be banning the champion for the sake of:\n\n* Being Red Side - Not having first pick of a very strong champion such as Ekko at the moment sees him banned away from the enemy.\n* Pick Order - If you are last picking Ekko and someone in your team doesn't think you will get him before the other team someone may ban it away. \n* Panic Pick - Some people have habitual bans which they do when they realize at 10seconds they have to ban or risk dodge. Thus they panic and ignore your pick.\n\nJust a thing or two to think about as not everyone's a bad guy!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-12T14:01:10.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just pick who you want banned, then play who you were going to play. 2 birds, 1 stone","replies":[{"poster":"Toxic Shaco","date":"2016-04-12T22:22:46.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just stupid.\nYou select you want XXXXX (because you want him banned).\nYour team doesn't ban XXXXX because you selected him.\nYou don't pick XXXXXX.\nXXXXXX gets picked by enemy and fills game with toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-04-12T23:55:45.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"theres 6 bans of course its not going to work 100% of the time. its better than having the champ you wanted to play get troll banned by some cuck","replies":[]}]}]}]}
