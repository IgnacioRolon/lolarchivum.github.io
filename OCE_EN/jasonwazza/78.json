It's fairly moderate.\nHonour is there to encourage neutral or better behaviour towards other players, and if you're just kind of a dick and annoying to play with then you won't progress honour.\nChat restrictions and bans are a way for the community to say \"hold up, not having any of that, think about how you treat other people before you consider playing again\" when players really cross the line into consistent or extreme negative behaviour.\n\nNow, Honour could be much better at providing feedback about your behaviour other than just being really slow to progress. I can understand how that causes confusion rather than understanding as it seems some players think that if they're not getting banned then they should be progressing their honour rating at the same pace as everyone around them.\n\nThis is why quick and relevant feedback in systems is important, which leads into my next point.\n\nAutomated penalty systems. There are probably more reasons we shifted over to automated penalty systems than I myself know, but other than penalizing negative/abusive players really quickly once they've crossed a line, automated systems allow us to get feedback to those players just as fast.\nTribunal was slow as hell and single cases required a lot of reviews from players in order to achieve confidence on a case by case basis. Some players were receiving penalties months after the offending game took place, which is pretty useless for both the player being penalized and the community reporting the player.\nThe current automated system (Instant Feedback) is able to achieve pretty much instantaneous penalties and feedback to the penalized player, and is constantly being informed by the sort of behaviour players report after game, so it essentially achieves the same level of case-by-case confidence that Tribunal had.\n\nBut as always, no system is perfect. But Tribunal and Instant Feedback had and have their own cases of inaccuracies regarding negative behaviour being treated too lightly or too harshly from time to time, which is where Player Support is usually able to come in and correct it on a case-by-case basis when prompted. Of course there is Boards as well where we get to have these kinds of discussions whenever a player wants to present them, just sometimes we end up forming opinions here based on incomplete or incorrect information that can frustrate everybody involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2018-04-28T13:07:28.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"does getting constantly reported mean they are constantly negative by default?\n\nalso why is there way to improve the player base besides punishment? \nplayers should act accordingly but when punished why not go into detail on improvement.

I understand there is (rather, supposed to be) a concept of \"reform\" in the punishment systems Riot employs, but the fact that such behaviour that, by all indications, would *normally* result in an escalation to suspension has *only* resulted in an \"Honour reset\" seems to be a fairly significant slap in the face to the community. It certainly indicated that there's a lack of consistency in these kinds of scenarios.\n\nThat said, there is another factor to consider, and that's the \"behavioural history\" of the accounts in question. I don't know much about \"Imaqtpie\" ( I don't much care for streamers) but from what I understand they are rather toxic, particularly in the last few years and particularly directed towards lower elo players. That certainly seems to indicate that there is a definite history of toxic behaviours on the account, which would mean it's more likely to be banned, whereas an account that has only 1 or 2 games of toxic behaviours would be less likely to receive a ban (assuming more or less the same toxic behaviours).\n\nI can't speak for whether the \"secondary\" account of the player responsible for the logs provided by Gehirn has exhibited much, or any, toxic behaviours, but without more information on the situation we can't say for sure either way. I think it's important to consider that this might be a distinction between \"consistently toxic\" and \"inconsistently toxic\". I don't agree with the inconsistency this comparison would suggest exists within the system, but there are intricate factors to consider that we simply don't have any information on.\n\nTo put it simply, it seems like a crappy system (and situation), but there may be a \"logical explanation\" as to why this has happened based on information we don't have access to, regardless of whether it's ultimately \"right or wrong\".","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-26T14:45:57.622+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, the only reasonable reason I can think for DarkShade's chat log not resulting in a punishment is it being that accounts absolute first offence and it put them right on the edge of punishment or what I imagine is more likely, it didn't get reported.\n\nI've seen once before where there was a chat log that contributed to a manual punishment (as recent negative history) but wasn't picked up by IFS. It was blatantly racist and I was baffled it didn't get punished. The simple answer was that it didn't get reported. \n\nOf course I don't know if that is the case here, but it would make sense for honour to be affected by negative content even if it isn't reported. It's only speculation of course, since I have absolutely no idea how those two systems interact.\n\nAs for the discrepancy, it's also worth remembering that NA reports and punishes a lot more harshly than OCE does, and I imagine that was a reasonably significant factor in imaqtpie receiving a punishment for that.
