After everything you get, you then need either essence or more skin shards to make the skin. Like what the fuck is htat shit, you just payed 10x it's worth. And to make that blue essence you gotta destroy the rest of the shit you just got, to make one skin.. It's why they've gone to blue essence and made the numbers so high, so you don't realise how much money you spend for SUCH HIGH NUMBERS that are actually worth nothing anyway","replies":[]},{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-11-30T15:09:22.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When the new pre-season patch came out, I thought only the BE system was altered. \n\nThen when I went to disenchant my skin shards, I saw the value for them decrease significantly. \n\nI had saved up all my legendary battlecast kogmaw and skarner shards hoping to disenchant them in the future for a skin shard that I wanted in the future.\n\nNow they're like you said, worthless.","replies":[]},{"poster":"J O K A R","date":"2017-11-28T23:25:06.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats how riot makes $$$","replies":[]}]}
