There was a good discussion over on Reddit that provided some more detailed stats (1/2/3/4/5 man premade against 5 man premade winrates). \n\nIn fact according to the graphs provided in the Reddit thread 4+1 premades actually have a slight advantage over full 5 mans (I can only assume this is due to the  matchmaking adjustments made).\n\nThe solo winrate is a little lower, but really all of those are within 2% so it's nothing huge.\n\nNA: http://imgur.com/a/JGJQc\n\nGlobal: http://imgur.com/a/tCJrM\n\nKR: http://imgur.com/a/uWq3c\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4tsxmo/dynamic_queue_matchmaking_update/d5k1lkh","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-23T15:49:26.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So the first thing to say.\n\nWhy the fuck is this on reddit, and not a part of what they showed, legit this is useful information.\n\nSecond, I'm not sure this graph is actually showing anything, the fifth line is a 5 man winrate, so how pray tell, can a 5v5 win more than 50% of the time?\n\nHell i'm confused as to what any of the lines mean given that other one is wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-24T01:26:31.045+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's possible the vs is Blue side vs Red side, so Blue side 5 man has a fraction better winrate, but I'm not really sure on that one. It looks like these graphs were taken from internal stats (rather than made specifically for this) so likely it's a limitation of the filters they have immediately available.\n\nAs for why they were in the discussion and not in the initial post, likely the team that writes up these stat posts took the \"we want to show them but don't want to throw seven gazillion graphs at them how do we condense this\", and when people asked for the more specific info that's when Socrates jumped in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-23T23:23:10.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Why the fuck is this on reddit, and not a part of what they showed, legit this is useful information.\n\n+ It was posted in the comment section for the Dynamic Queue post over on NA and a few other regions.

But keep in mind too much information and analysis will be overwhelming for a lot of players.\n\nI'm not sure what you're asking about the graphs though.
