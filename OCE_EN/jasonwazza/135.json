Everyone is already pissed off now!\n\nThere are a few posts defending this profit seeking strategy.\n\nMeanwhile at EA, Fifa is being boycotted because of the bullshit microtransactions in swbf2 and Fifa.\n\nSome people are clueless and it will take them considerable time to catch on to the fact they are being taken advantage of.\n\nBut the problem is that for every million people who are pissed off you'll get 500k who enjoy the exploitation and another 2M who just don't care so for a while this strategy will work. But it will also reduce game population significantly and unless they have plans to recruit more kids to hand over their hard earned, a sudden loss of a measurable % of the population will mean lol will start to bleed out and die in a few years.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-11-24T05:00:46.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"FIFA is the most sold game year over year.\nIt outsells any of game franchise, yet you don't hear about this because it's not day one or week one sales, it just sells throughout the whole year.\n\nThe people that play FIFA don't care about microtransactions, they don't care about any \"controversy\", they don't care about any gaming news apart from what console they can play FIFA on and even then they don't care about all the extras of the console or any of the specs and certainly none of Microsoft or Sony's dick slinging.\n\nThey just want to play their yearly release of FIFA.\nThey occasionally pick up other games along the way depending on their tastes, but even then they don't care about any of the news around the games.\n\nYou tell these people to boycott FIFA, they wont do it even if they listen to you which they likely wont.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-24T05:08:30.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uM1NvRHx,comment-id=00000000000000010000,timestamp=2017-11-24T05:00:46.991+0000)\n>\n> FIFA is the most sold game year over year.\n> It outsells any of game franchise, yet you don&#x27;t hear about this because it&#x27;s not day one or week one sales, it just sells throughout the whole year.\n> \n> The people that play FIFA don&#x27;t care about microtransactions, they don&#x27;t care about any &quot;controversy&quot;, they don&#x27;t care about any gaming news apart from what console they can play FIFA on and even then they don&#x27;t care about all the extras of the console or any of the specs and certainly none of Microsoft or Sony&#x27;s dick slinging.\n> \n> They just want to play their yearly release of FIFA.\n> They occasionally pick up other games along the way depending on their tastes, but even then they don&#x27;t care about any of the news around the games.\n> \n> You tell these people to boycott FIFA, they wont do it even if they listen to you which they likely wont.\n\nYeah i just made it up clearly \n\nhttp://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/heres-fifa-18-fans-calling-black-friday-boycott/amp/\n\n\nhttps://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/11/22/ea-trouble-time-fifa-fans-start-boycott/\n\n\n\nhttps://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/526389/EA-Sports-respond-FIFA-Ultimate-Team-FUT-Chemistry-Glitch-RighteousOnix-Boycott/amp","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-11-24T06:38:59.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"And yet if you work at an EB Games or such the people who buy FIFA never want to hear of such things, they are there for the item they've already decided to buy and nothing changes that.\n\nWhile other customers are a lot more receptive to your spiel about whatever from pre-orders to similar games.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-24T07:02:00.115+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uM1NvRHx,comment-id=0000000000000001000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-24T06:38:59.166+0000)\n>\n> And yet if you work at an EB Games or such the people who buy FIFA never want to hear of such things, they are there for the item they&#x27;ve already decided to buy and nothing changes that.\n> \n> While other customers are a lot more receptive to your spiel about whatever from pre-orders to similar games.\n\nsorry I'm not sure I understand the point of your comment.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-11-24T07:39:13.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"VOCAL MINORITY!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T09:05:32.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=uM1NvRHx,comment-id=000000000000000100000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-24T07:39:13.597+0000)\n>\n> VOCAL MINORITY!\n\nthere is nothing wrong with a vocal minority if they have a good point to make.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-23T13:04:04.305+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Unfortunately, boards post's don't really count as \"everyone\" nor does reddit, a lot of players don't talk on any of this shit.\n\nThe \"Vocal Minority\" is pissed off.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LadNirvana","date":"2017-11-24T06:07:18.445+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Games like lol only contributes a tiny tiny portion of the money Tencent makes.
