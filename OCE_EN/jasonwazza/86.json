A lot of what we do is discussion and explanation, discussing various issues, concerns and points of interest that the players bring to the boards (and occasionally taking the initiative to start the discussion), and explaining how the in-game systems work (or, rather, how they're supposed to work based on the information Riot has given the players.\n\nYou have the Instructors who'll discuss and explain the gameplay side of things, who's strong in the current meta, what runes work well with which champions, etc (I'm fairly certain, at least). You have the Wrenchmen who discuss and explain the technical side of things, such as helping fix common technical problems. You have the Emissaries who discuss and explain the Player Behaviour side of things, how systems like Leavebuster and the IFS work, why it's wrong to say things like \"kill yourself\" (just as an example), etc.\n\nI can't blame Riot for having someone else \"sift through the sh!t\" though, because, lets face it, most of it is sh!t. I've been doing this kind of thing pretty much all year, and pretty much all the time it comes down to \"player comes to the boards to complain about being punished despite having been blatantly toxic\". Sure, you have the occasional (or should I say rare) player who you'll explain it to and it'll click and they'll realise they were in the wrong, but most of the time you'll get the generic \"that's completely unfair\" or \"they started it so why am I getting punished\" or \"why am I getting punished and they aren't\" and it pretty much always ends with something along the lines of \"f*ck you Rito\". Quite frankly, I can't help but feel glad those kinds of players get punished.\n\nI know no one has asked, but if you want to know why I accepted the offer to be a volunteer, it's just a convenience thing, it's not like it's a favour to Riot or anything. Like I said, I've been doing pretty much the same sh!t since around the start of the year and it's just easier to do that kind of thing with the resources available via the volunteer program (such as a direct line to the Rioters). Pretty much, I see people who don't seem to understand how a system works, or how what they said/did was wrong, and I feel like I should try my best to help them understand. Then when all is said and done, I think it does help alleviate the stress of it all from the OCE Rioters, like Marauder and Gehirn (just the first two to come to mind), the *people* who sludge through the muck for the \"big brass\" at central to try their best to make OCE an enjoyable experience, with things like Ocean Week. The people who actually care about the community.\n\nYou can say I'm \"white knighting\" it all you want, I don't care.
