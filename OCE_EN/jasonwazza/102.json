Because I swear the last 12 times I reported someone for role stealing in ranked, I got no response, but the 5 times I reported people for toxicity last season, i got feedback for 3 of them), but you can get warning or chat restrictions for insulting a player who steals your role and then proceeds to feed.\n\nSuch a bad system.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-17T08:05:07.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"scummy company","replies":[]},{"poster":"awf","date":"2018-01-16T23:44:27.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot hq - world sjw hq","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-01-16T19:08:56.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, don't forget that if your teammates are the ones who rage and int, they don't get any punishment whatsoever, but if you do it even slightly, then BOOM! permaban...","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2018-01-16T14:37:27.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give Riot a million $$$$ and they will listen\n\nno money no talk simple as that!","replies":[]}]}
