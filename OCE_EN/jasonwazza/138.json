There are a number of champions in this game that don't really require much skill (I main alot these) but on the flipside to that they are incredible predictable and will rarely surprise or outplay you and they generally don't have as much power and potential as higher skillcap champions.\n\nAll of this said Fiora is definitely not a lowskillcap champion and she relies on parrying alot of spells and knowing when to all in to win fights. As the super noob I am I can't do this and so I would rather play something like cho'gath who has a aoe silence, knockup, sustain, aa enhancer, massive natural tank stats and a chunking true damage ult. Play against or as cho'gath and you'll learn what lowskill-high reward means.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-08-13T13:08:05.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">All of this said Fiora is definitely not a lowskillcap champion and she relies on parrying alot of spells\n\nI started losing to her, simply because she hit me with her W's, and i couldn't actually trade with her.\n\nI had CC, and she wasn't avoiding anything, but simply won because the AS slow stopped me from fighting back.","replies":[]}]}]}
