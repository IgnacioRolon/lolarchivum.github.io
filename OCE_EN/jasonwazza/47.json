It will give you a minor power buff against Brawlers and Tanks, yet not help against Assassins or other ADCs, where Mortal Reminder will let you out trade other ADCs and give Assassins what for if they take a risky dive attempt.\nNot to mention long range sustained poke combined with Grievous Wounds will whittle away the enemy nicely, or hell a Miss Fortune ult with Mortal Reminder shreds for days.\n\nRapidfire Cannon is stupid.\nIt's far too strong at this point, it needs to be toned down.\nPerhaps in a similar fashion as they did with Tenacity. So that the longer your base range is, the less RFC gives you for it's charged shot.\nA lot of people get both Shiv and RFC, but next patch that wont be happening since only one of their passives will be allowed. (Just like how mid lanners wont be getting Frost Queen's anymore next patch ;D )\nI should probably get Shiv on MF, but I just enjoy the 8% Movespeed too much on RFC as well as the ability to just get that final Love Tap from extended range.\nRFC pretty much let's Ezreal fire his AA at the same range as his Q, and again I love the 8% movespeed too much to care about a slight increase to wave clear. Also RFC's bonus damage on hit is applied with Ezreal and MF's Qs, especially nice on Ezreal, while Shiv's bonus magic damage can be higher due to being able to crit abilities that apply on hit effects can't crit so the higher base damage of RFC is better for that.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-28T14:54:07.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure 5% of 120 damage is higher than 3.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-28T15:59:39.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What marksman is doing 120 damage with their AA at level 3?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-29T00:23:46.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never said at lv 3... i just said im pretty sure that 5% of 120 is more than 3 flat health, although ezreal and lucian could be doing 120+ damage at lv 1 to minions with 1 attack, ez q does 120+ and heals for the damage, and lucians passive counts as 1 aa (because he shoots twice in the 1 aa)","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-29T00:14:02.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"what marksman gets rid of their starting item after level 3?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-28T06:55:42.615+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Cull is fucking amazing, despite what the pros say.\n\nHint: Generally the things pros say are backed up by stats.\n\n>The stats it gives you are hardly that different from D Blade, and for something that costs the same as D Blade it ends up being cheaper with it's return actually being profitable.\n\nSo first the stat difference.\n\n- 3 AD\n- 80 Health\n- Healing after your first back (as you will generally have the LS outclass the on hit health by this point)\n+ 400 gold\n\nNow this would all be fine **if starting items were sold when the cull passive is claimed**\n\nFact is the only reason this would ever outclass doran's blade is in the case where, the starting item will be sold at the 100 CS mark, and honestly, this should only happen in the depths of bronze where farming is about who hits 100 CS by 40 minutes.\n\nFact is it lacks hard combat stats, and considering the game is early/mid game centric, Doran's blade is superior.\n\nSure the item pays for itself, but you can pay for the change to doran's blade by killing your opponent with the superior combat stats.\n\nThe only reason to get cull is to play passive, and that's not what this season is about.\n\n>Why take Mortal Reminder?\nWhy not take Mortal Reminder?\nOut of it and Lord Dominik's Regards, Mortal Reminder is just better.\n\nAre you an ADC?\n\nIf the answer is yes, and the enemy's don't have a mundo, then take Lord Dominik's.\n\nFact is you are the squishiest mother fucker in the game, and likelihood is, your also behind a level or 2 on most other people (besides the other ADC.)
