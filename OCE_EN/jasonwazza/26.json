Two full clears and a few scuttle crabs will max you out to 300 health. That's actually insane, because most champions will cap in less than 7 min, and even less if you get some counter jungle or cannon minion tax. \n\nThe power spike is even bigger if you get Cinderhulk. Since that makes your 300 health go even further.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-19T00:58:38.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just feel it's underwhelming, it's basically, you get 300 health, and then your Keystone is useless.\n\nAnd yeah i realize you can probably get it by 6, that doesn't really necessarily make it good.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-19T05:25:23.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you're right, I still think you're looking at it from a lane perspective where you have gold coming out your ass.
