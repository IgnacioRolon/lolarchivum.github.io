They're working on it promise....\n\nAs for why he'd get such a late notification, it's possible it was a straight up bug with the notification, could have been the timing of his login, maybe he logged in but didn't play a game so it didn't refresh those notifications, or maybe it was a case that was manually reviewed (though I don't think those generate these notifications). Really I don't know, but the few times I've gotten these notifications it's always pretty much straight after the game (it's called the IFS for a reason).\n\nI've never actually heard of anyone getting a notification that late, so most likely it was either for someone else he reported and didn't remember, or it was just a strange bug or interaction of some sort.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-29T05:57:23.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"more likely than not you had them when their report capacity filled and they got a ban, your reports are saved for ~3 weeks and if someone within that 3 week period was banned which you reported, you get notified. It could just be they were notified, but because they didn't log in they never viewed the message, so it would have the appearance of a longer time frame.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-29T06:19:09.763+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah I suspect him not seeing it had something to do with him being inactive for so long.
