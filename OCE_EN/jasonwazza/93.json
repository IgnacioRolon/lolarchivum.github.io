This is classic JasonWazza. He flames every single \"bronzie\" that makes a post similar to this. He even makes separate threads complaining about the amount of \"bronzies\" that make these posts. On one occasion he begged for a ban on the forums so he didn't have to deal with these posts...\n\nFor someone in bronze and silver it can never be the case that someone \"stupid\" on their team is the main reason they lost. I mean this guy in the past has even told people that someone afk the entire game on their team wasn't the main reason they lost. It's always \"your fault\" and you lost because \"you're bad\". Somehow the same doesn't apply in his case. Oh that's right hes gold 5 and thinks that's good LOL.\n\nI mean shit, this guy deserves a ban. He'll throw the \"strawman\" argument out there but he has basically admitted that he harasses people post game as riot doesn't care and therefore he can get away with it like he does on these forums. Obviously he's not taking screenshots on those occasions.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-09T16:44:28.402+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">but he has basically admitted that he harasses people post game\n\nPlease again find where i said that, i make proper conversations post game, so that i'm not wasting people's time in game for fucking typing, if they get aggressive, or use swears, i will open up my language.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-07-10T00:48:39.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=JjrbEP9d,comment-id=0000000000010000,timestamp=2016-07-09T00:35:46.045+0000)\n>\n> Not that it matters, because as normal, if i&#x27;m going to say something to someone it&#x27;s in post game, because it holds 2 effects.\n> \n> 1. riot doesn&#x27;t care\n> 2. the person doesn&#x27;t spend the entire time typing instead of doing useful things.\n> \n> Fact is she was being stupid and was a big reason we lost, she couldn&#x27;t even one shot the squishy&#x27;s because the squishy&#x27;s had MR, and there is mountains of proof that riot doesn&#x27;t care what is said pre and post game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-10T07:36:57.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Fucking strawman, that is not at all what i said.\n\n>I said i'm not going to start a conversation during game, because of 2, the fact that i had to say she was being fucking stupid is an entirely different matter (and to be clear, she had used the same words in game from memory.)\n\n>But by all means, make any excuse you want.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-07-08T13:02:55.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> **Real talk here, why even bother?**\n> \n> + The game had ended at this point, _so why continue to lecture her on her build? _\n> \n>  She wasn't listening in-game according to you. _What makes you think the post-game would be any better? _\n \n>  I'm not sure whether you're trying to help **Annie**, or if you're trying to shift blame for the loss, but you didn't really do either of those and just made the match more salty for everyone.\n \nIt looks like she listened anyway and sold the **Rabbadon's** for a **Abyssal Scepter** to get magic penetration like you advised.
