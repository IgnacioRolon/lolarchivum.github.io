Do you think you can convince Chinese people to not be exploitative? Even if individual Rioters wanted the players to get more bang for their buck or so so on the higher ups would say no.\n\nI'm fairly certain the people in charge of LoL's revenue streams dedicate plenty of time to just how far they can squeeze their players without them boycotting or leaving the game. A lot of game companies are going that way nowadays.","replies":[{"poster":"SlothChan","date":"2017-12-08T06:53:05.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are aware that Tencent is A very large company that only interferes with Chinese League of Legends","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-12-09T07:03:47.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlothChan,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OHOUuYEW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-08T06:53:05.776+0000)\n>\n> You are aware that Tencent is A very large company that only interferes with Chinese League of Legends\n\nwat.\n\nTencent owns, like, 90% of China.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-12-09T14:38:08.951+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SlothChan,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=OHOUuYEW,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-08T06:53:05.776+0000)\n>\n> You are aware that Tencent is A very large company that only interferes with Chinese League of Legends\n\nTencent mightn't be heavily involved in League but they most certainly push Riot to make them as much money as possible. As below poster said Tencent owns a lot of companies, can and does push those they own to make as much money as possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
