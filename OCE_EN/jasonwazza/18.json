For instance if I'm hitting 500+ ping, it might not be a good idea to try a towerdive or big play with me at that moment. Probably better if I stick nearer the tower and do my darn hardest to freeze and farm, whilst you look for a play or objective elsewhere.\n\n It's far more frustrating for the person suffering the lag, then it is for you anyway, so try to be a little more empathetic, they are trying their best to help their team and honestly sometimes when I'm lagging this bad and my teammates are flaming me for it, sometimes I think it would be better to afk and see how they deal with teamfighting without their tank, adc, mage or support, because even on 800ping I'm sure as hell more useful than a dc.\n\n\nAnd you can't really blame people for when their internet acts up, not everyone lives in the cbd with satelite nbn, and picking on people for not having the absolute best internet kinda makes you sound like a spoilt brat, everyone has their own circumstances.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-05T10:34:53.513+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"1. It is way more frustrating for everyone else, i have a fucking dickhead that does this every other game, do you think that isn't frustrating?\n2. Most of the people who ping it, are WORSE then a DC, i would rather they just DC, and hell a lot of them have it at the start of a game, take the fucking leave.\n3. I don't live in the CBD (though i do currently have plans to move closer to melbourne), I live regional, i have a wireless modem, but i still make sure i check that i'm going to be able to connect properly before EVERY SINGLE GAME, and if i have bad ping, it's usually an easy fix to reset my modem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-05T11:42:03.995+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing to consider is that it isn't an easy fix for everyone. Of course if they're having connection issues every other game that's on them and they need to get it sorted out, but more often than not it's something unexpected. If it's something like a family member downloading or the like then usually they do get it fixed in a few minutes and it's not an issue.\n\nFor example I live regional as well, and have shitty Telstra ADSL 2+ with no soon hope of getting NBN because my area has \"the good copper\". Our internet isn't great on a good day (though fine for playing League) but every now again spikes for no reason. It's usually only for a minute or two and maybe only once a week, but it does happen in game from time to time (not at all often). It's something we can't do anything about, and that Telstra won't, and I'm hardly going to stop playing League for an issue that occurs so rarely.\n\nSo when I ping in game that I have 9000+ ms, I'm simply saying, I can't do jack shit for a little while, not \"omg this lag is so frustrating this happens all the time this sucks omgosh\". I'm simply trying to communicate to my team that shit is going down on my end and I'm going to be powerless to help them for a bit. Give it a minute, ping the 32 ms and we are all good and back to playing.\n\nLag is incredibly frustrating for the people playing on it, because unlike the rest of the team which only has the \"we're down a player\" frustration, those with the lag have that, and \"I can't play this game that I enjoy\" and \"I'm letting other people down\" and \"If this goes on too long I might be punished for it\" (even though for rare cases like mine a punishment is never on the table).","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-05T11:44:38.784+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sera for president.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-05T12:54:14.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Australian internet leaves much to be desired.
