I have played games verse her and with her on my team (I have picked her up, but have sadly not played her yet). I'm not trying to be a douche canoe, but are you in bronze? Lower ELO players will have no idea how to verse her, and that may be why you're stomping so hard.\n\nShe heals when she hits champs. Combined with anything like Spirit Visage, whenever she is engaged by multiple enemies, she can heal for a tonne of hp. Lower ELO players think \"More gankers = more profit\". But with Illaoi, the reverse is true. She's actually far easier to deal with 1v1. You simply have to dodge the tentacles, kill the odd one when it pops up, and treat her like any other bruiser top laner.\n\nI have never had a problem versing her. Even with squishee champs, you simply have to dodge, kill and repeat. I've never had an Illaoi on my team get 'fed', except on ARAM where those cramped quarters means Illaoi is all but bound to hit every single tentacle.\n\nIf anything, I would say she is mostly UNDERpowered. Her reliance on tentacles means she does well in top and jungle, but once if moves out of those realms, for example with ganks or team pushing other lanes, she is incredibly exposed. She also is a walking notification of her movements; if she's nearby, you can see her tentacles pop up or spawn. This is especially detrimental when trying to silently gank. Likewise, when she moves out of lane, or backs, you see her tentacles retract, meaning you can push lane or pursue other objectives.\n\nAs soon as the enemy figure out how to play against her, and shut her down in team fights so she can't blast in halfway through and hentai everyone to death, then there aren't really a lot of ways Illaoi can 'outplay' her opponents. She basically gets close, smashes with tentacles. That's it. No fancy moves like Zed, or Lee, or Yas. She's really quite basic and it requires a basic team to do poorly verse her.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-04T09:32:11.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">are you in bronze?\n\nNo this is coming from a gold ELO player (and the fact that you're a silver 5 with a 25% win rate and making this comment is fucking laughable, you're essentially a bronzie.), and the fact that you basically ignored everything i said and have only replied with \"dodge\" is pathetic, and honestly not worth replying to.","replies":[{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-05T07:29:58.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xbMHJ46r,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-01-04T09:32:11.394+0000)\n>\n> No this is coming from a gold ELO player (and the fact that you're a silver 5 with a 25% win rate and making this comment is fucking laughable, you're essentially a bronzie.), and the fact that you basically ignored everything i said and have only replied with \"dodge\" is pathetic, and honestly not worth replying to.\n\nJesus, someone is touchy! I even said I didn't mean it as an insult. If you read my comment, I wasn't insinuating that you were a Bronze player, but that you may be versing Bronze players who don't understand how to alter their gameplay when versing certain champions. I don't really need to defend my 'rank' to you, but I will say that I got to Silver, but realised I wasn't really that good (plus the number of feeders I was running into in ranked was crazy!), so have been practicing in norms ever since, and am now probably playing at a Gold level. Just because your mechanical play isn't as good as your knowledge of the game, doesn't mean your opinion counts any less, and for a \"Gold\" player, you are quite up yourself if I do say so myself!\n\nThat said, I stand by my original comment. I have never really had issue versing Illaoi. If you can dodge, you can hold lane. Maybe not win lane, but that of course is because Illaoi is a lane opponent. When she ventures out, away from her nest of tentacles, she becomes far weaker. That's her \"thing\". You deal with her the same way you deal with Nasus's laning.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
