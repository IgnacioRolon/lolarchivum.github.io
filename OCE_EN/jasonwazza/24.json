Excuse me but some people don't play League for 12 hours every single day. \n\nFor my opinion on the main topic though, and judging by the amount of \"Racist\" comments I've had deleted by Riot on these boards (which mind you make up 90% of the total comments I've had deleted over the many years I've been on here which goes to show maybe I'm not as wrong about everything I say as you think), I would say YES these kinds of people irritate me and YES I do agree that if you're going to play on an English speaking server you SHOULD know some basic form of English, as League is a game that HEAVILY relies on teamwork and communication it is vital that everyone on your team can understand each other. \n\nBut should foreigners be reported for the assumption that they are flaming you? No, that's Prejudice, and that's unfair. \n\nA way to solve something like this (Because just blatantly BANNING people from outside the country from entering our server is stupid seeing as people from OCE play on NA and other servers etc) would be a little tricky, but I have an idea that possibly could be implemented. If Riot could somehow have a translator for the in-game chat that automatically translates other languages into the desired language that has been set in your client, or maybe if having something like a translator that is always running is too much workload for the server it could be an in-game setting to toggle on/off, or a button that translates what has been typed so far in chat. Something to make it easier for universal communication, even though the multiple League servers were created to solve this issue there's not much that can be done for random foreigners who won't stay on their own server and would much rather put up with the lag.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-25T05:18:32.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a very interesting idea. A lot of translators can be dodgy but you should be able to get a relatively bare bones one working without a humongous load on the server. Obviously it wouldn't enable full communication just basic phrases and stuff that gets used a lot. Problem might come in the number of languages you include. The workload on the server would rise pretty dramatically based on the number of languages. \n\nAnother option might be some kind of macro phrase book. Kind of like pings to say a specific phrase in this specific language. Obviously since people would have to choose to use it you'd still get people ignoring it. But it would offer an alternative to get your point across.

This is naming and shaming. He intentionally left my name in the picture because he's petty and it's an attack. He clearly took the thread into paint, so he could have blocked my name out, but he didn't. Why? Because he wanted to try and get me punished. Simple as that. This is an obvious sign of rule breaking and it wasn't addressed at all. I have been banned and punished for less than this. I mentioned the guy's initials and had my post removed.\n\n2. Following point one, this is, no matter how you take it, a direct attack against my person. He plastered my name in the image and tied the entire post to it. This is not towards anyone but me. He added other small points that don't contribute anything, but this thread is nothing than a poorly masked attack.\n\n3. There's clearly offensive language in the post and nothing has been done. OP complains about toxicity yet his own post is toxic. It's alright for him to curse, right?\n\n-\n\nSummary? This is nothing but a petty attack on me because the OP is salty that I trolled him and he's mad. He turned a small deal into a big one and cried about toxicity, even though he himself is toxic, abusive, and the instigator of the situation. Remember, he reports people for not speaking English. Beleive it or not, but that's racism. I think that's a tad more extreme than me pointing out facts you can find on Wikipedia. Go ahead, I'll wait. Australia's history is listed there and everything I said is true.\n\nPeace!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-10-26T07:58:10.917+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll admit, you have a point. Looking at the original post in this thread with your comments in mind, there's clearly been more than one flaw in the moderation of this particular chain of issues. Going to be blunt here, I didn't notice the name in the screenshot Jason provided. I knew who's post it was showing, so I wasn't paying any mind to whether the name was visible. Can't speak for the Rioter(s) or the other volunteers on that, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did the same thing (we should probably work on that, though).\n\nThat's not to say it's any less inappropriate behaviour. I've brought this up internally, will be working to have this resolved ASAP. Keep in mind, Jason did (and still does) have a point. The comment in question is racist, and racism is no more appropriate than offensive language or naming and shaming. Their presentation of the issue, however, could definitely use some work (so could yours, to be honest).\n\nI just want to take a moment here to address this comment:\n> he reports people for not speaking English. Beleive it or not, but that's racism.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the players can and do have a say in what they report. Thing is, Riot encourages players to report anything they *suspect* of breaking the rules, even if that means they're reporting people who are speaking in another language because they're under the suspicion (or, in this case, assumption) those players are using offensive language, slurs (of various types), harassment, and other forms of inappropriate chat use. I wouldn't say that makes someone racist, rather that they prefer that the chat be checked for inappropriate behaviour despite their own ignorance of the language(s) in question.\n\nKeep in mind, racism is defined as \"Prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.\" (via the Oxford Dictionary), which doesn't really fit into this situation. No one so far has said they report because of race/ethnicity (even nationality), but rather because they don't know what's being said and would rather something be done *if* it needs to be. The reasons certain people feel that way may be morally questionable, but that shouldn't detract from the point that it's not a matter of racism to be reporting in such a fashion.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-10-26T23:04:06.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also wasn't your name pink \n\nEdit or was it purple.

It's very generic and I dislike reporting posts because there's no gain from it. If I report some threads I would like a purple name.","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-10-24T05:34:36.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Broken Scripts,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XsuJqeUb,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2017-10-24T04:08:35.180+0000)\n>\n> The report feature needs some work.

You have to earn it and be spotted by Riot as a helpful and nice summoner :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
