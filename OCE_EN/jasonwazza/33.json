It divided players into length of time playing the game to figure out the average time it took for players to obtain all champions in the game. The median score was between 1 and 2 seasons. I myself only took roughly 1.5 seasons to obtain all champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-18T04:47:21.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So then you did promise a Mystery Skin for connecting to Facebook on the condition that you also own all Champions.\n\nNot in the sense that JasonWazza is referring to. They are talking about when the facebook connection was introduced to the game, for which Riot promised a 4 win IP boost which should have already been given out to everyone who met the requirements.","replies":[{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-06-18T04:55:54.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-06-19T00:03:19.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As HeartVine said;\n\nWe never promised a Mystery Skin for connecting to Facebook.\n\nWe did promise a 4 win IP boost, which has already been awarded to players.\nWe did promise a Mystery Champion if players hit the milestone in Team up!\n\nHope that clears things up =)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SylvanMoon","date":"2015-06-17T14:21:27.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you get Riot Girl Tristana for liking the facebook page.. don't know if that's the same as connecting though","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-06-17T07:10:38.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot promised a 4 win IP boost (which was given out as far as I'm aware, received it on all my accounts) but no skin was promised.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-17T08:00:00.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that must have been it, I mostly brought it up because i recalled there being a thing for joining facebook, like the one in the Pool Party thing, but didn't recall getting it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-17T07:49:15.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/team-up-pool-party\nwe do get a mystery champion at 25 million points. sucks for those that already own every champion.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-17T03:19:49.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you get a default velkoz skin for free, now you have two!","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-06-16T04:47:56.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want proof that they were ever gonna give us a mystery skin for connecting with facebook","replies":[]}]}
