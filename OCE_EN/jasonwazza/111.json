Heaps of people don't even read patch notes though, heaps of people don't put in the same effort and dedication as others and a lot of the time people don't bother checking the exclamation marks etc. It isn't very straightforward and it's easily missed also. Sometimes people may assume it's the same notice as last time they were online too (For example might think it is referencing a previous disabled champ or w/e and not bother double checking).","replies":[]}]}
