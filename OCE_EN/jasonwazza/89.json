The system does not (and *cannot*) function on keywords. **[This post](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/Ifb0rpEJ-riot-should-just-make-a-list-of-banned-words-and-how-not-to-be-condescending)** does a very good job of explaining why, and the basic principle by how the system *does* work.\n.\n2. There is no single behaviour that *guarantees* escalation. There are behaviours that open that as an avenue for the system to use where it deems appropriate, as opposed to the less severe behaviours which will always follow the normal path. This was a misconception I have had in the past, and I have since clarified. It is also reflected in the FAQ you linked.\n\nSome other points that may be relevant here include:\n\n1. \"No history of punishment\" is not the same as \"no history of negativity\".\n.\n2. No two cases are the same. The system has an enormous wealth of background information that we as players do not (and will never) have access to about the players we report. If person A was punished differently from person B, *there is a reason for that*.\n.\n3. Obfuscation is frustrating, but it is also necessary. As soon as you set a hard line and say \"do not cross this\", people will skirt the edge while being as toxic as possible. A rule like \"Don't be a Jerk\" is much easier to *follow* as well as moderate. It is subjective yes, but that is the purpose of chat restrictions, to pull people up when they are skirting too close to the *M-rated, public space* definition of \"Jerk\".\n\nI will not pretend to think you will ever agree, but I can do my best to clarify. Anything else will get off-topic fast, so I'm not going to say any more on this.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-25T05:13:09.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I believe a few years ago the Riot report system went into a much more streamline automation system. It was a big shock for me because I liked the old system and felt confident that punishments would be given out appropriately. Since my return from a 2 year hiatus of not playing I am not confident anymore. As far as issues go it's not in the top 3 of Riots biggest issues for me since I know that I have a mute button and or the ability to deescalate situations if I really wanted to but knowing that it falls back on me having to do it because I don't have confidence in the system doesn't make my experience of gaming as enjoyable as it should be.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-25T11:59:56.128+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No system is perfect, but the old system had more than it's fair share of issues.\n\nI think this comes down to, why don't you have confidence in the system anymore?\n\nStatistically speaking, the new system is more accurate, requires far less oversight, punishes more immediately, and is more effective at preventing repeat occurrences of negative behaviour than the old system was. *It's not perfect*, but there is a reason the new system stuck around.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-26T03:34:13.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know the eccentricities of the system but I have noticed that reports don't even get looked at unless it's real bad or multiple people report. I have had several reports sent and at least half of them I have heard of other people got punished for the exact same issue but these ones didn't. Obviously different circumstances could have called for different measures but compared to the old system I don't see results like I used to. I have no doubt I am probably a minority and you being more on the inside of the system you get a better look at how it works and the rewards of the change but I personally can't see it. \nI really do feel like the more minor things slip threw the cracks a lot easier and I also feel like a more automated system allows for the toxic rioters to take advantage of what they can and can't get away with if they know what the system is looking for. \nAnyway no matter what there will always be bugs and disadvantages to every system used so you may as well just go with what gives the best results statistically like you said. \nIf anything like you say the people who are in charge are in charge for a reason and the judgement they make is for a reason so all we can do is hope that it is a genuine one with good intent for us and the game!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-26T04:57:51.364+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Depends what you mean by \"looked at\". Any report will trigger a review of the game and player in question by the automated system. It's a machine learning system that works on context, not on keywords (as explained in the post I linked), since keywords are extremely easy to dodge.\n\nEdge cases (e.g a player that gets reported every single game but the system can't determine why) or reports submitted through support tickets are subject to manual review, but it's a much slower process.\n\nFrom what I've seen, the biggest thing that makes people think the system isn't working is the lack of feedback. In the interest of reform and privacy in general, Riot or Support will *never* give out information about another player's account. Aside from looking for gaps in match history, you have no way of knowing if a player has been punished, and this leads people to believe that nothing is happening even when it is.\n\nThere is one notification that *sometimes* appears, but it is extremely limited. Seeing it guarantees a punishment was issued, but not seeing it does not mean one wasn't.\n\nAnother thing to consider is population. The old system required basically universal oversight (essentially making it a manual Riot reviewed system anyway), and that just isn't scalable. Such a system would not function with the population that the game now has.\n\nI get the feeling also, that you are confusing \"Rioters\" and \"players\". To be clear, a Rioter is an official employee of Riot Games, **not** someone who just plays the game.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-26T06:06:23.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol yep.
