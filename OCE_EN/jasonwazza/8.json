It made pretty good arguments that may convince some people to change.\nPersonally, I use flash on either key, depending on what the other summoners is. If I'm using mark, that goes on D with flash on F, anything else goes on F with flash on D, and every now and then, I don't even take flash (shaco, hec, etc).\n\nYou're mistaking _suspicious account behaviour_ with _proof_.\nRiot need to be **certain** of an infringement to take action, not something as flimsy as \"he changed flash key, BANHAMMER!!!\".\nIf you can't see how weak your argument is, then there is no point in this discussion.\nWhat if the cops said \"that person has many people coming and going from their house, lets arrest them for drug supply\", that wouldn't be legit, just like your argument.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tunasalad","date":"2016-09-11T10:37:29.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"It comes down to player-base numbers and Profit margin.\n\n\nOCE costs alot of money to maintain, They dont care who uses the accounts, as long as they are buying RP. \n\nYou can share accounts, boost, lend, and anything else that you can think of.\n\n**Anything goes on OCE.**\n\n\nThe worst you will get is a chat restriction. \n\n**Its very sad.\n**\n\ni know the OCE riot staff read posts like this.

Perhaps LoL has more, I do see a lot of people with skins (in ARAM where you can't always pick your 'main'), but who is to say which were purchased and which were free.\nIn saying that, you'll probably (I don't play ranked) see far more skins, the higher up the ranks you go. Very few in Bronze V, most players using skins in Diamond+.\n\nThose that do spend money, tend to spend regularly, only a few like myself have bought small amounts of RP but seldom. I have spent about $40-50, which I consider a fair contribution for a player that only enjoys limited aspects of the game (ARAM only). Most of the money made, comes from a small group that spends big, or spends regularly. All the players that play for free, keep numbers up and the player base in a healthy state. Pay to play or subscription based games tend to have much lower numbers of players, which is fine for PvE, but bad for PvP.\n\nAccount sales, boosting, etc, are negative to the financial side of the game to Rito.\nAn account that has had RP purchased on it, and is subsequently sold to another player, via 3rd party trading, is denying Rito the cash that the purchasing player would otherwise spend to get those skins, etc.\nRito gain no money from 3rd party spending, be it account sales or boosting services, and it is against their best interests to not discourage 3rd parties making money off their product/service.\nSo stop with the talk that they don't care because $$$, because that's just plain false.","replies":[]}]}]}
