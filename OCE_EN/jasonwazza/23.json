It's also worth noting that we're generally much more lenient here on boards than the systems for in game are, since even in salt posts there is usually valuable discussion that can be had, and it's a means for players to vent some frustration out of game where they aren't really offending anyone.\n\nThat said, if you truly do want a permanent boards ban it can probably be arranged, but permanent is permanent so you'd best be sure it's what you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Outis","date":"2016-11-01T11:00:44.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait a minute. so apparently flaming on boards is considered fine and not really offending anybody. but do it in-game (even if its just as banter) and get perm banned. righto.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-01T11:29:29.160+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't misunderstand, those who abuse/insult/demean people or otherwise demonstrate such verbal toxicity here on boards will have their posts deleted and will face bans just as they do in game. We try to be more lenient (where we can) on negativity which is not targeted at anyone or is born from frustration/generally harmless. For example If someone posts an all caps swear post about how they hate x champion x much and it just makes them so x rant rant salt overload, we aren't going to delete something like that.\n\nThe biggest thing to understand, and that I at least (remember that the mods are people and as such all have slightly differing opinions on what is worth a deletion/ban) always make sure to consider is that boards is a very different environment from in game. Where a non targeted salt post on boards can spawn valuable discussion at little to no cost, in game it only serves to sour the experience for 4-9 other people, and stops the keyboard warrior from playing the game, making them a further detriment.\n\nIt does not excuse the behaviour on boards by any means, but if it isn't hurting anyone, then we are happy to leave it be if there is something to be gained from it, which cannot be said for that kind of behaviour in game.\n\nGenerally speaking, those who cross the \"Don't be a jerk line\" only cross it once or twice, so we issue warnings and deletions but don't bother with bans. Those who cross it consistently naturally face bans for it.\n___\nIf you have a specific scenario in mind I'd be happy to clarify what actions I would take for it. \n\nIt's also worth noting that the report feature is there for a reason, and is a feature that is monitored, so if you do find something that breaks the rules, reporting it is the way to go.\n\n_(EDIT: If you've offended someone enough to report you, it's not \"just banter\". Just because you would react in a certain way to something, doesn't mean everyone else will react the same. I'm a big fan of dark humour, but I also respect that it isn't for everyone, and that many find it distasteful at the very least.)_","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-10-18T14:01:27.111+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing I think we can all agree on is that Riots banning system is slack.
