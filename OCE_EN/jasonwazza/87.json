Because all i see in lover level matches are smurfs that goes 21/0, and its getting very annoying to me. \nIs there a reason that they smurf, beside the fact that they don't want to get banned off of their main. It pisses me off when a Gold V is smurfing\nand calling everyone one on their team Fkin Nubs. \n\nRITO PLZ FIX","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-11T11:47:45.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically my smurf was originally going to be a top main, because my top is horrid, and with the new system that works to an extent.\n\nPersonally my skills are mostly in the Jungle/Mid and sure now with New champ select this isn't entirely necessary i'd still like to be able to get better on the roles that would likely get me placed in bronze/low silver.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-11T10:50:19.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a difference between the 'legitimate' smurfs and the ones created to be toxic/smash new players etc. The key difference being the latter is reportable and bannable. If they are just doing well then that isn't reportable, as Riot has no problems with smurfs themselves, however if they are trolling/toxic or intentionally losing games please do report them and give details.\n\n'Legitimate' smurfs are those that say, want a second account to completely reset their rank, or want the experience of levelling up with a different role to main (as switching to a role you are very inexperienced with when you are high rank and have a high normal mmr can be VERY difficult). They can be for people who want to play with lower level friends without said friends vsing super high level/rank people etc etc.\n\nIllegitimate smurfs are essentially smurfs created for any malicious reason. If the smurf exists to troll B5 or to 'n00b stomp' or as a way to be toxic without getting banned on their main then they are reportable and bannable.\n\nThis isn't a catch all, but generally speaking, if they are trolling and being an ass, report them. New accounts are punished much faster than older accounts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-03-09T12:36:01.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not the worst I have seen today ;)\nJust play a game and it will make it nice and clean again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Xrthck","date":"2016-03-11T07:34:04.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can they distinguish smurfs from a shared computer?\n\nThey can't, they're just fascist pricks who can't do what every single other multiplayer game has done before them and let people play without interfering in every small detail.","replies":[]}]}
