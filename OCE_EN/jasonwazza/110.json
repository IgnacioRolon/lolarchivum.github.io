Remember to follow a site like Surrender@20. Then you will know what they work on and there are links to posts about changes.\n\nEdit: They work on the client every PBE cycle, and when a new patch comes to live, you can expect something new coming to the client after that. Moobeat posts pictures of the new stuff like you posted above and he also posts links like this one here...\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update/changelog/7e8e741e-e83f-442e-a928-cdba47d43562#patch-profile which is kinda like a patch notes for the Alpha Client.
