The second buff is awesome; it's a buff that scales hard so if no one gets Dragon for ages or it becomes highly contested or whatever, at least with my 240 AD Darius I now have 5% Bonus to that, our 170 AD Vayne has +8.5 Damage so might eventually become useful and our support now has 105 AP instead of 100.\n\nAll of this can transfer a lost fight, into a won fight - where +75 G to me and our ADC taking bot turret then everyone not being able to Drag because the Jungler has healed or whatever or the AP mid is deterring us so the jungler can contest, or the top laners port is now up or whatever since we chose turret instead of drag is debatably bad, plus taking bot turret you can't lane freeze, you start to lose CS or are often wanting to siege mid which can in fact set your mid laner back, so realistically I would - as a top laner, prefer drag than bot turret and junglers often think like this too, ADCs are always greedy and Dragon is actually a safer option, plus things like that happen, where top laners port might come up suddenly or whatever and what was a free Dragon is now not a free dragon, or is in fact a Dragon for them and in solo queue you really shouldn't generalize rules and I believe it's simply a Jungler making a call based on his/her foresight and you should respect their calls, rather than call them stupid. They may well in fact be making a bad call, but I believe it's more a playstyle or foresight based call to open up other options for them or so they can do certain things that they want to do and either way you should respect them; because it's better to believe they're doing the right thing because often they are and should try not to tunnel vision.\n\nDragon 1 is 1 step away from dragon two.\n\nTurret 1 is not always like that.\n\nIt's easier early. Jungle might want to eliminate pressure, maybe doesn't want to have to tank it later or fight over it for the next 6 minutes or could just simply want to gank heaps and create pressure to delay the game a bit so that the scaling starts to come into effect; rather than snowball and there are millions of strategies, ideas and plans in one game. They might even have more of an idea of what their jungler is doing than you, or have had more time to check other lanes and suss things out and come up with ideas, might not want to have to tank Dragon in a few minutes instead of tank it now or might not want to tank it again at all for a long time; might want to farm for ages. I mean there are millions of ways to look at this and in a game as dynamic as League - simply stating it's not worth it isn't really that open-minded when I often as a Jungler make that call to Drag and for those exact reasons I listed. There are plenty of benefits to a dead Dragon and weighing it up against a Turret there are plenty of ways it can favour one or the other situationally, strategicaly; or playstyle wise.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-10T23:19:06.622+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1) This post was 5 months ago.\n2) it's actually a thousand times more relevant with the fact that game timers have declined, the main reason to be tunnelling dragon is 5th buff, 1st buff is still useless, 2nd buff isn't that much more useful (your over rating these buffs a lot, 15% faster pushing isn't as good as a crap load more gold.) 3rd buff is probably the most valuable buff, but you've given up so much control that if your not winning already your possibly forcing your own loss.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-11T00:30:38.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=MriQ7a81,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2015-12-10T23:19:06.622+0000)\n>\n> 1) This post was 5 months ago.\n> 2) it's actually a thousand times more relevant with the fact that game timers have declined, the main reason to be tunnelling dragon is 5th buff, 1st buff is still useless, 2nd buff isn't that much more useful (your over rating these buffs a lot, 15% faster pushing isn't as good as a crap load more gold.) 3rd buff is probably the most valuable buff, but you've given up so much control that if your not winning already your possibly forcing your own loss.\n\nI had 174 AD with 15 AD from Runes and 0 from masteries, with just Black Cleaver contributing to damage at level 12.\n\nI know 275 G is a lot. Even moreso now, but I have directly lost towers as a result of taking Vaynes tower and not being able to overextend and stop her farming as Ashe and I have also lost my own turret because of people doing Drag and Vayne scaling and pushing me back; instead of the other way around so it's not always a good idea, but if you have a team that wants a Vayne to have to push to farm then it can be good and if you have a team that doesn't want a Vayne farming near her second tier then roaming Jungle - they're often right on wanting/not wanting that and you don't what plans or ideas your Jungler has, or whoever else wants Drag so it's not a \"flat\" law that one is better than the other.\n\nPlus if I'm a level 12 Poppy with 174 AD that's 5% extra AD for me and I end up in a lot of clutches.\n\nIn fact, that 5% benefits the team a lot more often than not, than a carry who even with the solo Gold of turret (275) and giving me 125g in doing so isn't seeing how often things are a lot more clutch than revolving around one players influence and 25% primary stat boost for a team all wanting it, is 25% bonus to their effective scalings also which can be as high as almost 3:1 (Graves for example) so that \"5 AD\" per 100 can be +25 to my Q and all these things can add up to a lot.\n\nI mean that's +15 to my combo as poppy with 100 AD and can be the difference between a double kill and a shutdown which is mass gold for their team. +500g. That 125 g isn't a lot to be honest. 174 AD and that's like +30. Maybe even +70. That's a lot. The same goes for your AP Mid or AD mid, it can be like +100 damage for a Zed with his effective output being 40% more from a Deathmark and like +13 to his abilities can mean a passive proc sooner. I could be last hitting easier. There are many ways this influence of 5% can be game breaking.\n\nThat can result in snowballs etc and net me a pentakill.\n\nAn ADC with 275g is a lot of maths too, but if you look at the team scalings etc 5% is a lot. That's why Executioners is noticeable at all stages of the game and while people like Phreak might talk it down. I've seen many a clutch turned by the tiniest things and this is like 5% to everybody which can change things. 5% when they're below 40% is huge in clutch fights; I guarantee you if you go into a game without executioners and take mana regen by accident you will notice it at level one- level 18 and that's a \"rare\" 5% boost. A guaranteed one is even stronger.\n\nSo try to think of it as not just 5% AD which is 5 AD per 100, but also think about the scaling to your abilities which can be like 2:1 for a Caitlyn in one auto-headshot Q-E-Auto with ease and that's probably going to be guaranteedly at least +20 Damage and can be the difference between a kill and a comeback. +275g and some map pressure is like half an avarice blade, potentially +20% attack speed which is like 0.2 of an auto a second at like level 12 and a chance for like +80 Damage by completing that zeal early when your teamwide scaling can be like 300 Damage. That's from \"small combos\". Over the course of a few minutes that can be a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-11T00:42:58.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just so we are clear, we are not talking about 275G, we are talking about 700G, and honestly at times when dragon is taken, it's usually worth 1.4kG because generally bot could rotate to mid instead of doing dragon.\n\nNot to mention having towers down is actually a good way to have easier dragon's to secure.\n\nI'm not saying Dragon's are worthless, i am saying that Towers are worth more.\n\nFact is games are snowballing, and the gold is worth more then the upfront 6% boost, and your completely over rating this boost.\n\nThe fact that you seem to be valuing the dragon to the point of \"if we don't get this instead of a tower we will never get it\" means you really don't understand how to prep and take dragons properly.\n\nEDIT: and as an extra thing, a long sword costs 350 and gives 10 AD, generally speaking you can gain this by taking your tower (and a few extra CS as your still in lane) instead of taking dragon.\n\nThis over values your dragon until you have ~165 AD","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-11T02:37:12.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=MriQ7a81,comment-id=0003000000000000,timestamp=2015-12-11T00:42:58.991+0000)\n>\n> Just so we are clear, we are not talking about 275G, we are talking about 700G, and honestly at times when dragon is taken, it's usually worth 1.4kG because generally bot could rotate to mid instead of doing dragon.\n> \n> Not to mention having towers down is actually a good way to have easier dragon's to secure.\n> \n> I'm not saying Dragon's are worthless, i am saying that Towers are worth more.\n> \n> Fact is games are snowballing, and the gold is worth more then the upfront 6% boost, and your completely over rating this boost.\n> \n> The fact that you seem to be valuing the dragon to the point of \"if we don't get this instead of a tower we will never get it\" means you really don't understand how to prep and take dragons properly.\n> \n> EDIT: and as an extra thing, a long sword costs 350 and gives 10 AD, generally speaking you can gain this by taking your tower (and a few extra CS as your still in lane) instead of taking dragon.\n> \n> This over values your dragon until you have ~165 AD\n\nYeah but I have 174 AD with Poppy at level 12 with Black Cleaver.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-11T03:13:07.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And if your level 12, this isn't the time i'm referring to for getting dragon.\n\n>Fact is this post was made at a time where we still had junglers doing their cheesy little \"i'll solo dragon at level 3 and be useless most of the game cause i'm underleveled.\" crap.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-12-11T16:28:34.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, early dragons are now so bad to take, unless the enemy has been forced out of lane/dead.
