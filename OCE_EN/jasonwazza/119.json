It's definitely been poorly worded, what it should say is something along the lines of \"Companion apps for mobile phones add to the enjoyment and/or accessibility of games\", or just be a simple \"yes/no\" question, though the latter gives Riot a lot less to work with.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-23T07:01:08.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"Who cares about a stupid mobile app when the game is unbalanced and broken?","replies":[{"poster":"Spaghini","date":"2017-10-23T19:32:41.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-24T03:32:47.259+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using someone's in-game rank is a poor excuse, I've been playing this game for 4 years and I've seen all the changes that this game has gone through.
