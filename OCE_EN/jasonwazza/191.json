Take the profiles page for example, it is only barebones that is why we only have an overview and able to view others profile overviews. (Well done Riot, like the flow of the overview profile, coming together nicely). It would be nice to have the rune pages up soon so we can keep using the client more so than ever. The shop on the other hand isn't really a big deal right now, we can live without a store. But you can't live without runes and masteries. Just wait for what will happen, this is a long process and we all need to figure out the little things first before we get onto more releases.","replies":[]}]}
