Of all the maps to draw comparisons with, SR is honestly the one with the least connections. The elements which they've brought on (the center alter from Twisted Treeline, a Shard from Ascension and the centralised skirmishes of ARAM at the top point), are all built on the _running around a large circular map capturing points_ that made Dominion fun. I can't help but feel it's a massive improvement just by being mindless enough to not need any strategy, open-ended enough to allow nearly any champion and dynamic enough to compel me until the end of it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-05-29T04:47:20.499+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, of course if you take it super seriously and just focus on win win win you aren't going to have any fun. The whole point of rotating gamemodes are to be a fun break, they aren't meant to be treated like ranked.\n\nI agree with you completely, it's designed and executed as a casual map, trying to play it as anything else is gonna leave you dissatisfied. All in all I think it's actually a really fun gamemode (and any chance to earn those sweet mastery tokens is well worth it right? ;) ).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-05-29T04:12:58.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"capture top tower and stand under it with a stun but\n\nstale after 2 games, its only fun if i play something like akali","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-29T02:45:30.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not really.
