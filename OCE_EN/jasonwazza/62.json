Just a few responses from me to some of the things you mentioned. Lots of good points raised though :)\n\n> Stop doing instant 2 week bans off of a No-No word.\n\n+ I think the system was good before, but I have actually seen more of these recently, so it does seem like something has changed. I'm not sure what the \"settings\" are now, but I do lean a bit towards your end, there are some cases now where it's a bit harsh.\n\n  Do keep in mind though that usually the terms that apply to this are quite bad, they're usually homophobic or asking others to commit suicide. If you think it's alright to insult people like that, there really shouldn't be too many second chances.\n\n> In bans, highlight the words that have flagged an account, don't just give a chat log.\n\n+ I think this is a good idea, it's probably good for Riot to specifically point out where you went wrong. Although to be fair, it's usually pretty obvious what you should and shouldn't have said, so I'd never consider this a priority. But I'm sure there are some cases where this would be very helpful.\n\n BTW if you're not sure about a why you received a punishment, please post your chat logs on here for us and the rest of the community to look over :D\n\n> Stop using reports.\n\n+ Strongly disagree. \n\n Firstly, if you're in a 5-man premade and everyone's in on the jokes, it's not really an issue if you're using \"bad language\". There's no point in Riot scanning chat logs and banning someone in that case, since there was no harm done to anyone. It only becomes a problem when you're with other people, and not everyone is in on the jokes. That's when you can make the chat/game unenjoyable and offensive.\n \n Secondly, the entire Instant Feedback system is based off reports. It learns what kind of behaviour the community finds unacceptable by examining what is reported. If you stopped reports, Instant Feedback wouldn't be able to pick up on any new behaviour, phases or terms, and I think it's important that our detection system keeps up with that IMO. \n\n It might sound stupid, but language really does change quickly. A good example is \"cuck\". As early as 2015 that term was barely used, now it's becoming increasingly common.\n\n> Bring back tribunal\n\n+ Yeap, it's very disappointing for me to see it delayed so long. \n\n It's not a replacement for the current system of course, since it's not fast enough to deliver feedback/punishment within 15 minutes. And we [know from psychology](https://www.psychestudy.com/behavioral/learning-memory/operant-conditioning/reinforcement-punishment/delayed-reinforcement) that immediate feedback/punishment is better at changing behaviour than delayed punishment.\n\n But a tribunal would be a very welcome addition to the current tools for player behaviour we have now IMO.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-14T06:56:42.580+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">Strongly disagree.\n\n>Firstly, if you're in a 5-man premade and everyone's in on the jokes, it's not really an issue if you're using \"bad language\".

As early as 2015 that term was barely used, now it's becoming increasingly common.\n\nThe issue is, that with Reports being relied on so much, people get away with shit that isn't considered ok.\n\n3/4 man premades can group report people and have them get screwed over.\n\nAnd not only that, if your muting someone at the start of the game, likelihood is your not reporting them, even if they were doing report worthy things while muted.\n\nConsistency needs to be key in shit like this, and sadly, i don't think it matters if \"everyone is in on the jokes\" when, if your wanting to joke like that, go to discord and do it there.\n\nalso cases of bad language shouldn't be picked up anyway, this is more refering to the higher tiers of issues which people seem to get away with on a regular basis, and would give the bot a more consistent showing of bad behaviour, and give more logs to the player when they are inevitably banned.\n\n\n>Do keep in mind though that usually the terms that apply to this are quite bad, they're usually homophobic or asking others to commit suicide. If you think it's alright to insult people like that, there really shouldn't be too many second chances.\n\nThing is, i'd be fine with the system.... IF the bot could determine context, but it can't and therefore shouldn't be given free reign on this shit.\n\nContext is key in all of this shit, and lets face it, this is an algorithm, it can't determine context, and shouldn't be allowed to give instant escalations when it's not reliably able to tell the intent of someone saying things.\n\nThe ARAM example has already come up on boards where telling someone to kill themselves, is actual strategy, but the same actually applies to fucking SR as well, because sometimes the tank legitimately just needs to kill themselves, so that you can win a teamfight.\n\nUnfortunately, kys is actually a fucking broad statement, that can't be determined as bad without proper context.\n\nIf things like Kill yourself etc. weren't in the system, it'd probably be fine, mind you, i've seen the bot also actively ignore racism and not ban people, so it's a matter of the bot doesn't work like it should.\n\n>I think this is a good idea, it's probably good for Riot to specifically point out where you went wrong. Although to be fair, it's usually pretty obvious what you should and shouldn't have said, so I'd never consider this a priority. But I'm sure there are some cases where this would be very helpful.\n\nI mean it gives the player the ability to see if the context in question called for what was said, and whether they should go and contact support instantly over it.\n\n>Yeap, it's very disappointing for me to see it delayed so long.\n\n>It's not a replacement for the current system of course, since it's not fast enough to deliver feedback/punishment within 15 minutes.

But yes, it would help distill that notion that the \"word flagging algorithms\" are actually more sophisticated than they seem to be.\n\nE) can't remember exactly but the reasoning around why Tribunal was closed was something like the users were using the system how they liked, not necessarily using it in the correct way to actually punish those who did wrong. In other words, eg: people might choose to ban someone because they found the chat log funny, not because it was a toxic example that deserved punishment.\n\nPerhaps a compromise is a selective tribunal, where assorted cases are selected for community feedback whether that player should be punished or not, and these cases would be manually reviewed, while the others would still go through much of the automated process. That way, the community can feel like they are involved, but then again this may not be very clear so it may still cause miscommunication issues?\n\nF) Not sure what the argument is here (name and shame not allowed on forums, but it should be allowed in game...?)\nI guess the idea is to make it clearer on whether that report on \"Player A\" the other day actually did anything? We get the messages like \"A player you reported had been punished\" but we don't know who what when which game, and across multiple games and players; the notification seems to only go to the most recent report while the ones leading up to catching the punished player don't really get credited.\n\nBut overall, yes increased transparency and communication as to how the ban and reporting system actually works would help ease the frustration for players. It does come with the risk of making the system too open and exploitable though.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-14T05:29:56.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":">A) No idea if the instant word bans are actually like this (instant 2 weeks), but yeah that would be pretty dumb.

I also think it's utter bullshit that someone can get PERMANENTLY SUSPENDED from the game for typing a bunch of words. It makes sense if the person is intentionally being racist or homophobic, that definitely shouldn't be tolerated. But there's a difference between that and simple \"banter\" or yelling at another player. \"Banter\" is something which could easily be handled if we had a tribunal  and the players themselves made the ultimate decision whether the person was messing around or not, and even then a permanent suspension is ridiculous, just chat ban them. And \"yelling at another player\" again should be met with a chat ban. We all agree League can be tilting and frustrating, and taking someone's account away from them, that they most likely have spent hundreds of dollars on, isn't making anything better.\n\n1. They will be even more frustrated and tilted, and most likely will either take it out on someone irl OR\n2. They will simply make another account and take it out on everyone else there\n\nSo Riot you're pretty much creating MORE toxicity by your ban decisions. Stop focusing on skins and game content, and start prioritising one of the biggest issues with your game. You need to re-evaluate your ban conditions and make it something along the guidelines of:\n\n1. Permanent suspensions are given to players who are either hacking/scripting, using 3rd party software, intentionally feeding, or intentionally being homophobic/racist.\n2. Players who are toxic and flame in chat are met with a chat ban that keeps infinitely increasing in duration the longer they continue to be toxic.\n\nYou have to understand that the difference between a normal player and a toxic player is the chat, if you take that away from them, toxic players are no different than normal players. Obviously when they start doing something toxic OUTSIDE of the chat (intentionally feeding) than a perma ban is necessary since intentionally feeding can't be fixed WITH THE PUSH OF A BUTTON  (muting players/pings/emotes).","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-13T08:19:40.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The JasonWazza crusade continues.\n\nI swear, half these forum threads are started by you lately. xD\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, the system is fucked.
