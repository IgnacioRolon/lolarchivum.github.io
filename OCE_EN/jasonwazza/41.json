Wake up and realise your favourite game isn't being run by perfectionists, there is so many things wrong that have yet to be solved, or had anything done about. Notice how everything good that Riot has done: Skins, New champions, Community events, ALL INVOLVE MONEY. AS LONG AS THERE IS MONEY TO BE MADE RIOT WILL PUT ALL THEIR EFFORT INTO IT. Rather then doing something about broken matchmaking, broken balance changes, BOTS IN ARAM, broken feedback system perma banning people for \"saying bad words\"  and letting people who intentionally feed get away. \n\nAnd yet you choose to ignore these posts because you can't tell the difference between toxicity and CRITICISM.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-10T08:40:45.646+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"Having a valid criticism isn't a reason to abuse other players, especially when it's Riot and not those other players that you have a problem with. Abusing players just makes them dismiss your argument.\n\nI also wouldn't say Wazza is a \"toxic troll\", at least not in anything I've seen. So far as I know he doesn't troll in game. Do I think he has very strong opinions and is too aggressive on boards on occasion? Sure, but that doesn't mean he's a troll it means he's frustrated, and frankly I agree with the censorship bit on this one.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, if you're toxic trolling then you're the problem, not Riot, not anyone else, no matter how valid your criticism may be, you lose any high ground you had the second you turn it on innocent players. There's a reason we delete threads abusing other players, but not those calling out Riot (valid or otherwise).","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-10T09:33:05.846+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I obviously wasn't talking about threads where \"other players are abused\" I was addressing posts such as this where Riot is called out on things they are doing wrong. At no point within anything I wrote above was I talking about intentional troll posts. Those are the other half of the \"toxic trolls\", the ones that are ACTUALLY toxic. I'm referring to when the white-knights try to merge the reasonable people with the rest of the trolls and act as if they are the same. They are the people that do not get criticism, either that or they are incredibly stupid humans.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-10T09:39:56.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair enough and apologies, I misinterpreted your comment.\n\nSo long as you don't do the same with all the \"white-knights\".

Humans are always going to outsmart AI systems whether it be for better or worse, so if Riot would just spend a little more on making the game more enjoyable for everyone (e.g. hiring humans to deal with reports), in the long run it would also benefit their profit margins.\nMy friend got a 14 day suspension the other day and didn't get the email about why. I've never known them to be toxic in game, in fact they are usually very quiet. He considered the suspension a mistake but had to send in a support ticket to clarify what was going on. Fortunately they have a smurf account that they can use until the matter is cleared up.\nAs for swearing, rude words online, I've always been of the opinion that if players are too immature to handle this, then unlucky. Of course that is not Riot's policy however. They try to protect the immature players with censoring and using the automation to ban for \"toxicity\" and racism. But by doing this, they open up a different can of worms. Personally I'd be just dishing out the bans for ruining gameplay (e.g. disconnectors, trolls) because that is what wastes other players time the most in game, not just some text on the screen. A mature player can easily deal with stupid text on the screen, or stupid pings. Someone tells me \"kys\", wow man big deal. I'll give them some logic back and if they still continue personal attacks, they just get the mute button. Happens a lot.\n\nFor example the other day our team was facing the classic oce special of an all ad comp in soloqueue. We had a tank top laner and jungler. There were two idiots (Yasuo was one of them, ahem) chasing for kills and I just told them \"you don't even need to fight. All you have to do is farm, buy an armour item, and push your lanes, the game will win itself. But if you keep chasing for kills and feeding then the enemies they will snowball and you won't be able to come back to that easy win condition.\" Of course these idiots started flaming instead of actually reading what was typed and considering it. So they got the mute button eventually. Can't educate dumbarses in 20 minutes. Not worth bothering either, with those attitudes. It's annoying to lose the game that is a free win, but its OCE, it happens.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Fizz","date":"2017-10-10T15:15:08.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I got a 14 day ban for saying it out of context as in Keep yourself safe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-10-10T02:29:55.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-10T02:33:40.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You really need to learn to read.\n\nI don't hate people saying kys, i'm saying that if saying kys is bannable it should be censored.","replies":[]}]}]}
