Bring another (probably more experienced) duo into the game for the enemy team, more often then not this could easily be a boosting duo, meaning that your more then likely going to lose because more or less your Duo is inexperienced.\n2. Make the entire enemy team better players, now well this isn't inherently a bad thing, the fact that an all gold 5 team would go against an all gold 4 team simply because the gold 5 team has a duo that thought they were good isn't a good thing.\n\nDuo's tend to ruin the game's they are in whether it's because their more intent on fucking around or what.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-09T11:56:27.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I share this dislike of duos! #supportproblems","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-03-09T19:30:08.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely agree. My main roles are support and adc but when there are duos (even in last pick), they act they have a divine right to botlane.

Knowing how your adc/support plays and being able to compensate for their strengths/waeknesses is a massive advantage in a lane. I personally always let duo's lane together if they want to on this premise.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-10T06:48:06.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hint: 9/10 duos haven't played to the extent they should before they duo, if you don't have a good 20-50 games with that person, then you probably don't know them as well as you should.\n\nNot to mention, the other duo could have a lot more experience or a lot less synergy wise, not to mention they could be smurfs, in my opinion it just makes the balance of power shift way too much between 4 members of the game (2 on each team)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
