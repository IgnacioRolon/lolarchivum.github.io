Riot isn't here to fix every problem you have. They aren't the best of a Company but holy shit it's the worlds biggest game with hundreds of things that can go wrong within a matter of minutes. Give the poor Company a break, they try their hardest.. To make majority of their players happy. They don't concentrate on you and you alone. You're a tiny factor to the many of millions of other players out there. So stop complaining about Riot. Thank you","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-14T09:49:34.436+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry for losing my cool. But yea I just get frustrated with everyone completely losing their temper at Riot. Riot probably gets 3/4 of abusive complaints about them as a company and get maybe 1/4 of being mutual/friendly towards them. How bout we stop bitching about everything Riot does. And to be honest, I blame Riot. I agree, it's easy to jump on the band wagon and blame Riot but lets just give em a little support, instead of the whole \"Blame Riot for this\" \"Blame Riot for that\". Lets just stop.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-14T10:48:58.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Massive problem bro how dare they...","replies":[]},{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-16T10:11:32.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can you try and correct their grammar when yours is utter garbage?
