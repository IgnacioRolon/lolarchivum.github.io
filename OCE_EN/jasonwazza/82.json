Consumers got sick of EAS bullshit and walked away from the game.\n\nObviously, emulating ea is a profit seeking move from riot but after being the best ftp model of any game for almost a decade they  copied the practices of the most hated gaming company on the globe.\n\nThat's what happens when you put accountants in charge of a company formerly headed by gamers.\n\nI fear riot are shooting themselves in the foot by adopting an in game currency designed to milk their players like this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-21T08:13:20.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you make a good point about new players declining vs treating existing players poorly.

Not irrational spending of life savings, but happy to drop $50-$100 per year on skins to see the game evolve and support it.\n\nWill be spending money on other things now.  This direction is taking the absolute piss.\n\nThats possibly why they've gone down the BE route too - closer to loot box arrangements which require a bigger spend to get less. Suspect the strategy is to milk the remaining population as much as possible before they go and all that remain are the hard core fans who are too invested in the game to play anything else.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-21T09:56:43.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I mean admittedly i was a bit of a whale, but i've just flat out stopped for a year and a bit now, the last MAJOR purchase i made was elementalist lux.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-28T09:22:28.014+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=coZYPlrk,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-21T09:56:43.503+0000)\n>\n> I mean admittedly i was a bit of a whale, but i&#x27;ve just flat out stopped for a year and a bit now, the last MAJOR purchase i made was elementalist lux.\n\nthat was a sweet skin to be fair.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-12-09T05:26:13.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The lower population base and the jacking up of loot box and pay to play mechanisms follows a model:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7igijd/i_was_a_game_designer_at_a_freetoplay_game/\n\n> I'd say that, on average, pay-to-win tendencies increase as a game's popularity goes down over time.

Is kleptomancy isn’t op on other champs so do they nerf it and make it worthless? And before the rune changes ezreal wasn’t that strong either so do u nerf him and make ezreal unplayable? To put it simply ezreal abuses kleptomancy however if u nerf kleptomancy u fuck over a lot of other champs.
