And you're comparing two things that work differently from each other. You can study architecture for years through attending University and reading books the same way you could spend years reading League guides, but when it comes to the actual practical stuff, you can't just follow a step-by-step process you learned in architecture the same way you could in League. Because every League game is a unique experience, you always have to adapt. It's like if someone who had never played a game of LoL before in their life spent 6 months watching pro player streams and reading Mobafire guides, then they suddenly downloaded LoL and hopped straight into a game for the first time. You wouldn't expect them to just suddenly get fed and dominate the game, because it just doesn't work like that. Because League revolves around both **Mentality** and **Practicality**. \n\nBut I guess almost everything involves both anyway , even architecture (Because someone who has studied it all their life and has worked on many projects would be able to teach students better then someone who has studied it their whole life but has never built a single building ever).","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-26T22:39:05.538+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I must disagree with you when you say: if they fully understood the game, then they wouldn't be bronze.\n\nIts very easy to know a lot of information, but be unable to apply it in a practical situation.\nFor example, someone might know they need to watch the map every few seconds. However in game, they always get so caught up in trying to farm, and poke, and last hit etc. that they forget to look at the map.\n\nThey might know the perfect formula for last hitting. But they just cant get the timing of Karthus's basic attacks right, and so keep missing minions.\n\nThey know they need to CC Katarina as soon as she ults, but when she does ult, they panic and miss or hit the wrong keys.\n\nKnowing what to do, doesn't always mean you can do it in reality.\n\n_____\n\nYour example about someone who reads lots of guides, and then doesn't get fed, is exactly what I'm talking about.\nThey know exactly what to do, and how to do it, they probably know more than many Silver or Gold players who just instalock Riven every game and let the champ and their reflexes carry them. Yet they would still be bronze, because they don't have the skill to apply their knowledge, even though they know much more about the game.\n\nWould you rather the game was balanced by the gold Riven player who doesn't know shit about the rest of the game, but has lots of practice with Riven? Or would you rather the game be balanced by someone who knew the game inside out, but lacked the physical skill to get out of bronze.\n\n______\n\n\nYou say that someone who has studied architecture all their life and built many buildings would be able to teach better than someone who hasn't built any buildings. While I'm sure thats true much of the time, ist isn't always.\n\nMy example would be Stephen Hawking.\nIm guessing that Stephen Hawking doesn't get the chance to do many practical experiments (for obvious reasons).\nBut even though he doesn't do the practical element of science, you cant say that he isn't a better scientist than most other people do can do experiments.\n\nIf he put his mind to it, Stephen Hawking would be very good at balancing league, he would understand the power spikes of certain champions, and how some champ's power spikes happen at convenient times (like dragon spawn), and so have a better impact on the game, while others happen at times where they cant make full use of it, and so aren't as strong.\nHe would understand all of the little details that can make or break the game, and how to adjust them.\n\nBut he would be In bronze 5, because obviously he wouldn't be able to play very well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2017-03-26T19:46:18.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=iUitQxeh,comment-id=00000000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-26T13:10:37.924+0000)\n>\n> Theres nothing wrong with being in bronze.\n> \n> Its possible to understand the game in a professional capacity, but not have the mechanics or reflexes to apply your knowledge properly in game.\n> \n> There are professors in universities that have studied architecture all their life, and teach it to PHD students, and yet have never built a single building in their life.\n> \n> TBH id rather have the game balanced by bronze players who understand the game, and play it all the time, than by Plat level players who hardly play and just balance from statistics alone.\n\nI like this response, well said.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-27T00:22:43.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or being bronze cuz 80% of the games your mid feeds and lets his opponent roam","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-03-27T05:24:54.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but were they part of the balance team? or just some random rioter","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-03-26T10:13:15.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"the real reason is that league is a bad game.\n\nalso balance went to shit cause morello is no longer in charge. people went on about \"hur dur he's silver what does he know\" but compared to the current team he was really good at what he did.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-03-26T10:29:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"League wasn't a bad game in the first place, it was a really good game, or it wouldn't have gotten as big as it has.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-03-27T03:02:14.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=iUitQxeh,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-03-26T10:29:07.921+0000)\n>\n> League wasn&#x27;t a bad game in the first place, it was a really good game, or it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten as big as it has.\n\nyeah in like season 2 maybe. it's been an alright game at best since season 3 and has just gone downhill from there.\n\njust because it's popular doesn't mean it's good. there are a few reasons it's popular. firstly, it's free, so 14 year olds without a job don't have to pay money to play it. secondly, it's simple and easy to get into. thirdly, casuals have bad tastes in games.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-26T23:15:43.170+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So take a break.

Sometimes into things you may not necessarily enjoy. \n\nPersonally I'm pretty happy with the current meta and some small errors withstanding (Seriously who thought giving rengar cc immunity was a good idea. Like why) im fairly happy with the balancing. Not to mention there finally addressing some of the champs you haven't changed in years. But there has been times I didn't feel like that.
