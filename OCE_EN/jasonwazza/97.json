ABSOLUTELY FUCKING RIDICULOUS RIOT THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\n\nI went straight to a tier 3 ban after telling a trolling toxic dicklord to neck himself. 8 years of positive play with only 1 chat ban about 2 years ago then straight to a tier 3 because I told off a toxic arse cake after a raft of shitty games with trolls (not toxic, like game play trolls). No ifs, no buts, no warnings, no chat restrictions. Straight to tier 3. So I wont be playing on my main for a year or so because all it will take is a malicious duo Q pair to see my account perma'd. Started playing on an Alt but honestly I think about 50% of the level 9 accounts I played against were smurfs and the toxicity is worse there - got sick of getting muscled out of the lane I called (about 5 games in a row) so I muscled in on one myself (locked in and called) - two people locked in mid well after I did and got an instant warning after getting flamed all game and trolled by the person who picked after me. Low level norms is a lot more toxic than ranked because at least in draft pick the number of fights about what lane to choose are not as frequent.\n\nI am certain now that the player numbers riot reports are exaggerated because of the number of alts / smurfs in the sub 30s.\n\nIts a shame because I really enjoyed the game but the refusal of the player behaviour team to see any sort of reason and the utter toxicity of sub 30 norms games has really soured the experience for me. Lurk on the forums occasionally but cant see myself playing LoL again for quite some time. And when I do dip back in, the meta will have changed too much for me to enjoy playing again so I'll likely dip right back out.\n\nHave been playing a lot of PS4 instead recently. Not going to risk my main on an insta tier-3 ban because I just dont trust riot player behavior team enough to go through the adequate escalation steps for a punishment (\"neck yourself\" for instant tier 3? Give me a break....)  and I'm not willing to lose an account into which I have sunk so much $$.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-11-03T21:07:26.844+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh the irony...\nThe guy making racist remarks about Asians has a weeaboo name.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-03T04:51:16.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*FYI, bit of a wall of text.*\n\nJust so we're on the same page, what comments are you referring to when you say that you have been told by volunteers that the game isn't toxic? I can't, for the life of me, recall any.\n\nI agree with the sentiment, though. I honestly believe Riot needs to work on the report and punishment systems, in several ways. There's been a few comments from others on the boards that have got me thinking about this much more than I usually do, and it's lead me to the conclusion that Riot needs to step up their \"game\" when it comes to toxicity.\n\nI just would like to take a moment to give some context on my perception of toxicity in-game. The fact is, I don't experience it nearly as much, or to the same extent, as most other players seem to, based on the feedback that appears on the boards. I only see toxicity in-game occasionally, and it's pretty much always rather benign, such as someone getting a bit upset that they didn't get the role/position/champ they wanted (usually just a bit of whinging in team chat) or someone starting a game when they know they need to leave for school/work in ~20 minutes. With that in mind, I'm entirely reliant on feedback from other players to understand the true extent of toxicity in-game. The reason I bring this up is because, in retrospect, I realise some of my comments may come off as me implying there isn't much/any toxicity in-game, and that's not my intention.\n\nI'm not going to say the community is a good thing, because I'd probably be lying. Even the players who aren't necessarily toxic in-game can become pretty god dam annoying when they feel their perceptions aren't being met, not to say they're wrong to want a toxicity free game, but they definitely don't present themselves very well when expressing that.\n\nAs for the Instant Feedback system, I completely understand your frustration with that. I rarely have reason to report people and I get frustrated with the IFS. Not so much because I don't get notifications (I do, rarely), but because it is a wasted concept. It's still not in the position that Riot said they wanted it in when they announced it, before it was implemented on live. It's been, what, a year now? And Riot haven't been able to get it to notify more than one person each time a player is punished? It's ridiculous, if you ask me. The IFS is a great concept, and it has a lot of potential, but it is completely wasted in it's current state, and I honestly think it does more harm than good at the moment.\n\nOn a final note, I do have something to say to your GF, and I do hope you'll show this to her;\n\"You should trust him when he says the new player experience is terrible. I've tried to get a few friends into LoL, and they've all given up because of how bad the new player experience is. There are a lot of ways in which Riot could *definitely* do far better when addressing toxicity, but they don't. They seem to care more about money than actually creating an enjoyable game. I honestly think it's arguable that LoL is one of the most toxic, if not *the* most toxic, games available. The only reason I continue to play now is because I still enjoy it after all this time. I started at a time when things weren't nearly as bad, and have been drawn back in time and time again. Don't fall into that trap.

There doesn't seem to be any logical reason for it, unless there were a \"prisoner island\" kind of system in-game that Riot hasn't told anyone about. I want to believe that isn't the case, but I am starting to have my doubts.\n\nI'll have to try and be more clear when discussing things in that manner, though. Make sure people are aware I'm not trying to imply that the game isn't toxic or doesn't contain toxicity. If you have the time, could you give a few examples of the kinds of comments that come off that way? I'd like to be able to start an internal discussion with the other volunteers, try and get everyone to be more aware of this kind of \"assumed implication\" and try making their meanings a bit more clear.\n\n> When i'm with her next i will show it to her, though she is slowly starting to realise it herself, even when i try to push her away from the game.\n> \n> I mean i love gaming with my GF, but League is just one that she want's to play, and i just really want to push her away from it.\n\nYeh, I can understand gaming with people you like/love, but LoL isn't a good game to play with people who aren't used to, and/or can't withstand, this kind of environment.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-03T06:18:36.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":">unless there were a \"prisoner island\" kind of system in-game that Riot hasn't told anyone about.\n\nI think it'd be more likely that you are on the prisoner island then anyone else, as i know a lot of people who haven't received any bans that see the same style of chat as i do.\n\n>If you have the time, could you give a few examples of the kinds of comments that come off that way?\n\nThe issue is, i could easily go through years of content and find stuff that comes off that way, The main portion of it is the fact that  a lot of the volunteers say things similar to \"in my games, i see very little toxicity\" and use that as the focal point of their arguments, and the thing is, from this side of the argument, all i see is either your ok with the toxicity, or Riot has systems implemented to keep you guys away from any of the toxicity that other's see.\n\n>Yeh, I can understand gaming with people you like/love, but LoL isn't a good game to play with people who aren't used to, and/or can't withstand, this kind of environment.\n\nAgreed, like if it wasn't for the community, the general toxicity, hell if it were just the first 30 levels where the issues came in, i'd just smurf an account to 30 for her, but i can't do that to her knowing the community, and knowing how she'd react to the chat that i see in just most games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"OfficalMCLure","date":"2017-11-03T03:16:51.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"what are you talking about lol. \n\nI have been perma twice instantly after a game for telling  a guy  hes bad and even just telling someone to shut up. \n\nPeople talk talk shit to me constantly and int for feeding to act like they have been doing it all game i report them they dont get ban but if i flame a little bit i get banned i can see where your coming from but i have been banned instantly for doing barley nothing and im not just saying that cause it was me that got banned but they are pretty harsh when it comes to flaming.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-03T04:46:18.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You realise your making my point for me right?\n\nYeah your getting banned instantly, but even you say that other's aren't getting banned for worse.\n\nFact is i shouldn't be able to go into basically every game, and see toxicity, yet that is the case.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-11-03T12:18:44.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll just leave these here.\n\nThreats of violence and racist comments towards his/her own team mates.\n\n\nYep nothing wrong with OCE\n\n[REMOVED -
