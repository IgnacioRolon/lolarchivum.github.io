Then if you even get into a lobby people just swap roles with them self even tho the  new queue up system. You lose to a group of people then after wards you vs them again i remember in season 3 ranked was serious these days if you want a game where people aren't yelling at you. And reporting you for asking for a gank Go play normals. the new banning system is to much power for the oce sever riot you giving summoners a easier way to troll team mates. Oh my adc wants to play vayne so ill just ban vayne oh jg wants olaf ban olaf. Ranked used to be fun now its full of trolls. you ask for ganks u get reported you have one bad game and everyone smack talks you all game \n \nYou get a troll on your team taric mid 1/10 crit items so your team reports him and nothing happens then you get one report for verbal abuse after asking for a gank and you get chat bans \n\n#riotfixoce","replies":[]},{"poster":"SailMad","date":"2016-01-30T22:52:21.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've done 2 hours in queue today for one game, 70 minutes yesterday, and 120 minutes with only one game the day before (gave up for a second game.)\n\nRanked really isn't worth it for me as there is no way to go afk while waiting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-30T10:57:34.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What old patty said","replies":[]},{"poster":"Patyfatycake","date":"2016-01-30T10:56:07.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He most likely was trying but did bad and used it as an excuse.","replies":[]}]}
