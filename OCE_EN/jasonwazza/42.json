For example:\n\n1) In spectator mode watching friends, when you hover on items, sometimes only the starting items show their stats and abilities, the others don't bring the info pop-up.\n2) some bs about \"your party has disbanded\" happens on occasion.\n3) emote bug messages\n\nAnd nah, Monkey Max, the client is not a huge improvement, it's worse than the old one. Depends what you want though, eh? Glossy looks or functionality.\nOn the old one I could spectate challenger games, now its been a year and we still can't do that unless they are on your friend's list. And your own personal stats in ranked have been muzzled. For example you can't see how many Pentas you got this season, etc etc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-10-30T15:57:32.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that lag when selecting roles started around the time they introduced $5 emotes which they \"tested\" on our server. still pushed them through. :thinking:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-10-29T12:18:28.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old client is never coming back unfortunately, whatever issue you have Riot will always try and fix it on the new client.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-10-30T07:22:28.876+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"That’s because ur in the “invited” tab.
