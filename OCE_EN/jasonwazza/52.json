You might not think that it was/is your connection but when trying to diagnose a problem, sometimes its best to rule-out the most obvious reasons. Yes it's tedious and tiresome especially when you want to just crush some peeps in-game but sometimes that's just what you need - if you want to fix something properly.\n\nHaving 40-60ms ping does not mean there's no issue with your connection. Maybe there's something blocking the connection to the patching server which then bugs out the client (again, not a tech here just thinking outloud). \n\nRegardless, I guess you wanted a band-aid fix - which i 100% would too - but support wanted to try and figure out the underlying problem so you don't run into it again later.\n\nHoping the issue doesnt come back tho!
