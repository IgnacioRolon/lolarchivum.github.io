The client has surprisingly little in it at this point, i actually expected it to at least have the store.\r\n2. The client seems slow to respond, i had a few issues inviting everyone off the suggested list (it kinda made the client go spastic.)\r\n3. It looks amazing, and will definitely work well with the new ranked system.\r\n4. chat is bugged, that is known at this point\r\n5. i was stuck as in game status after a game.\r\n6. apart from being slow, and the bugs, it&#039;s actually a good client from what there is so far, however, you are missing multitudes of key features.\r\n\r\nHonestly looking forward to future updates to the client.","replies":[{"poster":"Caress of Venus","date":"2016-05-19T07:48:51.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree with all your points, I've had both the chat and the \"still in game\" bug you mentioned.\n\nLooking fantastic so far though, can't wait til these bugs are squashed {{champion:121}}","replies":[]}]}
