Looking at how each buff contributes to a team&rsquo;s chance of winning the game, however, tells us the buffs are statistically pretty close to each other. We&rsquo;re looking at appreciability of what each buff gives you at present as a result, rather than adding or removing raw power.\r\n\r\nA team that is able to get the dragon is able to win?\r\n\r\nGenerally if your scoring dragons (especially cloud since no one wants it.) your more likely to be winning the game anyway.\r\n\r\n&gt;Protobelt looks weak, but we&rsquo;d rather start low, and buff where needed, given the potential power a dash on an item involves.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t even understand you rito.\r\n\r\n&gt;We are seeing some games stretch out, with a few more back and forth stalemates.\r\n\r\nI believe the word you are looking for is throws.\r\n\r\n&gt;We&rsquo;re still determining whether the timers shut down some types of jungler too much, however. That&rsquo;s a concern that was raised before the timers&rsquo; release that we&rsquo;re still seeing some ongoing discussion about.\r\n\r\nHonestly i have seen less blue dependant junglers (outside of fiddle) then ever in my games, and the fiddle players are mostly cause reworked mage hype.\r\n\r\n&gt;The other concern we&rsquo;ve seen raised a fair bit is that these timers dumb down the game. Our feeling is that they shift mastery from one action to another. Without the timers, players were being tested on their ability to determine blue/red respawn times by noticing when enemy champions had red or blue buff then using the remaining buff duration to determine the next camp spawn time. With buff timers, that&rsquo;s no longer a point of mastery. There is more focus and need to deal with invades, or the threat of invades, which tests a different set of skills. If we&rsquo;re comfortable with the above point (do timers overprioritize certain junglers?), we&rsquo;re okay with this skill tradeoff.\r\n\r\nFact is you have countered any jungler that is actually buff reliant due to the fact that these timers exist, it&#039;s not a skill tradeoff, it&#039;s a complete fucking over of certain champions, and an even bigger fucking over of junglers in general, i used to be able to prioritize a gank without ensuring losing my buff, now i&#039;m almost forced into taking buffs before ganking.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-10T02:44:23.198+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why even bother critiquing them?\n\nOnce they changed QSS we all knew RIOT's common sense had run dry.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-06-11T04:47:31.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, the change on QSS wasn't even needed.\n\nA nerf could've balanced it out, but they just went in dry.","replies":[]}]}]}
