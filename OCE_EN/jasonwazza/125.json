While they do generally get it right in the instances they take action, it's the instances where there's no action taken that's the real problem.\n\nI would like to take a moment to say that it's important that we, the players, are active in reporting any behaviour that is a detriment to the game and experience. While it is Riot's responsibility to ensure that action is taken, their job is made that much harder when they don't get feedback on troublesome players (a system with no feedback is an innately flawed system). All it takes is one valid report to get a player flagged, then it's in Riot's hands.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-17T13:29:47.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tend to only report people if they're next level toxic (which sometimes they are), I don't know, I feel like if I report people alot, my reports might be worth less. I've reported people around 20 times now over my entire time playing league, and I've received about 3-4 responses from riot about people being punished. \n\nI guess I should probably report people more but half the time I forget, unless I really feel like an injustice has occured and it's foremost in my mind, and someone has crossed the line, alot of the time I just shrug it off and move on.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-17T14:14:20.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is also another good point, if i report someone, and they don't get punished, i then get punished by having my report power go down.\n\nSo what benefit is there to reporting people if i can only get punished in the majority of situations?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-02-18T00:36:43.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I will always report someone if I think they're breaking any rules or just generally creating a negative experience. I'd probably end up reporting, on average, 1 person every 5 games or so. That said, I've noticed no problems with my reports. I still occasionally receive (or have been, haven't played much the past couple weeks) the instant feedback notification that someone I reported was punished. Even on my pre-30 smurfs, which I'll take into ARAM and end up reporting several people each and every game, it doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\nThat said, if you do have concerns about your report weight you could try contacting support and see if there's any way for them to tell you where you currently stand. I'm not sure if they'd be allowed to share that information, but I can't see any reason why not.\n\nIn the end, one of the faults with the system is that it's so reliant on player feedback (in the form of reports), so the less people that are reporting the less chance that troublesome players will get picked up to be reviewed in the first place.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-02-17T10:51:28.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It really boils down to people not reporting enough, which is due to people believing that reporting does nothing thanks to there being no tribunal.\n\nRiot needs to put it plain as day in the client, leave it there for MONTHS, make people acknowledge a message that people ARE being banned, and the tribunal is not needed for your report to count and be taken seriously.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-02-17T12:47:06.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean whether or not it's people not reporting enough, that is on riot for letting this stigma happen so much.\n\nAnd they basically pushed it into a position where realistically that stigma is going to happen, regardless of what they do, because it does take so damn long for them to detect any bad behaviour.\n\nI mean in one of the games tonight i swear i got what amounts to a bomb threat on my family, and i reported him, and nothing came of it (IE. i didn't get the one person who you reported got banned), meaning, he can go and do that again, when realistically even saying that once is just ludicrous and should probably be at least chat restricted.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-02-17T09:14:19.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half of the reason people like myself get mad and rage is because these people will harass you for the smallest and stupidest things, some of which you had nothing to do with, or just get up at you because you had a bad game. Sure you can mute them, but as you go onto the next game and come across another bunch of assholes the rage begins to build up until you just end up rage quitting and having to take a break. I seriously shouldn't be forced to stop playing a game because I can't be treated like a human being that makes mistakes. Although there is room for Riot to improve, half of it is the fact that this game is full of children, and like minecraft they will continue to ruin every other game with their insensitive and easily triggered feelings as well as just generally being little shits. It makes me wonder why this game shouldn't be 16+ but I guess that won't stop people won't it?","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrPine","date":"2017-02-18T10:55:38.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"thats alright","replies":[]}]}
