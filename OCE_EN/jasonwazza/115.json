Everything can be deemed offensive, or inoffensive.\n\nThere is no one opinion that holds true for everyone, some people can be offended by basically anything (hell, i can get insulted for trying to give advice, because they think i&#039;m trying to be offensive) and some people just don&#039;t care\n\n2. Algorithms aren&#039;t perfect.\n\nOne of the main argument&#039;s against tribunal, is that it required a lot of manual reviews, but let&#039;s face it, the algorithm needs the same amount, they are just mostly being ignored, if you don&#039;t believe me, here is one such case, and if you believe this isn&#039;t offensive, then logic dictates that there are more of these out there.\n\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/MfOk0ATW-what-is-wrong-with-the-system\n\nThis happened to be reverted by Gehirn, and while that is a good thing, it shows that this new system has flaws, and as a point, it took me contacting a particular volunteer to get gehirn&#039;s attention and get it overturned, which occured well after this post was even made.\n\nThis shows not only a flaw in the main algorithm, but a flaw with the support team not inherently dealing with reports that need manual reviews, which has the same issue of tribunal.\n\n3. Reporting isn&#039;t a Majority Act.\n\nReporting requires one person, and we are told that there is an algorithm that adapts based on reports, which brings up my biggest issue, we are focusing only on the people who are offended, believe it or not, this server is OCE, and i think a lot of us, aren&#039;t that easily offended, there&#039;s no proof either way, but that again brings up the issue, that while we are told the majority decides, we don&#039;t actually, a minority decides, because it&#039;s based only on those that report, multiple people can choose to not report, and this holds no sway in the matter.\n\nA secondary issue is that eventually the algorithm has to decide that a reported thing that is said, isn&#039;t ok, but it could be as simple as one person having reported it millions of times (yes i get it, it&#039;s kinda hyperbolic, but it wouldn&#039;t take a lot for this to not be just hyperbol) eventually the Algorithm has to say that behaviour isn&#039;t ok, even if it might be perfectly ok to the rest of us, which could apply to just 1 person, or maybe, a couple of hundred deciding to report something in particular.\n\n4. Tribunal shows undisputed majoritys.\n\nIf we want to keep arguing the majority argument, give us back tribunal, as by virtue of it&#039;s natural use, it shows a majority either way, let&#039;s face it the manual review issue becomes BS very quickly, again because this algorithm is left unchecked, yet that same property can&#039;t be pushed over to the tribunal?\n\nWe have to take one or the other, either the Algorithm needs a lot more reviews then it gets, or the tribunal doesn&#039;t need as many reviews as you guys keep saying.\n\n5. The algorithm is always behind.\n\nAs the algorithm catches up, we will always find people finding new ways to be insulting, fact is right now, all you need to do, is know a little bit about the system, and you can still be a toxic player, without ever getting caught.\n\nThe system will always be behind, and it ends up being a matter of not getting banned, instead of not being toxic.\n\nBecause right now, this game no longer pushes for reform, if you did, then you wouldn&#039;t hand out instant 14 day bans, you wouldn&#039;t just tell people there is nothing you can do in support constantly to minor tickets (i can&#039;t tell you how many times i&#039;ve been told you can have your sentence reduced, but have never seen it in action)\n\nThis game used to be pushing for Reform, but recently even the basic things that people like Riot Lyte did have stopped.\n\n___________________\n\nFact is with the place the game is in right now, toxicity is running rampant, i see it in most games, and that is the simple reason most people feel their bans aren&#039;t justified, or that people complain that you only see one side of the argument, because it&#039;s really simple to know that the other person didn&#039;t get punished at all.\n\nAnd we have a bunch of automated systems in place, that do nothing, sure they are slowly catching up, but it&#039;s not fast enough to make an impact on player beliefs, and that is the pure issue, if players don&#039;t believe your doing anything, then you may as well not be.\n\nWhile i may be wrong, years ago we used to see actual stats come out of riot as to how many people got bans and etc. i want to leave it on this note.\n\nI haven&#039;t seen that stat in years.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-13T06:10:04.766+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noice","replies":[]}]}
