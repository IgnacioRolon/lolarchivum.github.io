If you think that _constant_ and _targeted_ abuse and toxicity throughout not one, but four entire games (and these are presumably only the recent ones) is ok, then you need to take a serious look at your behaviour. \n\nIt does not matter what others have done, it is your behaviour and yours alone that is being considered here, and what you said was not ok. You weren't targeted because of your boards presence, and it isn't an undeserved punishment. 14 day is the first ban tier, and while it typically comes after 2 separate chat restrictions (10 game and 25 game) excessive or highly consistent negative behaviour is plenty to skip those chat restrictions (assuming ofc you've had chat restrictions either).\n\nRemember that a 14 day ban is your last warning and your last chance to consider your behaviour. If you continue this behaviour, be aware that the next tier is a permanent account suspension. \n\nTry to consider your behaviour from the perspective of those you were targeting, a lot of what you've said amounts to _the_ fastest way to ruin someone's experience in game, and is more than deserving of the report and subsequent punishment.\n\nAgain, just remember that next tier is _**permanent suspension**_.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-18T06:54:54.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"Hint: I have heard miles worse then all 4 of those sets of lines, and nearly none of those guys even get picked up.\n\nFact is this is a last warning, with no prior warnings, for honestly sweet fuck all.\n\nYou can't actually think this is ban worthy if you play on OCE regularly.","replies":[{"poster":"Ascalon127","date":"2016-10-19T07:59:35.715+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly man, If your gonna whinge about this shit, then why would you post it on boards? Honestly... {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \nSeriously, I agree with Seras Dragon 100%. You got banned for a reason, so what? Deal with it. Just wait out the ban and then play again hopefully not doing this shit again. Everyone gets toxic once in a while and flames in chat. Even I do it. And it's a mistake everyone makes. It's just that these flames/toxic abuses are very consistent and that they are very much targeted at one person. Would you do this to a person in real life? Probably not. Would you like someone to constantly harass you just because you are not doing that well in a game? No. \nSo just think about you're actions before you go arguing about not deserving this ban, and think about what you did. Because this is very much ban-worthy toxicity. \nNo hate intended","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-18T07:05:37.166+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Again, the behaviour of others is irrelevant here, YOUR behaviour was deemed unacceptable. Like the speeding analogy, sure maybe someone else was going 100 in a 60 zone and didn't get caught, but you've been consistently going 70 in a 60 zone and got caught. Just cause what the other guy did was worse, doesn't mean what you did wasn't wrong.\n\nYou're only getting one warning and one chance because your negativity was so consistent. You've demonstrated that whatever your reasons, this isn't toxicity born of occasional frustration, but rather is a consistent attitude you have.\n\nYou have shown no remorse for being a complete asshat to other _people_ nor any recognition of any wrongdoing, so a chat restriction would likely mean nothing to you.\n\nThere are a couple things I want you to remember. \n\nFirst off, Riot only sets a baseline for what is acceptable and what isn't, the rest is decided by players through what they choose to report or not report. So it was ultimately other players (as in other people who play on OCE regularly) that decided your behaviour was unacceptable (and yes, that applies even under manual review). The fact that the players here on boards have also deemed your behaviour unacceptable should give you a hint that it's not ok.\n\nSecond, this is not a solo game, and thus you are expected to be considerate of the other people you play with to some degree, even if that means just ignoring them entirely. If you can't manage to not treat other people like trash then you can expect to be kicked out, because funnily enough, people don't like that.\n\nI do think this is ban worthy, if it was only one game it would be different, but it isn't, it's four games that hint at many more. So yes, as someone who plays on OCE regularly, I do believe this behaviour is ban worthy.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-18T07:10:37.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":9,"body":"Sera's you're just showing you're corrupted.\n\nThis is standard talk, and you should know this even from your own games, and you know sure as fuck that these people don't get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-18T07:24:07.777+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not standard talk.

If me believing consistent negativity and abusive behaviour is ban worthy make me corrupted then sign me up for believing in basic human decency I guess.\n\nI also happen to know they do get banned. I spend a lot of time on boards, and I see all the posts that come through of people who've gotten banned for their behaviour. I've seen some pretty hideous chat logs too. Some logs being worse than yours doesn't mean yours is ok. And like the petty people many of can be I also keep tabs on some of the toxic people I've encountered, and all the ones who really deserved a ban got one eventually.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-18T06:37:42.503+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ErwA6EQ5,comment-id=000400000000000100000000,timestamp=2016-10-18T06:27:15.797+0000)\n>\n> My issue is less with this being a ban, and more with the fact that this escalated me to a 14 day ban, from no prior ban history.\n>\n\ni dunno dude, every update / when the day you created your account / s..\n\nYou agreed to this http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse ,Section III E is pretty much stating they can ban you with out warning, because you violated Section V,\n\nGive it a read if you wish but i honestly dont see the point arguing they pay lawyers hundreds of thousands of dollars to stop people like you trying to Sue or give an excuse why..

You may think what you have done is nothing, but others don't and others are affected by some of the things you are saying.\n\nI hope you work on your demeanor and you don't have do go through this again.\n\n\nPeace :) {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-18T06:47:28.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":7,"body":"Oh and by the way\n\n>Sorry, I can't just run around expediting tickets whenever I get asked - certainly not ones that the support team is already equipped to handle.\n\nYou just made the ticket irrelevant by telling me, but now someone will still attend that ticket, so your just wasting your own people's time.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-10-18T04:43:21.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm guessing I scrapped by on the hair of my teeth with that manual ban wave...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-17T07:51:22.382+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"Im truly sorry to hear about the ban man :/\n\nDont get me wrong, RIOT is a wonderful company that does some amazing things for its player base, and i am proud to play their game.\n\nBut, they will never talk publicly about something that you can pull them up on afterwards.. So basically no direct question about sensitive issues like being banned.... or direct questions about anything tbh. _(but if you make post saying GO SKT T1! youll probably get a red reply!)_\n\nHell most of the time they wont even admit theres a bug in the game, even if you've got several videos clearly proving it. The only time youll hear them admit it is several months down the track when they say in the patch notes: \n_\"Oh btw there was a bug, but we patched that ages ago and forgot to say anything about it. Lol! silly us!\"_\n\nSo i wouldn't expect a reply from them, and if you do get one, it'll likely be heavily lawyered and say practically nothing useful, and certainly not answer your question. \n**(But I'm happy to be proved wrong!)**\n\nAs for knowing why you got banned, I would say that this is essential! and if it isn't telling you, that is something Riot needs to get their act together for immediately, for 2 reasons.\n\n1. how else would you know what to fix about your behaviour?\n\n2. people get frustrated when they don't know whats happening, \n_(like in a teamfight when you randomly cant cast any spells and die because of it, but death recap wont tell you shit about what happened, so youre sitting there thinking.. \"what the fuck happened? i shouldnt be dead!\". When if the death recap worked properly you'd see what kind of CC had hit you and you'd sit back going \"oh... ill have to look out for that next time.\")_\nThe same logic applies here.\n\nMy friend got permabanned for his 1st offence (not even a warning), and it took him about a week of emailing just to get a response from riot and all they said was something about using 3rd party programs. \n\nSo i think that if you get punished, they should tell you exactly what it was that you were punished for, _(and even better, show you the record)_.\n\nAlthough, it does say in the terms and conditions for lol:\n_\"RIOT can ban your account for **any** or **no** reason,\"_\n\nSo no matter what your argument is, you cant win, becasue they reserve the right to ban you for no reason if they want anyway. :/\n\nI really hope you get to the bottom of this man, things feel so much better if you just know why they happened. :(\n\nIm just going to end this post with 1 word.\n\n**Clarity.**","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-17T12:02:55.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":5,"body":"And you know what, it's been 6 hours and no rioter addressed this, so i think your right, and honestly it's pathetic.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-10-17T12:41:26.547+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the game I love Riot, and id love to work for them.\n\nBut for a company that prides itself on communicating with the players, they sure do a great job of avoiding the issues that people really want to discuss. \n\nThey are great for replying to you if you want to talk about LCS or want to play with a Rioter, but when you're legitimately trying to improve the game, by reporting bugs or pointing out flaws in the judicial system, they honestly don't want to hear any of it. \n\nJust go to 'Report a Bug' on the NA server website. Not a single red reply to anything in sight. \n\nI can understand why, if one rioter accidentally says _\"Yes that is a problem.\"_ suddenly the company's name is stamped on that statement, and they have to either put up with the embarrassment of retracting a statement, or they have to actually do something about it, and frankly, they don't want to do either.\n\n_________\n\nThere really needs to be a player council or something, where all the players bring their problems, the council selects the most predominant problems and publicly presents them to Riot, and Riot are obliged to respond.\n\nThere are a lot of issues that we just have no idea what Riot's stand on it is. \n\nSay Yasuo/Zed etc in bronze, Zed just stomps most games in low elo. and bronze players just have no idea what riot's stand on it is.\nDo they think _\"Zed is balanced in higher elo, so bronze can just deal with it cos we don't give a flying fuck what goes on down there.\"_\nor do they think _\"Shit thats a real problem but we don't know quite what to do.\"_\nLikewise with the banning system, its just so shrouded in mystery that people havent got a clue whats going on. \n\nI think a committee or council that is the bridge between Riot and the players would work well.
