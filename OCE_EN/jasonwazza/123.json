I, as I have said before, change flash frequently.\n2. My IP, much like most people, is dynamic. I have probably played LoL all over Australia.\n3. I'm not poor and have more than one PC.\n4. Sometimes I can go on a 15 game winning streak and other times, a 15 game losing streak.\n\nIt's awful seeing highschool children trying to understand detection because it's complicated. Boosted accounts could also be flagged and taken out in waves, which is more likely. Stop trying to makes sense of things you don't understand.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-11-06T09:28:37.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Except that's not what you suggested. You just suggested \n\"Why can't riot detect when people change Flash keys? And just manually audit those accounts?\"\n\nNow your suddenly using a different definition, that's called moving the goal posts and its bullshit. \n\nNot to mention I'm sure Riot will have something in place to keep an eye on those accounts that share those characteristics. But I'm betting they need a bit more evidence to prove boosting than you do. But we'll never know for sure because Riot rightly refuses to release the characteristics they look for in boosters and scripters. \n\nThey do the job, but be realistic the player base for league is huge there never going to catch every single booster. But players reporting potential boosters would help. So maybe instead of constantly complaining submit a support ticket.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-06T09:36:37.312+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"\"they do the job\"\n\nNo, they do not.\n\nAnd part of the manual Audit would be checking for IP address changes, fact is that Flash key changes aren't the only showing of a boosted account, so you would check for all the rest, but the change in flash key should trigger it just like reporting someone would.\n\nBut hey why would i expect logic from blind rito ass kissing?\n\nFact i've ran into at least 3 accounts last night that show clear signs of all of what i have said (flash changing, massive changes in win rate) but it shouldn't be on the PLAYERS to do RIOT'S job for them (and believe it or not, it is).","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-11-06T09:41:14.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I don't blindly kiss Riot's ass but with you around I always end you taking Riot's side because you treat them like a freaking Bond villain.
