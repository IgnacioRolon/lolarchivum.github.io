I have the red turned up quite a bit though so that's probably why for me (they're usually on top of those sort of clarity issues), I just wonder if it's the same for you given her particles are also orange-y reddish.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-09T11:26:49.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"f.lux?\n\nAs for the red in my montior, i'll make a note to check it after the next game, and while i did have a similar issue with Omega Squad Veigar, they did actually change the color to be slightly more visible (still not the greatest in a teamfight, but not much you can do about that) and i'm hoping they will do the same with this even if it is my monitor.\n\nThat said, if it is the red in my monitor, you'd think they would pick it up in testing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T11:32:02.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"f.lux is just a program that turns the red up at night so your monitor is less retina burning, but I just have mine turned up all the time. I tend to have mine turned up more than most people seem to which can of course wash out some red effects so I was just wondering if it was a contributing factor.\n\nIt probably would be picked up in testing, but I doubt they'd change an effect just for the few people that turn their red way up. If you're not aware of it that's probably not the issue though.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-09T12:05:34.417+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just checked, and no real abnormal settings from when i got it.\n\nAnd they really should just change things if things aren't easily visible, especially for a champion like Lux.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-02-09T12:18:48.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, I'm a big fan of clarity as much as I'm a fan of pretty visuals.
