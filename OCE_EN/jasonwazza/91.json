Pretty sure it&#x27;s just cause someone decided we had to actually enforce the rule for a bit.\n\n1. It's your job, literally, to talk to people and handle their questions and issues with an unbiased opinion. At no point should you be like, \"I don't want to deal with you because of _____!\". You may not get paid, but I am sure that Riot laid out some kind of guidelines and/or rules for being in a position of power over everyone else. If you don't want to actually help people, no matter what issue it is, step down.\n\n2. It is a job, it's a volunteer job. If you volunteer in person, you can't slack off and be like, \"I don't get paid. Who cares?\" The whole point is for you to be treating it like a job with no commitment or pay. You're meant to be doing it because you like to or because you need experience.\n\n3. If you don't have the time to post a simple reply, don't bother posting on the thread. Period. Each post of yours should be thought out and clear. There's a reason why most Rioters don't mindlessly post on threads like people seem to expect. If they say the wrong thing, people jump to conclusions and misinformation is spread. Situations like this happen because of carelessness. Also, the whole, \"I have a life outside of ___.\" argument is null and void and none of us cares. No one asked about your personal life. Don't throw it in our faces to hide your laziness.\n\n4. Rules should either be enforced or not enforced at all. Don't half-ass rules. You can't have a rule be active for five minutes per day and then it's serious business. Get a grip. There should never be a point where a rule is ignored unless someone is offended and decides to use that rule to punish people hurting their feelings.\n\nMy God, the moderators on OCE are godawful. My cat could moderate better than you lot. Double standards, power abusive, and ignorant. The classic combo of teenagers in power.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-08T23:57:41.587+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. You're not wrong, it is in essence a job, wrong wording there I suppose, but I am still also a player and can respond in the manner of just a player if I want to.

When it's things that actually involve my position I hardly slack off. In fact I spend far more time on some posts than I really should just to make sure I have given all the info, and I do it because I enjoy it. What I don't enjoy is having someone comment on everything I do, with the express purpose of undermining me because they think I lie for fun or something. Why would I engage with that? It's not productive.\n\n3. Pretty much, yes. I shouldn't have replied, but I do carefully consider all my posts. Frustrations colour some of those posts, but I don't just word vomit and post. I also never said anything false, so while the timing wasn't ideal, I wasn't being completely careless. The life outside was largely sarcasm.
