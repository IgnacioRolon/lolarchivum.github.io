Not racist, it just got the wrong reaction from people. Apparently being named \"Feeding the Enemy\" makes people rage at you. I had an irl friend with a similar issue when he was named \"Allah Christ\". People rage at you for no reason other than not liking your name, this has been happening since LoL began.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2018-01-11T15:08:46.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see racist names all the time. Its laughably easy to get away with because you can just swap characters for numbers or foreign letters/weird symbols.\n\nAs far as I can tell Riot hasn't ever banned people from the game for racist names when they will insta-14 day if you say the nword once and got reported. They just send a name reset then think the job is done and go back to ignoring them without even checking what name they chose.","replies":[]}]}
