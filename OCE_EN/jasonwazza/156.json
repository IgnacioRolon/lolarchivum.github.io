Clubs, fact is your clearly moving to knowing that a group is premade, by club tags, and what they inevitably cause, which is knowledge of premades, however this has a problem involved, that it&#039;s very easy to take it off, and pretend you aren&#039;t premade, which to me at least, seems slightly unfair to those who don&#039;t wish to do this.\r\n\r\n2. Dynamic queue, let&#039;s face it, you are pushing for Ranked to be more full of premades, we should at least have an idea of who is premade, so that we can at the very least tell why we have people that are 2 divisions higher/lower in our games (and this happens more often than riot want&#039;s you to realize.)\r\n\r\n3. Ranked toxicity, According to riot, ranked toxicity had more to do with not getting roles then anything else, and fact is that has been curbed, if that is the case and this is the cause of what had been toxicity towards premades (which part of it was) then there is no real reason to keep these hidden anymore as the toxicity problem that caused it to be removed in the first place should be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR; So in summary, Riot is basically moving to disclosing premades in the form of clubs, and dynamic queue should basically require that premades are disclosed for those in the game, and riot says that a lot of the toxicity in ranked was about who got what role, and that this reason should no longer be valid for not disclosing this information in ranked at the very least.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T06:29:48.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree but at the same time I'm not really sure it will make much of a difference to the games. You shouldn't be playing the game any differently. You should always play the game to assume the worst case situation and base you're play style on that. Not saying I don't agree I just don't think it matters.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-07-16T13:48:16.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing who's premade together and not actually helps your strategy majorly.\n\nEarlier today I faced a premade, while I was able to overcome their co-ordination, I would not have been initially caught off guard by it if I had known they were playing together beforehand.\nMy early game would have likely been a lot different.\n\nThe problem here is that in a game like LoL information is an extreme factor, from champion knowledge, to item knowledge, to masteries and of course knowing who in the game is friends and in direct communication with each other.\n\nConsidering how much it impacts on the game, there isn't any real reason to hide premades.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-16T15:15:18.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It shouldn't be an issue because Riot shouldn't be allowing premades to play 5 randoms anyway. If you are 3 man premade u should be opposed against 3 man premade or lose a rank advantage for example. I don't think that's much to ask for to create an even playing field.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-07-17T01:01:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's more than just being a premade against a premade. That tells you nothing.\n\nIf you know WHO are the premades that's the information you need.
