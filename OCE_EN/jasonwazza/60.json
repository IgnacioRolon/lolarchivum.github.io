I personally angle my shadow to make it harder for my enemy to dodge both and I generally land both fairly often especially in my ult combo. \n\nYes it's a nerf if you only throw 1 shuriken but as Zed I simply don't throw 1 so it's a buff. If I really want to kill them I'll throw 3 and at least 2 would generally land.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2016-06-02T04:07:06.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the exchange thing effect?\n\nLower the dmg, but up the % of damage per Q hit on target","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-02T05:13:42.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(Just so you know Mindstar has brought it up with someone and the wording has been changed, the wording used to be more ambiguous.)","replies":[]}]}]}
