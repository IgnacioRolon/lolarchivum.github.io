Or at least not reliably. There are a number of work around exploits to make control wards freak out and it's both hilarious and infuriating.\n\nFor instance, in certain locations, placing 2 regular wards on top of each other in a bush sometimes stops the control ward from spotting twitch or evelynn. Other things is if twitch walks through a bush whilst stealthing, the control ward is just like nope, not even I know where he went, you need to have a vision wards for that, but wait they're gone. I know this because I met a sneaky bugger of a twitch who countered my strategy of dropping control wards like the old pink wards when he stealthed in on us.\n\nControl wards have so many bugs, like the one next to dragon tends not to spot or disable traps so if the enemy puts a control ward in there, i find it hilarious to put about 4 shaco boxes in it and nearby and then have someone just go mental from the fact that control wards are useless when a good old pink would have revealed all the traps and not lulled them into a false sense of security.\n\nIn a few ways control wards are cool but most of the time they're probably the buggiest thing I've ever seen and even though I'm low elo, I miss good old, 100% reliable pink wards alot. Still denying vision is extremely useful when you need to rush dragon or baron and you don't want the enemy to steal it, though redtrinket does much of the same but better considering khazix and stuff won't be able to slide in and steal it.\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-11T07:24:09.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Meh i still feel like Twitch is now a better Evelynn.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-18T12:59:12.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They are basically pink ward with a different name \n\nThe Pink ward revealed invisible items and characters and also granted the player and their team the ability to attack these items / champions. This meant when a pink ward was placed, it would reveal all enemy traps, ward and champions that were previously invisible in a circular radius.\n\nThe Control ward allows players to disable enemy wards in the radius that it is controlling. Similar to the Red sweeping trinket, it will disable to enemy wards to prevent the vision previously granted by the enemy’s vision ward. Hidden / invisible traps will also be revealed, such as Teemo mushroom while the Pink ward also does.\n\nThe major change in the Control ward however is the lack of ability to reveal invisible enemy champions. Unlike the Pink ward which revealed all invisible enemy units, such as Vayne and Shaco when in stealth, the control ward will be unable to do this.\n\n[Source](http://www.esprts.com/difference-between-the-control-ward-and-pink-ward/)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-11-18T13:48:32.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sir are an idiot and didn't watch the video.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-11-19T01:01:37.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I did but I just had to put it out there.
