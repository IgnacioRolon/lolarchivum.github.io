Parents wont let 13 year olds play if there are rude words, and riot probably dont stand to make much money off the old guard who are turned off by the new system. So they clear the decks and give the impression of a wholesome game just in time for the rollout of BE which is aimed at pulling money out of millions of teenagers in very small and regular amounts for a chance to get some flair for their account or a new champ.\n\nIt really could be a clearing the decks exercise to encourage younger players, which in itself is an exercise to open up a new market of players to an exploitative microtransaction model.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-23T11:00:22.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Funny thing is, what 13 year old would even know that much about league?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T11:05:36.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WEYajdGl,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-11-23T11:00:22.460+0000)\n>\n> Funny thing is, what 13 year old would even know that much about league?\n\nThey promo pretty hard for school comps and at things like supernova etc. Gotta start somewhere.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
