That means that you have to receive the [AFK warning](http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/YexIdkTF8wM/mqdefault.jpg), and then continue to be AFK for another 90 seconds.\n\n> So to answer your question; your team will not be able to remake the game if you're AFK for just 90 seconds. You must be AFK long enough to receive the AFK warning, and then be AFK for an additional 90 seconds.\n\nI hope this helps :D","replies":[]}]}
