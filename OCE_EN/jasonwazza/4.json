Bot accounts are being banned as we speak, but it's clearly not happening quickly and efficiently enough.\n\n Please understand though, that a lot of the team at **Riot** is busy with the Dynamic Queue debacle and getting the Tribunal in shape.

One person with greater powers to view games, like they could see a list of all games currently in progress on the server. Would be then very easy to nuke bots, trolls and feeders. Incoming reports could also be on display for this person, so they could quickly \"grab a copy\" and follow said players to see if its insta-bannable. This person would also have analytical tools to scan computers lol folder for scripts or hacks.\n\nHire someone with a brain, who can put two and two together.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2017-01-18T01:18:57.820+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'll just expand on what **Heartvine** said here. \n\n+ People underestimate the amount of bots, because they go based off their experience in-game. But there's actually a lot of bots who drop to such a low skill level that they end up mainly playing with just other bots. \n\n And usually those games with only bots go completely unnoticed, unless a low elo player is unlucky enough to get matched into one of those games with 9 other bots.\n\n\n+ Another thing to consider is that bots aren't so easy to actually detect. Some are really obvious, but I've also seen many bots consistently going 2/15/31 in ARAM. \n\n Scores isn't enough in many cases. You have to start looking at their playstyle, chat logs etc. And it gets very time consuming quite quickly.\n\n You also have to be extremely careful that the person you're perma-banning is an actual bot. Getting it wrong means an innocent player looses their account.\n\n___*\n\nBut I'm always of the thought that, simply claiming other ideas won't be effective, while having no ideas of your own is pointless.\n\nSo here's my idea that I believe would end 50% of bots for good.\n\n**Captchas.**\n\n \nHere's how it would work:\n\n+ If a player is reported quite a few times for \"being a bot\", then they get given captchas to fill out after each game for 10 games. \n\nI sounds simple, but it now just got way harder for botters. They can't just leave their scripts on 24/7 anymore. Not even the most advanced bots can get through capchas, that's why they're used everywhere. Now the botter is forced has to fill out captchas all the time, or stop running his bots.\n\nThe only negative is that a real player might get 10 capcha penalty accidentally. But unlike a ban, for humans a capcha after a game is a just minor inconvenience. \n\nFeel free to critique my idea too BTW :D","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-19T02:07:54.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the Captcha idea. But Riot staff should have some sort of access to every game currently in progress. Like a server connection that shows the games in progress (with summoner names displayed). That way you could easily monitor \"name V2 name\" for example. \n\n\"Another thing to consider is that bots aren't so easy to actually detect.\" I disagree with this. You don't ban on the spot, you do a proper investigation. For example a staff member should have access to ALL functions in a game, so you can see the chat the movements and where they are mouse clicking. If you spot something suspicious you monitor it. Slap the captcha on it. And see what happens. It's time consuming but that's what a job is. Obvious cases are not so time consuming. For example usually a botter runs more than one bot concurrently. Plus the botter is usually online at the same time. Do an ip check on multiple accounts online at the same time. A DMAC check. A virtual machines check. Putting a ban on the root cause would work rather nicely. On a server like OCE with such a low population, I would say that you could eliminate 99% of threats rather easily.\n\nJust to let you know, I have been a cheat buster on worldwide chess servers (7000000 accounts) in the past. There are many techniques involved.
