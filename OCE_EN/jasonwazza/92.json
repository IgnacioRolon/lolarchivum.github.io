Most other ADCs have decent kill potential on their own, whereas in the early Jhin seems to need to rely on at least some CC from the support. \n\nThat said I don't think he's weak at all, in fact I think the opposite, but he's the most removed from the typical ADC playstyle so far as I can tell, so people are still very much getting used to him, and even ADC mains will have to switch things up a bit. My feeling is that if you have even a halfway decent support and you watch and follow their engages/pokes then you should do pretty well as Jhin (in an even skill level match up at any rate).\n\nThat's just my experience, and it's not exactly qualified evidence, just what I've been seeing. I played an abysmal support game and the Jhin did bad too, I played a great support game and the Jhin did great too. It's not so easy with people being individuals and all, but so far that theory has held true for me in 10~ or so games.","replies":[]}]}
