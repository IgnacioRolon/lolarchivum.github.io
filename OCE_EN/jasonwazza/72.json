I've recently been tilted because I'm very rusty at league, and bleeding out mmr and lp like mad. Just today I tried to play very aggressive with janna, but was never getting any follow up for my picks, and these weren't necessarily bad picks, this wasn't my team's fault either, but this was my fault because I expected them to make too many big plays without earning their confidence with a high winrate this season. Sure I might be trying to make a big play, but should they have any confidence in a guy that is currently declining at an alarming rate?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deathchewy","date":"2018-02-07T10:20:35.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's say i've done all this and still keep falling.
