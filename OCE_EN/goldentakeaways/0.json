Understandably that had expired also. \r\n\r\nIm not expecting you to be able to do anything with that - but it would be REALLY nice and appreciated, if you could grant me that one also!\r\n\r\nThanking you greatly. \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nxxxxxxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\nTo: xxxxxxxxxxx\r\nSubject: RE: Your Hoyts Enquiry - Issue ID :088052\r\nDate: Sat, 26 Dec 2015 23:28:11 +0000\r\n\r\nNo worries, I&rsquo;ll have this dispatched in the morning so it should be with you on Tuesday or Wednesday.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe code for the skin that was in the pack has expired but you can get a new one from Riot games, here&rsquo;s the note we received from them below:\r\n\r\nIf you have received your show bag, you may have found that the skins (download code) has now expired.\r\n\r\nThese skins were provided by Riot Games with the understanding that these would be distributed on the day of your session.\r\n\r\nAlthough this skin has expired, the team at Riot Games will be reissuing the Arcade Riven skin for all ticketholders!\r\n\r\nTicketholders who do not currently own the champion Riven will also receive the champion.\r\n\r\nTo obtain your skin, Riot Games will need a copy of your booking confirmation along with your Summoner&rsquo;s Name forwarded to OCEEvents@riotgames.com.\r\n\r\nIf you have purchased more than 1 (one) ticket, please provide one Summoner&rsquo;s Name for each ticket holder, as downloads are limited to one per account / Summoner.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding your skin, please contact the team at Riot Games on OCEEvents@riotgames.com. \r\n\r\nIf we can help with anything else please let us know.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\n HOYTS Cinemas Sylvia Park | 286 Mt Wellington Highway|Sylvia Park|Auckland\r\n\r\nDirect XXXXXXXXX | eXperience more","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTakeaways","date":"2016-01-25T10:31:24.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have just emailed you now :) Thank you heaps for the prompt response!!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-25T09:50:18.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thats real weird,\n\nCan you email me Maraudaur@riotgames.com with your summoner name, and HOYTS receipt and I will make sure you get the skin.
