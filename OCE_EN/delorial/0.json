It would be something highly abusable at higher levels for split second animation cancelling during duels, and although it makes sense logically, it could wreak havoc on some game balancing for champions with slower animations and attack speeds versus high mobility champs.\n\nThere is however a way which you can avoid being stunned/damaged! If you flash into the fog of war it will completely and instantly cancel the animation, allowing you to walk away. This is the case for most spells/attacks. Keep it in mind!","replies":[{"poster":"Delorial","date":"2016-11-09T10:24:50.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good tip with the Fog of war - thanks man.","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-11-11T00:30:08.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So true. i'm a renekton main, hes so badass :p","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-10T19:00:36.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Flashes cannot escape me.

Technically, i think, you hit flash before the stun hits you but due to the windup, your flash doesn't activate until the stun hits.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-10T14:03:48.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Renekton is one of the strongest early game champs available which means you'll need to respect him in lane if you hope to get out alive. Depending on who you are playing, it helps if you can poke him down so that he isn't able to all in you (eg Panth's Spear Shot) or use a readily available escape move when he dashes in (eg Shen's Shadow Dash). If the match up isn't very favourable you might need to flash earlier since Ren's Ruthless Predator is a super quick auto attack reset.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-07-10T01:22:38.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to make sure he cannot dash through one of your minions in the first place man.
