Generally, they seem to become available within about 24 hours, so it may just be a matter of being patient. If you still haven't got access to them within about 24 hours of unlocking them, you should submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let them know about the issue, and hopefully they'll be able to help.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hobbo jim","date":"2019-07-10T03:48:46.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not sure if this is your issue but:\n\nAfter you get level two, it'll give you an egg and you choose which of the 3 skins you want inside of it.
