How would you get tips on a certain champ when you're new to them? And if people can't complain, wouldn't that encourage ksing and etc.? Maybe I'm just lucky but I've only met 1 person so far who's pushed my buttons, everyone else is really nice or obviously just had a bad day(in which case I try to cheer them up and it works...).\n\nCompletely removing chat would be way too harsh, part of the reason I love league is because every game I get to make new friends and learn new things from teammates or even enemies, if people are smart enough they can just mute...\n\nCommunication wins games:D\n\nPs.

I have to keep reminding myself all the time that I can only control my character in the game, so just do your best and don't let the whole' ugh wtf stupid adc wont ward ' thing get into your brain coz it'll probably make you perform worse. \n\nGl in not getting matched up with any trolls!:) \n\nPs.

However, our design philosophy is to not completely remove a feature just because there is a potential for toxicity--we always assess the pros and cons, and try to see if we can figure out a design that is net positive. For example, although there is far less verbal toxicity in a game of Hearthstone, there's also less meaningful interactions and dialogue. In some games that remove chat, it's even hard to tell whether you are playing versus an AI or a human and that makes a difference in your connection with the game. It's nearly impossible to get to know someone without being able to express yourself organically through conversation, and if that's impossible, it's really hard to make friends. We were just reviewing data today that a majority of players have made a real, online friend in League and play with them a decent number of games a month--that's awesome. We think there is huge value in chat and some of our best experiences are those matches where you're chatting it up in games and become friends after._\n\n _To us, that positive experience is so valuable that it was worth trying features like Chat Restrictions and All-Chat Filters to try to reduce  the negativity of chat, while still keeping the benefits.\"_\n\nSource is right [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answers/133551494594), in case you're interested.","replies":[]}]}
