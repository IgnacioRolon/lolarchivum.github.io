If you do something like \n\n\"ping <some ip address>\"\n\nThese numbers won't necessarily be 100% accurate because ping commands typically send ICMP packets (which are different than LoL game packets). Since these packets are different, and have different sizes, they maybe be routed differently as they travel through network switches between your location and wherever the game servers are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-16T23:49:04.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I dont do that.

Isn't your own ping exactly what you're trying to measure? Other player's FPS / ping should never affect yours.","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-17T04:13:31.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does affect mine whenever I'm in game actually.
