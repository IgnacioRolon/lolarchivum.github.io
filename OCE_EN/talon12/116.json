It has the lowest pick rate in the game, its overly expensive and the passive it gives takes too long to stack to be useful half the time, literally only 2 champs use it and jax only pick it if he is way ahead, even then its a 30/70 pick/not pick ratio on him, the only person who actually chooses to use it is kayle and kogmaw no longer finds it a viable item since his revert and if you are lucky the odd xin, although its pretty useless on him. Its one of the most expensive items in the game with an extremely low use rate due to only 1 champion being able to reliably build it. So i ask again, is something going to happen to this pretty useless (in current state) item? I know it recently got ~~buffed~~ fixed (How do you make an item that loses stats for finishing it...) but that obviously didn&#039;t fix it, it needs to either provide more bang for its buck, or be made cheaper and more accessible, it should be made accessible to more champions than just jax and kayle, many people could benefit from the item&#039;s intent but its mediocre stats, high price and the passive which takes way too long to stack without some sort of heavy protection (thus the kayle ult or jax ult+E) to really be useful anyway, most champions who could benefit from its passive struggle to even each the passive stage to take advantage of it, which leaves the item unused and pretty useless in general, seriously if the item is only going to be used by kayle, might as well make it like the hexcore. The item needs some sort of tweaking at least, having an item that can only reliably be used by 1 champion is a bit silly.","replies":[]}
