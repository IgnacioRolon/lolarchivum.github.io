Removed all items with spellvamp and you removed akali&#039;s spellvamp passive, so whats the point in having spellvamp as a shown stat anymore, just replace it with your Damage heal or omnivamp or whatever it is you call it now, and change the mastery from 2% lifesteal and spellvamp to 2% omnivamp. It cleans up the useless stat, makes the mastery shorter, and it allows people with gunblade and whatever that other item is to see their healing from the omnivamp. What&#039;s the point in showing a stat that virtually doesnt exist anymore?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-12-03T03:27:53.033+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Morgana still has Spell Vamp passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-03T02:21:01.968+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Spell vamp quints","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wast3land ","date":"2016-12-03T02:43:47.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Here are all the spell vamps i know off.

Spell vamp despite its name doesnt heal from ignite, omnivamp does. Omnivamp is everywhere in the game, spell vamp only has 3 or 4 instances in the game, which could easily be replaced with omnivamp seeing as most of them come with a life steal additive of the same value.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
