Sunfire does x2 the damage cinderhulk does anyway, except the hp is more and it gives armor. Which is way more than 80 hp would ever do. Sure maybe if they stack absolutely nothing but hp all game they get like 300-400 (still completely useless, because they then have no resistances.) The only &quot;benefit&quot; that cinder has over sunfire is for champs that build nothing but hp all game, and still thats more of a negative than anything, because also means they are squishy, even with hp.\r\n\r\n{{item:3068}} - 2700\r\n500 hp\r\n50 armor\r\n48 damage (65 to minions and monsters)\r\n\r\n{{item:1401}} - 2625\r\n400 hp (+ a neglectable amount of an average of 80-200)\r\n26 damage to champs and minions (because it doesn&#039;t even do bonus to minions (LIKE THE LIES IN TOOL TIP, Y U HATE SHEN RITO)(51 to monsters)\r\n\r\nClearly shown by the stats... cinderhulk is worthless junk. 75 gold more for stats far exceeding? You&#039;d get better value off a zed with runic than you would cinder. Hell a Jhin with devourer would be better than cinderhulk on a naut. The only champ&#039;s that actually would ever possible pick cinderhulk on for it to be useful is naut or sion (if that sion can stack and gets to 1k stacks)\r\n\r\nCinderhulk only just has a gold value of 1226 with its immolation... useless huh, what the hell did the other 1398 gold go into other than smite? You didnt pay 1398 gold for smite, so why are you getting this useless junk. Why on earth would you get cinder over sunfire any day. Cinderhulk only has a gold value of 87% with its base stats, immolation (on monsters ofc) and 400 bonus hp, while sunfire has 113% with its base stats and immolation(not on monsters) big difference isnt there.\r\n\r\nSo what is the actual point of cinderhulk, i would really like to know. Why does it cost more than devourer when devourer has a 300 bonus gold value with just its base stats! Cinder is only 81% gold value, using its bonus stacks, while devour with just its base stats is 121% gold value. Im seeing a big ripoff here. With 29 stacks it jumps the gold value up to 171% gold value thats more thna double the gold value of that pile of trash you call a jungle item. And when it evolves into sated, hell when it evolves it jumps even higher, it jumps to 241% gold efficiency! So what the hell is the difference in these items,  devourer is 33% better than cinderhulk with only its base stats, than cinder is using its bonus stats, and when it evolves to sated yet again, easily 150% better value!\r\n\r\nWarrior? 147% gold value, still extremely more valuable than cinderhulk it, why does cinderhulk even exist when it has 0 benefits compared to everything else.\r\n\r\nRunic echoes, yes im going there, without its luden effect its still more valuable than cinder by a nice 14%, with the luden effect though, that skyrockets its value to 153% \r\n\r\nAre you seeing a reoccuring pattern here? because i sure am. Cinderhulk. Is. Useless. Compared. To. All. Alternate. Options. Jungle. Options. By. More. Than. 50%. Each. While. Sunfire. Is. Still. 30%. More. Valuable.\r\n\r\n_TDLR: Cinderhulk is was outclassed by every other possible alternate for nearly every single champion in the game._\r\n\r\n\r\n{{item:3672}} \r\nwhy the hell do boots show up when you search cinderhulk","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-03-11T17:53:11.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well.. I guess.\n\nLets say you are playing amu, most go cinder on him, but if you want you can go Echo then build a sunfire. It works from what i have tried and only limits your tankiness early game. \n\nBut i guess some people still think cinder is amazing or good, and each to their own really. They certainly don't get it for the sunfire passive, they get it mainly for the tank it gives them really.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-11T23:29:08.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"every single amumu I see goes runic.

It cost too much compared to its trashy stats to be of value, one must get 2.1k bonus hp to equal out its value to sunfire..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-03-12T06:42:35.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to take into account the ease of build path when looking at Cinderhulk. You cant exactly compare the FULL cost of the Cindehulk + Stalker's Blade.\n\nCinderhulk itself is an item that costs 1625 gold with a cost efficiency of 1227 [(Taken from the League of Legends Wiki)](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Cinderhulk)\n\nYes this means it is only 76% Gold Efficient (without the Immolate Passive). However, when you consider the fact that for every 100 HP it increases the efficiency by 2.5% it will allow for some scaling into the mid/late game.\n\n[Sunfire only has a cost efficiency of 87% without the immolation passive.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Sunfire_Cape) Yes it is a stronger passive, but it is also a situational passive, which means sometimes it may be completely ineffective.\n\nThe typical Cinderhulk jungler will be running down the Resolve (Defensive) Tree and usually taking Strength of the Ages. (The strongest pickup by far on tank junglers). This in itself will give you 300HP, a further 7.5% increase effectively for free. Now from 84% efficiency there will only need to be 100 bonus HP/Items to reach a cost efficiency equal to that of a Sunfire Cape. (IGNORING THE IMMOLATION PASSIVE). ,\n\nI would also consider the ability to get a similar passive and an item that scales in efficiency into the mid game (which is where Tanks can really shine), it is not that bad of a pickup.\n\nYou have to note also that for its effective cost (1625 Gold) you're getting the flat health aspect and a better passive than {{item:3751}}  earlier than you would be picking up a {{item:3068}} . (You get a 350 Gold starting item into the build path {{item:1041}} or {{item:1039}} .) Because you dont have to build the {{item:1031}} it is also a more versatile item as it can allow you to build Magic Resistance or further health instead of the armor. \n\nNearly every other item that a tank jungler will build will in itself include some HP (Except for {{item:3075}} ). Which means that you'll be exceeding the ability of Sunfire in raw stats by a significant amount with only a couple of core items under your belt. Cinderhulk's great HP stacking efficiency works great in conjunction with the buff you receive from Gromp when smiting it, which can effectively make up for some of the damage it lacks in itself.\n\nAs you mention, it does work great with any tank who has some HP based scaling on any of their abilities, as it will surpass the amount which Sunfire can provide. I hope you can understand that Cinderhulk although it may have some weaknesses within the game, has a clear set amount of strength to work around as well. It's not a bad item at all, and fits very well into the game in its current state.\n\nObviously Warrior and Runic Echoes give a far superior powerspike in the early game, which is why we see these dominate the Professional meta as opposed to Devourer/Cinderhulk which ramp up in efficiency, but that is due to the NEED to powerspike early in a much more meta focused and do-or-die situation in which gold efficiency in the slightest amount reigns supreme to snowball an early game lead and hold it. Anything less than pro play has a much larger room for error and the games are typically not won or lost over a single items gold efficiency. \n\nCinderhulk having a flat value and instant powerspike is a VERY hard thing to balance. It's much easier for a tank to ramp up into a noticeably strong mid-game than to give a very good tank item on par with the Runic Echo/Warrior alternatives and have league of tanks stomping at 11 minutes into a game, where that specific role shouldn't be excelling there.\n\nTLDR:\nCinderhulk GAINS efficiency which exceeds that of Sunfire eventually. Sunfire/Cinderhulks immolation passive cannot be given a number in efficency as its a situational passive. It is hard to balance as tanks with a bigger early powerspike in the jungle raise big problems for the role in itself and would effect the meta heavily.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-12T10:20:55.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Old cinderhulk was broken, and i dont want anyone to suffer that nightmare again, but the ramping was an interesting concept. \n\nYes cinderhulk does wrk well on things like sion and Naut, because of their synergy with it (though most naut I see are found with runic now, and i still see sion's with warrior more than cinder anyway), but any champ that has the option to build anything other than cinderhulk and still be viable WILL take the other option.\n\n\nCinderhulk needs some sort of compensation buff. Be it cheaper or slight stat buff, it needs a buff. 2350 gold would help make it more gold efficient, giving it ramping damage once more, though on a reduced scale, eg \"15% more damage every 3 sec in combat upto a max of 3 stacks. Or increase the health on it by 20%, or the hp scale to 25%","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-03-12T05:29:56.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ya but do you remember when Cinderhulk first came out?\n\nnever again pls no more of those nightmares","replies":[]}]}
