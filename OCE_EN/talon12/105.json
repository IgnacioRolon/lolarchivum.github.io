Plus the teemo would gain natural levelling from tower, shutdown and epic monster kills, making it even harder to kill making rengar lose out on massive damage, your &quot;broken&quot; problem is solved.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-01T12:47:15.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Waste of a good ward\n\nrengar predicts the counter and teams up with {{champion:10}} {{champion:44}} {{champion:203}}  to solve said conundrum.... back to the drawing board","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-01T15:50:52.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What conundrum. Pure damage passes through all immunity effects other than zhonya and bards ultimate.
