So in reality, the tip shows that it only affects attacks that do 200% crit damage and isn&#039;t modified, when it still applies to modified damage, because for shaco q it would be more like 190/210/230 etc. not 200 to 250, by saying just 50%, it makes a whole lot more sense, because it then applies to everything universally, without debate.\n\nSo I propose that you change the {{item:3031}} tool tip to say \"Unique: Critical strike damage is increased by 50%\" instead of \"Unique: Critical strikes deal 250% damage instead of 200%\"","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-27T12:32:49.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Unique: Critical strikes deal 50% more damage.\n\nSee, the problem with that is that it would be inaccurate. After all, IE doesn't cause Critical Strikes to deal an additional 50% damage, it causes them to deal an additional 25% damage. To clarify, 50% is 25% of 200%.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-02T04:30:35.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't matter, it was changed, the infinity tool tip now says it","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-11-02T06:23:30.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because Riot, despite what they say, don't care about clarity.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-27T12:31:33.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my mind is blown like some thing else","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-02T04:31:53.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't get ya, but it got changed like i asked :)","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-11-02T04:36:38.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this was 1 month ago bit late to comment","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-27T12:41:56.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly it just hasn't been updated since those sort of mechanics (crit increase/decrease) has been introduced onto champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-11-02T04:30:38.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did it!","replies":[]}]}]}
