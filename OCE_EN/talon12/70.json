The update for this should filter out in the near future.  As for why this didn't get done sooner - the team has been working on a plethora of features and bug fixes. We've been trying to tackle these as quickly as we can, but hunting bugs is a never ending battle.  I mean how many times did you kill Kha'zix last game only to have him sneak up behind you and murder you at Blue?\n\nThe balance between quick fixes (like changing Mordekaiser and Kindred's description) and larger things (like making sure the store is actually accessible when you want it to be) are always items we're seeking to address and balance, but we don't always get to all the things as quickly as we want. \n\nThanks again for highlighting this again, please keep sending us feedback!","replies":[]}]}
