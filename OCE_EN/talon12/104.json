Mostly in a Visual Update that barrier is the physical model of a champion being changed.\nHence why we wont see a Taric or Urgot skin anytime before their VU, since they are both Sion level of model change.\n\nFrom what we heard it seems that the VU team is typically separate from the skin team, while at the same time some people interchange between them. So there can easily be collaboration there.\nIt is possible, but likely too much work at the given point in time, and not to mention that working on a skin side by side with the VU could interfere with the artistic design of what's already given.\n\nBut also, why does Fiora need a new skin NOW?\nGP and MF makes sense for them to get new skins with this event and their new skins are tied to the lore of the event. Not to mention there are a LOT of skins in the update for the event.\nIt's likely that there was too much work going on at once for Fiora to get a skin alongside her rework.\nBut it's also notable that other champions so far haven't really gotten new skins with their reworks.\n\nPS: I really want an Armour of the Fifth Age Sion <3","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
