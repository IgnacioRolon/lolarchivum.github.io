So I really want to know, why do we have to lose lp because of others misdeeds. I want to know why riot, In my opinion it is unfair for us to lose because a troll is in our game. Why you make it harder to rank up by burdening us with a loss of lp because someone wanted to ruin our game. I can accept a wait, but losing lp to avoid losing lp is just unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Cuttledawgs","date":"2015-05-25T09:00:20.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the league system creates a 50/50 win loss(so to speak) ratio for \"trolls\". In most cases this person has a low pick order or the enemy or allied team picks a champion that they dislike, in any case they assume if the game plays out they are sure to lose, so by flaming in the pre game lobby they only improve their odds, if it fails and they have to play the game so what it was already a sure loss( in their mind ). The logical thing for them to do is troll, if someone else leaves champ select it's a win. The problem here is if one of these people enter a game in champ select in becomes a lose/lose situation for the innocent people. They either endure a horrid twenty minutes of a smite ignite tank teemo adc or they jump the game and get a timer and lose Lp and possibly get a ban. The way the system is structured has made the decision with the best outcome much easier to be obtained by the troll or flamer in many situations.","replies":[]}]}
