They were also baiting me, and ashamed, I admit that I took the bait and got into an even madder state than i was currently in, I now realize I should have just left the game alone and taken some time to cool off instead of playing a game to try and do so.\r\n\r\nAlso,\r\nLets just be clear, ~20% of that was also just repeating what they said back.\r\n\r\nFor example, things like, Stfu noob,  sb rengo or Rengar are you b5 or wood 5?, which was in reply to his &quot;Stfu noob, sb morde and Morde, are you b5 or wood 5?&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I know i did say some extremely rude things, and for that i am sorry, I should not have played with a clouded judgement. I am deeply sorry,  I apologize to the people I have offended.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have only logged back on today to find this, as I had decided to take a few days break from the game to take a good long break from this game.\r\n\r\nI humbly request a second chance, a chance to redeem myself for my mistake.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-14T06:43:47.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Talon12,\n\n\nAs this is a discussion pertaining to one of the Player Behavior & Reform systems [Suspension] in League of Legends, the best place for this discussion would be the [**Player Behavior & Moderation**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) sub-boards.
