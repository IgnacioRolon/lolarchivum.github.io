Although if not enough \"teams\" post here saying they are going to play (four at least) I will cancel it. This will be decided on Thursday the 6th of August, if there are enough teams to play and if so the roster will be done up by Friday, posted here, then held on Saturday or Sunday. If any excess teams are rostered I will try to fit them (1-2) but if too many excess teams are rostered I will have to cancel their submissions(sorry)\n\nEach team may have 4 players (3 playing and one sub(not necessary))\n\nEach team must submit their entry in a similar fashion to;\n \n(sentence to state you want to join)\nPlayers:\n(player 1)\n(player 2)\n(player 3)\nSub:\n(sub 1)\n\nclearly stating subs and players, the submissions may vary, as long as it is easy to read who is playing and who is sub.\n\n(note: the sub may get a skin depending on their performance)\n\nThis will be held in custom games in private, it will be password protected, so your leader will need to add me to get the password for the team. (if whole team adds, would make distributing prizes easier)\n\n____\n\nFor convenience, please post your team in the designated area's (teams 7-8 can be used for full teams, otherwise they are for single players seeking a team)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-07-28T13:01:48.205+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check out our events portal! - http://events.oce.leagueoflegends.com/\n\nRegister your event here and if there are 8+ teams we will provide some prizing for the tournament","replies":[]},{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-29T12:03:10.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I get 2 other guys who don't even play ranked, can I still join even if I know I'll probably be used to mop the floor?","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-30T00:45:47.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes you can","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-28T12:19:11.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i guess i can enter as a single player with no team?\n\nif so, sign me up\nalso, since boards is kinda dead, it will probs take a while to get all the player you need .","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T12:50:24.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"guess it wont happen then, its only really 12 people needed, sure there's enough here for that","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:46:56.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 8:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:46:33.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 7:\nGarens Harem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:46:11.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 6:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:45:46.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 5:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:45:20.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 4:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:44:52.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 3:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:44:01.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 2:","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-28T11:43:36.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Team 1:","replies":[]}]}
