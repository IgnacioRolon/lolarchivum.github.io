But when I reinstalled league, it downloaded the whole game in about 20 minutes and installed, everything seemed ok and same, 5 bar connection, 20-40 ping, the only different thing I noticed was that I now had 95-120 fps instead of 60-70. Everything is ass it should normally be, but when I join a game, I&#039;m stuck an a dc state, where people move, but nothing has animation and my champion wont move around. I cant see any reason, other than I might be missing some files (though they should have come in the download). I will run a few more drivers to see if that works, but otherwise I have no idea at all.","replies":[]}
