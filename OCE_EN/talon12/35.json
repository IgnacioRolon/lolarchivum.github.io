I am 1 games off finishing low priority (for answering the phone) fine long call I can understand, but the last game of queue I dc for 2 min and I end up getting it reset, this is a bogus system if every time you get a short dc it is reset. what sort of behaviours changing is this? all this is going to do is make people more negative towards the game and everyone who plays it, and srsly this get a 20 prio for 2 min dc bogus is really starting to get on my nerves 2, its really agitating, I sit down to have a nice game, all fun and all... dc for 2 min then cant play anymore games cuz I got this bogus q that cuts me down for time. You need to make this better and rethink it.\n\nI sugest instead of 2 min dc people and giving a min of 60 low prio you make if so;\n- only applys to people who are dc for more than 40% of the game (I can garentee that 2 min is not 40% of the average 37:26 minutes)\n- Happened multiple times in last few days/weeks","replies":[{"poster":"Shyama","date":"2015-03-02T23:15:22.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"10 seconds an change a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-03T02:24:23.448+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but having a 10 sec dc because your internet stuffs up is not a valid reason to give 60 min min wait time","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-03-02T12:11:47.518+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 mins can change a game","replies":[]}]}
