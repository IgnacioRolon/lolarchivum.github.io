I see this as unfair on oce seeing as they already do not have the option to get unchained alistar like Na and EUW etc.\n\nConsidering the [support page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202083184-Promotional-Content-Free-Swag-) was also updated not that long ago and it states that OCE may infact still be eligible for the RGT skin, therefore it should be, but apparently [it has \"expired\" for OCE](https://www.facebook.com/LeagueOfLegendsOceania/app/174961479209942), but the other regions still have full access?\n\nThere is even an entire [article \n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751824-How-to-add-Facebook-Tristana-to-your-account) from the support telling you how to get it, even though it is (hopefully shall only be currently) impossible.\n\nDreadknight works in full so that is fine, and unchained Alistair is not and never was available to oce, so that is validated. The problem stemming from this is likely a mistake from riot, which i wish to be cleared up.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-27T13:02:24.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can confirm Riot Girl Trist is available for OCE.
