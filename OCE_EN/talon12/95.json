Or does it tell you that you can't use a password you previously used?\n\nWhat I would suggest is to make your password something completely different, so your muscle memory doesn't kick in when you go to type it. Think of it as a 'new' password that you can naturally type. It will take some getting used to, though.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-06-05T06:38:43.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tried changing back, it wont let me.
