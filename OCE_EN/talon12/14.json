I'm really bad at this game to start with, and the current lag doesn't help. When someone like me can use it, what would happen if someone good uses it. It can somewhat 2v1 well, the only trouble I had was when my team died in a 3v5 and their team just collapsed on me under towers 5v1. You cant help losing when they do that, when they are all full build and 2 of them have ruin elixirs.\n\nYou should try it, and if you can use it, have fun melting everything in sight","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fatdragon116","date":"2015-09-21T20:23:38.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree you can use stun card for ganks.
