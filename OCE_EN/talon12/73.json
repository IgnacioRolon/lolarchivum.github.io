So I&#039;m done waiting on that. The &quot;beta/legacy&quot; issue might not be what it was now as it was on release, but it helps those people who just sit there and launch legacy through the beta every time, saves a tonne of time.\n\nYou can use the legacy client without needing to go through the whole &quot;open beta launch legacy&quot;, you ca simply go &quot;C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends&quot; or wherever you installed the game, and create a shortcut to the &quot;lol.launcher.admin&quot; file and launch legacy directly through that. Using simply &quot;lol.launcher&quot; isn&#039;t valid because that will automatically be updated to the beta, but the admin file remains untouched and allows the direct use of the Legacy client. Though they may have changed it, this was valid in 7.2 though.","replies":[]}
