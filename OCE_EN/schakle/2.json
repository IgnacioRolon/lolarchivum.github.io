But how it went isn't important. Towards the end of the game that I'm pretty sure we would have lost anyway. My router died. I ran out to restart it but the whole process took more than 5 minutes.  When I got back I was not surprised to find we had lost. What *DID* supprise me was the five games in a leaver queue. What. The. Hell. I thought that the LeaverBuster was supposed to detect when you left due to external factors, rather than just hitting the \"Leave game\" button. Can someone please explain how this stuff works?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-18T05:28:53.732+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well,\n\nRiot said they'd only revoke the leavebuster penalty if they get a message from the ISP that \"yes, we're having some troubles with all our customers\". I'm not sure if this means they'll accept messages from ISPs who say they're having problems with *particular* customers, or how many ISPs have agreed to do this with Riot, but my presumption is that it's **not many**.\n\nFor something like your router dying, you would still be considered to have \"left\" the game on purpose, however stupid that sounds. But it's fair, I think, because if you could do that, then people would just leave games by unplugging their routers.\n\nStill a real shame how there's nothing to detect the event of someone actually clicking the \"leave game\" button. Like, the punishment should be *slightly* less if it's because the client crashes? Anyway,\n\nHope that explains it for you. If you need anything more then just ask!","replies":[{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-19T07:51:55.296+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea that makes sense. Thanks man! It still pisses me off but at least I have an understanding. And yea I agree with you, it's something I reckon I can accept.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-19T08:38:54.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, hopefully the Leavebuster penalty isn't too long. I think Riot recently fixed its bug where it was resetting the timer.\n\nAnd if your router died, you might want to consider changing it entirely, to avoid things like that in the future.\n\nBest of luck with your games in the future!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
