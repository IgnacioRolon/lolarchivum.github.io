But surely it's possible to set up a small server for tribunal and have a slower system? I would gladly suffer through a little delay if it means we could actually punish the consistently toxic and negative members of the community. One in ten games I play are just upsetting, as someone screams at the team or pretends to be a victim etc etc. So what's Riots view on an actual tribunal system? Does anyone know? Please get back to me on this! Thanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-02-17T00:24:07.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi DarkLorde177,\n\nCheck out [this post](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/tribunal-oce) from Lyte on the tribunal.  It is from last year, but is still relevant today.\n\nThe TL;DR is that the Tribunal is not up and running in any region, and we have quite a few other systems in place to encourage positive behaviour.\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-17T06:32:41.254+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Still doesn't explain why we can't have a basic version of it.*","replies":[]}]}]}
