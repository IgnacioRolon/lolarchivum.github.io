But it's in there basic code of conduct that you should alot time to play any game from start to finish, not that 1-2 afk's will get you banned, because we all have that 'oh shit' moment in the middle of a game where RL calls and we got to go, but don't make habits of it, you can be punished, suspended, or banned for afking in bot games just like any other game mode.  I would not expect a response from RIOT, if you really wanted one you'd file a support ticket, and they'd probably just tell you it's standard agreement pop up, and that bot games count too.","replies":[]}]}
