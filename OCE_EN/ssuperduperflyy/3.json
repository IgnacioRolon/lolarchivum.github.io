After editing some videos for my youtube channel and using &#039;BaronReplays&#039; to go back over game clips and looking for highlights using the x4 speed features to stop myself from having to watch the entire match; and now for some reason the game actually still thinks I am playing at x4 speed. Some of the things that were happening were somewhat like that, but 4 times as fast; For example when I would click anywhere to move my character would run there in 2 or 3 seconds but the white line on the minimap would take a while to catch up, another thing that would happen is my character would &#039;get to&#039; the creeps in the jungle camp and I could see the spot where it is but nothing is there (they would only spawn once the white line on the minimap has caught up. Animations, Auto attacks, missiles and my (and everything else on the map that moves (players, minions, dragon, minion camps etc.)) would go ridiculously fast. Also the clock would be 4 times as fast but keep jumping back to where it should be, The &#039;match found&#039; clock was also 4 times as fast aswel.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else had this error, Anyone have any insights or fixes; Ive put a lot of time (and money) into this game and would not like to simply not be able to play \r\n\r\nIm currently uploading a clip and will link it when it uploads, it shows what I&#039;m trying to explain really well\r\n\r\n{{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-04T03:55:37.021+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey SSuperduperFlyy,\n\nI suggest performing a [client repair](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues).
