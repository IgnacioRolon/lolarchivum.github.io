I have spent years playing LoL (starting at the end of Season 3) and invested a fair amount of money into my account and I believe this permaban is completely unfair and no proper research has been done to verify the use of third party software and the history of my account. I'm not a cheater, I'm not a toxic or abusive player so i would very much like to discuss this ban with someone and hopefully work together to get this ban reversed so I can continue to play this wonderful game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-07T02:50:29.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Live discussion is not something that Player Support utilises or likely ever will. Given the vast timezone differences between English speaking regions, it wouldn't really be feasible or practical.\n\nIf you could be a bit more specific on the steps you have actually taken, we can probably point you in the right direction. Did you go through the account recovery process or just change your password and leave it at that? What kind of ticket did you submit to support? Did you get any response at all?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-07T10:30:47.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My brothers account is pretty much in the same spot.
