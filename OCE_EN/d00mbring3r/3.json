Known for their trickery and sometimes not so innocent pranks the raccoon tribe have the ability to shape shift which they use to trick people unaware. Once Zed found out about their ability and powerful magic item, he sort out and slaughter the whole village, all but one. the only survivor of the battle, Nuki grabbed the magical item and ran away before anyone could find him.\r\n\r\nThe magical item was a plain looking sack, but with it allows Nuki to transform and help out his allies \r\n\r\n\r\nPassive: Gifts from the sack\r\n\r\nEvery 10 auto attacks Nuki&#039;s magical sack drops a random berry that an ally can pick up or an enemy can squish. There are 3 berries Health berry, Manna berry and Gold berry.\r\n\r\nQ: Sack Whack \r\n\r\nNuki swings his magical sack and causes any minions in the way to be pushed to the side. Also damages enemy champs\r\n\r\nW: Power of the sack\r\n\r\nNuki gives his magical sack to an ally which grants a shield and bonus attack speed, or cast on to an enemy to stun and reduce attack speed. Nuki ccan not use his sack until effects have finished (so or abilities are unable to be used)\r\n\r\nE: Heavy sack\r\n\r\nNuki Throws his sacks which slows all enemies champs and deals damage to them\r\n\r\nR: Magical Sack\r\n\r\nNuki Shapeshifts in to a chosen ally champ for 8 seconds gaining all the basic abilities they have. This also gives the chosen ally a decaying shield for 2 seconds. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat is my idea let me know what you think","replies":[]}
