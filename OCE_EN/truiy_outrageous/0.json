Or something along those lines possibly.","replies":[{"poster":"Derpcat2986","date":"2015-03-06T00:51:27.041+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Bard's secret passive was to bugsplat people when he picks up charms","replies":[]},{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2015-03-01T22:08:34.994+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The icon was a teaser for Bard.\n\nIt has been on the rift for a while now and frankly I am surprised you haven't heard about it or seen it yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-04T05:23:36.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The real question is, why are you not playing Draven mid for freelo?
