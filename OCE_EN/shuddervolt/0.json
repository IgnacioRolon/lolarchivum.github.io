Well I feel as though it&#039;s cause at least 1-3 members on my team aren&#039;t pulling their weight ingame. \r\n\r\nRecently, I went Taric support with a Vayne who kept on either running away or engaging at the wrong moment, as well as an Ivern top who kept on feeding. (Cred to both for not blaming or flaming anyone tho). \r\n\r\nSince I was support though, I felt pretty powerless to turn the tide of the game, I could get picks for my team but nothing alone which is my problem. \r\n\r\nSo is there anyway I could carry as a support or any support champ for that matter?

A good support will really augment a good ADC's - or good team for that matter - effectiveness. However, little can be done if your carries are gronks. No matter how well you ward, no matter how well you did in lane, no matter how hard you try to prevent bad situation, if the team insists on chasing past ward lines, gets too far behind during early stage, don't ward themselves, et cetera, not much can be done.\n\n'Tis the life of a support, I'm afraid.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-27T12:48:08.275+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't play Taric then. He is literally useless as a laner (without voice comms).\nFor solo que you either want easy champions or playmakers (or both).\n\nIf you like Taric, play Braum or Leona.\nAs a support, roaming becomes very important. Go with your jungler and gank a lane together, it almost always results in a  kill. It also usually makes that laner rage at your bot lane for not calling MIA and you can win the psychological battle.\n\nTo be a good support, its mainly about your decision making really. I find that supports and junglers are more about decision making and game knowledge than any other role (since you have so much \"free time\").\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter looking you up: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=shuddervolt\n\nYour builds as a support are expensive and not necessary. Don't build {{item:3065}}  instead build {{item:3190}} . Half your support games you don't even buy sightstone or upgrade your sweeper.\nHalf your games in general you don't remember to buy boots.\n\nYou are still using tier 2 runes. You take deathfire touch on almost everyone.\n\nI'm sorry friend, but you are not ready for ranked imo. Study more, watch streams, youtubers, pro players etc. Learn the game and don't jump into ranked because you will be put into bronze. Better to learn how to play before you mess up your MMR then try to fix it after your learnt.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2016-10-27T11:20:23.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am only B1 so I don't really have any qualifications to say anything, but I found that picking supports that can be built to carry helps a lot. Morg is my favourite example. Starting with a Spell-thief's gives you some mana regen and gold income, and after a SS and Frost Queen's, it is quite easy and viable to build AP and be a secondary APC. Her kit also compounds this with great CC and a shield, so even if you don't carry and build support, you can still make game-making picks.\n\nAt lower ELO's, I heard Lux works well too, but drops after Gold or so. Zyra I imagine is good too.

When I play ADC I nearly always play passive aggressive.\n\nSo if I see my opening, i'll ping then go in and initiate the fight. \n\nProblem is some ADC's won't take the hint at that crucial moment. \nSo the key is to always stay with the ADC, let him/her do some damage to minions/champs, then as the enemies take damage, I would take the opportunity for example to land a pull or hook (Thresh and Blitz) landing a kill (Or double)for the ADC.\n\nI'm not overly skilled with Braum, however the slows he has is amazing, use that to your advantage. \n\nHope I helped, I'm actually in the process of making an ADC and Sup Tutorial if your interested.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2016-10-27T11:16:27.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're getting picks for your team you're doing your job, you're not realistically going to be able to win any 1v1 as support though.

You do so much damage and if you get ahead during the midgame, then you don't even need to bother with peeling since you'll just run at the enemy carry and sup and 1v2 them no sweat. My platinum friend did it to troll in a few games with me and then I tried it and even though I still prefer traditional supports as the support main I am, it's still incredibly strong and can carry so hard even if your adc is a potato. Your midgame powerspikes as Dr.Mundo Support involve doing as much damage as a full ap support and being constant annoying poke in lane, thanks to almost free spammable %hp cleavers and yet being as tanky as an alistair or braum. You can towerdive like the best of tank supports with your ult letting you stay under tower for basically as long as you please, you're a decently strong duelist with alot more damage threat than most other tank supports, you really aren't easy to kill if you get caught out, your new e pushes towers so quickly and your poke and lane sustain basically outperforms every other champion in the game.\n\nTry carrying a few normal games with Dr.Mundo Support before taking it to ranked though and try to buy 'team benefit' items where you can since you do sacrifice alot of peel when going mundo sup and whilst mundo sup can 1v1 a toplaner or jungle if you can keep up in gold, lategame you'll need these items to compensate for the lack of cc, peel and survivability you would have offered to your squishies with other picks..\n\n{{champion:36}} {{item:3401}}{{item:2045}} {{item:3111}} \noptions against heavy ap {{item:3190}} {{item:3065}} against cc and kiting {{item:3102}} {{item:3222}} {{item:3748}} \noptions against heavy ad {{item:3143}} {{item:3068}} {{item:3075}} against heavy poke {{item:3083}} {{item:3071}} ","replies":[]}]}
