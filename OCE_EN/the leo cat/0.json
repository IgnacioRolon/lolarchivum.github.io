I took a look at what she used to be, and what she is now. And I think I&#039;d rather have the old kindred back. Or at least parts of her kit. \n\nIt looks like you Olafed a Jungler, then tried to fix her by making her a hard ADC. Then buffered her to be forced into an incredibly expensive build path that makes her so damned weak before the 25-30 minute mark. While completely neutering her early game dueling ability by removing her flat 2 second cool down and forced it to drop down from 4 seconds to 2 seconds over the course of four ranks. So before then... the only way to do well in the early game is to be better than your opponent by a massive margin. Meanwhile, Old Kindred had options on what they were able to do. You could build On-Hit, Lethality, Bruiser, Critical, and pull off those builds so well for a jungler. She could adapt! \n\nDesignated ADC was feeding hard and fell behind? You can take over the role.\nThe enemy team was tank heavy? Just go On-Hit and you were one of the counters.\nNeeded an Assassin? Lethality Kindred.\nADC's blow chunks of your health out? Bruiser Kindred.\n\nCombined with her heavy focus on kiting and the ability to hop around like Kalista in the early stages of the game was enough to justify her squishyness as a duelist and solidify her place as a jungler and ganker. And put her on even ground with some of the more popular junglers. Heck, it probably even justified giving the enemy knowledge about her marks. Because she was probably strong enough to fight them for it.\n\nThis is not saying that the new Kindred is weak. There are clear and better options than her, but they are still viable if your team doesn&#039;t feed. It&#039;s just the way she is, she only starts becoming a threat when she builds three major items now, and those items are pretty damned expensive for a jungler.\n{{item:1412}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3087}} \n\nSo... could you pleease bring back some pieces of her old kit? Give them their options and dueling power back.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-08T22:34:59.887+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want old kindred back :(\n\nNew Kindred doesn't feel the same, her marks are technically stronger, but feel worthless.","replies":[{"poster":"The Leo Cat","date":"2017-07-09T22:33:44.787+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"*Offer's a hug 3:","replies":[]}]}]}
