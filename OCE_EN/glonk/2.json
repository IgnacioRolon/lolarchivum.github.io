Still learning hecarim and rumble, but i probs wouldnt trust myself no to suck vs anyone that knows what they're doing.\n\nJg champs are mostly Fizz, Vi, Gragas, Skarner. Can also play Aatroxx, Mao'kai and sion, but not quite as good.\n\nMid lane's probs my worst role other than botlane, my champ pools pretty small. Basically fizz, xerath and orianna. I can play lost of other champs, just not as comfortably as those three. \n\nAnyways, add me if you want and we can have a few games and see if everyones happy with it.\n\nI've got TS3 too, btw.","replies":[]}]}
