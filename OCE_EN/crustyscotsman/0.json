With the Sion rework I haven't really seen many people playing him, and what better to attract the crowds then a new skin for an amazing champion! \r\n{{champion:14}} \r\nMy main idea came from seeing the firefighter Tristana skin, and I thought about how firefighters often have a big guy who is there to kick in doors and cut them down with a massive fire axe. This made me think who would best fit that concept, and who better then our favourite undead juggernaut, SION! Thus, firefighter sion was born.\r\n\r\nHere's the run down:\r\n\r\nHis outfit would be replaced with a firefighters outfit, his axe with a firefighters axe, and his leg stump would be replaced with a fire hydrant or a fire hose or something.\r\n\r\nPassive - Glory in Death\r\n\r\nNot sure what could change for this, maybe he sees everyone on fire and tries to put it out with his hands. Suggestions?\r\n\r\nQ - Decimating Smash\r\n\r\nI couldn't think of a change for this part of his animation, maybe add a water affect to it or something\r\n\r\nW - Soul Furnace\r\n\r\nInstead of the usual red coloured shield whenever this is activated, he has a watery blue shield that explodes with water when reactivated.\r\n\r\nE - Roar of the Slayer\r\n\r\nWhenever sion uses Roar of the Slayer, instead of sharing at his enemies he could instead kick out with his foot, which then sprays water at people. Whenever he hits a minion the minion is sent flying, leaving a trail of water as he goes. Whoever is hit by the ability can have a wet dripping animation on them instead of the red circle showing they're slowed\r\n\r\nR - Unstoppable Onslaught\r\n\r\nThis is where you could have lots of fun with this. I had a couple of ideas for this one, both of which sound awesome\r\n\r\n1) instead if just running down the lane, he could jump into a firer ruck that races down the lane, which would let of a loud siren that's heard across the map instead of the shout. When he collides with an enemy it explodes with water and sion is flung from the truck to continue his rampage. When he doesn't collide, he jumps out of the truck an punches the ground, causing the knock up\r\n\r\n2) he runs down the lane, but as he's running he leaves a trail of water behind him. As he runs dummies appear in front of him, which he picks up and carries over his shoulder. Sion, being the clumsy oaf he is, slams them down by mistake once he hits the end of his ult. Alternatively, doors could spawn in front of him, which explode into splinters as he runs through them.\r\n\r\nBacking\r\n\r\nWhen he backs, he could have a funny little animation involving him stuffing around with his fire hydrant leg, and at the end the hydrant releases a large burst of water, propelling him back to spawn. Maybe it could involve him trying to put out a fire with a fire hose or something, and with a sudden large burst of water he's sent flying back.\r\n\r\nI had a few other ideas which I thought might be interesting.\r\n- engineer sion (large wrench instead of axe)\r\n- sion 2.0 (everything about him becomes awesomer with ROBOT PARTS!)\r\n- metal sion (wields a massive axe guitar and sings screamo at his foes)\r\n- riot sion (similar to firefighter sion but involving riot gear)\r\n\r\nYay or nay? What do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-26T11:42:37.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the concept. Picking up dummies or smashing through doors with his ultimate would be hilarious.\nFor decimating smash, maybe the ground could start lighting on fire during the build up, and he throws a giant fire blanket down over the flames?\n\nLove the metal sion idea, doing screamos fits his vocals so well!! And also the riot sion... I would definitely pay a premium for these skins.\nSion needs a little love for sure!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenera","date":"2016-07-07T08:09:55.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**YES.
