Now Ezreal.. has an ability that positions the champion for you... you merely put your curser where you want to be and press E, he completely removes the 'out of position' crisis that most ADC's have to face. \n\nas for his wave clear, he is an AD champion (which straight off the bat makes it easier to take minions than 50% of champions) his Q 1 hits minions and then refreshes the cool downs of all his abilities. meaning he can Q very very often, as well as Ult very very often. Then his passive makes him get a large attack speed buff.\n\nSo tell me how an AD champion with a large Attack speed buff and a Q that 1 hits minions cant farm?","replies":[]},{"poster":"SquidbrickS","date":"2016-06-13T22:40:38.626+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't really understand how you aren't able to win games with him.
