I think this gives Essence Reaver an actual niche on AD casters without making it excessively powerful. {{champion:126}} and {{champion:236}} are two champions who immediately come to mind as mana-hungry AD champions who would benefit from this change.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-06-28T03:24:49.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point of Essence Reaver was to introduce an item that gives mana-hungry AD carries a way to sustain in lane, the rework you designed creates abuse cases where assassins can use it to sustain in fights, and Riot doesn't like assassins who can sustain in fights, hence the Akali and Kha'zix nerfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Das Kappatal","date":"2015-06-28T03:36:02.973+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a fair point. At the same time, Elixir of Wrath already offers this effect, and I'm operating under the impression that it'd be a unique effect that wouldn't stack with the Elixir. Not to mention Ravenous Hydra offers similar amounts of sustain for most assassins. Kha'Zix is probably the biggest elephant (or void insect) in the room, though, since he would benefit a lot from this.\n\nI don't think a 3200 gold item is especially useful for lane sustain, though. They already tested a mini-Essence Reaver on the PBE a while back, and they apparently didn't like how it played, so I can't say for sure that that's its intended purpose.\n\nThanks for the feedback!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-06-28T16:00:19.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just imagine Luc's ult (I agree with you though he is really mana hungry, especially now that his e has a mana cost).

On someone like Jayce you dont really want to be waiting until you have 3000+ gold before you get mana regen so people would probably still go for tear anyway (at which point you wouldn't need essence reaver any more)","replies":[{"poster":"Das Kappatal","date":"2015-06-28T05:16:17.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funnily enough, they did trial that on the PBE, but decided not to go through with it. I'm honestly not sure what Riot's intended purpose for Essence Reaver is, but 'mana sustain in lane' is somewhat counter to its design.\n\nIt's kinda like how Ezreal often goes Tear before Trinity Force despite the items having drastically different power spikes (Tear spikes at 30+ while TF is best at 20-25 minutes). His needs and wants are so drastically different from the average player's perspective that he's forced into suboptimal item choices.\n\nThank you for the feedback!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-28T07:46:22.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tear doesn't spike at 30+ on an Ezreal unless your horrid at stacking it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
