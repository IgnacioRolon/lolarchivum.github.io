A good kat knows that if they have heavy CC just sit back and dont go in until well into the fight. Where most okay or just good kats just run in and get destroyed like i said. \n\nAlso as i also said. The only way a kat wins mid is if you picked a easy kill for her mid, or if you are just horrible at mid. She has so many counter picks in mid it isn't funny.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Kitty Katt","date":"2016-03-27T00:28:27.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A shit kat yer sure,","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JWhizz","date":"2016-03-23T10:28:21.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JWhizz","replies":[]}]}
