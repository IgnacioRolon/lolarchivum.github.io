Thanks for checking in on this. The skin codes should be emailed out by Event in the next couple of days - it's a digital process rather than a physical skin card!\n\nThere are some technical limitations that mean the codes can only be sent out AFTER the viewing - apologies for the confusion, we need to be better about setting expectations here.","replies":[{"poster":"hekticjellybean","date":"2018-11-05T19:09:47.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So my friend bought 10 tickets online for a bunch of us so getting seats were easier.

Or, at least tell all the attendants that the skin is not a physical copy, but a digital copy, as most people were expecting a physical copy of the skin.\n\nAnyway, it's all good now. thanks for telling everyone!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IZONE","date":"2018-11-03T13:27:13.457+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who told you that there are no skin code???","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Likala","date":"2018-11-03T12:16:10.565+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, happened for me too!
