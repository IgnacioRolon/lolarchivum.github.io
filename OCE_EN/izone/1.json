Maybe they can look up the game through one of them\nHonestly though, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have solid records of TFT games at all. I had to send a screenshot of a game I achieved a certain mission in because they couldn't see that I had achieved it (Which I had to achieve again).  Although I suppose that is different from them seeing records of games that have at least been played\n\nI hope they add Match History for TFT games soon!","replies":[]}]}
