Sure, if you're talking about an off-role, then it would be helpful. But this is your *main*. All smurfing on your main role will do is give you an ego boost from smashing those Golds (or whatever rank your smurf is). The fact of the matter is that you clearly managed to get to Diamond with your main role. You just had bad games/games against smurfs, and now have Ranked Anxiety/Imposter Syndrome, which then further negatively impacts your later games.\n\nA thing I want to note is that there isn't much of a difference between Diamond V, IV and III. Unless you're boosted, and you play at a decent Diamond level, you will notice a lot of fluctuation between those levels. Diamond II+, though, is a whole other story. The reason why I'm saying this is so you don't get disheartened when you bounce between Diamond V and Diamond III. It's perfectly natural!\n\nSo here is my suggestion: take a break for a bit (I don't know... a week?). I myself find I play a lot better after I've relaxed for a while and calmed down. Then go and play on your main. Based on the fluctuation, Diamond III would bounce your way sometime, especially if you're not tilted.\n\nDiamond II, though, would require a lot of improvement (pretty much to the point where you're at the level where *you're* the one influencing the fluctuation between Diamond V - III).\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat would I know, though? I'm just a scrubby Unranked player, trying my best to give advice. Even if there's better advice, I feel like this is at least a decent start :)\n\nHope this helps <3\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]}]}
