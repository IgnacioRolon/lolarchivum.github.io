WTF i joined back and this has been pissing me off. If i was afk for the whole game i understand but i was only gone to fix my lag. Dead set this is so bullshit waiting 20 mins for 5 games because i was gone for 5 mins fixing my net.

Last month i had to leave one game 'cause i forgot an appointment, just had to say sorry and close, got back 2 hours after.\nStill never had a single restriction, wanna know why?\n'cause _accidents happen, and it's ok._\nTo get a restriction, you need to make it _frequent_. Stop the bullshit, you haven't been suspended for leaving 5 minutes once.\nYou know _perfectly well_ why you've been suspended.

You already know all you need to have... It's not like they'll say you're innocent and lift the suspension.
