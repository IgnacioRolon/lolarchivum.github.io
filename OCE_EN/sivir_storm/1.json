The best thing you can do is report those players and move on. If they want to consistently be assholes to other players they will face the consequences. Blind pick does have some added frustrations in champion select (not that this in any way excuses the behaviour), so you could certainly give draft a go depending on what times you play.\n\nIt's important to remember that engaging helps no-one. Asshats will be asshats and nothing a stranger on the internet can say will change that. Mute, report, and don't give them the satisfaction of affecting your experience for more than a moment. Detailed report comments help as well, but the system will take care of them in due time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-12-07T01:08:41.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately that's the state of the game. Riot don't punish toxic behaviour, because they'd lose too much of an income otherwise. And a game where toxic behaviour isn't punished eventually turns into a cesspool.\n\nYou're still a low level and probably haven't invested money into the game. Take this opportunity to leave and find another game, before all this negativity consumes you too.","replies":[]}]}
