Had been abusive to a friend or two as well. As soon as I heard, changed my password, changed my email that League was attached to, thought it was all fixed. Had to play a few games with the lower priority queue because of said hacker. Then last Wednesday night I go to log in and play with some friends (after only getting back into League, and already spending more money on my account) and I got a two week suspension, when I had literally played a handful of games in the time I had started playing again and they were mostly Co-Op vs AI (helping a friend learn League). \r\n\r\nShortly after I found out that I had been suspended (and hadn&#039;t even been shown what I had apparently done to cause it), I opened a support ticket. Got a quick short response (which I don&#039;t really count as one) saying that I would be transferred to the &quot;Player Behaviour Team&quot;. Haven&#039;t heard a single response since. \r\n\r\nHonestly I&#039;m incredibly disappointed in Riot as I&#039;ve been playing since late Season 1 with not a single suspension, ban or having been put into a lower priority queue, until now. There&#039;ve been so many times in the past 9 days that I&#039;ve wanted to just hop on and play with friends (who now know I&#039;ve started playing again and therefore nag me to play with them) but I haven&#039;t been able to. \r\n\r\nI also would&#039;ve thought that Riot would care about a customer who has spent something like over $3000AUD on the game since I first created my account. Apparently I&#039;m just another customer to them that they don&#039;t care about. \r\n\r\nScreenshot of &quot;2 Week Behaviour Suspension&quot; email: http://i.gyazo.com/fab2fd7b772f9edfbac724c76e29926e.png","replies":[{"poster":"CrazyPete","date":"2015-07-03T09:07:58.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I  got a suspension as well for around 2 weeks for no reason the account was untouched no verbal abuse no nothing then today suddenly i got a suspension ban and the most funniest thing was that in the email when i cheeked what was the reason they wrote this \" This Account has been permanently banned \" plis no explanation no nothing , i mean like ive spent ages playing on the account i got to plat 5 and no i get a perma ban RIOT PLIS !","replies":[{"poster":"EzRdr","date":"2015-07-03T10:52:15.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feeling your pain...     in a nutshell Crazypete,   Riot has no control over it's own sucky systems...\n\nHere is a cut/paste from a post I just made in a different thread.\nDon't expect any answers from Riot any time soon ...  they honestly don't give two shits...\n\n\nWelcome to Riot Games online where you can expect to be constantly abused, threatened, ridiculed, sworn at,  swarmed by trolls and never-ending toxic behaviour, harassed out of your lane by team-mates even though you have called it first in pregame,  constantly plagued by afks and quitters.  and regularly have games ruined by the never ending procession of bots in Aram.!\n\nAdding insult to injury is this bullshit system  called Leaverbuster which blanket sweeps you up into it's magic sucker and spits you out without any form of redress or comeback!!   It only takes a handful of the toxic little turds over a period of time to anonymously  report you as afk  and the next thing you get this almighty fist from the sky booming at you in all its might and anonymity that you are penalised blah blah blah!   I thought we lived in the freeworld, not some backwater 3rd world dictatorship ruled by Idi Amin  or in some ISIS caliphate...    is there no such thing as innocent until proven guilty  .    RIOT  seems to be declaring themselves judge jury and executioner here,  and if any feel harshly done by from any of these judgements then it's just stiff shit!!  RIOT DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT!      \nWhy is it that when  I try to question such decisions  and ask for answers to several other issues also (not related,   but concerning bugs/ problems/disconnects etc)  I am given complete silence!!   Several emails  and complete silence later   can only lead me to one conclusion.   Riot sucks bigtime and have no clues and have no answers to the many questions I have emailed them........   bunch of rude ignorant pricks!\n\nHow can this be called customer service?   How can ignoring emails from clients be called anything other than being total ignorant assholes?\nIt's sad enough having to engage with the constant toxic trash in so many games, but when you get treated like dirt and totally ignored by the game creators then how can they honestly expect improving behaviour from the players themselves??\nIs this a fair enough question?\n\nAny system that relies upon toxic prepubescent teens to regulate themselves and each other is going to be 90% flawed and imo is created by lazy and inadequate designers who are incapable it seems of thinking up better designs for improvement.    The current systems are so rubbish it's laughable.... \n\nMost likely this will get under their skin and be removed  -  the truth always hurts.","replies":[]}]}]}
