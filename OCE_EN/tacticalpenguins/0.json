You can&#039;t just leave your team mid game (especially in ranked) and anyone who does is not looked on kindly by their teammates or the leaver buster system.\r\nBut sometimes when we load into the game and are sitting in the loading screen we are met with the not so happy surprise of high ping, depending on the state of our internet. This isn&#039;t something that is predictable for us, speed tests don&#039;t work and it can change in the blink of an eye.\r\nSo I suggest that Rito let us make an informed decision about how we are going to spend the next 20-50 min and put a ping indicator in the client. Have it so we know how our internet is doing and we can make the choice to play the game or not to based on our expected ping.\r\nPut it on the dashboard of the client before we press the play button, next to the profile bar or something, just so we can know if we are going to lag BEFORE we start a game that we can stop.\r\nThe ability to know if you are going to lag before you enter a game could change the amount of people who do lag in games and the general toxicity of people which is caused by lag and others lagging.\r\nI&#039;m new to forums so I&#039;m not sure if Rito will actually read this but it was worth a try.\r\nAlso Draven is the king {{champion:119}}","replies":[{"poster":"proMINscuous","date":"2015-05-20T02:47:26.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think before, there was a ping indicator during the loading screen, it showed your ping and also other players ping, but they removed it.","replies":[{"poster":"LemonHunter","date":"2015-05-20T02:49:37.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's still there showing your ping, but no longer showing other player's pings.\n\nI do agree with the OP.
