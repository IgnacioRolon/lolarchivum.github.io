I have just been through two full games without any technical hiccups. Giving you the full functionality of the spectate mode for your average player is an awesome tool for self improvement. I am aware third party software had offered this previously (to some degree of success as the applications I saw seemed to have never ending issues). But I am stoked Riot has introduced this into the client.\r\n\r\nSo props to the Riot team for adding yet another function into their game free of charge! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-11-15T07:58:02.492+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks man! also remember you can record small clips to show off your big plays =D","replies":[]},{"poster":"RagnerAngel","date":"2016-11-15T13:59:45.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was wondering if they would make the replays watchable even after the match disappears from match history","replies":[]}]}
