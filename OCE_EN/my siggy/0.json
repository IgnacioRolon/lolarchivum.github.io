Basically if you repeat the offence of swearing at someone in a negative or abusive way it will lead to a chat restriction depending on how badly negative/toxic you are being, but at the same time you must remember that Riot/tribunal will only ever take action if these triggers of toxicity come up in chat logs of your games.\n\nSo here's a tip: take it from me minimise your swearing as much as you can because even some 'but hurt' 12 year old could report you and you could pay the price just for swearing once. The second tip would be to not be abusive to your team mates as that is 90% of the cases where people are having their accounts banned. If you are unsure of what to do in game and your put in a rubbish situation before going out and lashing out at your team mate just leave the game if you have to, I understand you pay the penalty of a low priority que but its better then your account being banned or unable to be used. Just make sure you think clearly about what your gonna do in the situation your in whether it be a good or bad one. Make wise decisions and try not to get caught in trashy situations.\n\nGood luck summoner and my best endeavours to you and your mate on your road back to reforming.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Herbs","date":"2017-08-30T03:39:36.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you were too mean!!!","replies":[]}]}
