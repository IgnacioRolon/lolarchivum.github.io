But recently I came across another thing this pathetic game has wrong with it. Long story short, Flexing with 2 others (3 in total). Get into lobby, get into queue, come load screen, player 3 cannot load in, states has internet issues, we are all on same internet.. impossible, tries and tries and cannot load in, can log in fine but can&#039;t load into the match that was currently going, meanwhile in game, comes 3 minutes and we cannot remake stating that no one is disconnected. Loss of LP. Thanks Rito. Another thing you guys seem to struggle with. Maybe it&#039;s just me that gets this bad luck with League. either way, shit company, shit game.","replies":[{"poster":"Swordum","date":"2016-11-22T05:59:10.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to League of Legends","replies":[{"poster":"ZiQuam","date":"2016-11-22T07:44:13.352+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a bit like that isn't it.{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]}
