How did you let it get this bad? Your game is atrocious. The only reason anyone plays it is because it&#039;s the normal thing to do, it&#039;s the game to play, next to H1Z1 and CS:GO. Anyone joining into LoL will have no expectations because they&#039;ve been playing the game not long and all they know is &quot;most played game in world, LoL is so good&quot; etc... Anyone that&#039;s been playing the game for as long as me will say the game is just garbage compared to its older years. why does everyone 1 shot. Why can&#039;t I mechanically outplay an opponent even though they&#039;re on a counterpick? Your game is fucked. Tanks are 1v1ing ADCs. Assassins are 1 shotting ADCs. why play an assassin? Why are all the stats so easy to obtain? Why can a champions weaknesses be fixed in runes and masteries?  What happened to raw skill? fix your fucking game you stupid %%%%s","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-27T08:22:22.231+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> The only reason anyone plays it is because it's the normal thing to do, it's the game to play, next to H1Z1 and CS:GO\n\nI've dabbled in CS:GO, never played H1Z1 and I wouldn't call either of those games \"the game to play\", that very much depends on what games you play and what circles you are in.\n\n> Anyone that's been playing the game for as long as me will say the game is just garbage compared to its older years.\n\nI've played since season 3 and I still very much enjoy the game. I think the game as a whole has improved over the years, sure it's had it's hiccups, but overall still improving.\n\nI also play with 3 or 4 players who have played since S2 or before, one since beta and they obviously still enjoy the game, they're still playing it and having fun after all.\n\n> Why can't I mechanically outplay...\n\nA lot of this is dependent on rank, mechanical skill and experience with any given champion/opponent/team comp etc.\n\n> Assassins are 1 shotting ADCs.\n\nI do have a bit of a problem with assassins but that's what the assassin update is for, to fix those problems. That said, you do realise that bursting the carries is precisely what assassins are designed to do right? The problem with assassins atm lies in their itemisation and mobility, specifically the fact that they face little risk when they choose someone to blow up.\n\n> Why are all the stats so easy to obtain?\n\nAgain, assassin update.\n\n> Why can a champions weaknesses be fixed in runes and masteries?\n\nThe whole point of runes and masteries is to either emphasise a champions strength or mitigate their weaknesses, that hasn't changed at all.\n\n> fix your fucking game you stupid %%%%s\n\nYou think this is the best approach? Just because you don't enjoy a game, doesn't mean it's bad and that noone else is allowed to. If you don't enjoy it don't play it, but don't try and drag all the people who do enjoy it down with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Freddymc","date":"2016-10-27T08:21:18.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> why does everyone 1 shot\n\nObviously not everyone, but if you let someone get ahead by feeding a few kills, ofc they will one-shot squishies if they have moderate burst. If you or anyone else feeds such a champ then thats your/their fault, not the game\n\n> Why can't I mechanically outplay an opponent even though they're on a counterpick? \n\nThere are 'some' champs that can be outplayed even if they are counters, but for the most part, the whole f*cking point of a counterpick is that it counters. Just play it safe, wait till laning phase blows over and make plays in teamfights. It is frustrating when you go up against a brain-dead champ that 100% counters your champ, but if every champ could be mechanically outplayed then a lot of champs would be weak since there are some counter-pick specific champs that are picked for their reliability and consistency in lane\n\n> Tanks are 1v1ing ADCs. \n\nIf an adc lets a tank get close enough to hit him then that is 100% the adc's fault for not keeping distance. Melee champs have the glaring disadvantage of being short-ranged, but have boosted stats and more powerful abilities to make up for that. If you're not abusing your range over melee champs then that is your problem. Adc's are not duelists, they are consistent damage-dealers that can carry games as long as their TEAM protects them\n\n> Why can a champions weaknesses be fixed in runes and masteries? What happened to raw skill?\n\nOk this game still requires heaps of skill as with any other multiplayer game so \"what happened to raw skill\" well nothing it's still there just stop playing annie and try out shit like riven and azir and then you will find raw skill\n\nAnd a champs weaknesses cannot be fixed in runes in masteries, while they can be toned down they are always there\n\nPlease give examples also","replies":[]}]}
