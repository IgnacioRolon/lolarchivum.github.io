Roles are not defined by the META.\n\nA \"position\" is where and how a player might use a champion during the laning phase of a match, and is one of: Top, Mid, ADC, Support and Jungle. Positions are directly defined by the META.\n\nIf you want to play Heimerdinger in the Support position (without the possibility of being banned), you will need to cooperate with your teams so that everyone can agree on the strategy you are using. After all, this is a *team* game.","replies":[]}]}]}
