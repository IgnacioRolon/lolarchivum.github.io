I have only played it with friends, but we seem to have more enjoyable games that way as roles are chosen before we even go into queue.

I got a leavebuster warning for the first time a few days ago  after my sister had started downloading a 15gb update for her XBONE for her Halo:MCC which caused me to suffer ping greater than 800 for the whole match. I didnt leave but i did sit underneath fountain for the greater portion of the game as to not feed and give my team a better chance at wining.  What would you suggest to do when you have ping so high you cant effectively play? And no i had no warning prior to her starting the download so i couldnt tell if i was already lagging prior to loading screen.\n\nP.s There was also a Malphite game i didnt connect to 14 days ago due to a Forced win8.1 update that screwed with my GPU and reverting my DirectX to something like DirectX10 which caused a connection issue when trying to load. Ive never intentionally afk'd despite having those games where your team just doesnt want to play nice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Godsticks","date":"2014-11-24T00:13:03.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And he proceeds to go 0/8","replies":[]}]}
