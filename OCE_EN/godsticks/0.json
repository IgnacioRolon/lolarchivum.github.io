It appears you seem to have a sense of entitlement that you really shouldn't.\nIf you came into a  game with the attitude you've just shown, I'd be pretty disappointed too.\n\nGo have a drink, take a breathe, walk away for a moment, then come back and try again.\nThere are some games where things just don't go to plan, and some people can't handle that. If this is normals, even more reason to just chill out and try enjoy yourself, even if you or your team is feeding. Do your best to make it hard for them to get the kills.\n\nHope your next game is a better experience for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-23T09:22:47.575+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"DId someone apply for the intern role and get rejected? :3","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-23T11:18:09.624+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thats %%%%ing moba for you.
