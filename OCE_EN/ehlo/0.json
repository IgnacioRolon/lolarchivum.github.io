I hear the \"tink\" noise as normal. about 30 seconds after clicking launch the TOS comes up asking me to accept or decline, I click accept and wait for 30 minutes and nothing. It never goes any further. I click launch over and over and just get loads of delayed TOS. If I click to repair the client it does nothing.\n\nI reinstalled LoL. Still nothing. I already run it as administrator, as I&#039;ve done this for years. I haven&#039;t installed any new programs. All my windows updates/flash/adobe air and everything else is up to date upon checking. I'm using windows 8.1, not the new windows 10. This is an issue with the LoL client.","replies":[{"poster":"Askelon98","date":"2015-08-14T21:53:53.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem.
