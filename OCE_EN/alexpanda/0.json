During the preseason I climbed to B2 quite quickly playing champions like Anivia to push and abuse players who didn&#039;t ward or dodge skill shots, if a team mate flamed they were generally the ones who did not contribute to the team&#039;s efforts and I had no problem muting them. So, here&#039;s my &quot;problem&quot; of sorts, playing league is currently impossible to me. If I win lane I help others, I roam bot, I ward the enemy jungle for our jungle or myself etc, but no matter how much help I give my team will still manage to lose the advantage they had. My team mates constantly seem to flame and be toxic in my current skill bracket and it&#039;s ridiculously difficult to offer any advice to anyone without them being toxic ; a ;. Does anyone, no matter how new or veteran have any advice how to get past this rough patch? not necessarily what champions to play/ban, but whether I should just focus on my lane in low brackets and mute my team at the start XD etc\r\n(Also yes I get the whole &quot;some games are just tough, focus on the good games,&quot; I haven&#039;t had an enjoyable game in a very long time, not because of my efforts but the interactions between team mates and their unwillingness to play a &quot;team&quot; game :( )\r\ntl;dr What do I do even though I&#039;ll give bot 5 kills as Sejuani Jungle and they will still flame me and lose lane and blame ; ^ ; etc etc\r\nThankyou!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-06T03:19:07.694+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regarding toxicity, if things get out of hand, feel free to mute them. I wouldn't say to mute everyone at the start, because chances are you might mute someone who's pretty nice and whom you might enjoy playing with in the future. Regarding winning matches at low elo, champions that can get early game advantages and be able to utilize those advantages in the early-game (LeBlanc). Players respawn, but turrets don't; don't get carried away with getting kills for you and your team. Make sure that you're utilizing a decent amount of resources towards seiging and controlling objectives. \n\nLastly, I would say surround yourself with positive players who are as eager to learn as you are. Learning and improving as a group while also reducing the chances of encountering toxicity will make a game a lot more enjoyable and should provide you a bit more consistency in your matches.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ayaya cutie","date":"2016-02-10T10:57:16.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Always be positive is a great way to boost your teams egos aka DSM (Sky). Knowing your champs potential and limits against your match up is also a great way to snowball/ stay safe and farm up. Bronze is just a label if you work hard and don't give up you will win more games. I went from bronze 5 to gold 5 last season to prove that elo hell does not exist. It takes time and hard work but if you want it then you can get it!","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-19T00:10:30.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dsm is legit but i have a sore throat.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-04-18T19:26:50.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=AlexPanda,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=jckRfaqf,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-06T00:52:58.393+0000)\n>\n> where I sit at now currently (b5) seems to be a bit of an \"Elo Hell\" whether the term is real or not\n\nI do think there is an \"elo hell\" but I don't think it's the one everyone expects.\nFrom what I can tell, there are your fair share of throws in every rank, though ELO hell comes from the psychological aspects of playing at lower ranks.\nWhen people flame you for that one mistake, will you or anyone else tilt?\nAre they tilting in the first place because of that one mistake?\n\nTeam mates thinking that the game is now 1000% impossible to win and that you're all going to lose no matter what, and having people on your team tilt for no reason is the biggest cause of loss at lower ranks.\n\nEasiest solution is to find people who are okay with the concept of losing without placing blame and play with them instead of soloQ.\nThey are out there, and Team Recruiter is available if you're unsure where to start.\n\n\n>During the preseason I climbed to B2 quite quickly playing champions like Anivia to push and abuse players who didn't ward or dodge skill shots, if a team mate flamed they were generally the ones who did not contribute to the team's efforts and I had no problem muting them.

Not ours, but theirs.\nMake sure you understand what their champs are capable of and when their power spikes are. I'm a huge advocator of playing ADC and rushing QSS or third item Hexdrinker if you're against a lot of burst AP.\n\nDon't confuse this for me saying you should counter pick a champ depending on their team comp- Play within your strengths and play champions you know, but changing out that rabbadons for Void Staff or buying something with Grevious Wounds against a Mundo may give your team that fighting advantage that can push you to a slow victory.\n\n>Also yes I get the whole \"some games are just tough, focus on the good games,\" I haven't had an enjoyable game in a very long time, not because of my efforts but the interactions between team mates and their unwillingness to play a \"team\" game :(\n>tl;dr What do I do even though I'll give bot 5 kills as Sejuani Jungle and they will still flame me and lose lane and blame ; ^ ; etc etc\n\nThese are the people that you ignore and play past.\nSome games unfortunately are a write off, but those are the games I use a challenge to see how well I can counterplay against the enemy team before we lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-02-06T01:27:20.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uninstall (I'm not joking)","replies":[{"poster":"CookieButtLav","date":"2016-04-18T18:54:58.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll take it as a quip that there is no cure for toxicity, in which case I do believe you may unfortunately be right.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AlexPanda","date":"2016-02-06T01:41:19.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll pass","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2016-02-09T10:00:10.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try getting a lead then slowly help others then try and get objectives if you do decent then help other lanes they'd be more willing to follow an instruction or 2... sure you'll have people who just want death match and shit infact you'll get it alot so play a champ that can take turrets/objectives easily then while everyone is playing their deathmatch safetly take a turret then ward up take t2 ? i dunno it's what i did when i played on my friends account whom quit lol b5 to b3 12 wins in a row :> though i did play veigar mid most of them","replies":[]}]}
