The roster can be between 5-10, if numbers get big we can simply play whenever 5 are on - to get dat grind going. \r\n\r\nIt is preferable that those interested are ongoing and friendly and not just a 12 yr old raging behind a computer screen.\r\n\r\nAll positions are currently available so just tell me where and what you would like to play. \r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"NewTronix","date":"2015-03-12T08:46:43.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I don't play much ranked (except ranked 5's, team just finished provisionals 4-1, Bronze 2â€¦.) but my normal MMR is about silver-gold level. I play mid and a mean Katarina and Orianna, msg me in game if your interested in me :D, also I play a bit of adc. Got 2 level 30 accounts: Main - TSM NewTronix, Smurf - Newtronix\nThanks,\nTronix","replies":[]}]}
