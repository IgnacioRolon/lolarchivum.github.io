Amazing.\n\nThe issue is I've gotten at least 4 Honor 5 Orbs since then, every single one was lackluster compared to the first one (dramatically) as they only contain a small amount of essence and a few key fragments (which you get all the time anyway).\n\nAs it stands I'd rather get a level up capsule than an Honor 5 one, if you were able to get skin shards from each following orb you received at level 5 then more of the player base would be incentivized to become honorable.","replies":[{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-10-13T18:18:26.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the lvl system is kinda pointless in a way though eventually ppl will max out blue essence at one stage and own every champion .
