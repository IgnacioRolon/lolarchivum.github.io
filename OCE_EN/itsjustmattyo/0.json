(Not even 2x 6,300?) I ended up disenchanting both shards and receiving piddly blue essence in comparison to the old system and the amount of games I had to play. \n****\nI think a reasonable change which meets in the middle would be making the champion shards for milestones (levels 10, 20, 30, 40.. etc) have the option to choose which champion of that bracket you want; so if I get {{champion:202}} Jhin (6300), I could instead swap it for {{champion:245}} Ekko (6300) and purchase him.\n****\n {{item:2319}} **But overall the best thing to do would be reconsidering universal BE per game, not just the first game - per game. Make the game feel more rewarding for new players.**","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-19T09:26:35.945+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"BE is so great, you know why?\n\nIf you're 10 blue essence off of a champion, GUES WHAT?

Having limited pages at the start can help people get into the habit of modifying their pages at the start of the game though, which is a great habit to have. So I'm really half/half with this issue and think there are bigger troubles to sort out first.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KAYN BRINGS PAIN","date":"2018-05-19T03:03:20.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope i think it's faster to get characters just lvl up once a day and you get a character everyday","replies":[{"poster":"itsjustmattyo","date":"2018-05-19T16:22:05.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KAYN BRINGS PAIN,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=wifwtfOf,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-05-19T03:03:20.358+0000)\n>\n> Nope i think it&#x27;s faster to get characters just lvl up once a day and you get a character everyday\n\nThe point is you don't get the choice of champion, it's fine if you'll play absolutely anything and don't care as it'll be faster to get a wider pool. But if you're after a specific champion (keeping in mind that most people continue to play this game due to finding a champion they enjoy), you're stuck farming levels for ages or buying RP.","replies":[]}]}]}
