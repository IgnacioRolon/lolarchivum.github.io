He generally drops off in the mid game where other junglers shine.\nFor the most popular jungler to be below 50% winrate in Plat or above is a telling tale. A scary, telling tale.\n\nSource:\nhttp://champion.gg/champion/LeeSin","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-26T10:47:56.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lee loses to everyone for one simple reason.\n\nPlebs spam him when they can't play him.\n\nThere are too many lee sin's that can't execute the basics (i have seen plenty that struggle to even land the Q.) and continue to play him and bring the win rate down.\n\nThat's why his win rate is 44.8%","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-26T19:20:58.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"THIS. \n\n100% this. \n\nProblem with those charts is it calculates players who try him in normals if i remember correctly and that data muddies the waters and hides the real good Lee Sin Players, seriously a lot of Lee mains use this fact not to get banned half the time and can go on a rampage. Funny thing is these Lee mains are the reason the waters are so muddy. People will see a amazing lee player and will jump on him because they own him and try play him like they do and EPICLY fail. I am one of those people who spotted a lee playing amazingly and tried him and it was horrible. It is also the reason why i was banning him every ranked game i played for a solid 20 game streak.\n\nI personally think, that he should have a MUCH higher Difficulty rating than he has atm on his Champ card. As some just think his all about his skill shots where he ultimatly is about proper control and combo use than skill shots. The amount of people who use his ult just because it is up is insane, but when it(his ult) is used properly can be the most annoying ult in  the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-27T04:44:34.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is he can't really be given a higher difficulty rating.\n\nDifficulty ratings tend to be based off the skill floor of a champion, and Lee's skill floor is relatively low (the main skill you need to be able to play lee is to land a Q.) Lee's skill ceiling is where things tend to get hard, because it's really damn high because there is much you have to be able to do to be a really good lee (repositioning with ward jumps to get perfect ults, perfect insecing, flash ulting etc.)\n\nAn example of a champ with a high skill floor (or originally having a high skill floor, it's possible she is easier with the E change a few patches ago.) is Cassiopeia, because cycling posion and keeping her E up is kinda her bread and butter, which tends to be really hard to do.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-27T11:59:27.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I want it raised mainly to scare off players who think his simple really. Because then we would see the real win rate of lee. \n\nLike Udyr they are both heavily muddied by new players or 'noobs'. But Udyr is much easier to learn just over a few games. Still doesn't help people play him like a spazz half the time like they do with lee.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-27T14:12:34.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That won't scare them off.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-26T15:06:21.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree\n\nHe is way to spammed like every 2-3 of my games on one side or the other he was the jungler, with probably 1/15 doing well enough to carry a game.\n\nI have never even seen an olaf jngl.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-27T12:07:38.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"where is shotgun bob? {{champion:104}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-26T09:08:51.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i notice how it says >48%... then it says <52% for the same matchup.","replies":[{"poster":"IGoaLevy","date":"2016-02-26T09:20:43.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the bottom row is the champion, the left row is who they are vsing, so lee loses to all, then on the other champs they all have higher win rate with lee as the opponent","replies":[]}]}]}
