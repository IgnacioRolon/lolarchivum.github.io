It could be that you have an accessibility option activated, which is keeping Ctrl held down/not held at all during the time you're pressing it.\n\nHave you tried resetting your controls to their defaults? That should ensure it isn't a configuration issue. It doesn't take too long to reset your custom controls, especially if you note them down beforehand.\n\nDo you have any third-party input software/drivers installed, such as a gaming software which allows you to customize the light on your mouse, etc.? Try disabling/uninstalling them and try playing again.","replies":[]}]}
