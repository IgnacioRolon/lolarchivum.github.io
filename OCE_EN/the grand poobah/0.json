It&#039;s not because of any mechanics, it&#039;s not because of anything to do with the meta, it&#039;s nothing design oriented. It&#039;s all the bugs. Everywhere. I know that it&#039;s occuring for a lot of people, but I didn&#039;t realise just how bad it was until just recenty. Essentially I got bug splat in the loading screen, and the game was remade before I could join. This is all on you Riot. I didn&#039;t leave. I didn&#039;t disconnect. There was an error, that cost me LP. It&#039;s not just me either. I would say, close to 1/5 games have someone get bug splat at some point. Whether it&#039;s in the middle of the match, or at the start. People seem to be getting bug splats everywhere. I&#039;ve never seen it this bad. \r\n\r\nBut that&#039;s not it. In game bugs seem to be a common occurrence too. Whether its a Tristana ult, pushing me in the opposite direction of what it should be, Malzahar&#039;s crappy minion AI, things going on cooldown without using them etc. In game bugs are terrible, and they&#039;re everywhere. It even happens in professional matches, and it&#039;s embarrassing honestly. \r\n\r\nBut the client is the worst of it. Just because you are working on a new client, doesn&#039;t mean you should forget the old client, especially seeing as we still currently use it. I don&#039;t know when the last time I managed to see how long friends have actually been in game, but it&#039;s been stating game times of over 1100 minutes. If I&#039;m looking at a friend&#039;s profile to see their ranked progress, I shouldn&#039;t see my own League progress. There is an absolute slew of bugs everywhere.\r\n\r\nAll of this is existent, in a game, where the company has no responsibility to any other game. League is Riot&#039;s only game, and as such, these issues should not exist. Honestly, it&#039;s a game that doesn&#039;t seem to be going anywhere either. You might as well start from scratch with League of Legends 2, redoing the lore, redoing the code, but keeping the characters, summoner progress, items and mechanics. By doing this Riot would enable themselves to create the game that League is supposed to be. They have the money, they have the people, they have the community, but I&#039;m really questioning their integrity as game developers. The community will leave if the game continues to crumble, and I love the game despite all these issues, but if I can&#039;t get a good experience anymore, I will also pack my bags, and leave League as a good memory.\r\n\r\nEither way, I just really felt like putting this out there, seeing as I&#039;m a little annoyed right now.","replies":[]}
