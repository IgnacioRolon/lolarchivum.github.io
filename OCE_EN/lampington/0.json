So an ad focused spell vamp item tbh while it may be nice but it really won't get much use it because when assassins insta gib somebody they're mostly full hp anyway while in a drawn out fight they can't utilise the advantages due to everything is on cd.\n\nAnd fighters like Jax, Mundo, Reng and Wukong or melee adcs like Trynd or Yi generally have in-built sustain options like shield/heal or whatever in their kit, so I also don't think an ad focused spell vamp is necessary or remotely useful for them.\n\nIt can be nice to have, definitely. But tbh I don't see anyone will find much use from it because it's prob too situational.\n\nHowever I guess more items into the game is somewhat a good thing to see.\n\nEDIT: Lifesteal procs empowered AA so there's that.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2014-12-06T05:01:22.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So ad poke champs healing every 3-4 seconds with their ranged nuke skillshots, no thanks.","replies":[]}]}
