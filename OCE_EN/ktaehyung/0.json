It&#039;s probably something to do with my internet but I can&#039;t seem to find a solution to this. Whenever I launch the client on the login screen, it would take ages to log me into the game, stuck on the &quot;authenticating...&quot; loop for a good 5 minutes. When it finally loads into the client the home page never loads as it says &quot;we weren&#039;t able to load this page, if your internet is otherwise ok, wait a few minutes and try again&quot; with that always unable to load, I use my mobile data to get into a game because the &quot;Play&quot; button is completely unfunctional. Moving onto the gameplay, I turn my actual internet on to play a game and 30 seconds or so into a game the minions, jungle monsters and champions completely stop moving and when they die they just stay there with an empty health bar while my champion is able to move. My latency in a game is on average 100 ping so I have no problems with ping whatsoever. \r\n\r\nI need help asap because now I can&#039;t use my internet to play league and it&#039;s wasting my data.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-04T03:22:09.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so it sounds like your issue is packet loss related rather than ping related (ping is the time it takes the packet to travel, packet loss is the packet never arriving at all). 100 average ping is quite high but if you live over in WA it's not entirely surprising.\n\nThe first thing I'd recommend is to give lagreport a sus (when it comes back up). It should give you an idea of whether it's your connection or your ISPs that's causing issues.\nhttps://lagreport.oce.leagueoflegends.com\n\nPast that:\n\n* **Run a Client Repair** (Log into the client > Gear icon top right > Initiate Full Repair)\n* Download the [**Hextech Repair Tool**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool) to help diagnose (and hopefully solve) the problem.\n* **Clean reinstall** your League with the HRT.\n* If you are using a wireless connection, **try switching to a wired one**. If this fixes your issue entirely there's probably a whole lotta wireless interference in your home or your modem is on it's way out.\n* **Powercycle your modem** (turn it off, wait 10s, turn it on). Probs won't make a difference if your issues are so consisteent but if you never do it it's worth a shot.\n* **Check your taskbar tray** (Windows) to make sure there's no hidden programs eating up your bandwidth like rando auto-updates that aren't going as planned.\n* **Check with your ISP directly** about any outages or blocking.\n* Follow through any solutions in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) guide that you haven't already tried.\n\nIf all else fails, submit a ticket to Player Support - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnoJernsMakrel","date":"2018-03-08T19:04:34.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have had the same issue after client update, client was so slow that it actually kept crashing.
