As me I would like the play on the PBE to test out new things such as Xayah. But as I am not able to play the PBE because of its not in Oceania, the problem with that is that, if someone would want to play but they are in a different region than what you can use/play on, they wont be able to play which I think is dumb.\nSee if every region would be able to play PBE that would be good as it would be more videos, and more views and of course much more fun for everyone!\nNow if Riot employees see this and this actually happens I will be more than happy to play the PBE.\n\nThank you for hearing out my Discussion!","replies":[{"poster":"n3rux","date":"2017-04-21T14:57:29.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PBE - Public Beta Enviroment.\nHow is it public when you need to be aproved by Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-04-21T21:50:34.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's \"public\" because it allows regular players, albeit from limited regions, to test and try out different skins, champions, and modes, rather than limiting it to a Riot-only internal tool.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CRIMSONBO4R","date":"2017-04-18T04:18:38.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@monkiinator135 this guy is such a {{champion:266}}  #monkiinator135","replies":[]}]}
