My team will either be predominantly of lower skill level compared to the enemy team &amp; we will end up being eaten alive from the beginning of the game &amp; it becomes such a grind to even attempt to make our way back because the match up (player wise) is horrifically unbalanced. Sometimes i'll be playing against people way above my skill level &amp; it just does not make sense to me. Other times, i'll be the only one on my team who can carry. Like you, I will get into a losing streak &amp; it just ruins the game &amp; turns me off playing it. It's not fair, and they need to fix it.","replies":[]}]}
