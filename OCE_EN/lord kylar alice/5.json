Blue Ezreal is really popular. Anivia is God Tier. Mundo is God Tier.\n\nLong story short - every popular champion and his mother has a sh*t load of slows in their kit or FotM build. People are sick of said slows. Hence all of the Boots of Swiftness which specifically reduce the effectiveness of slows. Stormraider's Surge is also gaining popularity as a Keystone Mastery for that exact reason.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-01-31T05:30:28.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also the cost.

There are only 3 boots that cost only 800, Ionian (not always the best as you might not want the CDR), Mobility boots (you lose the bonus MS in combat and just getting to the fight isn't entirely important) and Swiftness boots.\n2. There are actually so many slows in this game\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Slow#Slow\nHere shows just the magnitude of how many champions have slows, and note that basically every champion outside of the can build slows\n3. Both Deadman's Plate, and Rylai's are decently in meta\n4. Everything is becoming a skill shot, more mobility = less chance of getting hit\n5. They are like a better version of mobi's that don't turn off, which is why supports are changing to it, and junglers in particular.\n6. Merc Treads got nerfed, these were actually the main boot's that were bought, and back in 5.22 they were changed to cost 100 less, but only give 20% tenacity over the 35% they used to offer.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-01-31T11:02:24.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main reason is, games are ending quicker, you get less overall gold the shorter a game goes, Boots of Swiftness are cheap.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-01-31T06:44:07.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're being built against teams with little-to-no slows and no slowing items are built.","replies":[]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-01-31T05:50:19.118+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i normaly always build swiftness on trundle apart from the occasional merc","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reclaimer","date":"2016-01-31T05:44:03.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not sure why nobody has commented but one main reason is because of Frost Queens Claim.
