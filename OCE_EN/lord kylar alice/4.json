I really don&#039;t. I get into Diamond, lose 4 games, start getting horrible LP rates. That&#039;s fine, I understand that my rates would be worse, but I don&#039;t understand why 4 losses changes my gains from +24 to +12 and my losses from -16 to -26. Then I play some more games, win 2, lose 1, then I win 4 games in a row and my LP gains are still only +12 and +13. Fine, whatever, it&#039;ll fix eventually. So I then lose one game and BAM, -32 points. Really? After winning games you&#039;d think my rates would be getting better but nope, they&#039;re getting worse. It&#039;s incredibly irritating to spend 5 hours and 5 games to only get +24 LP.","replies":[{"poster":"Excited","date":"2015-04-04T11:21:09.649+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Going to chime in here, your not the only one to experience this.. its diamond 5 MMR.\n\nwhen they put in master tier they didnt make adjustments to the MMR system for diamond 5. its a very known issue across the globe and riot don't give a fuck.  have yet to see them take an active approach to it.\n\nfeel free to search other regions forums but you'll find they have same issues, diamond 5 REALLY IS ELO HELL!\n\nwin 4 games gain 70 LP - loss 2 games and its back to 0-10 LP.\n\nits disgusting.\n\n\n\ngl man, may the RNG gods be with you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-04T23:20:36.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welp, time to spend my Easter Sunday grinding SoloQ. :^)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-04-04T22:28:59.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At this point I think the only way to get out of D5 with the dopey cnt LP system is to grind the sht out of SoloQ until you get super lucky and win 12 games in a row :~)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nasus X Ahri","date":"2015-04-04T10:23:24.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I remember correctly you are in Diamond 5?
