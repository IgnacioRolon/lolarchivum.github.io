I'm a 3-year player from OCE who has recently taken quite a liking to Shyvana. Though underrated and underestimated, she is quite a powerful Champion, despite her lack of CC, which is what I'm here about. Let's take a look at Shyvana's Ultimate and what it does.\n> ACTIVE: Shyvana transforms into a dragon and dashes to a target location. Enemies along her path take magic damage and are pushed toward her target location.\n\nWow, this Ultimate sounds like an amazing ability that is perfect for the Half-Dragon! This ability sounds like a magnificent way to turn a team fight, save a team mate or cluster enemies together so your transformed abilities deal maximum damage. The problem is, this is only in theory. While sometimes these things do happen because of Dragon's Descent, the truth is there is too little response and too many ways of stopping her Ultimate. Here's a list of things that can disrupt the Dragon's Descent (full list at bottom):\n\n* Ahri's Charm.\n* Alistar's Pulverize and Headbutt.\n* Anivia's Crystallize.\n* Azir's Shifting Sands and Emperor's Divide.\n* Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab (Power Fist disables you but you still fly towards location).\n* Braum's Glacial Fissure.\n* Cho'Gath's Rupture.\n* Darius' Apprehend.\n* Diana's Moonfall.\n* Draven's Stand Aside.\n* Fizz's Chum the Waters (the knock-up).\n* Gnar's GNAR!\n* Gragas' Body Slam and Explosive Cask.\n* Hecarim's Devastating Charge.\n* Janna's Howling Gale and Monsoon.\n* Jarvan IV's Demacian Standard-Dragon Strike and Cataclysm.\n* Jayce's Thundering Blow.\n* Lee Sin's Dragon's Rage.\n\nI'd keep going but it's just any disrupt (knock-back, knock-up etc.) stops Shyvana's Descent which doesn't seem fair at all and especially doesn't fit thematically. I mean, should a Centaur's kick really be more powerful than the leap of a dragon? Should a fat, male human's body produce more force than a dragon's leap? No. Let's look at a few abilities that are similar to Dragon's Descent. \n\n* Hecarim's Onslaught of Shadows.\n* Jarvan IV's Demacian Standard-Dragon Strike and Cataclysm.\n* Kalista's Fate's Call.\n* Malphite's Unstoppable Force.\n* Sion's Unstoppable Onslaught.\n* Vi's Assault and Battery.\n* Zac's Elastic Slingshot and Let's Bounce!\n\nNow let's see which of these abilities can be disrupted.\n\n**None of them.**\n\nShyvana is a fantastic Champion that is loads of fun and very powerful, but her power is lessened disastrously by the flimsiness of her Ult. All that needs to be changed is to make her immune to CC while Descending and to improve the hitbox on the ability (a lot of the time you just fly straight over Champions. If you read this far then thank you and I hope you can agree with my words.\n\nTL;DR: Shyvana is a lot weaker than she should be due to her Ultimate being stopped by anything and everything while Ultimates that are easier to use and deal more damage are unstoppable (Vi's Assault and Battery, Hecarim's Onslaught of Shadows etc.). To fix this, she needs to become unstoppable while Descending andher hitbox needs to match her target frame.\n\n***Complete list of abilities that disrupt Dragon's Descent.***\n\n* Ahri's Charm.\n* Alistar's Pulverize and Headbutt.\n* Anivia's Crystallize.\n* Azir's Shifting Sands and Emperor's Divide.\n* Blitzcrank's Rocket Grab (Power Fist disables you but you still fly towards location).\n* Braum's Glacial Fissure.\n* Cho'Gath's Rupture.\n* Darius' Apprehend.\n* Diana's Moonfall.\n* Draven's Stand Aside.\n* Fizz's Chum the Waters (the knock-up).\n* Gnar's GNAR!\n* Gragas' Body Slam and Explosive Cask.\n* Hecarim's Devastating Charge.\n* Janna's Howling Gale and Monsoon.\n* Jarvan IV's Demacian Standard-Dragon Strike and Cataclysm.\n* Jayce's Thundering Blow.\n* Lee Sin's Dragon's Rage.\n* Lulu's Wild Growth.\n* Malphite's Unstoppable Force.\n* Malzahar's Nether Grasp (unconfirmed).\n* Maokai's Arcane Smash.\n* Nami's Aqua Prison and Tidal Wave.\n* Nautilus' Dredgeline and Depth Charge.\n* Orianna's Shockwave.\n* Poppy's Heroic Charge.\n* Quinn's Vault.\n* Rammus' Powerball.\n* Rek'Sai's Unburrow.\n* Riven's 3rd Broken Wings.\n* Sejuani's Arctice Assault and Glacial Prison (unconfirmed).\n* Singed's Fling.\n* Sion's Decimating Smash and Unstoppable Onslaught.\n* Skarner's Impale (unconfirmed).\n* Syndra's Scatter the Weak.\n* Thresh's Death Sentence and Flay.\n* Tristana's Buster Shot.\n* Trundle's Pillar of Ice.\n* Urgot's Hyper-Kinetic Position Reverser.\n* Vayne's Condemn.\n* Vel'Koz's Tectonic Disruption.\n* Vi's Vault Breaker and Assault and Battery.\n* Volibear's Rolling Thunder.\n* Wukong's Cyclone.\n* Xin Zhao's Three Talon Strike and Crescent Sweep. \n* Zac's Elastic Slingshot (unconfirmed) and Let's Bounce.\n* Ziggs' Satchel Charge.\n* Zyra's Stranglethorns (knock-up).\n\n**Edit:**\nI've created a thread on reddit since it seems to get more activity than the boards. http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2ttpzf/the_strength_of_shyvana_and_dragons_descent/","replies":[{"poster":"Draco Fyrwing","date":"2015-01-30T09:30:04.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I fully understand and agree with what you are saying, however I find that:\nA.
