I tested it with neutral monsters and my ult worked fine, but when against Champions I can still die. Don't have any evidence as I'm still in game and can't be bothered recording. May get some soon.","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2014-11-27T08:41:28.445+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2014-11-30T01:55:08.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There is actually a 0.5 second cast time.

So playing Tryndamere this patch is really stupid which sucks because he is the highest skill cap champion that requires timed mechanics along with pitch perfect reactions. Buy a GA and let the enemy smite and pop your GA before you use your ult or get a Zilean on the team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Imasukai","date":"2014-11-27T02:53:22.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Against everything?
