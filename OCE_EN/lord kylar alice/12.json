At least 35% of the people I have been matched with between Platinum and Challenger have had more losses than wins in their ranked season and I just don&#039;t understand how they can be at this elo with history like this. The only answer I see is that they&#039;re all boosted, but that statistically isn&#039;t correct, and some of them are even higher elo than they were in previous seasons. Someone please explain.","replies":[]}
