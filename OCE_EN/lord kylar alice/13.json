I am looking for a support main in either Diamond, Master or high Plat to help me reach Master before the season ends. I&#039;ve gotten some advice and have decided to try playing ADC to climb since I usually enjoy it and I&#039;m not the worst ADC in the world. If you&#039;d like to go for the final push before the end of the season with me then please add me or post a reply. I have both Teamspeak and Skype but am willing to get Curse Voice. Apart from being high Plat, you must also not be toxic or pessimistic.\r\n\r\n**When I Play (times in AEST):**\r\nMonday/Tuesday/Thursday - 1-9 PM\r\nWednesday - 2:30-9 PM\r\nFriday - 1-2 PM-AM\r\nSaturday - 8-2 AM-AM\r\nSunday - 8-9 AM-PM\r\n\r\nIf you&#039;re keen on duoing but don&#039;t main support you can still add me or post a reply and we can probably go for it. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-04T21:39:32.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You streaming yet mate?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-11-04T23:26:27.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=HKM13I0w,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-11-04T21:39:32.521+0000)\n>\n> You streaming yet mate?\n\nNope, things have come up.
