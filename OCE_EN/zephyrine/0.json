To my surprise, out of the 3 new skins, it's the only one that's 1350. Very disappointed, I buy it and then a few hours later, a friend tells me it's 975? \r\nIs it possible to be refunded so I can repurchase Firecracker Jinx for the amount it was intended to be on release?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-11T08:29:12.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was a slip-up on Riot's end.
