Sure, he could hang out with the other Bandle City soldiers, but he already spent too much time with people (who were mostly too dead to socialise with) to really want company. Instead, he decided to have a truly, &ldquo;off&rdquo; day, where he could just unwind without his blowgun, rest with the grass on his fur and the blue skies above as he watched the clouds roll by.\nOh look, a shooting st- wait.\nA fiery shadow flew over Teemo as it continued a bit aways ahead of him. It left a black smoke trail, which he made a mental note to follow after investigating the nature of the projectile. The thing landed just over another hill, and the small Yordle took no effort to climb over it. Before the he reached the top though, his instincts kicked in, forcing him to drop into a prone position (just in case, he reminded himself). He peeked over the top and spied the smoking crater, squinting for details.\nA suspicious silhouette stood in the smog.\nTeemo cursed as he reached for his missing weapon, and could only choose to wait it out. He eyed at the figure with intense stillness, waiting for any residual effects before going in. It could be anything; a secondary explosion, a mutant creature, a killer robot, an escape pod with an enemy soldier inside, or even-\n&ldquo;WOOHOO! THAT WAS FUN!&rdquo;\nA Yordle jumped out of the smoke, arms outstretched as she ran to follow the smoke trail back to its source. She was covered all over in soot, ash, and black marks, with a few tips of her white hair still smoking. She was screaming at the top of her lungs, the excitement echoing everywhere throughout the empty plains.\nThe scout could only watch in disbelief before face-palming. \nHe had a heart attack. He was one moment away of strangling Tristana down in that blown earth. It&#039;s not his first time strangling friendlies, Teemo swears it. He&rsquo;ll scold her when he meets her, but for now, he&rsquo;ll tag along (silently, from behind) to find out how she was even flying in the first place, and how the scent of Ziggs&rsquo; signature gunpowder was all over her.\nHe stopped to shiver at horrid memories of pancakes that singed his fur.\nTeemo ducked once he heard another explosion over the hill. He heard a certain whining become louder, before it turned into a recognisable, manic laughter. He looked overhead to find another fiery form flying through the sky, this time with a sonic weapon attached to it that was giving the scout a serious headache.\nOh wait, that&rsquo;s Ziggs with his laughter. \nIt&rsquo;s always a wonder how he hasn&rsquo;t burned it all off with all those explosions. Teemo wasn&#039;t surprised anymore, but he was even more surprised to see that, not too long after another explosion, another Yordle overtook him in the skies, this one having blue fur and a scream that seemed to have a strange mix of excitement and fear. Teemo stood dumbstruck at the two flying Yordles screaming their excitement out. \n&ldquo;TRISTANA, I LOVE YOU!&rdquo;\nTeemo face palmed again. The sane Yordle hoped that the gunner in question didn&rsquo;t hear that, or else Rumble will have a hard time picking up the pieces of his heart. It&rsquo;s not like fixing a broken machine, he&rsquo;ll find, nor is it like trying to silence a culprit with his bare hands or clean an obnoxious piece of toxic gunk from a blowgun, where the pain will still stay even after countless missions and back breaking work, only for it to come back at the most inopportune moment where he&rsquo;ll have to salvage the mission at the last moment and have to make a clutch shot at the running war criminal.\nDon&rsquo;t date the girl with the big gun.\nThe scout sneaked onward to find a giant mechanical toaster on top of a particularly tall hill. He rubbed his eyes to make sure he wasn&rsquo;t hallucinating, but no, he was looking at what he can only describe to be a golden toaster. It was a cube with rounded corners that was littered with toasters stuck to it at odd places. One of the corners held a little orb with a smoking hole. There was a ladder leaning against it, albeit heavily scorched near the top.\nA fluffy puff of yellow appeared from behind the toaster just as one of the Yordle bullets came back. The scout caught the glint of a piece of metal stuck in the puff, and groaned. Why did the genius have to side with these mavericks? The sweet of smell of science doesn&rsquo;t have to include burning Yordles!\n&ldquo;Hey, Teemo!&rdquo;\nThe scout turned with a fist thrown that hit Ziggs. Luckily the amount of explosions in his life numbed his nerves so that pain wasn&rsquo;t even a thing to consider in his receptors. Ziggs dropped without a wince, causing Rumble to jump once he was reminded that calling out Bandle City&rsquo;s top black-ops agent out of nowhere is never a good idea.\n&ldquo;Woah! Woah! Chill!&rdquo; \nHis bloodlust kicked in and Teemo moved on to the blue Yordle. Rumble jumped back and pulled his  limbs in so that the scary soldier wouldn&rsquo;t rip them off in a moment&rsquo;s notice. He still needed arms for when he can get Tristana alone after a date!\n&ldquo;Teemo! Bad boy! Down!&rdquo; Speaking of his saviour. &ldquo;I swear, I know you just got back but this isn&rsquo;t time to welcome us with a killing spree! The last time you tried that the higher-ups took away your blowgun!&rdquo;\nBut Tristana&rsquo;s words were lost on him as the scout honoured his code and continued until he finished beating Rumble to a pulp. The said mechanic was too busy cowering in fear with his eyes closed as he took the beating, until the blows stopped coming. It took him a few seconds to realise this, but once he did, he looked to find his world pulling the soldier away. Heimerdinger looked to the commotion but thought nothing of it as he continued to work on improving the cannon. All of this was Tristana&rsquo;s idea since she wanted to find out how it feels to be a bullet, and so she asked Heimy to make a cannon for him. She already had backing from other professors in Piltover, namely Ziggs as he wanted to test some new explosives. He was skeptical about the funds, but when she said it was all, &ldquo;in the name of science,&rdquo; he was on board.\nLiterally, he went to his drawing board to start making designs on the cannon.\nAnd now, it seems that the Swift Scout was going to join in the fun. \nTeemo shook his head when he felt his fists hit thin air, where he saw that Tristana was dragging him to the cannon. His eyes widened and he can already feel the extreme heat and the burnt particles getting caught in his fur. He&rsquo;s already suffered through Ziggs&rsquo;s birthday present, he doesn&rsquo;t want to experience anymore explosions anywhere near him!\n&ldquo;Heimy! Give me a stun grenade!&rdquo;\nThe inventor nonchalantly threw one at the gunner. Tristana caught it smoothly before activating it, causing it to glow blue from the arcs of electricity coursing over it.\n&ldquo;No, no wait Tristana, I&rsquo;m fine now,&rdquo; Teemo pleaded. &ldquo;No, really, you can-&ldquo;\nThe woman shoved the sphere onto the scout&rsquo;s neck. Teemo instinctively gritted his teeth so he wouldn&rsquo;t scream, but the intense electricity knocked him out in a matter of seconds. With a grin, Tristan climbed the ladder close to the mouth of the cannon and threw the unconscious Yordle into the dark recess. She slid down quickly and pulled the ladder away. She ran to where Heimerdinger was, hiding behind the cannon. \n&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Tristana was hopping excitedly beside the inventor as he calibrated the cannon on a console. &ldquo;I want to see this!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;One traumatised Teemo coming up!&rdquo;\nThe said scout woke up within the barrel just as he heard the reactions heating up the chamber he was in. It only took a split second for the cannon to fire, but he was too late to realise it. He only saw the whiteness before the world seemed to spin all around him. He inhaled deeply and sighed, a blissful smile on his face as the wind whipped against his face. It didn&rsquo;t matter that he felt the dirt in his fur, he felt peace after being purified in the flames.\nTruly, an &ldquo;off&rdquo; day.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T13:52:56.593+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You've written a story about Teemo. You deserve praise for your bravery.\n\nJokes aside, I'd much rather read a dedicated story of a couple of characters, rather than a story involving a lot of them. Of course, that decision is up to you. It's just that with Teemo, you're putting a lot on the line (seeing as how controversial of a champion he is), and to have a protagonist of such caliber as the focal point of your narrative, you need to spend a lot of time making him into a character people want to invest in. \nI'd say this is a good effort. Well done!","replies":[]}]}
