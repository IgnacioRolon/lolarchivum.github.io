I just found out about the honor system today and it has me worried, All it takes is for one team to report and i could get a permaban for something stupid. \r\n \r\nI don&#039;t think it&#039;s fair to start at lvl 0 honor it&#039;s makes me think you guy&#039;s are looking for money grabs by trying to get people permabanned and having to start over again the right thing to do would of been for old school players to be at lvl 1 honor at least","replies":[]}
