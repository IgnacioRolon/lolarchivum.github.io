You shouldn't be fighting anyone in their minions in the first place. Anyone that knows what they're doing can easily abuse minion damage to win trades. Think about it for a moment, you auto nasus which triggers 3 caster minions for example. Each time those caster minions attack, each caster is doing around 23 damage, 23x3= 69 damage per auto (not factoring in your armour). So almost every second or so you're taking 69 from casters. If your trade goes on for about 5 seconds you're taking 345 damage from minions (Not factoring armour). That amount is going to be even huger if you decide to fight in a cannon wave. So yeah, don't fight in minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JokarSmokah","date":"2018-05-22T02:18:08.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Their should be a scaling effect with monsters like their is with jg common it's not the same LOL it's just about minions and towers not champion skill","replies":[]}]}
