He had already locked in his champion and we got put into game. Due to the login issues he was unable to login and reconnect. Because of this we had to remake the game. However not only did he lose LP and receive leave-buster, but I also lost 17LP. It was because of the bug that this happened and I would appreciate it if my LP was restored and his too.
