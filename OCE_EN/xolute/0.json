For example, ranked game the other day, we have a morgana mid who ends up with a kda of 3/11, im playing shyvana jungle, and whenever i gank and she dies, she blames me for not &quot;ulting to initiate&quot;, at the time of game i was 4/0/2. for the rest of the game, she constantly spams chat terlling me to ult first. i check op.gg, and this is her first season ranked. we also had a jax (also first season ranked) who fed 0/6/0 and kept jumping in.\r\nTo be honest, by lowering exp required, there are too many unskilled players coming into ranked, now, im only silver 4, so im not amazing by any means, but, before the exp half, i was climbing at a steady rate, but now, i have a feeder almost aeverygame.\r\n what do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-04-24T04:46:47.201+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xolute,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=t1AsIW1p,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-23T10:44:53.371+0000)\n>\n> To be honest, by lowering exp required, there are too many unskilled players coming into ranked, now, im only silver 4, so im not amazing by any means, but, before the exp half, i was climbing at a steady rate, but now, i have a feeder almost aeverygame.\n>  what do you think?\n\nAgreed. A lot more feeders out there with no balls. Skill level overall is now lower. More players are in the scene, though, equals more cash for Riot. \n\nCurious about the mid lane gank. Were you waiting in the bushes for her to Q them? How were you planning to gank?","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-04-23T17:21:30.444+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Xolute,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=t1AsIW1p,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-23T10:44:53.371+0000)\n>\n> im playing shyvana jungle\n> whenever i gank\n\ntheres the problem m8 lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-23T13:27:48.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there should be a system like world of warcraft heroic dungeons. You must get silver in your test to be able to join heroics.\n\nSo to be able to play ranked for your role there must be basic conditions met in a bot game like placing wards, getting cs etc.\nNot just intermediate bots but hard bots.\n\nThis way a player learns to play ranked and can get good enough to join the ranked queue.\nUntil they can get a pass in the test they would stay in wood league or equivalent.\nThis would be incentive for those learning to get better because the pass means you are out of wood league and into your placements.\n\nCurrently you just need to have RP/IP to buy enough champs, level 30 and you are in, no experience needed.\n\nThis would increase the level of play immensely. Lets lift the bar instead of allowing people with no experience to ruin it for those looking to rank up.\n\nHopefully the new tribunal will clean up the ranked environment ten fold until then we are stuck with inexperienced players that we have to carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-04-26T02:41:37.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree. Halving the XP will put a lot of inexperienced players to the ranked pool. Which is unfortunate. I already thought the journey to level 30 was not enough to get you ready for the game in a competitive setting. I played two accounts to lvl 30 before I decided I was ready. That was under the old system, where it look about 100 wins to get to lvl 30.\n\nThe lack of training available in LoL is a huge oversight by Riot. Bots are terrible at teaching you anything about map control, you can't really 'practice' combos without waiting for cool downs and there is no tutorial about warding. As much as I dislike DOTA, it's sandbox mode is AMAZING! It has everything new players and veterans need to hone their skills and get a feel for the game.\n\nHalving XP to 30 does not make the game more accessible, it is actually the opposite. Once you reach 30 the player pool becomes huge and varied. You can play against someone with 50 wins, or 500 wins. it's not an environment conducive to learning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"URBROISNICELADY","date":"2016-04-25T02:57:39.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YES","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-23T13:19:40.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drop to bronze, problem solved, all new players to ranked are placed as silver 5, bronze won't get the super new every game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aidan7787","date":"2016-04-23T11:28:46.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well technically using stats you should actually climb better if this was the reason as there is more chance that any of their 5 will be horrible compared to the 4 on your team...","replies":[]}]}
