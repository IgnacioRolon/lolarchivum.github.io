I'm here to help create a long term sustainable model for the OPL and Esports in OCE. We love our sport in this region, and I want us to be able to show it!\n\n{{summoner:4}} **ASK ME ANYTHING! I'll be around for a few hours answering questions.**{{summoner:4}} \n\n\n**Career Background**\nA little bit about my background - I&#039;ve been with Riot for about 7 months now, before that I worked in traditional sports (specifically with a lower tier Rugby League team). During that time I completed my MBA, explored options of going into the corporate world, but decided that my passion and love for gaming was the path I wanted to go down. I decided that I wanted to follow my passion and make a difference in Esports and League of Legends in Oceania.\n\n**My Gaming History**\nMy love of gaming started as a child with Snes, N64 which I loved Mario Kart, Super Smash Brothers. Once I got to high school, my vices became Counter Strike - playing in a LAN cafe after school every Friday, as well as Warcraft 3 - Frozen Throne (Dota allstars, Footy Wars WOOOOOH!), Natural Selection. I had a fairly long stretch after that of playing World of Warcraft - starting off with Raiding, but then mostly Arenas. I achieved Gladiator rank 4 times on a number of classes and was a fairly high rated Aussie player (250ms wtf). When I started working full-time, I transitioned back to just playing Dota, then HON, then League and Dota 2 and then League of Legends again. Nowadays I&#039;m playing some Player Unknowns: Battlegrounds, Diablo, Hots, CS:GO and still loving my League of Legends.\n\n**Let&#039;s Talk League**\nI'm a Mid/ADC main - My favourite Champions are Orianna, Anivia and Syndra for mid and Ezreal/Caitlyn in the bot lane. I do sometimes like to have a crack at LeBlanc mid and Lucian adc, but they&#039;re too mechanical for me haha  {{summoner:3}} \n\nEnough about me - tell me about you guys, or throw any questions you have at me :)\n\nAsk me anything!","replies":[{"poster":"Guts","date":"2017-05-12T05:58:58.871+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When are you going to be a caster?","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-12T06:28:28.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've given it a crack - it was a lot of fun, but I don't have enough insights to provide and don't get my words together quickly or clearly enough to direct the viewers lol","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-12T07:00:33.614+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I don't think I could do a cast without accidentally swearing. {{champion:157}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Taze","date":"2017-05-12T05:47:38.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What is the next project for the esports team now that we have all the pros in the studio and set up with gaming houses?\n\nAlso how is Riot going about next split to get OCS more coverage as last split there wasnt really any.

Knowing that conventions would be a great way to host community centric events and sell a lot of merchandise, do you think Riot might start considering the possibility of attending conventions again?

For the production/broadcast tech - I'm gonna bring in the big guns - Riot Perigan who is the OPL producer and has the expertise on these matters in our office.\n\nFor #2 - If we were to attend conventions again, the primary purpose would not be to sell merchandise.

Producing a show in 1080p 60 (59.94) is not industry standard for broadcast in Australia and almost all the hardware, though theoretically 1080p capable, is typically run at 1080i and most definitely not at 60 fps. Without hijacking Belquins thread the tl;dr is that we built a studio that combines technologies (broadcast and digital) in order to produce at 1080p 60.

Merchandise would help to illeviate that cost, and then give you more freedom to run an event that you actually want to see ran. Like, the OPL had merch for sale, but the OPL finals weren't made to sell merch.

Do you think it will actually be a competitive player on the world stage?\n\nAt this point it seems that the Korea's have taken over the show for quite some time now, if not the Korea's then surely an Asian country in the top tier leagues.\n\nBased on your experience working with Riot and such, what are the things that the OCE need to work on to become a competitive player on the world stage?  Is this objective with different RIOT departments around the world to try and develop the gameplay for different countries?\n\nAlso, can the OCE learn anything from the Korea's on the OCE can act and behavior inorder to achieve these goals (if the goal is to develop a completive base in the OCE).\n\nJust to go back to the \"Korean's taken over\" bit, do you think if the Korean teams dominate the Esports of League may this discourage players around the world that they are no match for the Koreans?\n\nI could use an example such as the NRL where you have the top tier teams who always hover in the top 8 where the rest have been where they are for quite sometime (yes you have the one off's like the Sharks winning the NRL finals for the first time) but majority of the top tier teams would hover in the top 8 or top 4 for years and years.\n\nSo coming back to the OCE scene, is it one of those things where the OCE will need years to prepare before they become a competitive top player on the world stage, I fear that how the gaming industry goes many games come and go depending on where the market is (eg Blizzard with Storm of Heroes and others.)\n\nIs it possible to create the foundation within the OCE to start and build of that, which that way the foundation and skills can be transferred to other games depending on how hot the market for what game, in this case it's (League of Legends).\n\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-05-15T04:01:39.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Macktheboloz,\n\nReally good questions - definitely things we also grapple with on a day to day basis - we would love the OCE region to be internationally competitive and essentially that is one of the things we aim to contribute to in how we invest in setting up the scene. \n\nTo me - similarly to the NRL, the best equipped teams with the best infrastructure (coaching, training regime, analysts, psychologists, boot camps, international experience etc), always manage to be competitive. What we are trying to focus on is helping our Esports teams partner up with commercial/business partners to help them commercialise in order to earn more money to then invest into their performance through the infrastructural things I mentioned before.\n\nI believe we are still years behind Korea - they have had Esports for literally 10-15 years before anywhere else in the world, they have Esports TV channels, fibre to every home etc. What we do have is the advantage of learning from what they have done in order to catch up more quickly. We have our sporting codes being able to see the success of Esports in Korea, and having a great crossover with things like Sports Psychologists, High Performance Coaches, Nutritionists etc which are all relevant in Esports training too.\n\nWe want League of Legends to become a sport - we don't want it to be like World of Warcraft arena as a sub part of a larger game with a small following, we want to set up League of Legends Esports to be an enduring sport played for many many years to come. This is well aligned with Riot's development - seeing how much the game has grown and developed year on year is staggering and I believe that is a critical part of remaining relevant, up to date and transcending the 'come and go' style of games.\n\nThanks a lot for the questions and comments though - I love thinking about and trying to think how best we can solve these types of challenges :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2017-05-12T07:33:36.801+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Greetings Belquin, nice to meet you! \n\nToday I have four questions for you, two a bit more serious in regards to it being about your work, two just more fun things about gaming.

Good question, I think there's definitely a lot of opportunities to help the OCE scene. Content about the league, the play, the players, the team is always a really good one that I love watching/reading. Creating and running community tournaments is another great way - there are a number of amateur level tournaments run by the community that is a great way to help build up the scene. Another way could be to get involved with University Clubs and help them coordinate tournaments between and within them. You could line up an OPL team to run training camps for younger players in the offseason. I'm sure there's a million other ways, but I hope these are a start :)\n\n1. I'd say the scaling and strategic planning skills - I was able to see the results of some really good scaling where we went from 1 overly expensive team and scaled up to 4 different grades, as well as results of sticking to a clearly defined strategy and ending up in a position where we delivered on our expectations and were building something really great.
