Then I read some other posts and I just want to reiterate (if I haven't enough through SC/Twitter); Jake, you're stellar. You and Quickshot and Pulse and Dash are the reason I practice casting and have had such an exponential interest in the career as of December 2015 when I visited LA for All-Star. I still haven't gotten to meet you yet, but as soon as there is ANY opening in the Austrailia office (caster or not), I'm applying. Europe and LA are on my list too, I just want to be involved with Riot in any way, and work my way up. AUS has always been on my list of want-to-live places. : )\n\nYou, and the rest of the global casting team, have been there for me through some difficult times, and I want to give back. Not just to y'all, but to my fellow players as well, in the form of awesome analysis and in-depth data explanation. You push me to do that. Every snap is evidence of that!\n\nStoked for the rest of the 2017 season, and let us know on twitter if there ARE any openings to look for!\n\nSeth Stout","replies":[]},{"poster":"jubjub727","date":"2017-02-24T06:20:51.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rusty why are you a traitor, we want you back >:(\nSpawn can you slap rusty for being a traitor\n\nWho's your favourite fan rusty and why is it me?\n\n\"I add everyone\" - Spawn 2016\n*ignores jubjub when he tries to add spawn* - Also Spawn 2015-2017\n\nOh and hows ted :D\n\n#SomeMemesWillNeverDie http://i.imgur.com/CYZzYgu.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2017-02-24T07:06:01.270+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do appreciate your support JubJub, I may be gone from casting the OPL on the regular but I hope to be back as often as I can!\n\nThe OPL will always have a place in my heart, as will your support.","replies":[{"poster":"jubjub727","date":"2017-02-24T07:36:33.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love you rusty but you just fucking capitalised both j's.

I plan to begin casting when I feel confident enough in my knowledge of the game (i've only been playing since kindred came out) . anyways I was wondering if you all could give some advice on everything and anything, how does one get into the industry of casting? so far ive found that you just have to work your way up from nothing and once you get good enough and have a substantial viewership someone will notice you. am I right?\nMany thanks,\ntoested\n(p.s. spawn you are my idol <3)","replies":[{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2017-02-24T06:30:46.139+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Toested,\nFirst off thats awesome you are willing to put the work in. Hopefully one day you are a kick ass caster and we create awesome content together. I would say if casting is the end goal always practice, there is only one way to get good and that is do it heaps. As for getting into esports I volunteered to help a team as an analyst. I has similar spreadsheets I would share and help with scrims. Eventually this meant I became pretty knowledgeable and went on to cast from there.\nHope this helps also add me in game if you ever need advice or to chat.\n<3","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Watermelown","date":"2017-02-24T06:23:38.483+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where is opl show week 4? :c","replies":[]},{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-02-24T06:08:01.572+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Any chance we'll see Hingers calling games in the future?
