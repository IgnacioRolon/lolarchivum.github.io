I thought this would be something similar to the Fantasy LCS, but this is from some third party company -- \"Genius Sports Group Pty Ltd \" (which also own some other tipping sites), how are you guys associated?\n\nHonestly, I feel quite misled. This should have been disclosed in the announcement, but no where in this post or on the lolesports announcement is this mentioned. They've also plastered the OPL logo all over their site (not to mention the header looks very similar to the one on lolesports and behaves extremely similarly), which makes it feel like the site's owned by Riot. The only clue is that you've said our existing League accounts wouldn't work, which would be strange if this was built in house from Riot.\n\nI had to read their privacy policy and terms & conditions {{summoner:3}} (which don't have any mention of Riot Games and are simply copy pasted from their other tipping sites) to find out. A little disappointing, you guys are usually really good about these sorts of things.\n\nAlso because this is marketed from Riot, many players are assuming they should be able to log in with their League account because it isn't mentioned in the main post but hidden in a comment below. If this company has a rogue developer, this makes it very easy for this them to phish players who try to log in with their League credentials. This is already a problem as can be seen on the main announcement where there are numerous comments about not being able to log in with their account.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-01-26T22:59:41.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Reduxed - thanks for taking the time to pass this on - you raise lots of very good points that we will take into consideration for future projects. To try and put you at ease though - this is a company we have commissioned and worked with to build the platform and tailor it to the OPL. This is the first iteration of a platform / product that we are definitely interested in incorporating into the oce.lolesports.com website. We aim to be fairly agile with product releases like this though so that we can take community feedback on board and make improvements and re-release, and incorporating it into our website will take much longer - but is definitely on the list. Last year we ran the tipping contest on a google sheet - so this is visually and functionally a huge improvement.\n\nI hope you take the fact that we are endorsing this product as enough to trust that we have done our due diligence on the company and the product here and that you are willing to join the competition anyway. We will definitely aim to make sure it is far more telegraphed when the product is not produced internally by Riot in the future - we did not mean to mislead you at all.\n\nOnce again I do really appreciate you taking the time to explain what you have though - it's a perspective I'm sure other players share with you and something that we need to be aware of and understand when releasing products with partners.\n\nCheers!\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Reduxed,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=GElrZVff,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T11:03:31.202+0000)\n>\n> Hey, just wondering why you guys are marketing this as if this is something from Riot?
