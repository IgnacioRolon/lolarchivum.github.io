Runes and masteries are the easiest fix in terms of staying healthy in the jungle, switching to flat armor yellows for example can help. Secondly camp micro is typically underrated for the average player and is something worth studying and practicing, you should be able to find videos online or even consider watching some stream vods.\n\n2. Pink wards are core for junglers on most bases and they help you clear out jungle entry vision. Outside of clearing vision you should look to take 'unconventional' paths into the enemy jungle to try catch the other team off guard, blast cones for example can help you catch the enemy team off guard.\n\n3. Identifying when to defensively ward (typically your own jungle entrances) and offensive ward (on enemy camps) is super important for junglers. It is typically dictated by whether or not your lanes are winning  or losing (but not always obviously)\n\n4. Ganking just comes down to game sense - you need to ask yourself what does my teammate offer me when I gank this lane? And how will the opponent react? Summoner spells and collapses should be considered as well.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"hazzadolly","date":"2017-03-30T06:43:52.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can play top, mid, adc and support fairly well, but i have always had trouble with jungle.
