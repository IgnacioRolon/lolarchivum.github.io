So the first thing I did was to check my match history only to find that my account had been in use. So i quickly changed my password and angrily sent a ticket to Riot support. Only to get a generic message sent back stating that my account had broken the rules and is indefinitely suspended. I asked player support again to please look over the situation once more, as I&#039;ve had this account for a long time and have been playing from the same location for about 3 years. Could they not check to see a change in the IP? But alas no help, just another generic message telling me nothing I couldn&#039;t have found on the player support page myself. Then I searched the Internet for anyone with a similar issue and I found a few, but none of them were able to fix it. So I gave up and sadly uninstalled my game.\r\n\r\nToday one of my friends brought to my attention a forum post with a very similar issue had his account recovered. So here I am with what will probably be my last attempt at trying to recover my account.  I would really like to start playing league again but I don&#039;t want to start over. I&#039;ve met so many friends on that account, got all the characters and spent a heap of money on skins. Starting over wouldn&#039;t be worth it, a new account could never hold the same value.","replies":[{"poster":"Cantina","date":"2017-05-02T09:51:17.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"All is good a rioter sent me a ticket and fixed everything :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-01T07:45:33.520+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try posting this on the Help & Support board","replies":[{"poster":"Cantina","date":"2017-05-01T07:49:31.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, will do.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-01T23:15:49.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also try submitting a support ticket.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-05-01T07:39:07.806+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh, so sorry man.
