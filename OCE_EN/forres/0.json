After having the first game, I took a ~3 hours break and tried following guides on youtube, using command prompt to determine the ping before I played. Despite command prompt saying I only have a ping of ~30, this was not true at all.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, my internet connection with any other websites/servers are fine. I'd like to know why this is happening and what I could do to fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-07-02T11:44:41.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's probably more specifically your connection from your location to Riot's servers, rather than your connection overall.\n\nIf the issue persists, Riot will be able to help you track down where things are getting held up: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nSometimes it's just a result of work being done on the lines or infrastructure and it will improve shortly. Another good thing to check is your ISPs service status page, as they will usually inform you of any work being done or things that might be affecting your connection.","replies":[]}]}
