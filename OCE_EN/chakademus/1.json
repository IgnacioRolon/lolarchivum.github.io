Past that I'm afraid the best advice is to simply mute as soon as someone seems like they're gonna be a dick about it. Some people will find anything to target, so I wouldn't count on just hiding the stat actually stopping that behaviour, they may just find something else to target instead.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
