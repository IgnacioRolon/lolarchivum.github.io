So I am unsure how I have received this penalty?\r\n\r\nThe pregame chat log, i asked for a switch pick, he selected my champ then I selected his with no issues.\r\n\r\nThe in game chat reflects moments of the game and context. First section, I came top and ganked and then the adc (my duo partner) pinged careful and i said dont hit me with a careful (after successful gank)\r\n\r\nWhere it progresses to when &quot;kayn was sooking&quot;, we were moving to baron from being inside the enemy jungle, at this point and the enemy jungle had a blue buffed spawned, i was helping leash quickly before we baron and my Q stole the buff by accident to which then kayn recalled instantly and said &quot;afk&quot;. \r\nKat (mid laner) asked why he afk and I said, &quot;fml kany was sooking becuase I sniped the blue&quot; - In context also, kayn had 21 kills 1 death and they had at least 3 champions dead so the baron was free, the game was about to end and he was full build and from memory he already had a blue buff.\r\n\r\nHe then waited until I died to which was minutes later to join the game. He said to me &quot;kys idiot&quot; so I respond with &quot;reported&quot; to which he said report yourself so i said *sure thing* (what else do i say to that without trying to heighten the issue)\r\n\r\nThey then had an open base inhib on very low health with i said &quot;im back fooring&quot; (meant to be dooring). Whilst I almost pulled off a victory althought died  he then claimed I was inting (to try find a way to report me after I said I would report him for saying KYS idiot&quot;)\r\n\r\nAfter saying &quot;im throwing&quot; that was a response to two champions saying that I was. We had worked up a lead and I sad that all my good work  was starting to come undone. However this was not in an intentional or inting or griefing context. I still continued to focus after this and we ultimately won the game after a fight not long after this sequence of events at the elder pit which I helped assist with.\r\n\r\nHope this helps with context! I know that from this game The kayn was in a duo with the Gnar (top lane). This was established by the same clan tags. So if I recieved multiple reports it would be from the two friends reporting in retaliation to my initial comment that I would report kayn for saying KYS. So basically I was ganged up on and reported in retaliation.\r\n\r\nI have linked my op.gg champ to provide evidence of the game to highlight I did not &quot;int&quot; as kayn was claiming and I did contribute as a support should with wards, saying in chat of enemy champion sums and no reason to suggest I was toxic or trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-19T13:27:42.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's a few things that were less than positive, but assuming the log is unedited it seems you got picked up for the kys, in essence a false positive for a no tolerance phrase.\n\nYou mention a ticket response but I assume you are referring to your reform card, not a Player Support ticket. To appeal your punishment, submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nThe best thing you can do is keep it short and sweet.

If we have the whole story it's a pretty easy to identify false positive. I know it sucks for you, but the alternative is that some people will get free passes on *really* saying stuff like kys. This is the unfortunate side of taking such a hard stance.\n\nTake comfort in the fact that if you got punished just for quoting the guy, you can pretty much guarantee they received a punishment as well.","replies":[{"poster":"ChakaDemus","date":"2018-07-20T03:17:05.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just copied the log provided and then pasted it to a word doc!\n\nSo far I haven't heard from support however I do understand that the amount of submissions they get would be high. I posted this thread shortly after the game had finished and tried to give an accurate and detailed response to provide reason/understand/context to each section of the chat log. \n\nThat's why I found a lot of the log/chat confusing because in relation to the chat/events that were transpiring it made sense. Even when i said \"I'm throwing :(\" that was not me intentionally saying that's what I am doing it was a response to my duo partner and the random mid laner saying I need to refocus on winning and try forget the toxic player.  I can totally understand the tolerance of this kind of talk being a hard stance because it needs to be removed. \nThat's the issue for me though it seems as though I was flagged/reported by him and his duo partner for saying he will be reported for telling me to \"KYS idiot\"\n\nAlthough, I cannot find comfort in being unjustly reported/banned when I was trying to do the right thing saying that I would not tolerate what he said to me and he will be reported. You know, for me this means my honor is effected (almost level 3 honor). I am unable to play any games during my university break and my account suffers.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-20T09:47:26.459+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It sucks for sure that it got picked up like this.

From memory it when like this;\n\n*Kayn & I were attacking enemy blue buff before baron, he was 22 kills 1 deaths full build* I hit it once maybe twice assuming he would kill it (being max damage assassin build) however my leash would help before baron.*\n\nMy Q killed the buff to which he then immediately said\n\nKayn: Im AFK\n*then recalled and did not participate in the game for an extended period of time*\nKat: Why did he afk??\nChakaDemus: fml\nChakaDemus: kayn was sooking\nChakaDemus: because i sniped the blue\n\n\nI did not intentionally mean to take the buff and the game was essentially \"won\" at this point, the enemy team had 3-4 dead. Baron was available and we had already taken 2 inhibitors so I assumed in the scheme of the game this would not effect the overall result of the match.\n\nAnd to the final point where he was suggesting I was inting, I went camouflage as pyke to back door and win when the nexus had less than 1/5 of its health left so I assumed that was a reasonable play. Otherwise my score, 10-13-16 (38 wards, 48% kill participation) would suggest that being the sole tank on our team where I had to engage (I even had tank items) that i had to engage for team (based off pings, chat, instinct). To validate my decision to backdoor, I assumed that since he left the game and went AFK that it would be best to try end the game as soon as possible considering it seemed likely that he would continue to be AFK thus resulting in a 4 v 5 for the rest of the game. The game replays would also provided evidence of the play and the entirety of the game and you can see there was never any intentional dying, inting, griefing or anything of a toxic nature.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-19T10:55:59.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You said \"kys\" twice.
