This gives any mundo player that much of an advantage. I am not sure if this goes with all his skins, but i have only seen it happen on his default skin. It&#039;s not just it goes invisible every now and then, it&#039;s always invisible :P please fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-06-04T17:27:52.052+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I once had Mundo Literally go where he pleased.\nHe walked right through my Azir Ultimate and gave no fucks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-05T00:49:51.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't seen any invisible cleavers lately.\n\nI wonder why?","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-05T01:22:23.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=DiamondAries,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=RA1jL7so,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-06-05T00:49:51.668+0000)\n>\n> I haven't seen any invisible cleavers lately.\n> \n> I wonder why?\n\nIs that because its invisible? :)","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-06-05T03:22:08.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm... maybe.\n\n\nNah, couldn't be.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-06-05T06:09:11.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You raise a few good points in that argument. \nJust let me remind you that if the mound throws an invisible cleaver, which you can not see, do you know his throwing a cleaver or is it just him waving forwards?
