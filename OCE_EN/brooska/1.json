But as far as balance is concerned Riot tends to take as much of a middle ground as they can. Champions HAVE to be balanced for the pro scene, but they also have to be balanced for normal play. Logistics of that aside, Riot won't nerf a champion that is strong in Bronze-Silver but not in Gold+ for example. Just as they will not buff a champion that is weak in Bronze-Silver but strong in Gold+\n\nWithout knowing where you are playing, all I can say is that where I am (Gold) Jax is rarely banned/picked. It's a bit trickier to balance champions than you might think, as they have to allow for learning curves and overall skill. Given the diversity of the champion pool, there will unfortunately always be champs around that could be considered 'Bronze-strompers'. It comes down to experience and relative strength of the champion. As a trash top laner myself, I know I'd get smashed by a Jax, but as a support main I know how to work with/against him in teamfights and the like.\n\nWhat this means is that different tiers will see different pick/ban rates, and the pro scene is a whole different beast (have you seen the way they play? I mean really it's like they're playing a completely different game sometimes).\n\nIt's a matter of understanding the context essentially. For example why Riot took so long to nerf Darius after the first nerfs didn't prove enough. He was banned so much they didn't have enough data to see if it actually hadn't been enough, or if it was just the lingering perception of the champion as OP, simply because few were actually getting to play him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-06T18:47:30.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Are you srsly think Jax is OP, Jax is no OP is the 1 fking Item that is still Broken as hell that make Jax OP Is Rageblade{{item:3124}}  {{item:3124}}  {{item:3124}}  this Broken as hell item make him OP.
