The disconnect usually last for about 10 to 15 seconds and then I&#039;m back on again. It could be a packet loss affair but I&#039;m not too sure. I never had this issue until about 2 - 3 weeks ago. Even after I moved onto Windows 10, the game has been smooth until recently. \r\n\r\nWondering if anyone is experiencing this issue too. I&#039;m on Telstra cable if that helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T08:44:55.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Balhaza,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.

I've been trying to diagnose if it is indeed my ISP playing up as my housemate did complain about disconnects from Heroes of the Storm. Thank you for the dialogistic.

Sometimes the dcs will be around 20 seconds max. It's been happening last 2-3 weeks as well sometimes it won't happen in a single game. But when it does happen its pretty infuriating. I'm on Spark and I got same trouble :/","replies":[]}]}
