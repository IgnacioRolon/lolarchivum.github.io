I do not currently own Orianna and I have no wish to play her any time in the future. Thus I am afraid that Riot Games might just give me the champion along with the skin, and I really like having exactly 40 champions on my account. Is there any way I can refuse this Victorious skin, or if I cannot ask Riot to delete Orianna from my account after they gift it to me??","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-14T05:31:13.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a question for support. You will receive Orianna along with the skin for sure. As to whether they can delete the champ from your account, I know they are able to do this (though you won't get any sort of compensation or refund), but be aware you may also lose the skin forever if you do this.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2018-10-18T06:14:47.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For clarity, Player Support can remove the champion while leaving the skin on the account!","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-10-18T11:37:39.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to know!","replies":[]}]}]}]}
