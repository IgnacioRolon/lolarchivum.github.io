Both of you are out of mana after lots of trading which boiled down into an auto attack duel.  You both have 50% crit, 100 AD and 200 health remaining.  2 AA&rsquo;s will be the death of you both.  If either of you turn to run you will die, so fighting is the only option.  You throw your AA simultaneously.  His crits, yours does not.  You are dead, due to a coin flip.  This is not skill.  This is not consistency.  This is luck.  It could happen to anyone.  It could happen 10 times in a row, even if that&rsquo;s almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is the nature of crit, and it is not healthy for the longevity of LoL.  Losing a battle, or worse a lane, or at worst a game, because of RNG crits happens.  And it happens every day amongst the millions of games that are played worldwide daily.\r\n\r\nI have a solution to this problem that does not break the game, and would require very few tweaks to adjust properly.  It evaluates to the same sustained damage dealt, does not require Infinity Edge to be changed, and does not change the end result of crit itself.  It changes the implementation.\r\n\r\nRather than having lucky spikes in damage, or unlucky droughts due completely to RNG, this system would utilize a way to average out sustained damage.  I call this Precision Damage.  Precision would replace crit, and empower auto attacks passively.\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s get into some math to help further my point.  Let&rsquo;s ignore armor for now.  Currently, if you have 20% crit chance base and 100 AD, you would crit 1 in 5 times for 200 damage and AA normally for 100 damage.  In other words, if you auto attack 5 times, then on average you will deal 600 damage.  1(200) + 4(100) = 200 + 400 = 600.\r\n\r\nWith Precision you would take that same percent value of chance crit and enhance your AA damage by the same value, up to a cap of 100%.  READ:  THIS IS NOT AN INCREASE TO YOUR OVERALL AD, ONLY TO YOUR AUTO ATTACK DAMAGE.  This would mean that those 5 auto attacks at 100 AD would become 120 damage per hit, 5 times.  This also equates to 600 damage.\r\n\r\nArmor would still affect your overall, sustained damage output by the same amount as it currently does.  \r\nProof: http://imgur.com/eDIW0Jw\r\n\r\nNow, the biggest question that would be on most peoples&rsquo; minds is &ldquo;But what about Infinity Edge?&rdquo;  And I have the solution to this as well.  Rather than increasing your overall AA crit damage by 250% (up from 200%,) with Precision Damage IE would increase your current Precision damage by 50%.\r\n\r\nLet&rsquo;s break out some more math to see why this works effectively.  Using the same numbers as before, 100 AD, 20% crit chance, and the IE passive, in scenario 1 you would hit one time for 250, and 4 times for 100.  1(250) + 4(100) = 650.  With Precision Damage, you would have 130 per hit instead of 120.  100 + (20 x 1.5) = 100 + 30.  This, over 5 AA&rsquo;s still equates to 650 damage.\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of it, let&rsquo;s use some larger numbers.  500 AD, 50% crit chance/Precision, and IE, over 10 AA&rsquo;s.  Crit system:  5(500 x 2.5) + 5(500) = 5(1250) + 2500 = 6250 + 1250 = 8750 damage.  Precision Damage:  500 x 1.5 (50% crit/Precision) = 250 bonus per AA x 1.5 (IE bonus) = 375 bonus AD per hit.  500 + 375 = 875 per hit x 10 hits = 8750 damage.\r\n\r\nThe next point I need to cover is ability damage. On-hit abilities would not be affected by this change, and as such would remain as they are currently.  Unfortunately for some, abilities like Master Yi&rsquo;s Alpha Strike would be affected by this change.  As of now, rank 5 Alpha Strike deals 165 + 100% AD, and if it crits it deals an additional 60% AD damage.  100 AD = 165 + 160 = 325.  One in 5 casts with 20% crit chance, and 265 damage for the other 4.  This results in 1385 damage.  \r\n\r\nWith Precision Damage things get a bit weird here. In this scenario, the damage difference between 5 casts of Alpha Strike with and without a crit, is 60 damage.  In order to replicate this we would need to increase each of Yi&rsquo;s Alpha Strike casts by 12 damage.  This means that the Precision Damage would have to affect Yi&rsquo;s bonus crit damage on Alpha Strike, rather than any other value.  So, whatever Yi&rsquo;s AD is; 100, 200, 500, 1000, you would need to take 60% of that: 60, 120, 300, 600 respectively, and multiply this by the Precision Damage percent.  10% = 6, 12, 30, 60..20% = 12, 24, 60, 120..50% = 30, 60, 150, 300.  And add that number to each cast of Alpha Strike.\r\n\r\nThings become murky and convoluted when doing this, and can make understanding ability damage difficult.  Despite this, the formula still works.  It is simply more difficult to fully understand.  Riot could easily solve this problem with damage calculations on the tooltips.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, the damage stays the same regardless of magnitude, regardless of armor, and would still be affected by AS and LS in the same fashion.  The only real difference here is that instead of having spiky bursts of RNG damage, or spiky droughts of bad RNG luck, it smooths out the curve.  This makes the damage more consistent, and provides a system to which skill matters more than a little bit of luck.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I feel that Precision Damage is a better system than the current crit system.  I get lucky crits just like everyone else, and it feels good.  That said, however, getting unlucky and having bad RNG or getting hit by a lucky crit are far more infuriating, than lucky crits are rewarding.  This system works great with IE, Armor, and would not affect abilities in the long run.  The only REAL change this system brings is a smoother damage curve to everyone who uses crit.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this wall of text.\r\n\r\nTL;DR  Precision Damage = take your crit chance %, empower your AA to deal that much bonus damage.  Crit chance RNG &ldquo;problem&rdquo; solved without removing, nerfing, or increasing the sustained damage ADC&rsquo;s need.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-09T13:59:31.514+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see too many Yasuos... YASUOS EVERYWHERE..\n\nGet rid of RNG Rito, and I may have my rest.\n---\nOn the more serious note: I really don't like RNG at all, it just doesn't seem right to have evenly skilled matchups based on chance. That's why I never play AD or AP casters with crit chances.\n----\n A minor problem would be the fact ADCs will have less damage in general when having crits below 50%, even though the statistics you show say they're even; it's important to consider the fact the amount of attacks won't _always match up in increments of the crit chance_\n\ni.e. If Ezreal had the crit chance on the table shown, and died before making 5 attacks, \nprecision will have 120/80/60/etc damage removed all the time\ncrit would have 100/66.6/50/etc damage removed _most of the time_\n---\nIn chances above 50%, ADCs will have more damage.\n\nIf Ezreal had 80% crit chance, it would be the inverse of your example, it would be 1 normal then 4 crits. If he died before making 5 attacks,\nprecision would have 120/80/60/etc damage removed all the time\ncrit would have 200/133.3/100/etc damage removed _most of the time_\n---\n\nOf course, this is in a statistically perfect world where crits are in increments and not random dice rolls. Maybe TF's passive E should be the standard for crits instead? But that would encourage bursting with ADCs by attacking several times before saving a crit for another guy, so it's actually worse IMO. There really isn't much of a way to balance crit, as it's just based off chance, the closest we can get to balancing chance is to put it in a statistically perfect setting, which is practically the antithesis of chance.\n\nIt's safe to say Riot wants chance to be part of the game, or they'd have to remove, not rework, crit completely.\n\nALSO - It's important to note that flat damage reduction complicates things further, but I'm certain LoL doesn't have that kind of garbage in any shape or form.\n\nAll in all, for this problem and this problem only, if precision replaced critical chance, it should be treated as Riot would with an auto attack percentage increase, and take very little bias from crit chances. Balance it as a completely different mechanic. A good starting place is the end of the damage mastery tree, +5% damage.\n---\n\nTLDR; \nHigher crit chance = more crits\n\ntherefore\n\nLosing attacks with crits = losing crits if above 50% chance, losing normals if below 50% chance\nLosing attacks with precision = losing constant damage\n\ntherefore\n\nhigh precision does more damage than high crit\nlow precision does less damage than low crit\n\noh GOD I DO TOO MUCH MATH in under 20 mins...

The damage loss ratio would always still be dependent on its RNG counterpart.  For example, 50% crit chance + 100 AD over 10 AA's, would be a variance of 500 potential damage in either direction.  Which would, again, be subject to the RNG gods.  I'm rambling now, though, so time to move on.\n\nRegarding the idea of crit stacking, there would be far too many problems with this.  Just to list a few, lane zoning potential with a crit stack, Zed stacking up a crit then going all-in and destroying someone, enemies bailing on a team fight when you get a crit stack, the list goes on.  If the stacks dropped off after a short duration it would be even worse.  Crit would take a huge hit in total value.\n\nAnother option for Precision Damage would be the Ashe treatment, wherein there could be a small flat damage increase on top of the AA to compensate... But that's not a perfect solution either.  As with >50% Precision the damage would start to become unreal.\n\nIn the end, I still feel that this method would be better than the full on RNG of our current system.  There's just too much at stake (entire games, I tell you!)  Another interesting theory is the DotA formula someone else posted.  Whereas also not perfect it, too, is vastly superior to LoL's RNG.  http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Pseudo-random_distribution\n\nInteresting stuff, that.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-10T05:22:00.746+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(BTW, 'RNG' stands for Random Number God, so at one point, you said, \"Random Number God gods\")\n\nIf Riot were to add precision damage, I would completely agree if they changed the values completely from the crit values. 10% crit does not equal 10% precision at all. It would be _an entirely different system_\n---\n>The damage loss ratio would always still be dependent on its RNG counterpart.

I'm rambling now, though, so time to move on.\n\nOf course randomness would be subject to crits, but again, I assert that the only way to effectively measure chance is to put it in a statistically perfect setting. To expand on the math I did earlier;\n\nWith x% chance crit, if he died before making an attack;\n\nthere's a x% chance he'd lose a crit, which is pretty obvious as it's a x% chance to get a crit in the first place\nthere's an (100-x)% chance to lose normal damage, which is everything that isn't a crit\n\n\nEven considering it's random, there's simply a higher chance of losing crit damage if your crit chance is above 50%. I'd argue that precision would be worth more at that point, and less when below 50%, Crit would increase linearly, but Precision would follow two separate equations for above and below 50%, only matching up exactly at 50%, 0%, and 100%.\n\n---\n\nOn the other side of the argument, if I were to convert x% into a fraction, and find the average damage lost,\n\ne.g. 20% crit = 20% to lose a crit and 80% to lose a normal attack\ntherefore\n1/5 of the time a crit is lost, 4/5 times a normal attack is lost\nIf we were to add it all up and divide it by 5, \nIt would equal the precision damage lost\n\nIt would be worth the same as precision, because we can assume crits even themselves out over the game because there are multiple instances of the loss occurring.\n\nbut I would argue that this would change the strategy of the game considerably as we have to consider each individual fight as separate, not the entire game as an average.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Adepta Sororitas","date":"2015-07-11T05:22:08.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RNG actually stands for Random Number Generation.

Additionally, if someone has 50% crit and gets a lucky chain of hits and wins because of it, then they absolutely do not deserve that.  This is exactly my point.
