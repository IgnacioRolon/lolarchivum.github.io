All you spent wasn't actually purchasing those skins/champ/whatever, you were leasing it out from Riot. Therefore, they have nothing holding them to refund you.\n\nIt's written clear as day in the ToS... The ToS you AGREED to when you started playing.

Why bother, it achieves nothing advantageous.\nBeing flamed doesn't help you get better or reform, it makes you either mute someone and keep playing your game, or deliberately troll the flamer to make them more angry. Which only negatively impacts the game for the rest of the team.\n\nDont be so serious, its a computer game. You're not playing for your next meal, or to keep your house or children. If you're not having fun, caused by someone else or not. Don't play.\n\nOr, deal with bad players and enjoy the next game.\n\nHave fun or get out.

The money you've spent on the game also doesn't entitle you to special treatment. You are judged on your behaviour, not the size of your wallet.\n\nIf you've been permabanned for chat you've had at least one previous suspension, with a 14 day ban in there somewhere. It says explicitly in the 14 day ban reform card that any further offences will result in a permanent ban, so you should have been aware that this was a possibility.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-07-18T23:59:18.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trust me, someone we reported who said 1 bad word didn't get banned at all. 1 bad word is nothing and won't get you banned, obviously you must've been more toxic than the person who was flaming you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Excited","date":"2018-07-18T13:42:45.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"$20 says you were banned because of 3 reasons\n\n1.
