What qualities do I have to learn to learn exact timing? For instance like Yi, I charge in with my Q to dodge all projectiles and literally just after that I get clapped. What am I supposed to do after or during that?","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-11-18T01:35:37.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion one of the strongest strategies that any player of any level on any champ can do is simply kite. Auto or ability an opponent then when they move to you move away. Then when your team mates do the same thing that cycle can continue endlessly. Often I will simply walk horizontally across the enemies front line just to burn there cool downs and waste their mana while naturally duking just by my line of direction. These types of tips sometimes take time to learn and also timing in game.\nIf you are an adc then not burning your mana on csing helps keep you relevant in fights and if your a tank not taking free poke but only focusing on duking until someone gets caught out. Then simply all in for your team to get the kill. If you get good at these strategies in aram you will find yourself winning much easier.\nFocusing their most fed player or help protecting your most fed player is under-rated and op. Quite often people only worry about their own kd and outplaying. Practising this in arams will make you stronger in ranked.\nAlso for ability heavy champions like yasuo or syndra quite often if you walk in a direction delibrately towards them then change suddenly when they make a move it will throw their timing out while keeping you safe. \nWhen ever ult heavy champions are on opposing teams like ez, ashe or sej practice walking diagonally when walking away from the enemy. That way it his less likely you will get hit by their strongest abilities because people tend to ult in an obvious line of direction and not for the duke.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThanatosX","date":"2019-11-17T00:50:31.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well to start with, probly don't blow your Q as a gap close to start a fight. Use it to dodge incoming damage when engaged or catch a fleeing enemy.\nSnowball in and auto at least once. Meditate can buy a little time to get a second Q off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Phoenix Horizon","date":"2019-11-16T22:50:52.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you\"re playing Yi you probably shouldn\"t be the one charging in","replies":[]}]}
