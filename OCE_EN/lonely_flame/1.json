Almost everyone has made this mistake at least once or twice, or at the very least been in a game where it's happened. You call jungle. You pick your champ. You get to load screen. And suddenly you realise you don't have smite. Or you call an ADC, get in game, and realise you forgot to change your rune page from your last game where you had mid so now you have AP.\r\n\r\nSomething I was really hoping Riot would get around to themselves but hasn't yet is the ability to assign Rune Pages, Mastery Pages and Summoner Spells to a specific champ. At the moment you can completely customise a champs build, with separate categories and titles, and assign it to specific champs and even more specifically, what MAP that champ is playing on.\r\n\r\nSo basic premise is that but applied to three mentioned categories. So for example, In Blind Pick I call mid and want to go Malzahar. When I pick him, my Runes, Masteries and Summoner Spells automatically change to the prepicked ones, and are changeable from there (so if, for example, you want to try new summoner spells you can).\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? I made a rough draft of what the Masteries page could look like. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE IT, IT'S SIMPLY AN EXAMPLE.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-04T06:10:52.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea. Although my midlaners and supports are often the same, or my junglers and top laners are sometimes the same, this wouldn't be too bad an idea. At least if I forgot to change things if I were, for example, support Morgana, I would rather have AP Mid masteries than AD Tank masteries.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2014-12-04T08:26:46.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically my thinking as well. You build the rune page and assign the same one to a bunch of champs.\nIt's also helpful if you change champs last second for whatever reason (for example, your team is basically all AD and you decide to go an AP champ instead)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TsunamiNinja","date":"2015-06-25T06:16:44.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good idea, would also like to be able to rearrange or organise mastery/rune pages in general.\nIt bothers me that I have mine set up like:\nSupport, ADC, Tank, Support variant 2, APC, APC utility etc","replies":[]}]}
