Ult had stupid low cooldown like normal, was casting like it should. Then for some reason it bugged and defaulted to the normal 180 something second cooldown. The info still showed up it should have been a 34 second cooldown, but it remained the same.\r\n\r\nThe event leading up to it was: enemy Zed ulted, me glassing mid his ult, come out of glass and dying, casting ult during passive.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-04-01T09:12:42.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry I don't usually report bugs.
