Not increase in strength, just increase in ranges.\n\nFirst off, I love Cho'Gath. He's the first champ I ever bought and still remains one of my mains today. His kit offers a variety of builds (some better than others but still) and is varied enough to be fun to play (a good balance between skill shots, targeted and auto). That said, there was something I never quite got with the stacks on his Feast, and the bonus' they gave, or rather, what they lacked.\n\nAt the moment, when Cho'Gath successfully gains a stack of Feast, he increases his size, health, and attack range. Now he's bigger and more fearsome, so why do his abilities still stay the same size? Why does my monstrous foot make the same size Rupture? Why does my gigantic mouth produce the same tiny scream as a level 1 Cho'Gath?\n\n**Therefore, I propose a very SLIGHT change to Cho'Gath: Have his abilities scale in size with him. Not increase in damage in any way, but increase the area of effect for his Rupture, increasing the cone size/range of his Feral Scream, and increasing the range of his Vorpal Spikes.**\n\nCurrently, Vorpal Spikes does so this slightly already in that the width of the projectiles increases in size to scale with  Cho, so stuff that increases his size in any way also increase the effect (Lulu's Wild Growth, Greater Relic's Storm Shield, Elixer of Iron all trigger this, even if Cho is level 1).\n\nNow whether the other abilities would scale in a similar way or increase by set sizes at different stack levels like his basic attack is up for debate, mainly because I've no method of testing it myself.\n\nSo yeh that was my idea.

The size thing relates to the use of Feast rather than a level-related thing, I thought. Correct me if I'm wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Lonely Flame","date":"2015-02-14T12:02:38.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a max of 6 stacks and when he dies he loses half (rounded up) of those stacks. His size increase when he a) gets a stack of Feast or b) levels up his Feast. I don't know if leveling up his Feast changes the size increase from getting a stack (ie lets say hypothetically with 1 point in Feast, a stack increases his size by 5%. With 2 points in Feast, this may change to a 10% increase per stack. Again I'm unsure of this, as even the League wiki doesn't fully cover it and it's kind of hard to test in game)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-02-13T23:14:32.585+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elixer of Iron all trigger this, even if Cho is level 1\ncant get elixer at lvl 1.\n\nbut this idea has been passed around for years. with the only time it actually became a thing...was for doom bots....\n\nhonestly no idea why rito didnt just INSTANTLY say \"oh wow that actually made cho GOOD FOR ONCE\" when they saw how well it worked on him...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Charrd","date":"2015-02-13T22:55:18.262+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes i liek","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dawaraven","date":"2015-02-14T14:37:44.155+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"If they increase cho q in size then he could place it so its impossible to walk out of.
