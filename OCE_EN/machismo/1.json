We joined as a group of 4 silvers and are all with win / loss ratios of not far off 50% as you do..\r\n\r\nTheir mid has 68 wins / 37 losses (silver 1).  Their Jg has 70 wins 42 losses (gold 3).  Their top is gold 4 and other two are silver like us with our kinda stats.\r\n\r\nFirstly, how are you still silver 1 with double the wins than losses.  I played against this and despite not playing shit for a change I was so outclassed 1v1.  The synergy with jungle was good but I wasn&#039;t getting caught by it. Just way better 1v1 than me.  I&#039;d say maybe he was just on form but with that win / loss?\r\n\r\nSecondly, is the ability to join as a 4 making it too easy for teams to rig it with smurfs? Elo was designed as a solo player ranking system (chess originally).\r\n\r\nSomething is different this time, I understand the level of skill with players is increasing but it doesn&#039;t seem enough to bridge the gap in this.  Maybe I&#039;m just a bronzie and that&#039;s where I&#039;m heading.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else struggled in ranked this season more than others?","replies":[{"poster":"SHIA LABE0UF","date":"2016-07-16T15:50:02.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm a bronze 3 player myself, I get put against silver 1's onwards almost all the time, not to mention my bronze 2/3 friend gets put against plats if he's on his own.

I highly doubt that a bronze player will be matched with plats in ranked (unless at some weird time at like 4am when no-one is playing).\n If you are talking about normal games (which looking through your match history you probably are), norms and ranked have different matchmaking ratings. A lot of people in high elo don't play norms very often, and when they do they mess around learning new champions and trying weird builds, so their MMR may not be as high as you might think. On top of this, most of the high elo people that I know don't actually play more that a few norms and a week and stick to ranked, also contributing to being matched with lower ranks. **On your side though, just think of it as a learning opportunity. You will never grow as a player if you stick to what you know and vs the same level of opponents constantly. **\n\n>-bronze players should be in a game with only bronzes\n-silver players should be in a game with only silvers\n\nSome bronze players have the same MMR as silvers, and have worked hard for that. They should have the opportunity to continue to better themselves and vs players of a similar MMR level. \n\nSome silver players ended up in silver through luck during their initial placements and find it too hard to maintain their current rank so when they play they keep losing and will eventually have bronze MMR till they drop to that level. If this happens, it will be much for comfortable for them to play at this level. \n\n>to stop smurfing, they could just have unranked placements and normals go off skill rating as usual, so people that play at the same level as say silver's in their region get into that division. \n\nI don't understand what you are trying to say. There are multiple things that factor into how well you are doing and how you got that level of play. I was watching my challenger friend smurf in plat the other day, his K/D/A and CS were generally on par with the other players. It was his in-game positioning and shot calling that set him above the rest, something that the game wouldn't be able to pick up. Likewise, I would probably still be stuck in bronze if we were placed and received LP based on our perceived \"skill level\" from something such as mastery grades.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-07-17T13:34:23.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be honest its mostly the lp system at fault there, if rank was tied to mmr instead of loosely attributed to mmr than said silver mmr bronze player wouldn't exist, and the inverse would be true for the bronze mmr silver player.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Dota3iscoming","date":"2016-07-17T01:15:09.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea i really highly doubt that you are talking about ranked and they don't base it on skill either don't flatter yourself or your friend. The ranked system has never gone off skill level and saying that they do as \"Usual\" is kinda Egotistic and ignorant as if you think you belong with plats because you play with them. In norms they just put a bunch of players that play at that time together there is no rating nothing just who joins first but in ranked they base it on MMR and Bronze players can have MMR = Low silver players thats just how the rating works but plat? I don't think so buddy =L Hate to burst your bubbles but Low bronze plays with low bronze, High bronze plays with Low silvers, High silvers play with Low gold, High gold plays with Low plats and so on. And the fix to the new queue systems don't work that way buddy trust me, if it were that easy they would have fixed it. It would be unfair for a team to have 3 challengers and 2 diamond versing a team of 1 masters and 4 diamonds, that's why the whole execution of \"until you get to diamond, then to counteract the terrible queue times, place as many as you can in the same ranking and fill the rest with other diamond+'s\" Is not gonna work nor is it ever going to work. You can't simply stop smurfing, its like trying to stop crime, you can try but its always gonna happen and it won't go away either.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-07-16T22:52:39.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Firstly, how are you still silver 1 with double the wins than losses.\n\nMy win rate was like that back when I silver 1, I started in bronze with my placements 1/10.

I did some research behind why I was losing so many games so badly and 1-4 of the games I played I was on a team of bronzes maybe 1 silver at best and the opposition had 3 silvers and a gold. That happened 5 times in total but that's not even the worst of it. I also had a game where they had a plat, gold and 2 silvers vs our gold 1 silver 1 bronze and 2 un-ranked. In reality I'm sure there is some logical explanation that lead to these events of team match ups but then when you watch the games and see how easily we get smashed multiplied by the amount of times it happened.... well now it's a problem. Not that I can do anything about it. Just have to suck it up and move on.","replies":[]}]}
