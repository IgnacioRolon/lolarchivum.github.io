These are the main reasons I am saying goodbye to Tencent&#039;s League of Legends.  Not a rant, just giving my feedback.\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\nBalance\r\nAnother skin for that champion\r\nChampion Select / Community\r\n\r\nBalance\r\nI want to be able to play the champion I enjoy and not have to expect an insurmountable challenge.  If I wanted that I&#039;d try to convince the American presidential selection process not to be cancer.  You can say I suck and I should be able to win lane with anyone etc but assuming equally skilled opponents on equally good form (after 2 beers but before 6) and getting the most from their abilities the stronger champion is still going to win over time, it&#039;s as inevitable as another Donald Trump hate speech.  I feel like I could tackle balancing on my own so just what the heck is Tencent&#039;s $1b per year buying?  A room full of Manatees?\r\n\r\nSkins / Reworks\r\nThere are daily tasks in my job that are harder and less rewarding than the quick wins I can skip to.  We procrastinate on the things we don&#039;t want to do no problem but I&#039;m not sure my boss would accept that I (riot quote) wasn&#039;t &quot;sure of the direction&quot; of that so haven&#039;t done it since 2011. She&#039;d  probably sack me on the spot, and not in the good way I&#039;ve been working towards by inconspicuously staring at her cleavage.  Look at Fiora, she was a fighter jet made of biceps when she came out but now with a few little tweaks in patches she&#039;s been evened out.  Gold star there, I know you can.  The Helen Keller&#039;s of League - Tarick, Yorick Kennen etc have been left in the dark since 2011.  It won&#039;t be _as_ profitable but you just might survive the financial crisis that making a Taric skin will cause.  \r\n\r\nChampion Select\r\nYou can play with friends to negate the whole shimozzle but having just 4 mates on at once happens as often has having a game where everyone gets on as well as a hippy festival.  Not having 3 people so you get the one random isn&#039;t trying because &quot;it&#039;s only norms&quot;, not 6 or more so you have to split to two games and double dip in the Russian roulette that is matchmaking.  I understand there are things being tried behind the scenes and something is coming soon but so is a Yorick rework and so is my first date with Miranda Kerr.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m sure someone will go o the effort in pulling up my stats and say I&#039;m quitting because I&#039;m rubbish so I&#039;ll save you the time.  It&#039;s true, I&#039;m gold trash and it&#039;s where I belong until I can watch the damn minimap properly!  But anyways that&#039;s not going to happen, I just don&#039;t have the fun that I used to.  Wonder what I&#039;ll do with all this extra time I&#039;ll have.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-20T17:57:15.802+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Basically what I got from this is literally the same as every other quit rant.\n\n1) I don't understand how imperfect balance works\n\n2/3) I never keep even a partial tab on what Riot is doing, I couldn't care less about the fact that Taric is getting reworked in January/February, so I'll just quit because my head is too far up my own arse.\n\nAnd that's my biggest fucking annoyance with you %%%%s, you think you're so important to announce that you're quitting league, yet you NEVER keep the slightest attention on what Riot is doing with the game. What's it matter that you've played for five years? I've played for five years, and I can do a five minute search and learn that the bullshit you're angry about is being changed.\n\nIn League there is no \"This it the number one champion and has no weakness\" it is a game of Scissor Paper Rock Lizard Spock. This counters this, this has this weakness, etc. All champions have something they fail at, a major Achilles heel. Except Vayne, but fuck her.\nThere is a video out there where I trashed a Master Tier Rumble player as Taric in top on a stream and I'm just a Silver scrub.\n\nI fucking love Taric, no homo (but yes all the homo), why do I not want another skin for Taric? BECAUSE HIS REWORK IS LITERALLY AROUND THE CORNER!\nI wish Evelynn didn't get that new skin this year, you know why? Because Riot promised ages back that she'd not get a new skin until she had a Visual Update, but that went out the window didn't it. As would Taric's rework if he were to get a skin right now.\nI lost count of the number of times a Rioter has said \"Taric is the next rework after Poppy. Poppy is to be updated at the end of the year and Taric will be done within the first couple of months of 2016\".\nThe reworks are mentioned in like 90% of the red post collections on Surrender@20.\n\nYorick keeps getting put on the list for a rework and taken off, and we know why this is, do you? No you don't because you actually couldn't give to fucks to begin with, you're just using it as an excuse to complain, just like the twats who complain that Fallout 4 has a few minor bugs, when every fucking %%%% and his dog knew Fallout 4 would be riddled with bugs from the start BECAUSE IT'S A DAMN BETHESDA GAME.\nMultiple times Rioter's have said they have no idea what to do with Yorick. They don't buff him, they don't nerf him. Because any time they touch him he someone becomes this mess of retarded damage.\nYou can take Yorick top lane right now and win 10 out of 10 games because no one knows how to play against him, while you smash your face into the keyboard. Dear fuck the damage you could do if you actually learned him.","replies":[{"poster":"Machismo","date":"2015-12-21T15:13:47.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your post misses the entire point on league.  You're right on with Bethesda though. That's the reason I wait a year to snag a Blizzard release (or first expansion, whichever is most likely to be the actual game they intended)\n \nI am a follower of surrender @ 20 and have a whole page news widget on my phone that I looked at every day for the last year.  But I dunno, there's just something about intentions and lack of delivery that remind me of being a virgin the day after prom.  It's fucken unsatisfying I'd tell you but you're probably well familiar with that.  This is league to me lately with all their \"it's coming's\" for shit they could do in a day.\n\nWe could brainstorm a Yorick remake between us in this thread over the next few days with a few minutes from each and have something workable by the end of the week.  Name a champion or remake release that nailed it 100% first go.  You get something out, listen to the feedback, review the stats and patch accordingly.  Tencent (someone asked about this? Rito sold)  are earning a poultry $1 billion a year and they can't bring in a needed change after 4 years? These facts combined leave the only explanation - there's a certain an element of prioritising going on.   Gintamino Bay nailed it below - it's hard sure but this is the game they have created and it's so screamingly obvious what needs to be done.  Get in and do it, the resources are there.  If I was a whiner, I'd still be playing league, hating and trolling like half the existing current player base seem to be.  My action was to remove myself and provide the feedback why as I was finding the game less enjoyable than something that I do for fun should be.  Doesn't mean I have my head up my ass.  Moreso I know what I want and that's why I'm heading.\n\nMe to you as my boss  \"Chill and stop being a whiney bitch, it's on my to do-list fuckhead\" \nYou  \"Oh ok sweet, thanks for the update\" \n\nWanna know why Darius got released late and remade early? Prioritised.  Why did he get prioritised over others? Cos dunking is 'cool' and sells shit like legendary basketball skins cos basketball is of course huge in demacia and nox and therefor must be practical and relevant.  Yorick (again for example) has nothing that stands out as cool.  Seriously what is that ult.  Just make him able to teleport or switch places to one of his ghosts and gain a different augment for the one he chooses and blam, mobility and a higher skillcap than buying tear and facemashing keyboard.. It caaaant be that hard. I don't even play the guy but I do want to play about 50 of the other one trick pony champions that only need the most minor of tweaks.  Take Akali, bring back E proc for Q.   Two GCD's and an auto on her feels like a dutch rudder, just awkward.  The change to ult in moving behind was great but having to land an auto attack for her - a champion that buying attack speed would be retarded - is just.. wtf.  A contradiction.  Speaking of that - shroud - ermagerd you cant see meh, I'm soo not gonna die.  W is almost useless. Make her able to click to teleport wherever she wants in it as much as she likes as long as she is existing in one spot so she can at least try to dodge the infinite amount of aoe and skill shot you can salvo in there now days. Then as long as there's no lee sin in the game or pink wards you're good.  Only slight changes any player in the community could come up with would fix half these champions in a few patches.  \n\nI'll check in a while and see if 'cool and profitable' is still outweighing 'practical' \n\nPS, do you work at Tencent / Riot Kerian? Someone of your age should really be a little more open minded for gamers feedback rather than flaming and telling them such as \"Read the terms of service. Bitch.\"  I, like most play games for fun and confess to at the very most skimming the 'terms of service' and I certainly don't know them well enough to tell others off the top of my head what they contain.  I never got banned or even warned in 5 years.  How I did this was just taking for granted the terms of service summised one simple thing - don't be a Klavinmour\n\nlastly, I reaaaly hate to bring up the bronze thing but it does further reiterate there is a limit to your understanding of the finer mechanics of the game that you seem so eager to give endless advice in regardless.\n\nHavent met a bronzie yet that attitude wasn't most of the problem.  Interesting you were the most vocal asshole here and still managed to influence another to follow you.  Hold on a second.. what the... I am I back in the rift already?  Dammit Talon12 was right all along","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-12-21T16:25:56.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay if you're going to use my real name, at least spell it right.\nWhy should I be more \"open minded\" at my age? Have you seen how other 24 year olds are acting? Besides I've lived an open minded life and it's really not that great.\nI'm not Bronze, and I've demonstrated many a time that my mechanical skill and knowledge of the game is far higher than I bother to place myself in ranked.\nAs I've said previously there are many a video from my participation on Diamond + streams where I've shown great ability in the game.\n\nIn my five years of playing I too have never received a warning, or moderation action. Why? Because I know where to draw the line. Ain't no one on OCE going to get butt hurt at being called a %%%% when we do that every five seconds in real life here.\n\nI've yet to see any problem with Riot's current \"coming soons\" we've got clear windows on what we need to have clear windows on. Four to six months ago we were told Poppy would be reworked at the end of the year and then shortly after in the first two months of 2016 Taric's rework is due.\nThe new queue selection will be released during the pre-season. Somewhat vague, but at least that means we know it will be released before February, and testing will be completed by Feb so that the new queue type will be active for ranked season start in Feb.\nThe only one you could possibly complain about is the New Tribunal System, but that's hardly an issue right now with the fact that the community HAS cleaned up considerably over the past year with Riot's step phase plan bullshit.\n\nI can name plenty of champs that haven't been broken on release/rework recently. Let's see we got Vel'Koz, Sion, Mordekaiser, Rek'Sai, Kindred, Bard, Kalista, Illaoi and Poppy.\nOMG RITO TOTALLY MAKES CHAMPS OP ON RELEASE TO HIKE UP SALES OF RP!\n\nNow lets take a look at this Yorick thing again. He is played in 0.6% of games.\nIn all honesty, why should he be prioritised?\nHE. IS. NOT. PLAYED.\nUnlike say Poppy who if you recall a few years ago Morello said if she ever saw competitive play he'd have her nerfed to high hell. If that doesn't scream \"this champ needs a rework\" I don't know what does.\nYorick will be gotten to, when he gets gotten to, and I doubt even after being reworked that anyone will even play him still.\nYou have Urgot, he got played a hell of a lot this year, and Riot realised that they can delay Urgot's rework because he still fits within the game, and still works.\n\nAs for \"cool\" champs and \"coolness\" being all the priority for being OP and getting skins. That's a total load of horseshit.\nDarius was barely played even when he got his legendary Dunkmaster skin, he still barely got played.\nHe's been picked up more since the juggernaut update, but his popularity has once again waned. Seriously. Bard is just as popular as Darius.\n\nIf coolness dictated who was super OP and got all the skins, then why doesn't Vi have as many skins as Annie? She's like the most awesome champ in the game!\nWhy doesn't Emo Edge Lord Yasuo have more skins?\nOr how about the single most popular champ by play amount in the game Lee Sin? Why doesn't he have a Legendary Skin? Or hell an Ultimate Skin!? He sits at 32% popularity, with Vayne at 30% right behind him, next highest being Thresh at 26%.\nWhere are the super popular champs' Ultimate Skins?\n\nAlso I find your comparison to a real life job really funny, especially since I'm in a field where work gets done at the employee's leisure and not the boss' will.\nIt's great being a scientist. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2015-12-20T21:17:23.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Klavinmour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=0h6pE8ML,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-20T17:57:15.802+0000)\n>\n> Basically what I got from this is literally the same as every other quit rant.\n> \n> 1) I don't understand how imperfect balance works\n> \n> 2/3) I never keep even a partial tab on what Riot is doing, I couldn't care less about the fact that Taric is getting reworked in January/February, so I'll just quit because my head is too far up my own arse.\n> \n> And that's my biggest fucking annoyance with you %%%%s, you think you're so important to announce that you're quitting league, yet you NEVER keep the slightest attention on what Riot is doing with the game.

You get them with a full build and a good Garen almost cannot be killed, he makes a mess of your team and takes little skill, he is just an impenetrable wall, that is old school, he has one trick.\n\nThan there is Yi, whilst some CC makes him bat shit useless, if you let him run free he will 1v5 your whole team with ease, but if he gets caught, he has no way out, no survivability and nothing up his sleeve. He is a killing machine and that is that,\n\nYou need to change the older champions to make them fit better with the current style. A Garen top, Yi jungle, Annie Mid, Cait/Blitz bot works GREAT if all 5 know what to do, but one slip up from any of them and they are toast.\n\nAll 5 of those are great when they work well and can really pack a punch. But none of those 5 have an escape, none of those 5 can do anything if they are countered, none of those 5 can do anything really if they are caught out, it is almost the same for all the older champions and you could almost split the champion roster down the middle and make 2 games out of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-12-20T13:13:21.384+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"tencent? donald trump? helen keller? miranda kerr? tarick? wot did i just read....","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-12-22T01:37:23.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Miranda kerr.\n\nMmmmmhmmmmm","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-20T10:34:19.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Moba kills brain cells and excludes top tier growth potential in a lot of people who don't have a refined art of understanding the history of the genre, gaming & theory in general.\n\nWean off with a few months of (for example_ a single player arcade game like street fighter or mortal kombat, see what ELO you can climb to, something like this, if its an option. \n\nMoba in particular LoL is one large psychological operation on e-sociatal habitat.","replies":[{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-20T10:49:56.976+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ViolinMaker53,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=0h6pE8ML,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-12-20T10:34:19.851+0000)\n>\n> Moba kills brain cells and excludes top tier growth potential in a lot of people who don't have a refined art of understanding the history of the genre, gaming & theory in general.\n\nyou sound like the biggest fucking spastic prick anyone has ever and will ever meet.\ngoddamn.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-12-22T01:39:19.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You obviously haven't read any of colonel j's posts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-12-20T13:10:35.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"HAHAHAHAHA","replies":[]}]}]}]}
