I do understand that I am not obligated to open them, of which I don&#039;t, though I would like to ask for a way to be able to report players who do so. It&#039;s simply one of those things that would help improve the League community, especially to those gullible and see &quot; riot give for client free 2500 rp and free skin so login and enjoy :) good luck&quot; (yes that is one that was sent to me. I didn&#039;t add the link or the players name). This is what i&#039;d like to help stop or even just help prevent.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-21T14:21:03.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's great that you want to report these people and we really appreciate it. Usually such messages are sent from compromised or throwaway accounts, but even just being aware of the particular link is a help to Riot.\n\nThe way to report these people is to [submit a ticket to player support](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). There's no specific category for reporting players so just pick the one that's something like \"I have a question about League of Legends\" or whatever the real general one is. \n\nA screenshot of the convo is super helpful in the ticket if you have it, otherwise the summoner name and the copy pasta :)","replies":[]}]}
