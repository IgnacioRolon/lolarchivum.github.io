Sol, deciding that the ult would turn the fight, proceeds to Zhonyas. Sol ended up dying when the jungler helped him out. I didn&#039;t get my assist.\r\n\r\nOf course, this isn&#039;t the first time it&#039;s happened and I&#039;m sure most people would&#039;ve encountered this.\r\n\r\nConsidering that a spell I used potentially turned a fight, but had no recorded impact, should the Assist system be re-coded to allow for circumstances such as these? Of course, the system would have to predict if something would&#039;ve landed provided there was no other interference besides normal movement.","replies":[]}
