But were alot of kills done solo? In which case, the team  contribution is low, your warding may be low as well as your CS, if you're in JG, objectives like Dragons, Rift Herald and Baron play an important role also. It may be a great performance, but it may also be on a highly used champion say like Zed, Yasuo with a huge data pool to compare against as alot of people use him. It may be a solid performance for you, but the champ has still seen better. Also look at graph's for things like \"Champion damage done\" you may have 17 kills, but lets say its on the ADC only, you've probably only done around 17-22k damage to champs given their health pool, but someone who aoe's alot especially in team fights has done 40k damage has 7 kills 1 death 10 assists, this becomes a 7 to 1 K/D ratio (compared to 5.3/1 K.D and unknown cs) with a huge contribution to champion damage / team fights which is valued more highly. \n\nHero mode isn't always rewarding play for champion ranks, i'd probably say given the lack of info i'm given, it's mostly a lack of team contribution and CS. It's not saying give up kills, im saying try orientating them more around the team / lane objectives, is roaming for a kill as handy as a double wave of minions? not even the same gold without a bounty. \n\nKills are great, objective play is better for ranked outcomes. With as low a death as you can manage whilst always being around to contribute as much as possible.\n\nHope it helps.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} ","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-01T08:27:52.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">But were alot of kills done solo?\n\nThis actually doesn't matter at all.\n\nAlso i just love that post for the sheer fact it says this\n\n>However, the variables are fairly intuitive in terms of what you would expect to be important to winning.\n\nFocusing on CS and never grouping is the number 1 way to win ~Rito games 2016","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2016-07-01T01:18:30.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ward placement outside own base, pings, low deaths, high kill-participation rate, very high cs & monster kills, great objective participation and map presence.
