I have a lot of time to practice so difficulty doesn&#039;t bother me :-)","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-14T06:28:45.729+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, Zac and Shyvana are good for both top and jungle while Vi can be played top but is more suitable for the jungle exclusively. They all have their strengths. \n\nVi is probably the best solo queue jungler out of all three and is very versatile. Great ganks, lots of CC, plenty of damage, relatively tanky and can build full offensively and defensively. \n\nZac is very tanky and very annoying with his passive but isn't conventionally a high damage jungler but rather has lots of cc, great ganks/roams and is very tanky. Also has a great impact in teamfights and brings great initiation.\n\nShyvana is also naturally tanky and you can also build her either full offensive or full defensive or both. She's super late game and can single handedly carry games. She doesn't bring great ganks though and has very little cc but has a great duelling potential, teamfight aoe and initiation.\n\nRest is up to you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-18T00:45:19.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm surprised no on has mentioned Jarvan IV. His E+Q Combo is great for ganks and is on a relatively low cooldown, his Ult is great for locking down in teamfights. If built as a tank is extremely hard to kill and is slippery with E+Q escapes. If you watch certain J4 players like Pawnce, you can be a great Assassin J4 in the top lane or jungle with your ult. He can deal absurd amounts of damage with his quite high attackspeed + Flag.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:59:51.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Irelia cause she can solo 1v5","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2015-04-14T09:15:51.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shyvana with red smite+botrk>full tank is op at the moment until riot nerfhammers cinderhulk/red smite (and they will)","replies":[]},{"poster":"yamumandcheese","date":"2015-04-14T08:01:57.723+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well if you want tanky eith damage volibear is a good option he can go top and jg {{champion:106}} all the way","replies":[]},{"poster":"Water Is Wet","date":"2015-04-14T06:30:59.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
