I feel like a major point that hasn't been emphasised is; **WE WILL STILL BE GETTING MORE RP PER DOLLAR THAN THE US!!!!!**\n\n____\n\nSimple Math;\nUS: \n- $5 USD = 650 RP \n- $5 USD = $6.48 AUD (based on today's conversion rate)\n**- 100.3 RP per $1 AUD** \n\nNew AUS prices:\n- $5 AUD = 520 RP\n**- 104 RP per $1 AUD**\n\n_____\n\nTo those complaining that Riot are being unfair or greedy, ask yourself why do you feel you deserve to pay less for RP than other regions? \nRegardless of Riot's reasons, this new amount will be a FAIR amount, based of what every other League player is paying. \n\n-Skyprus","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-03-09T02:50:03.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"The thing is, Riot could of just raised the amount other servers get yet the chose the other option of lowering it for us, just because we have a weaker dollar, yes now we get pretty much an equal amount **however** Riot chose the option of lowering the amount we get instead of just raising the amount others gets, seems pretty selfish, in any case, this has sealed the deal for me, no more RP purchases from me, I was actually planning on buying on buying $100 worth of RP and I could very well still get that before the amount lowers, but yeah, consider it me just not wanting to fund a greedy company that chose lowering ours over increasing the others, RP is already expensive, it's pretty much $10 or more for a decent skin, anyway I don't care if anyone agrees or not because in my eyes Riot is just greedy.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-09T03:33:54.466+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"The OCE region is also quite small in comparison to other reasons.
