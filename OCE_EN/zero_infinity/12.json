That's pretty much the only way to directly compare it to rank. Rank in aram means nothing though.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-11-30T07:45:52.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get ARAM has a different MMR, and it's only a fun mode, so people don't try as hard.

While ARAM does take some amount of skill it is a lot more luck based than other game modes. If the individuals in plat/diamond that your friend gets matched with/against use only 1 or 2 champs in ranked then chances are they wont have the skill to keep that same level of mmr in ARAM.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2014-11-30T07:57:48.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I get ARAM has a different MMR, and it's only a fun mode, so people don't try as hard.

But I'm sure a lot of plats/diamonds+ play ARAM for fun, and to take a break from ranked, while your friend might be playing to win. Why doesn't he just play ranked and see where he ends up?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2014-11-30T08:45:07.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trying to encourage that, but he has the pre-ranked fear.\nFeels like every game is worth so much, and that there's too much pressure.\n\nEven normals are too serious for him :/.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2014-11-30T09:36:22.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the thing, Their MMR in ARAM is probably %%%%, but if he is consistently playing BETTER then these plat's/diamonds, then he'd be decent in ranked (assuming he has the actual SR mechanics down half decently)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Elphantasmo","date":"2017-04-07T10:37:28.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I also play mostly aram and get put in with plat+ alot but you aren't versing the player where they won that rank, we might be as good as that player playing aram on a champ they don't main but I know I wouldn't contend in lane against them.
