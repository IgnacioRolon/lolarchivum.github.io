It only brings up the client (which is already open in the background anyway).\nWhen you launch League, the first thing that happens is the **patcher** loads. Once you click \"LAUNCH\" button, you will open the **client**.\nWhen you press \"PLAY\" and after champion select you have the loading screen, you are launching **the game**.\n\nIf you open your task manager, you will see that when you are ingame, they are all 3 there... just not visible. What Skyprus is explaining here is just a way to see the client which gives you the possibility to chat with your friends.\n\nI personally use this method quite often so I can say it is very safe :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-12T03:17:01.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never had any issues, or two clients open. \nI don't know much about the technical side, but I think something separate opens up when you go in game.\nAfter a game, that close and the client you opened before stays.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-12T21:51:27.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's the same for mac.
