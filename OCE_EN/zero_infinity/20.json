DC < 5 min no punishment. \n2. If someone has DCed for a short amount of time and reconnects to the game, they have a 24 hour Ranked Queue lock out.\n3. If someone DC&#039;s/AFKs and does not come back, they have a week lockout from Ranked Queue. \n\n____\n\nIn respect to good players,\n- If you DC for more than 5 min I think it&#039;s fair to say you are adversely effecting a game. 24 hours to norms to sort stuff out I believe is fair\n- What if it&#039;s on Rito&#039;s end/bug splat etc? Once again, if you are having these issue which are lasting more than 5 min regardless if it&#039;s your fault, you should stick to norms till you know its ironed out.\n- If you have to leave for an emergency; it happens, and if it something that rarely happens then you should be be able to accept the one-off one week penalty. \n\n___\n\nLove to hear your feedback,\nSkyprus","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T07:47:42.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">    DC < 5 min no punishment.\n    If someone has DCed for a short amount of time and reconnects to the game, they have a 24 hour Ranked Queue lock out.\n    If someone DC's/AFKs and does not come back, they have a week lockout from Ranked Queue.\n\n1st is fine, as that is how it's stands, 2nd seems fair enough, but that 3rd one is kinda bullshit, a week for dcing and not being able to reconnect (remember we have times where Rito's end has firewall errors and such that make getting back in hard)\n\nUnless Rito makes a way of being able to revert these bans if they actually aren't deserved (IE it's one of the times that Loss prevented should have been on but wasn't) then it's a bit harsh.\n\nThis being said, i can understand it, i just think 1 week is a bit harsh for someone who might only play ranked games.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-28T09:05:29.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yer I can see that.\nDoes three days seem fairer to you?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T09:54:48.708+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My suggestion would be that chronic leaver status can give a week off ranked, and that the day restriction is probably as far as you should go otherwise.\n\nA week ban from ranked for something you can't stop that probably won't happen for the whole week your ranked banned?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-28T10:08:54.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like the idea that the bans get progressively longer.\nSo perhaps everyone starts off with a one days ban.\nAnd as long as you don't regular receive this it will remain there.\nIncreased bans within a short period result in the bans getting longer.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T10:11:54.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much, if your banned 3-4 days a week, likelihood is that a week ban is required (and says to the person fix this).\n\nLike i have leaves (i think i have one ranked leave and that was due to a family issue) but they aren't chronic by any means, and in general i try to avoid it wherever possible.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Master Chief","date":"2015-03-27T04:14:40.834+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> - If you DC for more than 5 min I think it's fair to say you are adversely effecting a game. 24 hours to norms to sort stuff out I believe is fair\n> - What if it's on Rito's end/bug splat etc?

Some peoples internet may crash/bug out for more than a period of 30 minutes or so, people may have a power outage in their house/street that causes them to unintentionally leave a game. To be punished by not having access to ranked queses for over 24 hours for one game that you had no control over leaving isn't fair whatsoever, these are outrageous punishments for such a little crime. Their punishment for afking is fair enough already, afk a game or two and you have a lower priority in ranked que which goes up the more you afk in a game which eventually leads to a ban and that's not even including the banning from the leaver buster/reports they'd receive from the other players in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-27T05:14:04.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you bug out rarely how is 24 hours harsh?\nIt's one day of norms.\n\nIf something big happens, like a power outage, you most likely lost a game for you team whether intentional or not. \nMaybe 3 days, rather than a week. \nBut either way, how is this small lock out, which you should rarely get unfair. \n\nIf you are having crashes or power outages in a certain a period of time, you should return to normals anyway till you know the issue is sorted. \nThis is just enforcing that idea.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoForkYourself","date":"2015-03-27T04:35:25.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the punishment for AFK is such a joke that you are lucky to get a game in bronze/silver where no one does.
