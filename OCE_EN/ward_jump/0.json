Its useless i rather play on NA and have 220ping but play with less toxic people then play on oce.","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Jigglefluff","date":"2015-11-22T06:01:08.097+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Ward Jump,\n\nI'm sorry that you had some bad experiences with players, but rest assured if you report the players in question and they keep up their behavior, they will eventually have consequences for their actions.","replies":[{"poster":"Joerick","date":"2015-11-23T11:47:58.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly, \"eventually\" isn't fast enough. You think Silver's bad?  Try 99% of Bronze being worse that anyone you've had to suffer through.\n\nI'm Bronze 5. With the MMR of a Bronze 1 or 2. And yet I can't get out of B5 because every game it's the same thing; I'm the only one warding, I'm the only one thinking, I'm the only one building for the enemy's comp/build, and by the end I'm the only one with a positive K:D ratio. I've even been the only one NOT afk on my team. And I'm not just saying this, it literally is EVERY GAME.\n\nWhat's worse is I just found out the hard way that when you Block a player, it only mutes them. It doesn't actually _block_ them at all. So we're doomed to suffer worthless piles of human excrement for teammates for the rest of our League days! Hooray.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ward Jump","date":"2015-11-22T06:03:59.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks but eventually how long will it take to even touch the surface of the bad players (behavior wise) on oce","replies":[]}]}
