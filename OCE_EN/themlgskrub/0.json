This is the 4th time this week and have gotten 3 leaver busters for it and lost 2 promos because of it, is it a problem with my computer or is anyone else having these problems as well, it&#039;s really frustrating having to deal with this issue please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-13T08:50:52.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could try some of the steps listed in this article here: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974-Bug-Splat-and-Game-Crashes\n\nPast that I'd recommend submitting a ticket to player support and they should be able to help you out: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
