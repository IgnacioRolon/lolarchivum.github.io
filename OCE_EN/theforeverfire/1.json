Full screen, max res, highest settings, all just fine.\r\nBut recently, I have been getting massive FPS drops every 5 seconds or so and it&#039;s making the game unplayable.\r\nI am positive it&#039;s not my computer because it is ONLY in League Of Legends.\r\nThe only thing I can think of is Win 10 not working so well with patch 7.1\r\n\r\nAnyone know how to fix this? I would normally get 100+ frames, but I have it capped at 60 now and it still drops to around 10-6 every 5 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"KÃ¼rama","date":"2017-01-18T06:43:27.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boost your FPS by utilising the **[Frames for days booster.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752684-Low-Frame-Rate-FPS-Troubleshooting)** This booster is legal and is approved by Riot.\n\nhttp://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/Skins/Tristana_RocketGirl_Splash.jpg","replies":[]}]}
