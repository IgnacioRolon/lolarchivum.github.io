I don't think it would be a bad idea to test, Just to give some more freedom of choice when it comes to one of the core items in League as every champ Except Cass needs boots :3","replies":[{"poster":"BarneyIsComing","date":"2018-02-21T11:43:33.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah sure lets make this game even more broken than it already is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-20T22:09:42.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, let's give Panth, Zed, and Renekton free early game damage that has no trade off.
