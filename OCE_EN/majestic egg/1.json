But when [champ] called him bad I said, &quot;Go Back To KinderGarten [champ]&quot; in which he responded &quot;Go Back To Preschool&quot; which was fine until he said &quot;Go Back To Jail You N^gger with an er not an a(The Slave Term). I found this offensive since I have African-American roots so I said &quot;reported&quot; in which he responded &quot;Go Ahead&quot; it was pretty normal until the end with [champ] flaming and me and [champ] responding and all. But in the match results after we lost it was bad, I don&#039;t know how to post the logs of that but I said &quot;report [champ] for racism&quot; and he said &quot;Go Ahead N^gger&quot; and after said &quot;jew get gassed&quot; before firing a bunch of racial slurs at me and the part that made me feel sick was the fact his team backed him up by saying &quot;Jax is just a sore loser&quot; and all that.

Saying KYS or being overtly racist are some of those things.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he is already banned. You can keep an eye on his OP.GG but he's probably gone.\n\nI like to \"favourite\" people I report on OPGG when they are really toxic to see if they get banned. More often than not within a few days they are banned.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nejire Hado","date":"2018-10-09T10:53:37.470+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"1. No naming and shaming!\n\n2.
