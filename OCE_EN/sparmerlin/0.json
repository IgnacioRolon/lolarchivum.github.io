I mean it was fun for the week or two that it was up; but if they re-release it, it may become another dominion. A ghost town. (That isn't even on OCE. Thanks Riot)\n\n2nd: Some people may not enjoy it, although it was **BY FAR** the best, and most enjoyable game mode, a lot of people disliked it. (Hipsters pls)\n\n3rd: It would strain the servers, it was extremely buggy and full of \"OP\" champions. If riot really wanted to implement a system like this they would have to actually put effort into bringing it back. Lets be honest, riot aren't going to attempt with that. IF they did bring it back they would need to put a lot of work into it to make it balanced, and permanently playable. (Lets face it, that would ruin the fun)\n\nI personally love Urf, and I can't wait for its re-arrival, the only problem is that it may be destroyed if it is brought back. (Metaphorically speaking).
