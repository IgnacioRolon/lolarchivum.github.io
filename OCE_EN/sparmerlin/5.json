I&#039;m not sure if this is due to the support staff working on other issues or alternative reasons.\r\n\r\nI feel as though implementing the Watchmen system that is used in the larger regions would really help take the load off the limited number of support staff and allow them to deal with the more pressing problems while the Watchmen can process the more common issues.\r\n\r\nOf course this is just a suggestion and I&#039;m sure the support team are on top of everything! It&#039;s purely a way to reduce some of the load. If there are any decisions regarding the Watchmen programme could you please let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLuke (sparmerlin).","replies":[{"poster":"AgentViolet","date":"2015-08-30T15:07:36.927+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agree to this","replies":[]}]}
