Then, when I tried to join an ARAM the whole client just froze and crashed so I had to re-open it. Afterwards, when I tried starting a game I was given a fifteen minute abandonment ban. Please work on a better system and remove my ban as I only just had time for one game tonight due to work and I&#039;m highly disappointed that I was unable to play due to faults on your end.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSparmerlin.","replies":[]}
