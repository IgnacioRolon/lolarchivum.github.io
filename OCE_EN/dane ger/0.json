Once in game he was fine but in Champ Select he refused to play the role he was given (adc). At first he asked if anyone else wants to ad but no one did. As he was first pick he said fine - locked in Garen and said he was going Top. \r\nMyself and some teammates reported him after the game but nothing he did *in game* really matched up with the reports.\r\n\r\nWill you please implement a report for people who refuse to play the role they are given? It seems like he was fishing for someone to leave/just bully people into letting him have his way. Quite frustrating when you play by the system even when getting autofilled support xD and yet there are people out there doing this, and seemingly, getting away with it.\r\n\r\nglhf :)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-13T06:02:06.887+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can report behaviour like that as \"negative attitude\" through the end-game report system.  [According to **Lyte**](https://twitter.com/MisterLyte/status/689646191454195712) (previously leader of the Riot PB team) the system can detect it automatically there. You can also report it straight to [Riot Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) in cases where you choose to dodge.\n\nI totally agree though, some kind of a champion select dodge feature is needed. **Lyte** has [said in the past](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/WV2VqZca-new-champ-select-qa-with-the-dev-team?comment=00350000) that one might be possible. \n\nI think the new the new champion select did a great job on toxicity. It really lowered 'role fighting' and made the whole experience far better, but that shouldn't be an excuse to just leave it as it is. Especially considering how close it is to being perfect from a behaviour perspective :(","replies":[{"poster":"Dane Ger","date":"2016-12-13T09:57:09.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I think \"negative attitude\" is what I put down. Agree with you on how much it (new champ select) has helped with toxicity - really there are only a handful of people still abusing it.","replies":[]}]}]}
