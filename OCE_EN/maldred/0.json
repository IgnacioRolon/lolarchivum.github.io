Then I thought, maybe maybe if we put a limit on how many up-votes/honours you can hand out on a daily basis, again I figured most of the community would just randomly hand it out to players to get the \"free IP.\"\r\n\r\nAnother idea crossed my mind. What if we reward IP to the players that receive the up-votes/honour points? Would people just never give it out at all?\r\n\r\nI for one feel like most of the community sees this as almost useless, but definitely has some potential. I'm sure half the community (either consciously or sub-consciously) feels like it's just a waste of time to give honour if they're not receiving anything out of it, because let's be honest most of us wont do anything unless it benefits us too.\r\n\r\nIf the tribunal system has comments on it, why can't the honouring system?\r\n\r\nAny ideas? I for one would like to see the feature come back!","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-17T04:07:37.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Perhaps using something like for ribbons, where the person who got the honour has to consistently get honours (though to less of a degree), would work well with the IP reward for honouring. Basically, you honour someone and if that person consistently gets honours following that (not as much as for a ribbon but still a significant amount) then you get a small amount of IP. It would discourage false honouring, particularly if coupled with a daily limit on how many honours you can give. As for pre-mades, you could reduce/remove the IP bonus for honouring people in a pre-made with you, even people on your friends list.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-02-16T22:36:29.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get what your trying to say: Honor = Ip\n\nBut think about if your in a party??? Free ip for you and your friends.\nAnd also you hav to think about the people who dont troll / carry a team and they get an honor but hav reached their max honors for the day???\n\nIt's an awesome idea but i doubt it'll go live, but still good idea","replies":[{"poster":"Maldred","date":"2015-02-17T00:32:47.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So why not have the community monitor it? Almost like how wiki's work.\nThe community is monitoring the tribunal, so why can't we monitor the honour system? Why should the community be given authority to ban/suspend some one, yet we can't support positive behaviour?\n\nAlso, throw some ideas out there! Let's get Riot's attention on this!","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-02-17T03:55:39.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said it was a good idea, but seriously get more people to monitor this?
