What frequently happens is that it will try summoning after champion select, but the screen will just go black and the cursor will be normal, and not the league cursor. I try reconnecting several times and it says - you have lost connection to the server, please try reconnecting many times, even though my internet is working fine. This really frustrates me because i have been placed into lower priority queue twice now, and can&#039;t do anything about it since it is not my fault.\r\n\r\nThere are no programs that might be harming anything, since I recently restored my computer to factory defaults.\r\n\r\nPlease help, it is getting _really annoying._{{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"LÃ©gs","date":"2015-07-13T12:51:17.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Normally what I would do when this happens is to close league completely.
