I have been playing on my mobile internet when necessary for about 4-5 months now and everything ha been working fine.

Also, I am now having problems loading. A pop-up shows which says could not connect to the server and mentions firewalls, even though all my firewalls are turned off.

I feel like I was cheated by the internet company to access internet using a stupid expensive modem.\n\nModems are dirt cheap nowadays any ways, just buy one.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-11T23:26:36.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing about phones is that they weren't designed to last like a modem. If you're continually and repeatedly using it to connect to the internet via tether or hotspot (hotspot being even worse) then it's a possibility that you've damaged your phone.\n\nWhen you're browsing the internet on your phone, do pages sometimes take a lot longer than the should to load?","replies":[]}]}
