Nowadays it seems that I can&#039;t go through a single game without someone abusing, belittling or telling me, my friends or other people in the game that we should kill ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I&#039;m sure you can understand, I am damn sick of it.\r\n\r\nBecause most of the time, if someone acts abusively to me or my friends, I report them; so do the friends I play with. And it seems to solve nothing. We queue up again. We get matched with someone else. And, in all likelihood, they&#039;ll turn out to be derisive or nasty too.\r\n\r\nIt is seriously getting to the point that I no longer want to play _League of Legends_. It&#039;s not because I don&#039;t enjoy the gameplay (I do - every game brings a new set of enemies and challenges to overcome), but because I don&#039;t enjoy the company of the people who play it too.\r\n\r\n&quot;_There&#039;s an ignore button, you know?_&quot; Yes, I do. And it&#039;s a bandaid that peels off after about an hour. Because this person, in all likelihood, will go on to another game (hopefully one that I&#039;m not in) and proceed to just abuse someone else. It solves the problem for me, not for everyone else they&#039;ll be inflicted upon.\r\n\r\n&quot;_Well, report them then._&quot; I do. Over and over and over again. Nearly every time me and my friends are matched with someone toxic, after the game we&#039;ll report them. And in the next game we&#039;ll get someone just as bad, if not worse. It makes me feel as though the entire Report system just doesn&#039;t work; how could it, if people who are so blatantly vulgar and abusive are still able to play the game?\r\n\r\nI read the releases that Riot puts out about player discipline. It talks about these great strides forward that are being made in dealing with toxicity in the game. But then I play a game, and it just comes across as posturing. Because there&#039;s no evidence that the strategies are actually working, or that our reports are actually having an impact. At least when we had the Tribunal, players knew they were making an active contribution to improving the server.\r\n\r\nBut now we just have to take your word that what you guys are doing behind closed doors is working; I&#039;m sorry, but with the state of this server it&#039;s a pretty tough pill that you expect me to swallow. Your invisible justice, if indeed it exists, is not working. And its ineffectiveness is driving me and my friends away from your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-08-29T03:21:45.238+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":1,"body":"-","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-08-29T05:48:57.661+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logged in just to up vote this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-29T16:33:29.415+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Logged in to upvote","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-09-02T23:16:18.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Your Neighbour,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XxUUHOnE,comment-id=00050001,timestamp=2015-08-29T16:33:29.415+0000)\n>\n> Logged in to upvote\n\nLogged in to upvote","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-09-04T14:38:17.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Logged in to re-upvote","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-08-29T05:27:43.280+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nI totally get where you are coming from. I get people like that in my games too.\n\nWe have instant feedback now and if people are being abusive, harassing, etc, they will get picked up and punished for it. The important thing here is that you report them.\n\nThe settings started out conservative and are being ramped up over time.\n\nOn your larger point about the general toxicity of the server, when I was at a summit with all the regions and the central player behaviour team, the LATAM player behaviour guy asked every one to raise their hands if their players did not believe their region was the most toxic in the world. No one raised their hands.\n\nWhat's going on right now is we have systems up and running, such as Instant Feedback, Chat Restrictions, Intentional Feeder Detection and LeaverBuster.\n\nThe central player behaviour team is also working on features that expand the Instant Feedback system and they release them as they complete.\n\nWhat's happening is players are getting punished and banned, but they are just not posting about it on here so it's not getting seen. When Instant Feedback first rolled out there were a bunch of posts and naturally the community pointed out that they deserved the punishment.\n\nWhat tends to happen now is people get banned and open support tickets instead of posting about it on the boards.\n\nWhen you get banned you also get a reform card with a chat log, so far no one has been willing to post theirs publicly on here.","replies":[{"poster":"efiasko","date":"2015-08-30T03:59:44.568+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"its simple, if you get reported at the end of the game it should tell you in the same way that it tells you after the lobby if you got honored/friendly/teamwork .. that way people know they are being reported and why and that may scare them enough to straighten up a little bit next game.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-30T15:07:47.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is an interesting idea","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"I am Ben","date":"2015-08-31T02:47:06.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Sephyre,\n\nThanks for taking the time to respond. I only made this thread to vent, wasn't expecting it to actually get a Rioter's attention.\n\n> The settings started out conservative and are being ramped up over time.\n\nI feel like the ramp needs to be steeper. This coming off the back of a game where someone on my team told us we should hang ourselves. And an enemy team doing little but talk trash at us all game.\n\n> What's happening is players are getting punished and banned, but they are just not posting about it on here so it's not getting seen.\n\nThing is, that's not what I mean about your justice being invisible. What I meant was when we had the Tribunal, you could look over your prior judgments and see what verdict was passed. You could _see_ who was pardoned or punished. There's a sort of system of visible justice in the Mandalorian Mercs Costume Club - which I am a member of - with a list of people on the site, along with real and forum names, who have been banned from the club and why. Could even relate it to the media at large; when a criminal is judged and given a sentence, the media, the police and/or the courts report on it. We know who the person is, we know the punishment they are getting, and we therefore know that we do not have to suffer the chance of encountering one more murderer, rapist, thief or pedophile on the streets.\n\nRiot, on the other hand, gives us \"_x_ amount of people have been punished, but we're not going to tell you who they are\" and that's it. We don't know if the person we reported is among them, or if they are still spilling their toxic vitriol upon other people on the server; we don't know if we actually made the difference we wanted to by submitting that report. It's all well and good to tell us that _other_ toxic people were punished, but what about the one that specifically ruined _my_ playing experience?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-08-29T03:27:20.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've got two NA accounts, and I'll tell you this right now, if you think OCE is worse than NA, you are terribly mistaken.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-08-30T05:24:35.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=csm,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XxUUHOnE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-08-29T03:27:20.514+0000)\n>\n> I've got two NA accounts, and I'll tell you this right now, if you think OCE is worse than NA, you are terribly mistaken.\n\nWat does CSM stand for?","replies":[{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-09-30T08:47:25.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ThatsBS,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XxUUHOnE,comment-id=00060001,timestamp=2015-08-30T05:24:35.157+0000)\n>\n> Wat does CSM stand for?\n\nExactly","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-29T04:57:15.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=csm,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XxUUHOnE,comment-id=0006,timestamp=2015-08-29T03:27:20.514+0000)\n>\n> I've got two NA accounts, and I'll tell you this right now, if you think OCE is worse than NA, you are terribly mistaken.\n\nyeah but in NA people get chat restricted and banned easier. my NA account is currently on a 20 game chat restriction. i talked shit one game and received it. and i only use the account once every few months....","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chrystoff","date":"2015-08-29T00:51:00.230+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"We have an autoban feature in now, so if you report players who are showing toxicity it will eventually punish them if they repeat the offense and if they don't learn it will ban them. \nIt is a recent addition, so just give it a bit more time maybe? \nI feel that the toxicity levels have gone down since this addition, but maybe that's all in my head, and that i turned all chat off.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-28T18:08:18.245+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":4,"body":"Use the mute button and harden up.","replies":[{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-08-28T22:58:45.044+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Essembie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=XxUUHOnE,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-08-28T18:08:18.245+0000)\n>\n> Use the mute button and harden up.\n\nare you saying toxic people shouldn't be punished? and there's a limit to how many people you can mute, so it's a flawed system.","replies":[{"poster":"Chrystoff","date":"2015-08-29T00:52:02.517+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Send a report their way, along with the mute, they will eventually get punished if everyone reports them.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-08-29T16:39:22.873+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Eventually\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-08-29T03:38:57.922+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"Not at all.

I know this cause I have been banned for staying in base a few times due to a obvious lost game. The enemy was simply better then our team and crushed us.  \n\nI don't sit in base anymore due to the leaver system. So this system works and it works well. At the moment if I were to afk 3 times in a row I would be put in the low priority queue. \n\nRegarding abuse though I just finished a 2 week ban for havinga rage session at a player who literally trolled the game but because they didn't say anything all game they will look innocent but whatever the point is that if you do get reported it can be as little as 5 minutes before you get banned. It is that quick. I don't intentionally feed so I cannot comment on that one but regarding afk and abuse the system works and it's very strict. You get one warning before your account is permanently banned if you are abusive again after your 2 week ban. That's what my email from riot stated to me when I got my ban.\n\nSo it's really simple.
