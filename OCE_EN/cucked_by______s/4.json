I absolutely stomped her in lane with the assistance of my jungler and she just comes back with that item. She wasn&#039;t a bad Diana either, but my jungler was more helpful and ganked top frequently.  When she got the item she tore me to shreds in 1v1s and ended up doing more damage than their 7/1 Shyvanna. \r\n\r\nSo the question remains, why, every time I&#039;ve ever versed a Diana, the moment they buy an abyssal sceptre and no matter how hard they&#039;re feeding, they become just as strong as you?","replies":[]}
