Find a program to check your ping for a few minutes, if there are massive fluctuations (eg. going from 70ms to 230ms), then contact your ISP. There's something wrong with your connection.\n\nOtherwise, it could be the method that your ISP uses to transfer data is not that compatible with League. Does this occur in normal matches as well? Does it ALWAYS happen? It could be that then, TPG users experience it a lot.\n\nLastly, it could just be the servers are stuffing up. If this has been happening only recently then it could be that, people have been having in game issues concerning their connection speed, in which case you'll just have to wait it out.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
