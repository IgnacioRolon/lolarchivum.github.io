Go to Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\ and enter the folder with the highest number (should be easy enough to work out, unless you've been here since beta and never once repaired your client).\n2. Create a new, empty file in the latest version folder named \"S_OK\", with no extension. This can be done by creating a new text document, and then renaming it to remove the \".txt\" at the end.\n3. Run the patcher in admin mode. You might get a glitch the first time around, just open it again and it should work.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Henkthebest","date":"2015-04-01T16:11:42.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nI was expiriencing the exact same problem! \nI had created a new text document in the latest folder inside my C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.138 and i named it S_OK. \n\nI restarted my computer and when i started up the launcher the download would start and finish succesfully. \n\nBut when i wanted to launch to the accutual login screen it gave the next error: 0001: Failed loading mod/win/ClientWindow.dat due to invalid dependencieslib.external.dat.champion_select. in a special window.\n\nAfter this i did another repair, after that the game is fixed and i am now able to play agian!\n\nThank you very much for your help!
