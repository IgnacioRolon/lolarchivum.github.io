This is annoying because I want to post a discussion on a board that requires level 10 and apparently I&#039;m only level 9..\nWhy is this happening? Surely something just needs to update and it&#039;ll be ok but it&#039;s more than a whole year behind...\n\nEDIT: Wow just after posting this it updated to level 30. It's all good now, I have full access.\n\nEDIT 2: OK I actually do not have full access to the boards despite the website now recognising me as level 30. Apparently my account still needs to be level 10 or higher to post on certain boards....","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-08T04:23:42.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nApologies for such a late response, are you able to post in other boards now? It seems your level has updated correctly and is displaying as 30 on my end of things.","replies":[]}]}
