They have every right. by law, to refuse skin exchanges.\n\nalso where does it say that absolutely under any circumstances they don't \"refund\". the thing you quoted just says that they don't refund for accidental skin \"purchases\". you really think if the product they sell, Riot Points, were faulty in some way, they wouldn't refund you? Now obviously RP can't be faulty, because they are not a real, tangible, thing, but I hope you get the point.","replies":[{"poster":"Darcy","date":"2016-01-12T03:59:33.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am not failing to realise anything, the purchase of riot points and the purchases with riot points are not a loophole to get around our laws.
