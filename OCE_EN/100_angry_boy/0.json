And we were like OK  we let the first game go, we can try catch up in next few games , because we made mistake. Now is how unsportsmanship comes in the organizer goes : no you are out of the tournament!!! Wow  such a rude organizer.\r\nAlso we been told its going to be a NZ based tournament and only NZ teams will join, we found there are numbers of AUS teams in this tournament.\r\nWe are so disappointed because they are doing such thing to faithfull LOL player and their team. We were issued auto FF for not checking in, and we havent received any check in info. this is a joke.
