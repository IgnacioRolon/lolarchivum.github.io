Which btw, I&#039;m absolutely terrible at landing it good! (hints why I don&#039;t play rumble much) So, is viktors E as hard as rumbles ult, or is there something about it that just makes it a bit easier to land... Or am I making the wrong decision entirely and go with Maokai... Because atm viktors only just ahead of him!\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to comment! Would love some feedback from you Viktor players! And some Maokai players :p\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:58:16.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just but irelia she is the easiest champion to get rank 1 challenger with","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jewmanji","date":"2015-04-10T11:28:23.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Viktor in normals, not URF is a difficult champion. But, once you get the hang of it, you can become unstoppable. It will take time, and you will get frustrated. If you're looking for a fun, simple, easy to learn guy go for maokai. He can play as a tank or as an apc. If you're looking for a challenge, go for vik.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-04-10T04:40:41.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"VIktor's E is different from Rumble's R.\n\nYou cast it more so you get far more practise.\nWhen you get used to it you'll love it and you won't stop casting it because it's so fun.\n\nBest situation to practise is when the 6 lane minions mid game walk to fight your minions, they will form 2 rows of 3, allowing a single E to kill all minions with Augment Aftershock. It's best simply because it feels so good to instakill a whole minion wave with just one ability\n\nAnd Viktor's new art looks boss\n\n{{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}} {{champion:112}}","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-04-10T10:10:39.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually did buy Viktor because of one reason, urf is still here, which gives me time to spam, have fun and practise his e while still doing a lot of damage. So far he's awesome! First game with him I got a triple kill in a 3v1 situation!

He isnt an instant burst like Veigar because Viktors ult is more of an intimidation technique then does a little damage. Viktor's E works exactly like Rumbles ult. You click and hold while dragging to the direction you want. no mater if you flash, get stunned or die, viktors E laser will stay fixed to its direction and course. Maokai is more relevant to the team because he has hard lockdown and team initiate fighter. He doesnt do so much damage but he does help team fights allot.  So to conclude viktor is someone who will be harder to play and more reasonable to buy maokai.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-04-09T15:40:05.373+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This helps alot mate, thanks!\n\nQuick question though, does maokai still do decent damage for a tank? Or is his damage just absolutely garbage, cuz I'm a fan of the tanks that not only help there team with cc, tankyness and all that, but can do at least some damage, for example, volibear, tanky and quite strong.","replies":[]}]}]}
