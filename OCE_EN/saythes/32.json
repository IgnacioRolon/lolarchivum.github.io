Thoughts...","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!\r\nSo as you may know, kindred was released today! I was already saving up for him/her, and was going to wait 1 week for 6300 ip. Now that I see her being played, I&#039;m not too sure anymore... Every game I&#039;ve played with a kindred (only 4-5) they haven&#039;t done well at all. I was considering buying darius until kindred was announced, so I&#039;m thinking of that option again! What&#039;s your opinions on kindred? Should I still wait and buy kindred? Or should I get Darius instead?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nPlease comment below! I love reading them and will try and reply ASAP!","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralLasers","date":"2015-10-18T00:41:20.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should buy Kindred. He has many roles he can play(mid,top,jungle or adc) and overall he's pretty strong if you know how to play him. He's a beast in the jungle btw.","replies":[{"poster":"LunaHiga","date":"2016-02-11T11:47:21.747+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she* :\")","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-11T11:57:09.828+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"*They ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T21:38:28.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LunaHiga,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Y6fE9nb3,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-02-11T11:47:21.747+0000)\n>\n> she* :\")\n\nKindred is comprised of both Lamb and Wolf so it's not she.

Kindreds ult is just so weak! I played Kindred in a One For All match (and I know that's not a good place to judge champion potential) and the ult was underwhelming. You can really only use it if you a) are taking baron or drag at low health b) are ignited and about to die or a global ugly is coming your way and nearby champions are dead. You have to be fed as kindred to ult during a duel and then win that fight. Also playing her in lane makes it hard to get her jungle marks as enemies know that you left to get it. Kindred seems like a very snowball type champ where if you get fed you are unstoppable, it's just getting fed seems hard.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T05:57:17.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have to disagree here, before I actually played her that was certainly how I felt, but now I realise its potential. Understand, it is less for duelling (though it can be used for such if you are a little weaker/even with your opponent, if you're more fed than them you shouldn't have to) and more for team fights, it is phenomenally strong when used on your teams back line where as little of the enemy team is in it as possible, and your carries are protected (you included if it comes to it). It opens a window for your carries to dish out free damage and for your cc to peel enemies off them (with any luck getting them out of the zone before it heals), then your team can just clean up afterwards. Kindred is strong with cc heavy teams but also weak against the same, she'll always be difficult to pick for/against in blind though. Her ult is strong, you just have to be very aware of your team comp and positioning (and to an extent have a team that knows at least how she works which is still difficult since she's so new).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-14T10:22:27.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"kindred will get buffed in a week or we will find out how to play it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-10-14T10:09:36.357+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally, I really like playing Kindred, though I may just have a soft spot for 2-in-1 Marksman champions (Looking at you Quinn and Valor). Honestly, I'm even considering learning to jungle just so I can play Kindred and, hopefully, dominate.\n\nOne thing you should keep in mind is that Kindred was only just released today, no one, no matter how good they are at the game, knows how to play them effectively at this point, certainly not people in low elo. Considering that, it's no surprise you haven't seen a good Kindred yet. Never judge a champion based on their least knowledgeable/experienced players.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-10-14T10:19:02.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah!
