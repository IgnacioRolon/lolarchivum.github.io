The only thing that is bothering me about him is landing his e. I heard its exactly like rumbles ult, and in my case, a hard landing skill... When I'm under pressure I just smash keys like not tommorow (not really, but I don't take to time to land a specific skill with that certain technique) and I will feel if I don't land it I'll be screwed...
