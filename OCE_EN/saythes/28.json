Oh well. I'm kinda paranoid, if I get _just_ enough champs to qualify for everything (I think it's 16 for team builder?), would it be better than having all champs since my chance of getting one I specialize in is higher? Is it possible to disable champs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-07-02T09:11:41.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think alot of people got azir, everyone i asked said azir (and i got him), but they also said no one will get one less then 560 rp so there isnt a gamble lel","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-07-02T09:57:06.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, and I though azir free week was annoying..
