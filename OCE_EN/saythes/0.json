I&#039;ve been playing udyr a lot lately (godyr guinsoos for the win!) and really like the look of his ultimate skin. I already own the other 2 ultimate skins, and enjoy PFE way more than DJ sona. This isn&#039;t because DJ sona is bad, it&#039;s just that I really enjoy the feel of PFE. Anyway, I&#039;ve only really bought the ultimate skins, as I don&#039;t really buy RP much. Should I buy SGU? Should I wait for the next ultimate skin to come out? (Unkown champ)\n\n\nThanks!\n\nComment below {{champion:77}}","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-03-08T18:07:31.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Save your moneys and buy someone you appreciate a gift.

Spirit Guard is very nice too, but it depends on you! \n\nIf you like all of the intricate things within the skin such as the emotes and quotes along with the particle/aesthetic look then I'd say go for it! If you haven't seen all the details check out this [Skin Spotlight!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0APrGg6EqI) (You can also search for any other skin you're considering here for a full look at it!)\n\nIf you're more in the mood for a gimicky and funny skin to play around with I'd recommend the Definitely not Udyr!
