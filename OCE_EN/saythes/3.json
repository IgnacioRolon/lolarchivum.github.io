So I&#039;m really struggling with picking which one I should get. There are things I love about both of them, and things I&#039;m not to sure about. I main both ADC and JG, and I love playing Ekko Jg. I already have Heartseeker Ashe, which is one of the reasons I&#039;m thinking more towards the Ekko skin. Here are the Pros and Cons for both skins (My opinions btw). \r\n\r\nProject Ashe - Cons\r\n- I feel like the effects (mainly ult and W) are a little weak for a legendary skin.\r\n- It is a bit like Project Lucian, just blue (bit lazy, wanted something a bit different) \r\n\r\nProject Ekko - Cons\r\n- I not a big fan of the body design (lacks that project vibe)  \r\n- I hate the Wallpaper/Loading screen card thingy (not really a big deal though)\r\n- Green isn&#039;t the best colour (But I do appreciate the colour change, unlike Project Ashe) \r\n\r\nProject Ashe - Pros \r\n- I LOVE the body design (That cape though)\r\n- The hood program creates a unique look.\r\n- THAT DANCE THOUGH!\r\n- The Droid is beautiful.\r\n- Wallpaper/Loading screen card is badass! \r\n\r\nProject Ekko - Pros\r\n- I love the look of all the abilities; better then project Ashes tbh...\r\n- The voiceover is sick.\r\n- They changed the colour from his classic skin.\r\n- It&#039;s fluent, meaning that the abilities just work with each other. \r\n- It&#039;s amazing for its price. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, while there are some Cons for both skins, the Pros overtake them by a mile. I love the new skins, which is why I&#039;m struggling to pick one. I can either do this...\r\n\r\nBuy Project Ashe for its price\r\nOr\r\nBuy Project Ekko and a couple of cache boxes.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t have enough money to buy both, so don&#039;t bother mentioning that.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!\r\nFeel free to comment below. \r\n\r\n~Saythes {{champion:245}} {{champion:22}}","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-05T10:30:01.295+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer PROJECT: Ekko.

Since you already have Heartseeker Ashe, and if you like it, you might lean towards the Ekko skin. If that doesn't matter to you then go for Ashe. \n\nMaybe the 470 RP (or how ever much is leftover) and the possible glory that caches bring is too good to pass up. I guess that would depend on how much essence you have though. Tough decision.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-02T07:55:16.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Project ashe","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-02T07:11:37.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Personally, i don't think theres any competition \nPROJECT: Ashe is far superior \n\n(I dont play either champ, so I'm unbiased)","replies":[]}]}
