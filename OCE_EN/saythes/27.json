I&#039;ve currently gained 6300 ip lately and was wondering if I should buy him, or should I just keep saving and buy kindred on release? I heard kindreds really fun and powerful, but idk... \r\n\r\nSo buy ekko? \r\nOr buy kindred on release (7800ip) \r\n\r\nPlease comment your thoughts, love reading them!","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-22T16:39:25.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1st of all nobody should be buying champs for 7800ip unless you've got every single other champ and every important rune you'll need alongside the 20 rune pages you should have. if i bought every champ since ive started playing at 7800ip id have wasted 13,500 IP just cos i couldnt wait a week to play them. 13,500, you could buy that champ and then any other champ/s in the game since you'll have 7200 IP leftover\n\nekko probably wont get nerfed anymore so thats what id like about him. hes definitely not OP and besides an unsuspecting W hes still pretty easy to telegraph and manage in a lane against. kindred looks pretty mobile too though but i feel with his/their kit, their abilities themselves might be a bit weaker when not taking advantage of its synchronicity, nam saiyan","replies":[]},{"poster":"killll hunter","date":"2015-12-28T06:08:49.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my opinion,i think you should first try them both free (or at your's frinds account).If i were you btw i would buy ekko or diana.Hope have helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"slimegr","date":"2015-12-07T18:01:15.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i just played ekko today and i gotta say you're gonna have so much fun to play with him...he is really hard though.Kindred is easier and she is op BOTH OF THEM ARE OP! but just kindred is easy........ something that ekko isn't..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trymoreharder","date":"2015-09-28T22:13:04.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would say buy ekko because he has a good kit. he can dive with e and can get out with before he die. he has a gap closer, a stun/shield/slow, a range q which u can farm with/ can slow opponents and his ult can make u escape battles or kill low health enemies that are chasing you.\nHe is a good mid lane champ and u can jung with him.\nHe is a mid game champ if u didnt know.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-23T11:56:35.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko is super OP against predictable opponents.\nIf you can land his W well then you have pretty much dominated lane and game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-22T21:38:55.127+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko isn't really over powered he is really effective but in mid lane he is gonna at his weakest.
