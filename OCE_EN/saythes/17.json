His Q is ridiculous, I mean, not only does it do a shit load of damage, but it heals him... Oh yeah, and it has a 5 sec cd at max lvl! Then there&#039;s his ult reset, which is not only OP, but stupidly anyoing since he can pretty much 2v1 in any situation... Anyway, I&#039;m thinking of buying him, you think it&#039;s worth it? Or do you think there going to nerf the hell out of him later? P.S, I actually hated the old darius play style... A lot of people did! \r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-30T21:47:53.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok the q walk to him and he wont get a blood stack or heal only if the tip gets you if you get what im saying hehehehe as for the  ult reset he has always had that and he is probs the most balanced of the juggernauts aka reworks mord skarner and garen are p atm riot sed they will probs buff him not nerf if you know how a champ works you can play agenst him old darius you always walk away from him so he dose not do a shit tone of damage but now you walk to him or away depending on were his q is going to go off don't post unless you read how a champ works","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-31T07:53:41.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's always had it truly reset, but only for a period of time... So pretty much he can only use his ult again in the next 30 secs... This is what changed now, because it has no time, if he kills someone with it, it resets perminately until you use it again!","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-08-31T08:59:27.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so I played old darius a lot and by lv 6 you all in them ult and by the time they get back to lane its reset or has a 30 sec cool down","replies":[]}]}]}]}
