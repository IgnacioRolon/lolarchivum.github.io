Personally, I prefer the looks and display of PFE (Pulsefire ezreal) more, but everyone says that it&#039;s not worth it, and it looks clucky and needs an update. I recently bought Ezreal and find him so much fun to play. I still play Sona too, and I really like the creativity for the DJ sona skin. Which one is actually worth it&#039;s money? As I am only buying one of the two... And don&#039;t tell me to buy neither, as I will be buying one or the other, I just need help choosing the right one! \r\n\r\nComment below! \r\n\r\nThanks...","replies":[{"poster":"KoiSarina","date":"2015-11-02T19:00:10.266+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which one do you play more?

I think I'll stick with my gut, and go with PFE, as I don't really play Sona that much anyways.
