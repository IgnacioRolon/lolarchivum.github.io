I have been waiting all day to play urf, and you still haven&#039;t delivered. I&#039;ll be seriously pissed if you don&#039;t release it and actually carry on with the game mode rotation. You think we are happy with it? From getting urf for 2 and a half weeks to getting urf 4-8 days a year... Step up rioto, do what makes us happy, as I WAY prefer to have the 2 and a half week urf time all in one period.","replies":[{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-04-01T11:58:36.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would you prefer 2 and a half weeks of each game mode meaning less time and becoming very boring very quickly  or every weekend on different game mode so it will never get boring and more exciting to get the week over with to come back to the weekend of game mode fun.

There is no real date to when the U.R.F. game mode is going to be out, but here is some information that people may have missed.\n\n> We’re announcing it now is because two years in a row, we delivered the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode in increasingly absurd ways. While we’re pretty sure you aren’t going to believe us anyway, we’re telling you right now that URF will not return on the first of April.\n\n> We are ready to share that Ultra Rapid Fire will appear at least twice in 2016.\n\nIf you want to read up on the full post, [Click Here](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/gameplay/announcing-rotating-game-mode-queue)","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-04-01T16:23:16.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, this is just unfair. Why would riot think that this was a good idea? We are getting it twice a year for 2 days each... 2 DAYS! That is so unfair. They are giving us less urf and are spreading it out during the year which is even more annoying. It's not what we asked for riot, what we asked for was to get 2 Urf times per year that each go for 2 weeks. You can't say that it gets boring after awhile because it purely doesn't. I played urf none stop from the day it started, to the day it finished, and man oh man was it weird playin ranked after that...","replies":[{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-04-01T16:27:24.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Where does it say that U.R.F. is only going to be around for 2 days at a time?

This means 1 of 2 things.\n\n1. U.R.F. is going to be on the rotating list, meaning it will be around once every so often (6-8 weeks depending on how many game modes there are)\n\n2. U.R.F. Is going to be active 2 times this year for a week at a time or longer.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-04-01T17:00:04.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It says it runs for every weekend mate, not every week. So in total, we will only get urf 6-8 days this year, which Is a nerf.\n\nFrom going to 18 days of urf to 6-8, how can you not be made?

RIOT will do something with the info that has already been said. If U.R.F. has been added to the cycle and we only see it for 6-8 days a year, that's fine! It's so people don't get bored. \n\nRemember what happened to Dominion? If U.R.F. is up for so long, the same thing is going to happen. \n\nPlease note, this is all in my own opinion. People react differently, and I am someone who is not fussed if U.R.F. is coming out or not, if it's there I'll play a little of it, but back to the normal summoners rift for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-04-01T21:27:49.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Omg don't you dare compare U.R.F to dominion. Rito made an honest statement that the reason why people got bored of it and stopped playing was because the DID NOT support it as a game mode.\n\n\"We haven’t been supporting Dominion, and we’ve trapped ourselves in a vicious cycle where the queue isn’t large enough to warrant major attention, but falls prey to bugs and periods of imbalance from the introduction of new champs and items (which then drives down the size of the queue, and so on).\"\n\nThe community is SCREAMING out for U.R.F and naturally Rito will support it, as it is a game mode that doesn't require harsh balancing or the introduction of anything that summoners rift doesn't already have, it is just completely absurd and fun! Like playing an Aram after having a massive losing streak on norms.\n\nU.R.F simply isn't made to get \"boring\", because its a new way to play champions.","replies":[{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-04-02T10:55:16.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel it could happen though...
