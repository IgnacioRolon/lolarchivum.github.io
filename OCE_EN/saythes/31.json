Nothing really can kill him and he has hardly any outplay potential (save for his Q which heals ridiculously in the middle of teamfights) Ekko on the other hand, can be played Jungle, Mid, maybe even Support or Top, seeing as he has stuns and gapclosers. He's very fun to play, and he's not weak at all! It all depends on your playstyle to be honest, I'd totally prefer Ekko, unless you want to really dominate top lanes, then pick Darius. But be warned, you'll bore of him soon (maybe)","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-09-14T14:11:49.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, there are two reasons why I'm really stuck between them... Like you said, Darius is Op and all, but he does tend to bore me a bit as well, thing is, haven't played him since the buff. The other problem evolves Ekko which, like I said, seems to be a bit weaker nowadays. Now, if I was to get Ekko and play him jg, I wouldn't play him tank, does that still work? I would get Ekko for fun and power, same applies with Darius. \n\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-16T11:21:00.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You don't have to build Ekko tank just because the pros did it (I mean it's a good idea, but you don't have to). \nThe thing with Darius is, though he's OP (kind of) he has no outplay potential, and he can't run away from people, or ganks. \nDarius is a kill-kill-kill champion, when push comes to shove in his lane, he can't run away, he doesn't have any disengage abilities, while Ekko has both engage and disengage. \nAlso, Darius is one of the slower champions in the game, so if he's too stronk for you, just slowly walk away and the grandpa won't catch up. \nRegarding Ekko, he's definitely not weak, he's actually very powerful, and much more fun, he can E over walls, then AA back to an enemy (his gapcloser). He can stun, and gain a massive shield, he can slow with Q, and if he procs 3 Auto's he gains speed and superslows the enemy. He can also (not sure if bug or intentional), Ult back to lane within 4 seconds of recalling.\nWhat you do, you recall (homeguards help with mana & health regen), then wait for mana/health to go back to full, remembering it has to be full within 4 seconds or your ghost catches up, then ult, and you'll be back in lane. \n\n(Please don't hurt me if it doesn't work, I believe it does, and I don't think it's a bug, I've seen someone do it in the middle of lane, pretty awesome!)\n\nAnyway, I'm biased because I main Mid and Support, so I'd love an Ekko in my champion pool, and I really despise champions that move slow, are OP, are boring to play, and have no outplay potential.
