Is the ultimate skin (3250 RP) Pulsfire ezreal still worth buying? I&#039;ve been playing ezreal nonstop lately and was thinking of buying it. It&#039;s personally my second favorite ultimate skin with DJ sona being the first. I&#039;ve never really like Sporit guard udyr, as I think of it more of a legendary skin due its lack of design and performance. However, the reason I&#039;m not considering getting DJ sona is because I don&#039;t really play her anymore. I was just wondering what you guys personally think of Pulsefire ezreal...\r\n\r\nComment on your thoughts!","replies":[{"poster":"WrEeDa","date":"2018-04-03T08:12:49.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pls RITO update the skin","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-04-03T11:02:33.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It has been.

Personally I own it but it's a bit clunky with Q's and such. It's not the best skin. Maybe later down the line if it gets an update. I use Striker Ezreal over it =/","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2015-11-08T15:03:08.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, I play Ez quite a bit. I am still waiting for an update. I like to transition depending on position I play. Striker for AI's, TPA for ADC (because it is red and I am symbolic as all fck), Frosted for Sup (easy to tell apart from the fray) and Debonair top AD (because I want to die constantly in style), but I usually use Pulsefire for Mid anyways, because it is blue and I play AP mid... Soooo yeah. :P \n\nIn the end, nice to have, but maybe wait for the update first. It is still a better skin if you are considering a change in particle colours.","replies":[]}]}]}
