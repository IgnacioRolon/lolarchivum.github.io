Anyway, I thought of a new skin! \n{{champion:64}} kangaroo lee sin!!! Picture it! Lee sin wearing a kangaroo onesie, throwing wallabies for his q, doing a &quot;Kangaroo jump&quot; for his ult.\nThe creativity is endless! \n\n\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-10-14T21:50:53.216+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TBH. The current OCE skin does a fairly decent way of representing all populations in the Oceanic server. A \"kangaroo lee sin\" would really only cater to the Australian population. One of the biggest reasons for the delay in our server skin was finding a way to represent as many if not all population groups within the Oceanic server. In addition, Lee Sin already has a boxing skin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-15T10:26:26.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kangaroo Lee Sin only represents Australia since they only appear in AUstralia, the Cosmic Reaver Kassadin is a good representative because only the Southern Cross me Seen in Oceania and nowhere else, if you are considering a skin concept please think of all the other countries in Oceania.\nSilentXKiller","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-14T14:44:31.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you not wont a free skin shhhhhhh o wait no free skin fuck you riot","replies":[]}]}
