Is this a bug? For example, on a single win, I would only get 11-13 lp added to my rank. On a loss, however, I would lose about 20-25 lp. I don&#039;t know if this is the new ranked system, pre-season changes or a bug, but if it is supposed to be the &quot;improvements&quot; that Riot has stated about the whole new system, then it&#039;s anything but that.
