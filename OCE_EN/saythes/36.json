It has been 4 business days, and it&#039;s still processing...  My friend told me he got his cho and kog Maw ones in about just over a week... It has almost been a week, and hasn&#039;t even been shipped yet. How long did your merch take when  you bought stuff? Please riot, I want my two figures before christmas! \n\nComment below please, as always, I love reading  them...\n\nThanks \n(P.S, Live in Australia)","replies":[{"poster":"DreamlessDays","date":"2015-12-01T21:58:16.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the past I've ordered a mousepad and figures, and in my experience they took about 2 - 3 weeks to get here. Personally I don't expect my own order to arrive before Christmas, but legit hope all of it works out in time for you.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-12-02T00:23:41.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks bro, just got a message today saying that they are on there way...
