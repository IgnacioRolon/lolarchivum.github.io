It is very easy to call them both troll champs, Infact, bard has one of the lowest win rates out of all the champs... But lately I&#039;ve been noticing a lot more God bard players and I personally think that bard, in the right hands, is an amazing supp! I have played one, which was indeed bard, and had a lot of fun and did actually really well! I haven&#039;t played tahm yet, but I&#039;m hoping to try him sooner or later, as ATM he looks like such a broken supp... \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Bard or tahm?\r\nComment below!\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-20T05:49:18.829+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They're both really strong when played by a skillful player. I think id hate bard more but maybe that's just coz i havent played against any good tahm yet. I guess his permaslow on his attacks would be really damn annoying. But i've found if you play against tahm, just stay behind your minions and he's pretty useless besides throwing minions at you and his ult.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-07-23T08:36:23.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like tahm better","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-07-23T08:20:28.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bard does more poking than Tahm, so Bard is more ideal if u ask me","replies":[]},{"poster":"AcerArena13","date":"2015-07-23T07:49:20.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally think they are both good but personally I think Bard is slightly better as he has a bit more utility later on in the game, especially with his ult, plus he can harass a little and possibly innitiate with his q. \n\nThat's not to say tahm is bad, he can save his carry very easily.","replies":[]}]}
