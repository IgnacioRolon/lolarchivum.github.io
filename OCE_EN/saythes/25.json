Whilst playing, I realised that the last ultimate skin that was released was DJ Sona, which was about early April 2015. I then began to wonder if we will be getting one for 2016, as I \npresume it is a yearly thing (PF Ezreal in 2013, SG Udyr in 2014 and DJ Sona in 2015). So my question is, will we be getting one this year? It is \nclosing near the end of the year again, and there has been no teasers at all for the champ, theme etc... I personally love the ultimate skins (Own DJ Sona and PF Ezreal) and all the different unique capabilities they each bring to the rift. \nI was thinking that this years ultimate skin will go to Maokai, until I saw his Victorius skin. Now I have no Idea!\nWhat are your thoughts? Who do you think the next ultimate skin will go to?\n\nComment below!\n\nThanks! {{champion:81}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:77}}","replies":[{"poster":"SKT T1 Taehoon","date":"2016-10-10T15:11:25.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A Chinese Rioter Leaked info about it and it was the champion of Vel Koz that was heavily looked into #PoolPartyYorick","replies":[]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-10-08T04:17:41.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was leaked that Lux was getting the Ultimate skin, \"Elementalist Lux\" along with Candy King Ivern, and the new Star Guardian Skins.","replies":[{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-08T05:53:17.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ pretty much this","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-10-08T07:06:19.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read something about a \"Dreamtime Maokai\" ultimate skin (or something along those lines).
