And it is the most OP thing I&#039;ve ever played with a jgler champ... And I didn&#039;t even get that fed early. Anyway, I&#039;m close to getting 6300 ip, and I was considering to get vi... In the end, i decided that I was going to get Ekko! But! Now that the new titanic hydra item came out and it scales with health, I was wandering if it worked really well with Vi, if it does, I may reconsider getting vi instead...\r\n\r\nThanks :D comments below!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-08-21T06:59:23.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tank Vi with Titanic would be fine, it just suffers the problem of being a waste of an item slot on Vi (this is hydra in general), and if your going for AD/Tank stats you kinda just look elsewhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-08-20T11:26:33.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't get ekko he's underpowered and it doesn't feel rewarding to play him anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-20T12:22:30.263+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"rito killed skarner like they killed him","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-08-20T14:50:59.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Talon12,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=aV5Nzm6H,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-08-20T12:22:30.263+0000)\n>\n> rito killed skarner like they killed him\n\nHAHA if only he is busted now his e takes 1 aa and stuns for 2 seconds also it slows and his w scales off health plus he deals a shit ton of damage and here I was think nautlius jg was the cc king with the best damage","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-21T04:42:19.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"his stun is only 1 sec, the slow duration and % was nerfed, the cd for the stun us higher, he doesn't scale very well unless he builds ad, shied is useless if you don't buy hp, passive does nothing unless in jg, and even in jg its easily captured by enemy, and skarner cant recapture it easily, losing his passive until enemies pull out of the area so it doesn't do anything for him. Passive is 15 or so gold every few min and maybe the bonuses from it for a few seconds till the enemy just kills it. his q lost it's jg clear, it's move and attackspeed utility,  and its duration. w is either 3k+ hp or nothing, e is a chance stun, you miss you get nothing for another 13 sec. his r doesn't damage without ad, the passive attackspeed gained from r cant be used if you can't aa, the only thing he does now is hope he isn't invaded and drag enemies to his team to be beaten","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-21T00:02:32.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Mar3thyu,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=aV5Nzm6H,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-08-20T14:50:59.631+0000)\n>\n> HAHA if only he is busted now his e takes 1 aa and stuns for 2 seconds also it slows and his w scales off health plus he deals a shit ton of damage and here I was think nautlius jg was the cc king with the best damage\n\nPlus they gave his ult an ad scaling so going ad skarner is a viable option now if it wasn't already","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
