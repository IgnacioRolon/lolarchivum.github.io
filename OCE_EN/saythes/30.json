But people have told me there are better jglers, and with that matter, I have decided on 4 champs (still including vi and aatrox) \r\n\r\nThose following are...\r\nVi\r\nAatrox\r\nRengar\r\nNocturne \r\n\r\nPlease comment and vote in which one you think is the most worth champ... Mainly looking for jgler tier btw... But a toplaner/jgler would be fine :D \r\n\r\nThanks again","replies":[{"poster":"AcerArena13","date":"2015-08-19T08:32:21.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Currently I would actually recommend Nidalee and Elise, props the too best jungles right now, however with the upcoming mr item buffs it could change","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-08-16T04:08:10.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall if you want one guy to main from Bronze to Diamond go Rengar, he's really strong in all elos. There's some simplicity to him kit making him easy to understand but also some really complex tactics you can pull off. He can play top and jungle really well too.\n\nVi is really nice jungle but no so good top, apart from that same as Rengar.\n\nAatrox is pretty trash unless you go devourer or something.\n\nNocturne can be good, his top lane is actually stronger than people think.\n\nTL;DR\nPick Rengar","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-16T12:54:02.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply! \nTbh, I play league for fun, not ranked, so I don't really care or not if he/she gets me to diamond, I don't play ranked anyway...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-16T12:51:16.720+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Help!

If you know how to pull of the 5 ferocity ult combo you can easily 1 shot almost anyone (except tanks) and his kit is simple once you learn it.","replies":[]}]}
