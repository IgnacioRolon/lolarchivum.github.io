I want one really badly, but the champs I like from the list don&#039;t look as good/detailed as others. So please listen to my suggestion of making a viktor one riot :D I know, viktor is underplayed and not much people would buy him, but he is a champion I like and would think it would look so badass! \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and make suggestions of other champs you want to buy as a statue!","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-04-19T21:27:15.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Join the glorious evolution!
