However Vi in my opinion has faster clearing speeds. I know you may be looking at only Vi and Aatrox but a champ that I feel seems to do jg/top pretty well is Volibear. His teamfight is not bad and his clearing speeds are pretty good. Vi's teamfighting potential is also probably stronger than Aatrox especailly due to her Ult where she can focus on the ADC really well during team fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-11T12:30:46.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the thought, but I do already own voli XD \n\nP.S, sated is like my fav jg item...

However junglers such as Udyr, Shyvana and Yi greatly benefit from the sated devourer item. Another champ that is really similar to Aatrox in terms of sated is Xin Zhao, while I feel that sated Xin Zhao is alot stronger it could come up to personal prefernce. Im not exactly sure How long it takes Aatrox to get sated but I know that Shyvana and Udyr have some of the earliest sated timings in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-08-11T13:51:07.654+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again, I own all those champs except shyv, which whom I played devoured build many times when she was free, and I have to agree with you, udyr devourer AD is just stupidly broken...
