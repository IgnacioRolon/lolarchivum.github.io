We were in champion select, and my friend and I both got bot. I picked him for my adc, and my friend picked taric. Anyway, our darius proceeded to tell me not to play jhin as he is weak and has no mobility. I \nlaughed at him, as it is such bs that jhin is weak (I&#039;ve only had one negative score with him \nso far, and got my first Ranked penta with him...). \nWe then went through champ bans, and whilst he didn&#039;t ban jhin, his nooby friend did. They then laughed, and told me they did it because they hate jhin. This really made me \nangry, and I picked ezreal and got into game. The game went on and darius and rammus (his friend) ended up feeding. They fed so bad that they even fed the lone leona that we were vsing \nin the bot lane (there ADC was afk). Outta the blue, leona got a massive power spike (titanic hydra) and proceeded to use that to her \nadvantage. We then fed, and lost a 4v5 game... \nWe were not toxic, but they were. They then reported us for feeding, and said we were the worst bot lane they have ever seen (We lost a \n2v1 against a 4/1 leona...). We did nothing wrong. \n\nPlease do something about this riot, I&#039;m scared my account will get banned...\n\nThanks...","replies":[{"poster":"Bytez","date":"2016-03-12T08:22:59.372+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"'Naming and Shaming' is not allowed.\n\nAlthough I do understand that it's frustrating.

Sometimes it's better to not use the preview pick feature if you feel that people will question your champion pick. Jhin is an absolutely fine pick as you said, and has seen play in Professional as well. \n\nTrolls happen, and it's something that when you get them you feel helpless. But just make sure you and your friend **do report them!** it does work and will get them punished. Them reporting you won't result in anything unless you are retaliating. If they are trolling and flaming you simply mute them and focus on what you and your duo can do. Flamers typically hate one way conversations, and want a response from you when they insult you. Mute them and they will talk to themselves for a while and hopefully give-up the chat spam and go back to the game. Alternatively they may get more angry (which isn't your fault) and spam more or All Chat, which will probably lead to more reports for them!\n\nYou can't change some people, but you can utilize Mute and Report in order to focus on the game and hope they get punished. Remember, as long as you and your friends are not fuelling the flame in any of the games, the other team should have a lot higher chance of getting the trolls in the long run! Focus on your game and being positive players and it should help your situation. Maybe not every game, but over the course of the season you should see results.\n\nSorry to hear about this situation and I know it sucks to be in it. You could also try and queue up with more friends to reduce the chance of this happening further? Dynamic queue is super useful for this, but is really under utilized. (Remember you can just add people you enjoyed playing with after games! If you win with them and are nice, it gives them a reason to try queuing up with you again!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2016-03-12T10:47:47.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry didn't realize guys!
