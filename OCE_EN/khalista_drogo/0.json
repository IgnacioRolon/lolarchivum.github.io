Sure. We all have games where we are provoked and act irresponsibly in defence and I&rsquo;m one to do that on many occasion\nBut for what I was banned on - what it came back and told me - was not a bannable offence. My whole team had asked for this person to stop whining I was a bad support, I said nothing ill I said things in my defence but nothing that was in an offensive way and I muted this persons chat. So I&rsquo;m confused as to why I was suspended for this particular match as my team mates will defend my actions as to what happened. \nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Khalista Drogo","date":"2018-07-14T23:46:11.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Game 1\nPre-Game\nKhalista Drogo: lol\nKhalista Drogo: ok then\nKhalista Drogo: sup it is\nKhalista Drogo: want me to take heal?\nKhalista Drogo: veigar supp?\nIn-Game\nKhalista Drogo: lol, well this sucks\nKhalista Drogo: your three teamates were out team mates last games\nKhalista Drogo: :)\nKhalista Drogo: i know i meant to be as well but he scares me\nKhalista Drogo: if i had the shield i woulda put it on you\nKhalista Drogo: omg\nKhalista Drogo: can you\nKhalista Drogo: stop tyelling me what to do\nKhalista Drogo: i know\nKhalista Drogo: though you should see my lulu\nKhalista Drogo: mate your not a good adc, i havent said shit\nKhalista Drogo: who takes quinn bot lane now a days\nKhalista Drogo: so shhh\nKhalista Drogo: omfg\nKhalista Drogo: are you still talking?\nKhalista Drogo: i never said that\nKhalista Drogo: you pinged me\nKhalista Drogo: told me to let them push\nKhalista Drogo: even though they were attacvking the turret\nKhalista Drogo: so stfu\nKhalista Drogo: you are stupid\nKhalista Drogo: i did as my adc told me to\nKhalista Drogo: even though it was a stupid call\nKhalista Drogo: muting your tilting as fuck\nKhalista Drogo: oh i muted it\nPost-Game\nKhalista Drogo: report quinn\nKhalista Drogo: naw\nKhalista Drogo: sweetie\nKhalista Drogo: look at my match history\nKhalista Drogo: lol\nKhalista Drogo: by you\nKhalista Drogo: the rest rest of the team reported you\n\nI found the log.. of course only shows what I said, but I don't find this banable fo defending myself against the other player.

There's nothing overly dramatic in there, but there's a few things that could be happening.\n\nAssuming the log is unedited, there's no way this would have warranted an instant escalation to a 14 day ban, so you've had at least one chat restriction (but more likely two) prior to this punishment. Basically this means you have significant negative history, and will be treated less leniently than a first time offender.\n\nMy best guess as to the cause of this punishment is cumulative history. There are some cases where a player gets reported a lot, but for relatively minor offences that eventually results in a punishment, as opposed to a few reports for severe offences. That log, and what I know of the systems in place tell me that this is likely the case.\n\nUnfortunately this means that regular players like us on boards can't give you much more than generic context, since the specifics of your punishment are deeper than just the one log you have received in the reform card.\n\nI can only point you in the direction of Player Support for more context. False positives (or exaggerated positives) aren't unheard of, but they're hardly common either, so I'm not going to make any judgements either way. Support can provide you with older logs (the reform card logs are selected automatically from your most recent games, not necessarily from the best examples in cases like this) that may give you a better idea of why you are facing this.\n\nSome important things to note:\n\nPunishments follow a 4 tier progression **based on continued violations, rather than increase in severity** (with some exceptions like hate speech). It  doesn't matter if what netted you the 25 game chat restriction was worse (only a hypothetical, it comes up a lot), what matters is that you offended again.\n\n**Negative history counts for a lot.** To grossly oversimplify, assume you need 10 points to be punished. Hate speech or something like \"kys\" is far more often than not an instant 10. Your behaviour may be only a 1, but 10 games of that still results in the 10 points you need. Having previous punishments might drop the requirement to 8, because you've already been warned that the behaviour you are demonstrating isn't ok, and you have used up your \"everyone gets mad and frustrated sometimes\" leniency.\n\n**Support are *busy***. If you want specific or in depth answers, you will have to ask specific and in depth questions. If you ask a yes or no question you will get a yes or no answer. Don't just ask why you were punished, ask for examples from your recent logs, in particular, ask for report comments if there are any (and if support is willing to provide that), as they often offer valuable insight into just how your behaviour has affected other players.","replies":[{"poster":"Khalista Drogo","date":"2018-07-16T01:10:28.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"No no. See when you hand out a punishment and yes this is as far as I’m aware of the second time I’ve had a report on 5 years cause I’ve only had a warning the first time a few years back, but when it comes up telling me I’ve been banned with this chat log where I can’t see what was a bannable offence then it’s not my fault that the judiciary ban me for this chat log - if there was something more offensive then give me that chat log. This is not a bannable offence and it’s wrong.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-16T09:24:23.304+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Like I said, your case isn't as cut and dry as some, so much of what we can tell you as players (I am a volunteer, the only benefit I have is the coloured name, I don't have access to anything an actual Rioter does) is speculation based on cases we've seen before. I can speculate that your punishment resulted from more than just this one log, but that the automated system will only show you the most recent. I can also speculate that to be punished for this you likely get reported a lot, or that it was a false positive. \n\nUnfortunately that's all it is in the end: speculation. If you want more context you'll have to take it to support.

If you seek to appeal the ban and/or be provided with more chat logs showing the behaviour that has led up to the ban you should follow Sera's direction and submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\" option) and they will go through the process with you.\n\nSomething else to consider is that just because it's only the second time you've *seen* something happen as the result of a report doesn't mean you've only been reported twice. Believe it or not, there are (relatively new) systems in place to allow you to view some data about your report history, both received and submitted, all you need to do is contact Support using the \"I need help with account management, data requests, or deletion\" option (choose \"data request\" when it prompts you). This method will also give you all of your chat logs for the past several months (among other things), though it *does* take 30 days for the system to fulfil the requests.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Khalista Drogo","date":"2018-07-16T01:15:05.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Actually don’t worry about it.

It does not take into account any context, which makes anyone posting chat logs more guilty than they may otherwise be. This was one of the benefits of The Tribunal, you could see the context of people's conversations and be sure you are making a correct decision based on proper contextual evidence, especially if their game was a once off.\n\nIt also polices people's language to an extreme degree. It is not tiered and you can jump to a 14 or permanent suspension without going through chat bans. Unfortunately it nabs people who engage with banter, cruder jokes or saying the wrong words when venting, even in a team of friends. Riot has given guidelines on how not engaging in such behavior, but in my opinion this is why this is a game and not real life. In real life, there are times where you have to step up and defend yourself in situations where someone is being rude or bad mouthing you, rather than just being positive 100% of the time. Also both sides are taken into account, rather than one side and what they said.\n\nYou seem like a nice person, at least you can defend yourself and not sink down to unnecessary profanity. I'm sorry this happened to you.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-14T12:04:07.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want community feedback on a punishment then I'd recommend posting your chat logs.
