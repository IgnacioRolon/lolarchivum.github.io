When I double-click the icon to launch the launcher, nothing happens. No icon, nothing. The only way I've been able to actually play LoL at all is by re-installing the game every time I want to play.\r\n\r\nWindows 10 and drivers are all fully up-to-date, and I've googled and tried every solution I could find including this own forums \"common fixes\" page ( https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbPY3Rpr-experiencing-a-tech-problem-find-the-common-fixes-here )\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could be causing this or anyone know of a fix that will actually work?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-22T10:45:17.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit a ticket to player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf none of the common fixes worked they'll probably have to ask for logs or such to look deeper.","replies":[]}]}
