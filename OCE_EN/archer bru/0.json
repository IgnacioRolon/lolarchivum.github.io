I have sent a support ticket trying to appeal the ban but I was wondering if there is anything else I can do to help my case as I haven&#039;t been able to find much on the subject.  Any suggestions to prove that my account was hacked would be greatly appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"GURNHAWKs","date":"2016-09-30T09:10:53.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/YQ4IrvNq-morality-poll\n\nHave some votes and join the club, but make no mistake, this silly issue really should be addressed!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Renzcer","date":"2016-09-26T15:58:35.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got the same problem, latest reply I got from support seems like they're implying it's OUR fault for not keeping our details safe.\nBest of luck to us, it's not looking good.\n\nThere are other posts here with the same problem, Riot's f-ing up with their ability to keep accounts secure and doesn't seem they care much at all.","replies":[{"poster":"archer bru","date":"2016-09-27T01:19:48.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I sent a support ticket and they just said \"I hope you can see why it would be unsatisfying and frustrating to play against other players who are using a tool to tamper with the gameplay experience.\" which really doesn't help me at all, it feels like I'm talking to a brick wall rather than an actual person.
