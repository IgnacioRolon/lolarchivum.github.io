They played with no idea, clueless and what really put it out there was all of them running out to turret at the same time and doing everything simultaneously. The reminded me of robots i felt like i was watching a beginners Bots game. So my question is Who/What are they??? Is it Riot adding bots into it because of minimal players in the game mode??? Boosters??? And if so what do we as a community do about it?","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-04-28T05:37:39.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"first of all LOVE the name, and second of all there is nothing we can really do, its aran you can win a 4v5 if one person is botting then i guess its okay but like seriously what can the community do? nothing really.. Aram is just for fun and to try out different people, i personally don't have the same attitude towards Aram as i do with ranked or norms but like still its not fun having a bot on your team, ruins the game","replies":[{"poster":"12inches of love","date":"2015-04-28T05:53:41.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha thanks, and your right i guess it just really ticked me off seeing the whole opposing side was well Bot-like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ypan","date":"2017-10-15T16:55:58.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And this server is still full of bots now, bloody waste.

Not just one or two games ive seen them in, theyre in over 80% of games you can find on aram these days and its just a massive fucking PLAGUE. Riot gunna actually do anything with our reports here in oce or do i have to run into the same toxic people and the SAME game ruining bots. Also my best guess is the non policed justice system is the REASON they abuse specifically in OCE commonly. Because it is KNOWN that riot doesnt do a damn thing with the reports from oce. So bot farm in oce transfer to another server and sell? SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN. Rito pls. You just told me in a loading screen that the tribunal helps reform or remove toxic players, make your voice heard! Two guesses what i said next.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-05-12T04:52:06.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here are the current giveaways:\n\n1. They have no idea and just move forward attacking anything (especially minions), take turret aggro and die fast.\n2. They first buy boots and always take the snowball and ghost summoner spells.\n3. They don't talk or respond to pings, and never help a teammate.\n4. Their name is a double syllable of some random words e.g. LifeSaver, or FrozenHeart\n\nGood luck in ARAM! I won't be playing it anymore until this crop of bots are banned by riot. Ruins a fun game.\n\nP.S. I played a recent ARAM game, got handed Nocturne, never played before in my life, went 17-0-18 against bots. A good 20 minutes of my time wasted.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-11T23:46:38.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I beleive that Riot should have a Botting report in their after game thing. The amount of ARAM games ruined by bots on both teams is insane. One time I had a game and we had four bots in the game, two on each team. It was crazy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrozenFlame","date":"2015-05-11T23:33:19.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I've seen this once when queueing with a lower level friend. The player literally didn't use abilities. Face planted the enemy team. Didn't respond in chat. Had to be a bot.\n\nPerhaps Riot should add a \"Is bot character\" option when reporting and they can evaluate it on their end? I don't think Riot's that's putting them in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-04-29T05:20:25.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These scrubs are also Plaguing PvP vs AI.\nI have a list of them but I can't name and shame them.\nBut we should.\nThe consequences to the actions aren't valid or balanced.\nName and Shame works.\nthat way too if your in ranked and see a player that's a bot script user...you know they're a self centered waste of space, that's out for themselves not the team or the win.

BUT from lvl 1-30 u have no runes etc and have beginner teammates so it gets extremely boring extremely quickly as you literally have to spend a few days in game to get the account to lvl 30 so you can play ranked. SO people/websites have started making bots level up these accounts to lvl 30 so they can sell these accounts for money without having to do anything. Thee bot has all that ip to spend  on champs/runes/ what ever and all things necessary to play ranked..","replies":[]}]}
