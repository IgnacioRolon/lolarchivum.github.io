Seriously its not like oh im qq'ing this champ's op but seriously this champ has got too much loaded into his kit. His mana problems are nonexistant if he buys a flask, his damage is through the roof when he hits 2, he also even has cc in his ult which is just a fucking huge pain and he has more mobility than a yasuo being allowed to e through anything and everything. To top it off he's allowed to run untargettable against anybody and anything with his troll pole and he's not even that hard to play. Litterally. All you have to do is dash onto someone activate w then e away after aaing them twice and there's no retaliation from any champ whatsoever... It's completely ridiculous. It would be nice to see this stupid fish nerfed because seriously he's running around rampant too hard","replies":[{"poster":"Lily","date":"2014-12-21T08:44:05.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's what other people said, try not to give up early kills to fizz early game because he snowballs very hard. He scales well into the late game for an assassin because his early game is quite weak and needs a few core items ({{item:3100}} ,{{item:3157}} ) to get things going. \n\nOh yeah because fizz is melee, if you are a ranged champ you can punish him everytime he goes for a cs and zone him out. All I can say is fizz is one of those 50-50 champs that you either go good with him or complete bad in the game. \n\nThere should be plenty of guides out by now that can explain properly how to play against a fizz and I'd recommend you to have a look at them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2014-12-21T08:12:09.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wtf. u know how hard it is to get even one core item as fizz mid.  there is clearly reason why fizz dose so much dmg late game because hes early game sucks quiet a lot","replies":[]},{"poster":"jordanpatak41","date":"2014-12-21T07:44:59.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ori reks him","replies":[]},{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T04:52:51.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to see some mechanics changed about his Playful/Trickster. Yes, allow it to make him untargetable, but not invulnerable. That's just stupid, a part of play is to be able to time it correctly to negate as much damage/retaliation as possible. Right now, it can be used to cancel some champions' ults, save him from damage-over-time and make people waste summoner spells (if he's exhausted, he can just jump on the pole and wait out the duration). Basically, allow things which have locked onto Fizz before he jump still come into contact with him even if he jumps during it's travel-time (it's really frustrating how if he cancels your ability, **it still goes on cd because cd is set as you cast it, not when it hits**).\n\nAnd damn, that passive E almost makes him an AA-reliant APC. But that's for another day.\n\nOh yeah, his 'counter-play' is basically wait for him to not be able to use his abilities. That sort of counter-play is really boring to play against, and rare to come across in blind-pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-21T04:16:03.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give people the ability to dodge right before getting bitten on the arse then it's all good.\n\nAnd something has to be done with troll pole tbh, need more counterplay options I say.

Same can be said for nearly every champion, except it affects Fizz harder.\n\nTo counter Fizz, play Annie or Syndra and poke the hell out of him pre 6 even if he went flask.
