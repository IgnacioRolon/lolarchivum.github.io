I know I make mistakes even just small ones that can cost me games but I really want to put an end to that I have been playing League since season 3 and have peaked Gold 3 on OCE in Season 7 but finished Gold 5 0-13LP so a big drop.\r\n\r\nI used to main Jungle (kha&#039;zix) however after the recent changes to scuttle I seem to perform better in the Mid-Top Lane with a new champ pool consisting of Talon/Akali (the main 2) however with Garen and Kat on the side.\r\n\r\nI am essentially looking for a long term coach someone who is willing to look over my games and give me homework to work on to improve someone who can take me under their wing and coach me so that I may reach the big boy table because honestly I hate silver elo I currently and sitting on S1 18LP or something have reach gold promos twice I believe and both times dropped to silver 2 just to climb back into the promos and drop to silver 2 again.\r\n\r\nI play these champions because I find them easy to snowball with and with the mobility they have helps me with roaming because if I were to spot 1 of my weakness or mistakes it would be CS (early) I tend to take bad trades but get good CS or take good trades but lose so much CS. winning or losing lane I would say I am on a 50/50 scale depending on the match up however most of the time I win my lane by roaming to gain a lead to snowball my lane and increase that lead into other lanes and eventually take out the game. However that is all easy said on paper but doing it and finding out what I should be doing or shouldn&#039;t be doing is a lot harder for me while in game.\r\n\r\nI am looking for someone who would be interested in watching over my replays as mentioned and even a live game or 2. I really want to climb I don&#039;t believe I deserve a higher rank than what I have currently I have played in plat 4-3 elo and I have been able to manage consistent damage and map awareness including winning the games however I don&#039;t think I deserve that elo not yet but it does make me wonder why I can control myself in that elo but not my own.\r\n\r\nif you think you can help me whether you want to be my long term or even if you are just bored right now and think this might be fun just to look over 1 or 2 games or even a live game I am online now so please add me in game my name is DropK&icirc;ck (it is a special i the alt key is 0238).\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and have a nice day.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-06-02T07:47:27.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your transition from jgl to other lanes mean you are starting from scratch at those roles. Your cs is quite bad on akali and talon, and dps overal is 3rd consistenly. From here i can tell - You are weak at laning phase; Either get put behind too often, or roam incorrectly and lose cs. The thing am confuse about is. You said you main jgl before. Just because scuttle got change you swap role? Stick to 1-2roles and master it. Stop playing all over the place. \n\nYou need a successful mindset. A master craftmen continuously hone his art. Not switch focus when he feel like he suck. You've pointed out that you're making bad trades and losing lane control because of it. I'd say, that is due to your lack of exprience on the champ you are playing into certain match up. I would advice you to stick to 2 roles, and main 2champs for those role.","replies":[{"poster":"OCE VortexDragon","date":"2018-06-04T04:27:43.549+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreeable in the sense that you should stick to a role and champion and master it however there is one thing i'll frown upon. The lack of skill on champions don't necessarily help improve cs, trades and lane control. Rather the inexperience to laning. In the old jungle meta, trades, cs and lane control didn't exist so rather he does not know how to lane than how to play the champions.{{champion:240}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lexhanatin","date":"2018-06-06T10:36:45.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reducing the variance by playing other champions simplifies laning too.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lexhanatin","date":"2018-06-03T04:51:06.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice post, i agree with everything you say except for 1 thing.\nid rather say 1 role 1 champ\necks dee","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"OCE VortexDragon","date":"2018-06-04T04:16:41.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are playing top lane after transitioning from jungle a main focus you need to learn quickly and master efficiently is lane dominance. E.g. Splitpushing, Lane Pressure, Set-ups. One main thing to know is that assassins perform horribly in top lane and currently bruisers have been dominating the meta. I recommend burst bruisers that can easily tank and have high engage and set-ups especially for ganks. For example, a good bruiser would be somebody like kled (This may be biased as i main him). His kit makes him highly versatile and has one of the greatest abilities to achieve lane domination. As conqueror is broken right now, i suggest picking up bruisers. Back to the topic at hand, lets say i'm playing kled, the first thing i'll likely do is scout my opponent. If i am facing a tank or another bruiser-i will aggressively play a level one all in. If i'm facing a ranged ap champ for example-i'll play more safely and wait till a more viable time like lv3 to engage. The next thing i take aware of is timing and map awareness. Ganks and ability cooldowns are a great double edge sword. You're vulnerable to ganks and you need to have a keen awareness of your cooldowns as this is the main way you can get kills or avoid getting killed. However, a many jungler start red you will likely can early ganks. However, don't have too high of hopes, solo laning is perhaps the main part of top lane. Therefore, you need high versatility and need to be ready for anything, from getting camped and having no counterganks or perhaps a rogue teemo top or a lane swap.\nTips and tricks:\n1. Roaming is vital but lane pressure must be achieved prior to roams. This means you should focus on towers and your lane before going mid or counter jungling enemy jungle.\n2. Safe yet aggressive. Skills are key. This means you should play passively (most times) but go in for trades you can win. Take a keen awareness to enemy skills and spells cd and use that to your advantage when trading.\n3. All in or not. If you have committed, keep committing, no point going in and trying to run away when you see a jungler. You may get a kill out of an all in and that's worth it or even spells. Top is a long lane and you don't usually have great mobility nor a sup to help peel you.\n4. Don't be a pussy. Seriously. Don't. You're the top laner, tanky, damagey, holding down enemies champion. Dive with your jungler or mid (when you roam) you would survive.\n5. TP. Bot, Bot, Bot. You can switch a gank from the enemy jungler into a triple kill for you, you just need a good eye. But, don't tp if:\na) You're top tower getting destroyed.\nb) You won't win the bot fight or you wont get kills, dragon or towers bot.\nc) You're bot and/or jungler is losing hard.\nd) You're laner is ahead and has tp.\n6. Know when to split or group. TP allows you to split better or group better. It is a guardian angel to not having your team get thrashed to badly and is generous to mistakes. However, if you don't have tp, here are some things you need to take aware of:\na) Objectives up-Baron, Dragon, Rift, etc. If your team is there or close, go to them or a near lane.\nb) Objective pressure-If your team is getting dragon of baron, either help or pressure a far lane (top if team taking dragon, of bot if team taking baron).\nc) Heavy team fights-Team fights are a make or break part of the game. If a team fights about to break out, help your team. It's way more worth to win a team fight then get a inhib and get aced.\n7. Know your environment. Be aware if your in inevitable danger of a gank or gangbang. Be prepared for a zac jumping out a bush or a twitch appearing from nowhere. Ward up and know enemy jungle path (You were a jungle main you should excel in this). Look at your team's lane a see if any enemy is missing or if their overextended to much so you can roam.\n8. Minions. Farming is obvious and important. But minion control is more vital. Enemy backing? Push wave and back or roam. Deny and starve your lane opponent to dominate the map with top lane pressure with tp and good roams. Make sure the enemy laner cannot keep pace with you in both laning and global pressure. This is achieved only through minions. The denial of exp and gold and the wave controlled so that you don't miss out on farm yourself.\n\nI hope these tips helped anybody who need help in top.\n\n{{champion:240}} \"CHARRRRRRRGE!\"\n\nOCE VortexDragon{{champion:136}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lexhanatin","date":"2018-06-03T04:47:42.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I used to main Jungle (kha'zix) however after the recent changes to scuttle I seem to perform better in the Mid-Top Lane with a new champ pool consisting of Talon/Akali (the main 2) however with Garen and Kat on the side.\n\nI disagree with changing roles/champions. You're switching from one discipline to another which results in the majority of work invested in the initial discipline going to waste. You've played 314 ranked games total this season so far. 68 games as khazix.\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nUmm... is my math right? Somebody check...\n\n(68/314) * 100 = 21%\n21% of your total games is your main champ.\n\nDoublechecking math\n\n314/100 = 3.14 (1%)\n3.14 * 21% = 66\n66 is close enough to 68 given my roundings.\n\nThat's actually fucked... I am convinced there is no better word to describe this.\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n\nYou need to play more more games as one champion. I'm not gonna offer to watch any games due to the large variance in your champion pool. You're focusing on talon now, before that it was akali, before that it was random for over 10 games, before that it was akali, before that it was random, before that it was leblanc, before that it was galio...\n\nFocusing on one champion limits your scope. There is a small problem with this; it decreases the number of options you have to achieve success (win conditions etc). Playing more champions increases the number of options you have to achieve success, but you better know every single option and when they're relevant to each game.\n\nI'm not gonna go any further with a focus on you.\n\nWe use terms like win rate, cs, kda, rank, mmr, damage dealt... The list goes on. These are important statistics that measure the success of a player/team in a given game. However I don't believe these are important metrics to measure the potential of being successful in league of legends.\n\nI've been focusing on learning my ekko matchups in mid, and I've gotten to the point where I dodge every game I don't get ekko mid. I have a spreadsheet of every champion I've vsed as ekko with notes which I refine after I find something new to add. With this I feel comfortable going into the common matchups, and my overall game knowledge has increased dramatically in the past 2 months. This doesn't mean i still win every game, or even play the match ups effectively. I make mistakes even though I clearly know what the right decision is.\n\nThe question then becomes: \"Why did I make that mistake?\".\nI was too greedy for CS, I was too desperate to influence the map, I assumed kogmaw would rotate without looking at the map. These are some of the answers I've come up with recently to some of the questions I ask myself.\n\nThis allows me to use different metrics to assess my games. Did I play the match up effectively? Did I apply the correct map pressure? Did I focus the right targets in team fights? ...\n\nThere is a thought I had which I don't know where to place. It is the thought that sparked all this. Did I learn anything from that game? We invest so much time trying to win and cry when we don't. Maybe it's time to stop focusing on winning games, and instead focus on trying to learn?\n\nI don't know if any of this is right. I'm just a shitty gold ekko main.","replies":[]}]}
