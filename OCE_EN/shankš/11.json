I want to get better I want to improve and I want to be able to reach plat and even higher.\r\n\r\nProblem is I don&#039;t know what else to do.. I have been maining Kayn and Kha and I have gone from a 80% Win rate on Kayn to 55% and I don&#039;t want to blame my team but it has me thinking if I deserve to be silver and I know things about the game like not to contest a 1v1 when they have 3 levels on you and their power spike for example like I don&#039;t know maybe as a jungler I could do more yes I under perform at times but there are games when I just don&#039;t and then I have a bot lane with 11 deaths at 7 minutes while i&#039;m being invaded yet I cna mange to break even I just don&#039;t know what to do I want to stop having these games with trolls so to speak but I don&#039;t think that will ever happen so what can I do to improve to carry enough so that they ain&#039;t as heavy. even games where I am carrying the game then goes into late and the enemy mord or jax just ends up 1v9 how can I get to 1v9? \r\n\r\nCan someone please help me if you want please add me in game my name is Shank&scaron; (to get that s its alt 0154) please has to be someone out their who can offer advice or give me so 1 on 1 tips to actually be able to carry it.","replies":[{"poster":"57chev","date":"2019-01-01T02:15:01.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick scan of the op.gg reveals that you have been duoing with a silver, quit that. Then teams will be better.\nAlso you seem to die a lot, work on that. Think before helping people that start a silly fight over nothing, sometimes its better to just let them die.\nAs Kayn, until you transform you are weakish, so work on that.\nWatch some jungle streamers (e.g. Shernfire) to get tips.","replies":[]}]}
