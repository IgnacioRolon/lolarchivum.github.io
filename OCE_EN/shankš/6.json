Also try Jax, he fits your jng pool play style and is quite strong atm, other than that","replies":[]},{"poster":"1T 1T 1T 1T 1T","date":"2018-02-14T10:16:34.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can help you out with Counter Jungling if you want, I main Mundo and I got to plat 3 using him.\n1t 1t 1t 1t 1t","replies":[]}]}
