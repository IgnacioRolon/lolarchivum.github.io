For changing roles it's easy to say you become the win condition, but to act it out is entirely different. \nI'll try to focus on the role jungle, normally the role of the jungle would be to \"control\" the jungle, this can be camps, vision, pressuring lanes etc. I'm assuming you don't know about these advanced tools and you want objectives/kills. That's the first issue. Reasoning is people look at objectives and kills and think \"we got that, we're ahead\", but there's more advanced things such as understanding the opponents jungler clear path, which laners are stronger, item power spikes etc.\nReasoning to know this is it allows you to pressure the opponents jungle and jungler and play to a certain side of the map (losing or winning). In doing this you basically can control the map. With this control, you can transfer it onto lanes, so understanding lane match ups is the next in line. The reasoning you want this control is it allows you to pressure the correct lane with the lead you have. So assuming you have a certain amount of control in the game (since you state you get ahead early but lose it later), you can use the winning/pressuring lane to control that side of the map (let's say you have a strong bot lane you can help snowball). Then you can keep using that bot lane to pressure deeper into the enemy jungle and towers (assuming you don't lose skirmishes with them, this can become quite elaborate and very situational).\n\nPersonally this way you control the waves (lanes) and in doing so you basically control the map. Because in theory, the enemy shouldn't be fighting you if they have waves pushing into their tower, if they do \"try\" to fight (they ignore the wave and go to the objective or they have a person farming the wave while you have people around the objective making it a 5v4), they basically lose waves of farm.\nThis all should be done around neutral objectives (buffs, dragons, baron). This can be enabled with pinks and sweepers. This can also be used on towers, but know this, fighting under the enemy tower is risky.\n\nThen you can repeat and you slowly gain a gold lead (team wise). Let's say they do fight you guys, you should be having the advantage, because they're pathing into \"fog of war\", and in doing so you have the first move (basically camp a bush with pink, they face check you kill). With the kill it gives baron, with baron gives lane control (waves) and use this to pressure towers, because waves will be crashing into the tower and causing chip damage. Or you can siege towers and they just give it up easily.\n\nThere's a lot more into this than just that, it's really situational and depending on champions, the state of the game, who's ahead etc.\nTo be simple controlling waves with your laners and looking for vision on a side of the jungle enables you to help your lanes, understand here the enemy jungler is. Then use this information to use the numbers advantage to get objectives, zone enemies from towers etc.\nOnce you learn more about the basics, you can apply more advanced stuff and understand other ways of snowballing/using your map to your advantage.\nGood luck in your games and with your new role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T16:30:52.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrote this in another post\n\nA brief list of win conditions in no particular order;\n\n1.3 inhibs\n2. 2 inhibs + baron\n3. 1 inhib + 2nd baron (2nd baron is very strong)\n4.

If you push and there is no pressure you will be collapsed on every single time. This is harder than it looks because the trinket system in this game literally was the start of riot taking community advice and then doing their own thing. Your 1 red and your 2 stealth or 1 blue are no where near enough to keep your self save when pushing your own advantage vs your team. The only advice I can give is ask your support to help you ward top or bot with you and play mind games with your advantage till you either get your 1v1 orget the enemy so out of position your team can win. Hope that makes sense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-02-27T23:44:34.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What helped me with this was a Pant are Dragon video from a while ago where he broke down his macro decisions, and how that along with rotations allowed him to get a 15 minute inhibator. I have also seen others recommend this as a good example of learning macro.\n\nHere is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-zcSGHcqtk\n\nIgnoring the cringey title and intro, the rest of the content is very good, and demonstrates how to transfer a lead into a win through macro alone (since there weren't many kills in the game).\n\nI hope this helps :)\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Smurphy101","date":"2018-02-27T21:31:45.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't focus so much on the objectives like drakes and such if you have a lead and can push a lane or get another lane fed. abuse your lead. Counter jg and leave your jg for your adc to farm, basically you want to tilt the enemy as much as you can and the best way to do so is by farming their jg out of the game or just straight up abusing a lane with your presence. I prefer to get my mid laner fed providing that they know what to do with a lead, like roaming and helping the bot lane or counter jgling themselves. Dont focus on helping a lane that is losing, just get the other lane/s fed and carry the one behind!","replies":[{"poster":"Shankš","date":"2018-02-27T22:31:20.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Essentially that is what I do I am never not countering the enemy jungler, I hang around top if I pull off a gank when I know the top laner is going to use TP and then I kill them again.
