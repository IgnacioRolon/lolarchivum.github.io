I have the same problem as you, I was gold last season but currently hard stuck in silver 4. So I observed many other players matched with me and I realized that no one can actually climb up. Most players only have around a 48% win rate. Even some good ones: they had a 70% win rate on a specific champion in their first 30 games of the season,  but they start losing games as a couple of patches come out. \n\nBecause Riot has reduced the chance of soloing carrying in recent seasons, individual players have a much small impact on the game than previous years. So the outcome of our game heavily relies on our team's performance. For instance, you are playing ranked with your trusted Kayn. And you successfully make a very good start. The team is ahead and some of you are fat. This is due to your hard work and you definitely deserve the win if the game ends at the point. However, Riot decideds to put 3 players with a 45% win rate who have zero knowledge of the game to balance your 60% win rate Kayn. They just keep throwing with a bounty gold, never listen to your Pings or refuse to group up for objectives, etc. The other team will eventually make the gold even. Beyond this point, the only chance you have is to play around the fifth player and hopefully, he picks a late-game carry and he's good at it. Otherwise, it's a big GG. \n\nApparently, this problem causes huge frustration in the league community. Because they know that they cannot self carry the game so they begin to give up, to flame the worst player in their team (fight in chat) or they simply just go AFK when the team is behind. This is a huge vicious spiral right now, in this game. Players lose games with good performance, they get frustrated and toxic. Players get toxic, they lose more games. I've been playing ranked in recent weeks. But I lose a lot of winnable games purely because the team gives up after just a few mistakes. Solo laner blames their jungler after getting soloed... Support and ADC are fighting each other because they target the enemy support in a 2v2 bot lane fight... By the time I was ahead and trying my best to help the team. But I see someone just guards the shop meanwhile two others stay under turret with their both hands on the keyboard. \n\nThe League of Legends urgently needs a better matchmaking system and a better disciplinary system. The current punishment system is either too weak or too tough: no punishment at all or a straight 14 days ban. Please Riot, you make it a better game by just spending 30% of your attention from creating those money-making skins or overpowered new champions. Last time someone in my game told me that in the Chinese server, each player has their own credit point. They lose credit points whenever they behave disruptively, and this keeps these trolls/inters/AFKer away from ranked games. If this is a real thing why can't we have one in this server :(  Just disable their ranked game for a short period to cool them off. \n\nI know some players from high ELO (diamond - challenger in the past) stop playing this game from season 10. Even someone played high school tournament begins to play games on Steam. Surely this game would lose all of its players if there is no change. For this player here, Shankš. Why don't you switch to another game until the environment becomes player-friendly.","replies":[{"poster":"enose","date":"2020-03-02T10:53:07.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop playing it in s9, too many trolls in my game{{sticker:sg-ahri-1}}","replies":[]}]}]}
