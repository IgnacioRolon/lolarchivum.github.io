I don&#039;t know how to do this every game and I get that with time it will come but it only will come if I know what i&#039;m basically looking for so part 2 question is there a formula that is like a guide line for example if you&#039;re vsing a burst mage such as syndra would there be a guideline to just follow until it all falls into place etc? \r\n\r\nAnd another question about CS/Trading. Again another one that comes with time I don&#039;t expect to just improve over night but I need to know what to look for to improve basically my question is I can punish the laner for going for that cs by the bare minimum of throwing an auto or even better a Q (using Cass again as example) and get some poke on them thats fine but if I do that I feel as though I lose out as some times I just don&#039;t manage to hit my own creep and secure the gold but they do. Sure they lose some health and I get a health lead but then I guess my question becomes what do I do with a health lead how can I abuse that? Should I just let him push and ask for a gank? \r\n\r\nAnyway if anyone wants to leave their 2 cents that would be appreciated i&#039;m doing my best to try and climb as I want to earn my rank but I don&#039;t want to be stuck in Silver/Gold for another season so any and all help would be good even if you would like to sit down with me and go over a replay with me to tell me what I could or done and help me set out what my gameplan should of been that way I can get a better explanation etc if that is something you have time for and would like to do please add me Shank&scaron; (to get the &scaron; its ALT 0154)\r\n\r\nThank you again for any help","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-02T00:11:24.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur win condition in solo q is maximise ur gold farmed and collapse in team fights if ur contribution will be above threshold to win the fight, after that take objectives. barron at 20-25 minutes. ending by 30","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-02T00:12:21.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"learn to farm, league players are garbage trash in that regard. heroes of newerth 2010-2011 taught me to farm in moba.\ndota 2007-2009 taught me to be good in terms of team orientation, playing in 5s exclusively with mates. whats left in lol are bads","replies":[{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-12T14:56:41.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"demigod taught me to solo carry","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-05T19:48:08.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you want value maximising behaivour so that comes down to your ability to quantitatively choose a superior choice out of the decisions you have available to you. and this should be reverse engineered from your final praxeology(ical goals aims ends ambitions). \n\nso to deliniate:\n1. kill nexus is win condition\n2. asset map superiority-dominance (vision, wards, objectives, strategy &amp; coordination)\n3. kill enemy champions\n4. farm npc's\n5. dont die\n\nso start at 5 and work your way up as appropriate. if you run into some issues (better to predict proactively and apriori then experience post), go back down a peg","replies":[]}]}
