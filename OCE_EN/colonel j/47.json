Spears deal far too much damage and counter harassing is nullified by aegis.\r\n- A global teleport that does stupid amounts of damage and ensures a kill at level 6, every time.\r\n- Impossible to stop from snowballing, and then impossible to 1v1 if hes anything more than 1 level higher than you\r\n- Does a burst aoe for over 60% of most champions hit points which is not dodge-able without summoner spells.\r\n- Impossible to run away from\r\n\r\nIts really plain rediculous. He is beyond S-tier in so many ways, and in the hands a competent player literally breaks the game. No hero stands a chance versus pantheon in the laning phase, and if they want to get xp they will probably have to give up first blood, essentially losing the game bc massive snowball via global tp.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-03-10T06:31:44.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he's so broken why aren't you playing him every game and getting freelo?","replies":[{"poster":"Colonel J","date":"2017-03-11T08:32:56.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Arkangyle,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=6V2ifbsA,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-10T06:31:44.374+0000)\n>\n> If he&#x27;s so broken why aren&#x27;t you playing him every game and getting freelo?\n\nI'm an Urgot main.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Affiliation","date":"2017-03-09T11:27:36.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. He is very prone to being ganked. He is a glass cannon and offers very little defence besides a stun and auto-attack block.\n2. Falls off after 20 minute mark.\n3. Can be countered in game with combo-based champions like Ryze, and turret hugging simply stops him from getting solo kills\n4. His ultimate is very readable; it can also be countered easily with a flash. You can capitalise on this by shoving your lane and making him lose significant amounts of gold/xp.\n\nLook at high elo games, Pantheon gets blown up and out-maneuvered quite often and easily.","replies":[]}]}
