(Or \"climate change\" whatever you liberals are calling it.)\n\nYou see, the Earth often cycles between colder and hotter times during it's time in the universe. There is a reason why Earth has had several ice ages for example. It's cyclical.\n\nIt is very silly how we can't predict the weather accurately for past 2 weeks, but people are predicting the weather beyond two decades.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0QBbTxU.jpg\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy\n\nThis is of course not an excuse to pollute the environment. We do not want dead fish in the ocean, the extinction of specieis, or terrible air quality like some parts of China where they actually have to buy Canadian air.\n\nIn America, and some other countries I'm sure, some scientists science groups WILL NOT receive government funding unless they approve/agree on climate change. How does this make sense? It's a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWe've been tracking Earth's temperature for less than 200 years, not even .01% of Earths life, yet we're making all these conclusions of Earth's future. 200 is a small sample size when compared to Earth's age, no?
