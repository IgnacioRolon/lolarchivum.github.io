I suggest you delete that image and the person's summoner name.\n\nI'm not too sure what Riot's stance is on discriminating who's playing the game and who's not based on their personal preferences but if you truly believe that this person is endangering the lives/sanctity of innocents then you should call the police. Of course, they'd probably ask you for more information than just \"their user name on a video-game\".\n\nYou can send in a support ticket to Riot about this, requesting for more information *or* just explaining your concern and see if they'll get the police involved.\n\nPaedophilia is illegal, but you don't have any real proof, do you?
