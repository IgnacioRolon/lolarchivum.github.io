The &quot;Shadow Marked&quot; one is obviously Zed. I thought the &quot;Ethereal Flames&quot; one was Kayle because of the protector line although I&#039;m not sure since it says she stands alone and Kayle is with Demacia, although I can&#039;t say it&#039;s Leona since she also trys to protect others (not alone, shes with who she protects)  and the &quot;Weaves,unweaves&quot; one Shen because of the blade dancing and the one vision ( his ult is Stand United). I&#039;m unsure about the &quot;Piercing Flame&quot; and the unknown one.","replies":[{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2015-08-19T08:24:51.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No there are actually 6 of them unknown one is yasuos brother .

But Riot did it to Yasuo so maybe.","replies":[]}]}]}
