Despite this, I didn&#039;t care much for it but yesterday and today it got worse. It would&#039;t work  at all. I could hear the sound but nothing happened, and I&#039;ve tried redownloading, deleting lol_patcher and lol_airclient and I&#039;ve tried changing DNS. I couldn&#039;t even repair and when I did nothing happened. Any help would be great but I&#039;d like to fix this before the Captain Gangplank skin leaves and the mystery OPL skin comes.
