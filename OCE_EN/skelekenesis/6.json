I&#039;ve tried practically everything and nothing works. I tried repairing, but it doesnt do anything. When I force a re-patch the EULA pops up twice and I don&#039;t recieve the terms and conditions. I&#039;m currently hoping the repatch magically works, but any suggestions on how to fix this would be nice. Thanks!","replies":[]}
