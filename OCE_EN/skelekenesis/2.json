I thought &quot;assistant scientist&quot; would fit him seeing as his parents were scientists. He could have a ripped lab coat and glasses resembling goggles or Raybands and thats all you&#039;d need. For his passive, his clothes could drop down and go back to him with green spots if he manages to revive. I don&#039;t have any splash art for this though.","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-04-09T06:37:58.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"heh heh sounds not bad indeed also {{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[{"poster":"Skelekenesis","date":"2015-04-10T12:35:21.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed he is.
