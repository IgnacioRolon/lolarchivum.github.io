A .5 second channel is long enough for players to make it out of the stun/damage range, while still letting Annie Flash and summon Tibbers to catch out the enemy team.\n2) Make her abilities decrease in damage when her ult is active. This means that instead of 2 thornmails and 2 pyromaniacs fighting you, it&#039;ll be 1 1/2 thornmails and 1 1/2 pyromaniacs.\n\nJust my two cents on how to balance Annie.","replies":[]}
