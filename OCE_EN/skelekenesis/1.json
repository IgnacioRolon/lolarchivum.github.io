But one king never had a chance. After Jarvan Lightshield&#039;s death, the Kingdom of Demacia was in ruins, waiting for a new king to ascend. Hypnos, the son of Jarvan was not the most likely candidate, but Noxus did not take chances. During the peak of midnight, Hypnos was captured and sent into hiding within Noxian territory. Cursed by the call of the crow, he was destined to never wake again. But the rooster crows as it pleases.\n\nAppearance:\nHe should look around Annie&#039;s age or younger, not ageing since he was cursed, being a little shorter than Annie. Kind of like male Kana from FE: Fates. His hair is pure white, wearing a crown resembling a small golden diadem. His armour should be like Garen, just smaller. His weapon is a golden falchion.  \n\nAbilities:\n[P] _Drowsiness_\nWhen ally champions near Hypnos are affected by crowd control, he cuts the duration by a quarter and gains a stack of _Drowsiness_. This slows Hypnos&#039; movement speed and attack speed by 35% for 3 seconds, but increases his health regeneration (10% AP ratio) and mana regeneration (10% max health). \n\n[Q]_Starry Night_ 70/80/90/100/110 Mana 28/24/18/16/12 seconds\nHypnos enchants his falchion, empowering his next auto attack. If he hits an enemy, it spreads across to nearby enemies (quicker depending on his attack speed) dealing 20/50/70/90/110 magic damage (60% AP ratio) and stops, applying **Sweet Dreams** to affected enemies.\n**Sweet Dreams** gives increased regeneration to **Sleeping** targets, but increases the duration of **Sleeping** and take 50% extra damage while **Sleeping**. If an enemy with **Sweet Dreams** is hit while **Sleeping** they gain **Nightmare**, which deals 35 magic damage (10% AP ratio) over time while asleep, but cuts the duration by half.\n\n[W]_Contagious Yawn_ 50/60/65/75/80 Mana 22/20/18/16/14 seconds\nHypnos yawns loudly in an expanding radius, and after 1 second, all enemies inside of his range are **Yawning**, which causes them to be slowed by 20% but gain 50% damage reduction. If they stay inside his range for another 2 seconds, they start **Sleeping**.\n\n[E]_Insomniac_ 70/90/90/90/95 Mana 26/24/20/18/18 seconds\nHypnos focuses on staying awake for three seconds, becoming immune to crowd control effects and gains 50% bonus movement and attack speed, but becoming unable to cast any abilities other than [Q] _Starry Night_. After this, he gains a stack of _Drowsiness_.\n\n[R]_Malevolent Lullaby_ 100/125/150 Mana 130/110/90 seconds\nHypnos casts a large spell, which puts himself and all nearby enemies to sleep for 4/5/7 seconds. **Sleeping** enemies gain 40% mana and health regeneration, which stops when hit. If Hypnos casts _Insomniac_ while **Sleeping**, he gains a stack of _Drowsiness_. Allied champions within his range gain increased health and mana regeneration if not in combat, based on their current regeneration (their health regeneration is added to their mana regeneration and vice versa).\n\n(his [Q] applies on-hit effects, but is counted as neither ranged or melee)\n\nSkin Design; Bedtime Hypnos\nBasically just in an oversized wizard&#039;s robe with stars on it and a night cap, with a magic wand with a star on the top instead of a sword. Give him sparkles for special effects and he&#039;s good.\n\nThe lore needs a lot of fixing, but the main premise is that he should have been the king but Swain captured and cursed him to fall asleep forever, but he wakes up from the chaos of the Crystal Scar and the Summoner&#039;s Rift. \n\nHis play-style as a top laner would be focused on applying pressure. He&#039;s pretty versatile, dealing consistent magic damage, while being tanky enough to sustain hits. He can stay top lane and farm/take turrets, but when times get tough, he can cast [W] to slow then sleep, and [E] to run and protect himself. When he&#039;s done with his farming, his team fights as a mage would be great. Charging his [W] puts his opponents to sleep, preparing for his [Q] into his [R]. This deals damage over time while applying CC for the DPS and mid laner to execute targets. A basic build would be Liandry&#039;s, Iceborn, any boots, Deadman&#039;s, Nashors and a Spirit Visage.\n\nAs a support, he has amazing CC and defence for his ADC. His passive gives leeway to engaging ruthlessly without having to worry about  being caught for long. He would build similarly to an Alistar, as he covers the same role as a support. His ADC can push bot freely, but overextending is bad for him, not having a real dash or escape.\n\nAs a mid, he deals sustained damage. He can live for long periods of time even without tank items or stats. He would just be a generic AP mid laner, but his kit focuses more on utility rather than damage, so he can deal damage while his opponent is stuck, and set up for ganks with his [W] and [R]. A generic build for him would be Nashors, Rylai&#039;s, Liandry&#039;s, Sorcerers, Rabadon&#039;s and a Lich Bane.\n\nSome of his details are a bit rushed, but I&#039;d take any feedback.

Good passive, but maybe cut a quarter off, not half, so it's balanced.\n\nQ is good too, not too much damage and still is helpful, maybe needs a chunky cooldown though.\n\nW is an amazing idea, which gives them a loos and a gain, unless they stay, which is good.\n\nE is great too, and is good to get away from things like karthus wall, stuff like that.\n\nR is a good idea, but if used at the wrong time can be like a zhonyas that heals for the enemies.\n\n\nI like what you've done here, and could be great champion if played right, but if played wrong, RIP.\n\n\n\n:D","replies":[]}]}
