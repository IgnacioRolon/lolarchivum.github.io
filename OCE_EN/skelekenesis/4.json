I'd definitely suggest you get in touch with the Player Support team if you haven't already.\n\nThe article you linked is on the right track, but if it doesn't work, You could also try out [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).
