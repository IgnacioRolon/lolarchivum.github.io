I feel there should also be the same system just the fact you can practice a siren roll before playing in ranked so they you do not upset other players playing ranked if your not good at a champ or the roll you selected. I have found that if its mid or top there is always fights and q leavers because they don&#039;t get that spot or champ they would like to practice or learn. Could there be a though in adding it in there as well?","replies":[{"poster":"mosguinz","date":"2016-10-19T05:02:50.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was Team Builder queue, but Riot killed it since not a lot of people used it.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=darthpav,realm=OCE,application-id=PpTM71nT,discussion-id=kyJGooba,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-16T04:39:35.191+0000)\n>\n> I have been wondering for a while now as to why isn&amp;#039;t there a pre section spot in normal games like there is in ranked.\n\nNormal Draft is what I think you are referring to.

Riot also stated that: \"In an ideal world, weâ€™d like to retire normal draft in all regions.\"\n\nLink to Riot's post [here](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/how-rank-2017-season).\n\n{{champion:17}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}
