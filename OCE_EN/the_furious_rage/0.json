I&#039;ve always been casual though, and it used to be I would win keys and chests and get occasional goodies.  Recently I haven&#039;t been getting chests.  I was looking up the prereq&#039;s, and it says S only in premade matchups.  I always play solo queue.   I have 12 keys right now and haven&#039;t gotten a chest in what seems like ages.\r\n\r\nSo I have a couple questions with probably simple answers and one comment:\r\n\r\nCan you not get chests for solo Q? \r\nIf you get an S and a mastery token(I have several I&#039;m working on), do you get the mastery token instead of the chest?  Or do you get both?\r\n\r\n\r\nComment:\r\nIt&#039;s a weird workaround to get blue essence for mastery levels.  There should be a way to sell or trade these things you earn. Couldn&#039;t there be a trade system where you can just trade orange for blue, or keys for blue essence, or buy a chest with extra orange essence, etc etc?","replies":[{"poster":"Azaeal","date":"2017-10-21T22:38:53.814+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests are awarded for gaining an S- or above with a champion in any queue that awards mastery points.\n\nYou do *not* need to be in a premade, but playing with a premade allows you to gain chests if you did not gain an S- or above, as long as one of your premade buddies did for their champion.\n\nYou may only receive one chest per champion, per season. This ensures players must branch out and learn other champions. (Or, at the least, have a premade get an S while you are playing a different champion)\n\nIf you get an S- or above, you get both the chest and mastery token (Assuming you are eligible for both.)\n\nIn regards to the Blue Essence, don't worry. This next preseason will change all IP to Blue Essence, and you can use it for all things that IP **and** Blue Essence are used for currently.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-10-23T08:16:32.690+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chests are also limited by time :) A casual player will likely never notice, but you can earn one chest per week and they stack up to four if you donâ€™t earn one for a while.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-10-22T23:21:36.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Immortal Pie,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=ApXlEU5e,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-10-21T22:38:53.814+0000)\n> \n> You may only receive one chest per champion, per season. \n\n^this.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Time Criminal","date":"2017-10-21T13:43:32.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can only get one chest per champion every month I think, and a total of 4 in a month.
