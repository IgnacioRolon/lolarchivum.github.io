Solo/Duo + Flex.\r\nWhilst I understand why we have split the queue types, I question whether this is a good idea on a relatively low population server like OCE\r\n\r\nWhat I have been noticing a lot recently is players being autofilled. It seems like in a majority of games someone is being autofilled into a role they don&#039;t want to/know how to play. This seriously diminishes game quality as it leads to onesided matchups. Surely part of this problem is due to the player base being split over 2 separate queues.\r\n\r\nIs it really worth having two queue types on OCE if it means more people being autofilled? Should a smaller server like OCE switch back to a single queue system?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-25T05:17:48.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[Today's flex queue at 4pm.](http://imgur.com/a/XtLV3)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SeventhZenith","date":"2017-01-20T13:09:44.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's my question. Would people rather a single queue with all players, including premades and solos (Like last season), or would they prefer to have the current system with the cost being more frequent autofill?","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-22T11:02:32.906+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just have soloqueue and that's it. No bulldust matchmaking (like silvers+golds vs bronzers five games in a row) or [queues like these](http://imgur.com/a/woSqi) (no that's not an exaggeration, and OPL started at 3pm so people weren't away watching that, either). Even with dynamic queue last season the maximum wait for me was 2 minutes. And probably no need for autofill either with the one queue. Never had issues with roles in seasons 4 and 5.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-20T15:24:59.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is OCE big enough for 2 queue types? **NO**\n\nShould a smaller server like OCE switch back to a single queue system? **Yes**\n\nWhen you pretty much get the same players over and over and you are in low bronze, you know there's issues with 2 queues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2017-01-20T12:53:29.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People don't want to be autofilled, but they'd rather take the bullet than not be able to play with friends.\n\nFlex is for people who want to play in a team environment or with friends and Solo Queue is for someone to grind the ladder and improve by themselves. \n\nIf you take away either of them the large quantity of the people who play the removed queue will hate it. If put in a position where you either had both queues or had autofill less often at the expense of losing a queue, I'm 99% sure that almost all people would keep both.","replies":[]}]}
