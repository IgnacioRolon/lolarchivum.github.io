Solo/Duo + Flex. \r\nWhilst I understand why we have split the queue types, I question whether this is a good idea on a relatively low population server like OCE\r\n\r\nWhat I have been noticing a lot recently is players being autofilled. It seems like in a majority of games someone is being autofilled into a role they don&#039;t want to/know how to play. This seriously diminishes game quality as it leads to onesided matchups. Surely part of this problem is due to the player base being split over 2 separate queues.\r\n\r\nIs it really worth having two queue types on OCE if it means more  people being autofilled? Should a smaller server like OCE switch back to a single queue system?","replies":[]}
