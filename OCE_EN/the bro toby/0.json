This would accommodate Riot with more ideas to add for the players who are passionate about League. Not to mention the Universe Beta, which is great, although an addition with Clubs in this sense would potentially bring in more Universe Beta innovations and much more! Capitalising on competitive notions would see great feedback for Riot :)","replies":[]}
