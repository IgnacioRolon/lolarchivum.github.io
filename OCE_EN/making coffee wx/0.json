You can also submit a (separate) ticket to report other players if they are engaging in punishable behaviours by using the \"Report a player for cheating, phishing, or negative behaviour\" option and Support will ensure the case is properly reviewed.\n\nKeep in mind that Support will only change the outcome of a punishment (via removal or reduction) if the punishment was issued in error. Standard progression for chat-offences is chat restrictions (10-game then 25-game) followed by suspensions (14-day then permanent), and if you have not followed that progression you *may* have a case for reduction.\n\nNote that use of \"zero-tolerance language\" is likely to result in escalations past the usual progression (such as triggering a 14-day suspension before a chat restriction), and considering your use of terms like \"retard\" it *may* be that the case was escalated due to use of such language (though, no one will be able to provide further details on that point without more info, i.e. the relevant chat logs).","replies":[]}]}
