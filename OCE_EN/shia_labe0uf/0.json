I know how this will seem, I&#039;m not on to balance numbers well, but I did what I could using other champion numbers to try to make the changes fair, but you can call me billy blue biased bollocks, because this little rat is what i consider the funnest champ in the game, but he doesn&#039;t really fit in to any good team comps. Sure people play him top as an anti-melee pick, or play him mid as a mage, but his official roles are &quot;Marksman&quot; and &quot;Assassin&quot; both that if you need in the team, there are waaaaaay better champs for those roles. So this proposition is to see if I could make him more viable as an ADC or an AD assassin. So without further ado here is the rework;\r\n\r\nKey changes;\r\n-Scales with AD instead of hybrid\r\n-Added some counter play to Teemo&#039;s Q (Would look like Annie&#039;s new resource bar in-game)\r\n-Added a much better escape to his W (as an assassin he needed a new escape)\r\n-Gave a bit more depth to the E to compensate with not being as spam happy with the Q.\r\n-Teemo&#039;s R felt annoying if you misplaced it in a place where no one walked, so it refunds the charge if it doesn&#039;t detonate.\r\n\r\nTeemo Rework\r\n\r\nP- Camouflage\r\nBonus Attack Speed: 5/10/15 at levels 1-6/7-12/13-18\r\n\r\nIf Teemo stands still for 1.5 seconds without acting or being acted upon, he enters stealth. Teemo retains stealth until he moves or is displaced. If Teemo is within brush, he may move without breaking stealth.\r\n\r\nWhen stealth is broken, Teemo gains bonus attack speed based on level for 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nQ - Blinding Darts\r\nCooldown: 6 seconds\r\nRecharge timer: 25/20/15\r\nCost: 60/65/70/75/80 Mana + 1 Dart\r\nRange: 700\r\nBlind duration: 1/1.25/1.5 at ranks 1-2/3-4/5\r\nOn-hit Physical damage: 25/50/75/100/125 (+90% AD)\r\nAdditional true damage: 5/7/9/11/13\r\n\r\nPassive - Teemo creates a Blinding Dart charge periodically up to a maximum of 3 at once. Blinding Dart cannot be cast without a charge. If Teemo has 3 charges, the next cast will deal additional True Damage over 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nActive - Teemo shoots a dart coated in a neuro-toxin, consuming a charge, dealing physical damage and blinding the target for a short duration. While blinded, the targets vision is reduced to 200 units.\r\n\r\nW - Yordle Tactics\r\nCooldown: 20/18/16/14/12\r\nCost: 45 Mana\r\nRange: 1000\r\nBonus Movement Speed: 8/12/14/16/18%\r\n\r\nPassive - Teemo gains bonus movement speed whilst in brush, and around allied turrets.\r\n\r\nActive - Teemo becomes stealthed for 1.5 seconds and creates a decoy that moves to target location. Upon reaching its destination the decoy disperses as if Teemo went into stealth.\r\n\r\nE - Toxic Shot\r\nTrue damage per second: 15/20/25/30/35 (+25% AD)\r\nAttack speed reduction: 10/12/15/18/20%\r\n\r\nTeemo&#039;s basic attacks apply a poison on hit effect dealing true damage over 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nBasic attacking the same target for three consecutive shots reduces the targets attack speed for 3 seconds. (Cannot be applied to the same target twice within a 10 second cooldown)\r\n\r\nR - Noxious Trap\r\nCooldown: 0.25\r\nCost: 80 Mana + 1 Mushroom\r\nRange: 600/850/1100\r\nSight Radius: 500\r\nDetonation Radius: 200\r\nRecharge Time: 25/22/19\r\ntrue damage per second: 15/25/35 (+25% AD)\r\nSlow: 20/25/30%\r\n\r\nPassive - Teemo stores a charge of Noxious Trap periodically, up to a maximum of 4 stored at once. Each charge that is stored lowers the cost by 5 Mana, with a minimum Mana cost of 60 Mana. If a mushroom&#039;s timer runs out before it has detonated, it will refund the mushroom, even if Teemo has maximum charges (now having 5 stored).\r\n\r\nActive - Teemo throws a mushroom trap onto the ground bouncing off armed mushrooms. Becoming stealthed when it lands, 1 second after it lands the trap arms, lasting for 5 minutes. While armed, mushrooms grant sight around them.\r\n\r\nIf an enemy steps on a mushroom, it detonates, poisoning all nearby enemies; slowing, granting sight on them and dealing true damage over 4 seconds.\r\n\r\nMushrooms have 6 health, can only be damaged by champion basic attacks. Take 2 damage from ranged attacks and 3 damage from melee attacks.\r\n\r\nWith the benefit of Hind sight, I may have gone overboard with passives. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed reading this proposition to Riot, as much as I did making it. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-07-16T22:53:31.488+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SHIA LABE0UF,\n\nModerate fan of your work.\n\nAs for the Teemo rework.\n\nQ at max level would do 125 damage per dart. 3 dart stack = 375\n\nLets say I have three damage Items\n\nInfinity Edge +70\nBloodthirster +75\nEssence Reaver +70\n\n= 215 damage\n\nThe Q will also do 90% of your AD as a bonus.\n\nThis would be a damage of 646\nper dart. So if you had three charged, 1938 damage. Every 6 seconds, not including runes or masteries.\n\nAlso I think the mushrooms should have 1 health not 6 health.\n\nWe want a fun game man, not a game where people are running around with sweepers wasting time destroying mushrooms for a couple seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-07-16T22:56:51.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also I have not included any crit chance into this","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SHIA LABE0UF","date":"2016-07-17T09:32:56.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I'm not very good with balancing numbers XD, maybe I should review them. As for the mushrooms I only added the refund mechanic, all the rest is the same. I didn't want to change the shrooms much as that's a part of teemo identity.\nGlad to see you enjoy my concepts, perhaps I should finish more of them that I got siting in my documents folder :P","replies":[]}]}
