Var&#039; Keth is mean&#039;t to be a jungler, being able to speed in and out of a gank before the enemy knows what to do, I might have gone heavy on the CC a bit, I might have stuffed up the costs and cooldowns as well as I tend to not focus on these as I play. Anyway, I hope you enjoy the concept. Any and all feedback is always welcome.\r\n\r\nVar&#039; Keth, The Speed of the Void.\r\n\r\nPassive - Hunger for Speed.\r\nVar&#039; Keth targets an enemy with the highest movement speed, killing that target gives Var&#039; Keth 5 stacks and selects a new target that is out of their fountain. A champion cannot be the target again until Var&#039; Keth has killed all possible targets first. Killing a jungle monster gives Var&#039; Keth 2 stacks. Maximum of 200 stacks.\r\nEvery 4 stacks gives Var&#039; Keth an additional movement speed and attack speed point.\r\n\r\nQ- Rush.\r\nCooldown: 7/6/5/4/3\r\nCost: 35/45/55/55/85\r\nVar&#039; Keth dashes a short distance dealing bonus magic damage on hit. If it hits an enemy champion or jungle monster that has not being hit by this ability within the last 10 seconds, activating the ability again within 3 seconds of using it will return Var&#039; Keth back to the position he activated it the first time.\r\n\r\nW- Speed Siphon.\r\nCooldown: 20/17/14/11/8\r\nCost: 40/45/50/55/60\r\nVar&#039; Keth marks an area slowing all enemy champions in to for 3 seconds, after 3 seconds any enemy champion in the area loses 50 movement speed giving half of what is lost to Var&#039; Keth for 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nE- Metabolic Enhancement.\r\nCooldown: 25/23/20/15/10\r\nCost: 25/40/55/70/85\r\npassive - After 5 seconds of without being struck by a champion or turret attack, Var&#039; Keth increases his health regen rate based on his movement speed.\r\nactive - Var&#039; Keth gains a percentage of missing health back.\r\n\r\nR- Mirage.\r\nCooldown: 85/75/65\r\nCost: 100/110/120\r\nVar&#039; Keth runs at incredible speeds, leaving behind a speed mirage with reduced physical and magic damage stats based on the distance between them, with maximum damage being 75% of the original stats, and minimum damage being 25% of original stats. Activating it again merges the two together at a chosen position directly in-between them, dealing area of effect magic damage based on the distance the clone traveled, slowing hit enemy Champions over 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading the concept, I hope you like it and look forward to hearing any thoughts on my champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Cancer","date":"2016-02-21T10:30:28.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This champion is literally drugs.
