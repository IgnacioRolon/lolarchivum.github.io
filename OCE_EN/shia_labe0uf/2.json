Why not have it that once maybe one or two more exclusive hextech skins are released, make it so you can convert 2000 or so champ essence into a gemstone? that way only the people with all champs would really have a reason to spend such ludicrous amount of essence into a single gemstone. What does everyone else think? should Riot make a system like this?","replies":[{"poster":"Plasmarine","date":"2016-04-05T01:35:41.165+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that's a pretty good idea honestly! I also really like the fact that the Annie Skin is hextech exclusive. It actually feels special when you use it. Pretty strong idea.. Much better than people saying let it be used for skins too. (Kinda defeats the point of -cosmetic- essence lmao)","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-04T23:16:05.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should save at least three champion shards for when a new guy comes out, so you just re-roll and get him/her for free.
