Almost without fail, each match has had at elast one player botting... in most cases, though, there have been two or three bots in my matches. It is quite frustrating that the people I am reporting day after day are still botting away and removing the ability for players to learn champs properly in the designated queue. (For instance, you can&#039;t set up ganks as a support when you don&#039;t have a team to actually follow through.) \r\n\r\nI understand that botting will always be an issue in massive multiplayer games but it&#039;s alarming  that the same accounts have been reported multiple times over the past few weeks by a multitude of players are still active.","replies":[{"poster":"Dezzter","date":"2016-01-31T18:40:56.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had 2 bot games where its been me and 4 bots and I just report them all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SomethingFunny","date":"2016-01-29T17:20:51.829+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now there are bots in normal games too:\n\nhttp://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/6000641#matches","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-29T12:36:24.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe best thing you can do is to continue to report these players for cheating in the post game screen, include as much detail as possible in the report.\n\nIf you wish to submit a further report with any evidence, you can [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to player support and they will forward it to the appropriate team.","replies":[{"poster":"SomethingFunny","date":"2016-01-29T12:53:12.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, no offence, but you're really not that helpful. In both posts of mine that you've responded to, you've quoted information that was already addressed by me in my opening post. \n\nAnyway, I've been reporting these bots and no actions have been taken. This is an on-going issue that needs more attention at more than just an individual level. \n\nI appreciate you trying to help but just copying and pasting stock standard information, esp. when you're not a member of the Riot team, isn't helping move us any closer to actually solutions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SomethingFunny","date":"2016-01-29T09:12:18.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As has been noted in other places on LOL forums, this seems to be PARTICULARLY bad on the OCE servers:\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/GMiNlmb6-the-overwhelming-number-of-bots-in-coop-vs-ai-games?comment=0003","replies":[]}]}
