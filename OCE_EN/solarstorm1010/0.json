How do I even fix this?

Just unlocked the map skins and they're still showing up as locked in lobby. It *might* just be that it's taking several hours to actually become available after it's unlocked (sometimes happens with other loot/rewards), so it may just be a matter of waiting for a while. If nothing's changed tomorrow, it would be prudent to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and see if they can help out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Oppa","date":"2019-06-27T12:13:59.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Upvoted.
