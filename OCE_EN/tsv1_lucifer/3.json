It causes my client to run slow and takes 20-30 minutes for it to warm up and I am able to click on something in client. I believe it is a coding bug and obviously it is something I can&#039;t fix since it is the clients coding. So I was hoping to get in contact with rito to report the bug and try to get it fixed. My computer is fine, the H/D is a little full but it shouldn&#039;t be the problem. I play other games Rocket League, DayZ, Total War and WoW and everything works fine and there is no flashing with any other clients (steam, b.net etc..) Please help me out.{{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} {{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\n\r\nLucifer {{champion:92}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-22T03:52:27.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds to me like something may be drawing focus away from the league window, could you try closing any other running applications that are not a necessity before entering a game, let me know if this issue persists.","replies":[]}]}
