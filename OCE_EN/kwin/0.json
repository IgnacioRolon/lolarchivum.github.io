Not to concerned about rank, I&#039;m only Gold 1, just wanna play with people again as most my mates have quit. Usually play weekdays around 4-9 and more flexible hours on the weekends.","replies":[{"poster":"Connor","date":"2018-04-01T12:22:06.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"sending request","replies":[]}]}
