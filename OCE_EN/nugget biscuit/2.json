It only requires luck and a little bit of knowledge. Anyone that plays the game for 1 month can easily get to diamond. I played for a week, new to the mode and got plat 3 already. If you also look at the top players, you can see that they just abuse the most op meta builds. A broken game that should not exist unless they properly nerf and buff champs and items. Some champs are the most useless pieces of garbage whilst others are so op that even if you are losing for the entire game, that one champ can help you win. Similarly some items are so op whilst others are garbage.","replies":[{"poster":"SirTiltsABit","date":"2019-12-23T04:20:28.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I don't think Rito care about this game at all. For instance, you could play Glacial and not ever proc it, but verse it and be perma frozen. The other terrible thing at the moment is Soulbound. As long as you get Senna/Lucian, GG. Everytime, I had 4 3* Berserkers and it tore them up like they were nothing.","replies":[]}]}
