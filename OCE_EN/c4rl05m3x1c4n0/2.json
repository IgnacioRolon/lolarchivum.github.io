Heck i was pretty much redundant and not required for the win.\n\nJust luck, those three could of been on the other team.\n\nAnd its not just match maker. Game before last the sole Gold5 player in the game decided to shaco jg and fed hard and went salty. Can't match make that.\n\nSo at lower ranks luck is the deciding factor IMHO. as 1/10th of the players involved it is so damn hard to swing a win.\n\n(have seen it happen, a vi jg just snowballed the game so hard and won in 25min)","replies":[]}]}
