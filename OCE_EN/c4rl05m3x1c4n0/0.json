As you pointed out, her weapon looks nothing like the Hyperlight \"Alpha\".\n\nAs for {{champion:58}} it seems a little silly to count him out simply because he's a crocodile, Riot isn't beneath doing that, however I do agree it's unlikely to be him. His blade is more like a Bat'leth (yes, I'm talking about the traditional Klingon blade weapon) than the Hyperlight.\n\n{{champion:24}} to me seems like an unlikely choice, mainly because he usually holds his \"weapons\" at any point he can grab while he wouldn't be able to do that with the Hyperlight, since it's only got a small area in the middle to hold onto (arguably only able to use one hand).\n\n{{champion:11}} seems even less likely than {{champion:24}}, mainly because of the differences in {{champion:11}}'s usual weapons and the Hyperlight. With {{champion:11}}'s weapons, they only go in the one direction from the hilt. The Hyperlight, however, goes in both directions, clearly a big difference. I'm not ruling him out though.\n\nLooking at some other champions, {{champion:62}} seems a possibility. I know he usually uses staff weapons but they're consistent with the hyperlight in the sense they go both directions from where you hold onto them.\n\nIt even seems possible (though unlikely) it could be {{champion:429}} (I know it doesn't seem like a spear weapon but, other than that, it seems to have a few similarities with her spears) or even {{champion:99}} (I know what you're thinking, but Riot have already turned her staff into a gun, do you really think they're going to shy away from turning it into a sword?)\n\nJust my two cents.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-08-20T14:46:33.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly doubt it's going to be {{champion:62}} that completely does a complete 180Â° on Wukong's weapon of choice. No other skin departs from that identity of Wukong holding a staff. \n{{champion:24}} more likely is the champion because it states in his lore that he can handle any weapon like a master; his title being \"Grandmaster at Arms\".\n\n\"Alpha\" and \"Multi-Target\" closely aligns to Master Yi's Q ability. \nThe transverse double-bladed feature of the weapon could be used for Master Yi's Passive - Double Strike. (I know. It sounds like a complete ability rework; a legendary or ultimate skin).\n\nOther candidates are {{champion:107}} and {{champion:58}}.\nTheir weapons have similarities with the Hyperlight Blade.\nRenekton doesn't match with any of the descriptions of the character, aside from multi-target, but Renekton doesn't target multiple champions, he simply slices and dices people in his immediate range.\nRengar can hold the title of \"Alpha\" but his weapons (across all skins) has thickness and curvature, this Hyperlight Blade does not  seem to have that. \n\nI go back to Jax. The weapon handle could extend to give Jax space to hold it with both hands, as he does with every other skin.\n____\nThe seeming nature of the figure's multi-eyed head indicates that it is either {{champion:11}} or {{champion:24}}. You could say that those could simply be reflections of light sources in the vicinity but highly unlikely.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"C4RL05M3X1C4N0","date":"2015-08-21T01:04:02.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so its master yi seen on the PBE\n[](http://read:http://www.surrenderat20.net/2015/08/820-pbe-update.html)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-21T02:27:26.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much this.
