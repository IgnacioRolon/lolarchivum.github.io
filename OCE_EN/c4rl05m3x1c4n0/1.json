So my thought is that if you are able to ult said juggernait then flag and drag out this will shut them down harder then any other cc because you cannot cleanse qss or spellshield it.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-05T20:40:01.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're almost there.
