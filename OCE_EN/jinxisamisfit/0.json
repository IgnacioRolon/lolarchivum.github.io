However, if you think there is only a small chance that the ADC will get it, while you can easily secure the kill DO NOT HESITATE. They will probably flame you a little, but in the end they gotta just accept that you got them an assist and some time for easy farming, rather than the rather possible nothing at all.\nMorgana and Karma, like you play, are good choices. I would suggest picking up Leona, Thresh or Braum as well though, for those occasions where your team has no tank so that you may do that too. All of them are excellent in lane anyway.\nEarly Sightstone is good too. It should be one of your first items. While everyone should be warding, in low ELOs people will be like \"NOT WASTING MY MONEY, PLACE MORE WARDS SUPPORT\". The amount of times I have had people tell me off for placing no wards when I have 3/3 wards and pink down D:.\nLike on everyone, pink wards are nice. Placing them in places people don't often check is a good idea. It isn't gonna expire, and it will always come in handy at some point. That was as well, you won't be surprised if someone uses a path no one seems to use.\nAlso, wards... don't just place them in bushes. Its nice to have them in bushes, but having them outside of them can give you more information by letting you see a bunch of places people may walk through.","replies":[{"poster":"JinxisaMisfit","date":"2015-02-02T00:47:44.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry didn't mean to offend :) thank you so much for this :D even in pvp I find the ADC abuse can get really harsh. Most of it for KS when they can't kill confirm.

Sightstone is a must for supports.\n\n- Die protecting your adc or for team\nSupport who is kill hungry should not play support.\nSupport is supposed to die for your adc or team\nbe the meatshield for your team. But it doesnt mean support is ok to feed. Its all about common sense.\n\n- Watch map and wards\nI have met a number of supports who buy sightstone but rarely use it to wards the map. This is fail support\nSupport must always spam the warda in sightstone. Dont go back to base if you still have over 1 wards in your sightstone\nAlso watch map. Give warning to your team in any other lanes if you see enemy jungler is going to gank. Let the team know where the jungler is.\n\nThere are many more points to do as supports but this should help at least.\n\nAs Morgana, I usually rush zhonya them buy sightstone\nI dont even buy shoe. Just rush sightstome while buying the 75g wards or 100g\nAfter you have zhonya, ppl will fear you. Why?\n\nFlash into enemy team, hit R, activate zhonya. Win. Repeat. Ggwp.
