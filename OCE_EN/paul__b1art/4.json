This may take up to 5 minutes. \r\nNOTE : The process may appear unresponsive during this time&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe only way i have been able to fix this is by restarting my pc!\r\n\r\nTicket will be getting submitted but i just want to do my best to make developers aware of this issue to get it fixed before to many others get hit with it.\r\nIf you&#039;ve had it happen to you or a friend please leave a comment just so i know it not just my pc.\r\nThank you!","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-12-20T21:22:10.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try ctrl+alt+del and then 'end process'.","replies":[]}]}
