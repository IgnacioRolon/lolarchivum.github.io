I have watched most of the toxic players come and go and around 80% of the cheaters get banned. Recently I have seen a new problem rise up worse than anything I have ever seen in the game!!!\r\n\r\nBecause I don&#039;t make friends randomly I chose people that are good and team-players I have trouble finding people to play with and I normally end up playing with at least two or more &quot;randoms&quot; on my team. There is a REASON many of these people don&#039;t have friends or teams to play with!!!!\r\n\r\nMOST people that play this game enjoy watching tournaments and often gameplay guides made by people that call themselves professional gamers. What most people watching these videos don&#039;t realize is that they are not in a professional game 90% of the time and should not treat it as such.\r\n\r\nIn a professional league game kills are all that matters for simplicity but in MOST games IF you DON&quot;T destroy towers YOU WILL NOT WIN. I have seen around 70% of people that play league fit into one of three categories :\r\n\r\n1.  they spend the whole game trying to ks and don&#039;t help their team unless they can ks and the rest of the time they either farm or camp in the bushes somwhere until they can ks again.\r\n\r\n2. they want to &quot;get kills and farm&quot; before they push and they wait until there is really no point in even trying to win.\r\n\r\n3. they don&#039;t even TRY to push  farming kills instead until they are about to lose then suddenly want to push,,,,, and then they either lose and spend the next ten min arguing over &quot;WHO FED&quot; and harassing them or outright blaming people or just jump to the next game pretending it didnt happen.\r\n\r\nEVERYONE enjoys winning and EVERYONE enjoys having a nice score on their account but IF YOUR &quot;WIN / LOSS&quot; RATIO IS SO BAD IT MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH YOUR KDR IS NOT EVEN GOING TO BE LOOKED AT. Everyone knows that kdr is easy to fake and all they have to do is look at your win / loss to see  if your faking it or not.\r\n\r\nI can understand playing the game &quot;for fun&quot; even not trying to0 hard sometimes but when you ruin the game for other people because your trying to pretend you have skill by making a fake kdr, or making sure your team does not win because you don&#039;t want to damage your kdr.............. your just ruining the game for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}  {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}} \r\n\r\nI think there should be MORE training talking about how to play better maybe even have it done by PROs as people lvl up and start learning to play better. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n*  when you are in a lane with another champ and kat (or any other enemy champ) is about to kill your buddy you can get close to him so that she hesitates and he can get to safety. Even if you die, if you destroy a tower or repulse the enemy team from charging temporarily it is a worthy trade because you now have time to farm and destroy towers or even kill more of the enemy team or........ at least get some help from your team and do some shopping.\r\n\r\n* The earlier you destroy towers the easier it is to win the game over all and you don&#039;t need to farm as hard if you destroy towers because you get gold bonuses and kills as they try to defend their towers.\r\n\r\n* Your not SAVING your KDR when you let your teamates die unless the whole enemy team is charging and your buddy was dumb enough to go give them a hug. IT&#039;s important to &quot;Play smart&quot; but letting your teamates die to preserve your kdr when it&#039;s 1x1 or 1x2 is just FEEDING because now they have more gold to murder your team with. Unless you are countered  by both or low health. every situation is unique but you need to not worry so much about dying as you should about destroying towers and getting to their main building.\r\n\r\n* If at all possible you should stay near enough to &quot;be a threat&quot; and keep them from dividing your teamates far enough from you to make it easy to kill them.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-12-20T08:45:53.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I have been part of League of legends from the start of the game back in beta I think it was 2004.\n\nI mean... beta was 2009, so i don't know how you got 2004, hell, 7 years and a beta, it's kinda easy to calculate.","replies":[]}]}
