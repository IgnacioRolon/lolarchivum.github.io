I've made a support ticket and I'm awaiting a reply in that aspect.\r\n\r\nHowever, the games that they played on my account worry me. They played 5 games today and the most recent one was a game where I think they were intentionally feeding. I'm just wondering if I can actually be punished for their actions, or if I can continue my good standing. \r\n\r\nI haven't heard of anyone else being punished when their account was hacked, so I was unsure as to what happens in that regard.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-20T09:44:31.374+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"P.S to what HeartVine said, if you haven't already, change your password *now*. If you so much as suspect your account has been compromised (and you have proof that it has been) the very first thing you need to do is change the password of the account and the attached email account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-05-20T04:42:14.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there's no history of account sharing on the account, and you're the original account user, you should be pretty much right, as whoever handles the case should be able to distinguish between games you've played and games that were played by someone else during a compromise, and subsequently any punishments that would have come from another persons actions would be removed.\n\nYou'll still need to go through the Account Recovery process as normal, but generally whoever is the original account user is able to verify enough info with the Support staff to confirm they are the original account user.\n\nYou might also want to run an anti virus scan on any computers you use regularly (personally, I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for manual scans, as it tends to pick up more than other anti virus software in my experience, but up to you), check out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see if there's any indication of compromises on others services you use, and just generally check security on the really important stuff (like emails, bank accounts etc).","replies":[]}]}
