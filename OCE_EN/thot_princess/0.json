So why am I being punished to begin with, when I did nothing wrong AND the punishment has no effect? \r\n\r\nWhy does honour level exist SOLELY to punish players? There is literally no other reason.

That's a lie. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, instead of asking riot for support in unturning my fair ban, which they usually decline for the simple reason of \"We can't unturn bans, even if they're unfair\", I'm just going to tell everyone that the ban system is dumb, unfair, broken, and STILL doesn't punish actual punishable behaviours. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt's so dumb. Punishment has no effect, so riot doesn't punish actual inters. But, they still want to punish something so the game isn't bad, so they punish toxic behaviour (The SINGLE game I was banned for has NO chat use, so there's no evidence of me doing anything against terms of service), but that just punishes actual players, and only has an effect on actual players because they're the ones who constantly use their actual accounts.\r\n\r\nI am shit fucking TERRIFIED of logging into my main account which hasn't been used in almost two fucking years because I'm CONVINCED that I'll tell my team to fight and I'll get perma-banned for it.

Why do I have to live in fear of being banned for doing nothing wrong, and STILL get matches with and against players who blatantly int? \r\n\r\nRiot cannot ban inters who don't use the chat because there's \"no motive\", that is what they have officially said, or at least I've been told, and yet people can still be banned for having bad days despite there being no motive, despite it not even being ranked, and despite the fact that there are other inters in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-21T11:20:51.836+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I recently got a 14 day account restriction because someone else decided they wanted to int my game.\n\nYou didn't get a 14-day because of what they did, you got a 14-day because of what you did, the specifics of which are in your reform card. Just as you are not responsible for the behaviour of others, they are not responsible for yours. If they did something wrong, and you reported them, them they will be held accountable same as you have been.\n\nIf an analogy helps here: Just because Fred steals your bike, doesn't mean you are allowed to steal Fred's TV, or George's bike, or Steve's microwave. It's also not your responsibility (or okay) to get your own revenge on Fred in whatever form that takes.\n\n>They were a four stack and all reported me, and I was suspended.\n\nPremades are irrelevant when it comes to reporting. It only takes a single report for a game to be reviewed, and extra reports have no extra impact, precisely to prevent premade abuse.\n\n>This is dumb, and I can easily circumvent it by just making another account.\n\nThe idea is that most people have more attachment to their accounts than you apparently do. Sure such a method works for a 14-day ban, but 14-day is your *final* warning before a permanent suspension. If you choose to ignore this, then you risk losing your account and all content and achievements on it.\n\n>So why am I being punished to begin with\n\nAs to whether you did anything wrong or not, your reform card is designed to shed light on that. The community can review it if you want, but you'd have to post it. As to the punishment being effective, see the above. It won't work for *everyone*, that's just not possible. Just as laws don't stop everyone and prison isn't a substantial deterrent to some. Doesn't make breaking the law right.\n\n>Why does honour level exist SOLELY to punish players?\n\nIt doesn't. Honour is a reward for positive behaviour. If you are doing the opposite of that, then you lose that reward. How you look at it is very much like the glass half-full/empty dilemma. It is a reward for good behaviour, which means bad behaviour loses the reward. Or it is a punishment for bad behaviour, and keeping it requires good behaviour.\n\n>You still get key fragments, chests, loot, etc from honour even if you're honour level 0\n\nChests aren't tied to honour, keys are. You get *substantially* less key fragments on Honour 0 than you do Honour 2+. You also don't get season rewards (something many players care a great deal about) if you are below Honour 2.\n\n>Why does it get reset whenever you say a single bad word in game?\n\nIf it's from a single word, then it must have been a very bad word. Things like racism, 'kys' etc. League is M rated, not 18+.\n\n>every single player I know has at LEAST one perma-banned account\n\nThis is incredibly subjective. Of the players on my friends list (50 odd) only 2 have ever been perma-banned (3 accounts total), and only 4 have had a punishment of any kind (in fairness to you, that I know of). Point being, the smaller the sample size, the less indicative it is of the average.\n\n>\"We can't unturn bans, even if they're unfair\"\n\nThat's not the case. If a punishment is made in error, or made too strong, it will be reduced/revoked. That's not to say that your idea of unfair will always match up with official policy however.\n\n>so riot doesn't punish actual inters\n\nGameplay punishments are slower, because chat like \"go f%%% yourself you useless f%%%\" is a lot clearer in intent than what might be an int, or what might be a tower-dive gone wrong. That doesn't mean BS liek that isn't punished, it's just slower than most people would like. It also does not mean that we should stop banning other BS behaviour in the meantime. \n\nEG: Just because it takes longer to investigate a murder than it does an assault, doesn't mean we should stop punishing assaults until we can get faster with murders.\n\n>so they punish toxic behaviour\n\nYes. That's the idea.\n\n>but that just punishes actual players\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this. Everyone who plays the game is an actual player, regardless of what category their behaviour falls into.\n\n>I'm CONVINCED that I'll tell my team to fight and I'll get perma-banned for it. Because that has ACTUALLY happened to one of my accounts\n\nThen ask for a review. The false-positive rate is low, but not 0 (because that would be impossible). If you want a community review before going through support you can post your reform card for that punishment or any other than you may be concerned or uncertain about.\n\n>Why do I have to live in fear of being banned for doing nothing wrong, and STILL get matches with and against players who blatantly int?\n\nYou don't. You only have to fear your account being banned if you are using your chat or your gameplay to create a negative experience for other players. It sounds like you've had multiple punishments from your post, so you records of what crosses the line and what doesn't.\n\n\n>Riot cannot ban inters who don't use the chat because there's \"no motive\", that is what they have officially said, or at least I've been told, and yet people can still be banned for having bad days despite there being no motive, despite it not even being ranked, and despite the fact that there are other inters in the game.\n\nIt is slower, not impossible to determine intent in such cases. They do get banned. Having a bad day is not the same as abusing players in your games, over multiple games (you always get *at least* one warning in the form of a 14-day ban, usually 2 chat restrictions as well, before permanent suspension). Ranked or normals is irrelevant, it is the behaviour involved that matters. Other people doing a bad, does not make your bad a good or even an okay. Report them.","replies":[]}]}
