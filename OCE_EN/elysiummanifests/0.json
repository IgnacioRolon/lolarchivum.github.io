According to the wiki (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ao_Shin) he has been delayed one untill 2015; then again until early 2016. Is he still being released or has he been dumped? Or is it going to be like the Heimer rework that was leaked 5 years before it was released with the exact same specs as the leak?\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Meddler,realm=NA,application-id=A8FQeEA8,discussion-id=BK1jt7bU,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2014-11-27T06:32:52.233+0000)\n>\n> TLDR: Ao Shin someday, won't be soon.\n> \n> Slightly longer version: We spent a bunch of time working on Ao Shin but ultimately concluded he wasn't hitting the mark so put him on hold for a while in order to figure some things out. We still think his concept's really cool, as is some of the stuff we were trying with him, so do intend to make him someday. Don't expect to see him anytime soon though, we'd rather be slow, but do a better job of delivering on his potential, than quick. That's a process some other champs have also gone through (Lee Sin, Elise and Azir for example), where it took a few different takes to hit on what we felt was the right one (Lee Sin originally as Blind Monk way back pre launch, Elise originally as Priscilla the Spider Queen, Azir originally as Seth the sand mage), ultimately yielding better champs in the long run we feel.\n","replies":[]}
