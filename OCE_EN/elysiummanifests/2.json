Some games I flat out carry as an APC, others I just die horribly and some I take on a support role.\n\nBelow are some issues I have found with him:\n\n**Passive **\n\nMy allies rarely understand my passive. I have had people leash my buffs into oblivion and not pick up the extra copies of red/blue that spawn after level 5. Is there any way you can allow us to ping ability descriptions? Or have a loading screen tip that shows in a game with Ivern in it?\n\n**Q**\n\nSimilar issue with Q. People do not get how it works and the indications for it are sub-par. Sometimes myself and allies that use the go into attack range thing get stuck in walls. Also what is the range of the go into attack range thing (X units)? Moreover for how long can the effect be activated? The entire length of the root?\n\n**W**\n\nEither the tooltip for W is wrong or there is a massive bug with it.\n\nFrom (http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ivern/):\n\n> In brush, Ivern&#039;s attacks are ranged and deal bonus magic damage. Ivern can activate this ability to create a patch of brush.\nPassive: In brush, Ivern&#039;s attacks are ranged and deal 20/30/40/50/60 (+0) bonus magic damage.\n> Active: Ivern grows a patch of brush for 30 seconds. For 3 seconds the area in and around the brush is revealed.\n\nAlmost all the time after leaving the brush the Passive effect persists. According to (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ivern) this is suppose to happen for 3 seconds after leaving the brush. The reveal page (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/champion-reveal-ivern-green-father) also states that the passive effect \"lasts for a couple seconds after Ivern leaves the brush.\" So what&#039;s going on? \n\n**E**\n\nTrigger-seed damage does not appear to proc after the shield has been destroyed. So is there missing information or is it a bug?\n\n**R**\n\nDaisy is the most buggiest monstrosity I have ever seen in this game. Okay let us start with the tooltip: \n\n> Ivern summons his sentinel friend Daisy. If Daisy attacks the same champion three times in a row, she will create a shockwave knocking enemies up for 1 second (3s cooldown). Daisy gains additional damage and defenses based on Ivern's Ability Power.Recasting this ability will direct Daisy to a new target or position.\n\nOkay so the three attacks in a row part is clear. Everything else is unknown. So what happens when you press R for the first time? Does Daisy go to the target you designated? Can you even designate a target on first cast? I have experienced many inconsistencies with this alone.\n\nAlso the \"Daisy gains stats from Ivern's AP\" part there is no indication what the flat values for Daisy are or how AP affects the stats. We know that AP has X effect on Y but not the degree of said effect (Ratio). It cannot be purely RNG can it? Sometimes Daisy can tank a teamfight, other times she practically dies at spawn. \n\nThere are some ratio's here though: (http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ivern)\nThanks for reading this brick :)","replies":[]}
