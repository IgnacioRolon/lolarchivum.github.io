In the past my pink was 20-30 since I live in Canberra. I used 'Logs of Lag' and yes there are both ping spikes and packet loss in them. Bad Game #1 http://logsoflag.com/#ybnd4IxAl0q . Bad Game #2 http://logsoflag.com/#Vv-UFHzAtqS. Game from 2 weeks ago # 1: http://logsoflag.com/#hOIz9kWFbmU. Game from 2 weeks ago #2: http://logsoflag.com/#D19IzsXNALk . There's a pretty big change in the graphs. \n\nRan two more traceroutes if that helps. And yes i use WiFi and have tried resetting my router/modem multiple times to no avail.

Look for signs of packet loss.\n\nAnother thought - do you use wifi to connect your PC to your router? I'd hope my first hop was a rock solid 1ms.  3ms could be a sign of either wifi or router load issues.\n\nLet me know how you go!\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}
