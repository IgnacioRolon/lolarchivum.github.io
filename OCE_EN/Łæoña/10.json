If yes then how and why ?\r\n\r\n5) Is there any type of video games did  you play and why?\r\n\r\n6) Can video games be applicable to day-to-day daily task? If yes then was there a video game you played that helped you in your daily-tasks?\r\n\r\n7) Do you feel video games can affect you or anyone&#039;s psychological state? (psychological means the mental or emotional state of an individual- for those who don&#039;t know what psychological means).\r\n\r\n8) Can video games be Utilized for Emergent Learning? (Can be video games help bring out the creativity or Enabling Young People to Design, Create, or Invent Their Own Games)\r\n\r\n9) Has any video games you&#039;ve played helped improve your understanding of some things?\r\n\r\n10) What type of video games do you play ? (genre)\r\n\r\n11) Do you feel that more very young kid&#039;s are playing and becoming more addicted to video games? \r\n\r\n12) Have you encountered young youth who has access to video games restricted above their age? What do you think about this?\r\n\r\nWell thats all the questions I would need for my research, thank you for taking the time to read and answer the questions. It is much appreciated if you answer them. \r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-06T04:00:34.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Next time you should definitely consider using [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) just to make it easier for everyone to respond. It also makes graphing and response collection easier too.\n\nAnyway, here's my answers:\n\n1. It's a good pastime. I can play at almost any time with people anywhere, unlike a traditional sport/recreation which requires meet-ups with the team etc.\n\n2. (This question doesn't make grammatical sense BTW) I do think playing strategy and puzzle games can help with complex thought and problem solving.\n\n3. 2 or 3 hours most days now. But during school and work days it is closer to 1 or 2.\n\n4. Literal strategy in League (as in knowing where to ward and gank) has not helped me at all IRL. But shotcalling with my friends has helped me with teamwork tasks outside of League.\n\n5. (This question also does not make sense). I assume this is asking what other games I play? I only really play competitive strategy games.\n\n6. I'm sure some games like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Academy_(video_game)) can help with daily tasks. But nothing I've played has helped me in that way.\n\n7. Absolutely. I think the reason people get so emotional when things happen in League is because it's affecting their mental state.\n\n8. Yeap.\n\n9. It's helped understand people a bit.\n\n10. MOBAs and team-based multiplayer first-person shooters (Overwatch, CS:GO).\n\n11. I don't think anyone is getting addicted, and I don't think young kids are playing anymore than before. I remember me and my friends used to play Runescape and Pokemon back in primary school (almost 10 years ago).\n\n12. Yeah I see it quite a bit. TBH the restrictions are set way to high. People of ages 14+ should be able to play games like GTA.","replies":[]}]}
