The 'funnier'/'worse'/'better' the better. If this is your first time doing so they'll 100% give you that 1RP. Otherwise I'm pretty sure they won't let you a 3rd or 4th time.\n\nSo all in all, don't lose hope! Small things like this, Riot will take care of for you! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-11-20T06:19:09.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seriously?

Riot just likes to have fun with the community. You in no way have to take the 'art' thing too seriously; unless it's extremely good, they won't either. It's all fun and games; literally :P\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-11-21T02:31:23.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha alright thanks for the help, have you sent in any art-work before?
