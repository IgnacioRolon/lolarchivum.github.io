But the thing is that there was this very toxic player and legit he flamed everyone on our team apart from thresh (possibly his duo partner), oh and I understand the no shaming policy so I won&#039;t put in his name.\r\n\r\nSo what happen is he was flaming my mate, telling him that he was stupid (ofc he was chill but responded by teasing him with small insults which may not be a good idea) and some other insults and this is when I felt that he was being irrational and just plain stupid so I joined in this argument and took over my mates place to argue with him.\r\n\r\n**He called out that we both were autistic and should kill ourselves, he also made a comment that his life mission is to make me to kill me (as in make me kill myself)  not my mate ( And to be frank with you all, I do have depression and it is not really deep depression but Im not gonna go too far into it )  so I insulted him by telling him that he was being irrational and not thinking properly as in understanding that he was toxic and not handling his comment by understanding our point of understanding. \r\n**\r\nBut the end of the where insults flew across back and forward.\r\n\r\nI constantly added him not to annoy him but purely to ask why he was toxic, he replies &quot;I don&#039;t hate you, I hate stupid people and you fall under that category&quot; So I gave him a whole speech about where his rights limits him to but he got like penalised mid-way through\r\n\r\nSo thanks riot for removing him from the community for a certain amount of days or something.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this, I would love to read your opinions .","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2016-09-22T04:49:20.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why Riot need to give us the option to turn off chat all together. There is 100% no reason for people to chat other than to abuse on another or be toxic. Considering now you can ping your statistics (rank to next lvl, mana and health %, ult timer etc tec) I can't see why it hasn't been added. Gone are the days where you would need to thoroughly keep track of people ults and CD's or use chat to keep track of the timers.\n\nWant to be nice to someone to show they played well or were friendly? Use the reporting system. Most people forget that it can be used in a positive way and majority will only report after a negative experience. You still have the option to chat in the lobby screen after the match has ended.","replies":[{"poster":"JimmyBoy","date":"2016-09-22T05:25:59.060+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Communication is a huge part of this game, sure most of the time people won't have the time to chat/type out full sentences, but it's still very valuable. However If you really don't want to see chat at all, just type /mute all at the beginning of every game.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-23T04:08:56.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can just ping","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DeathBringer787A","date":"2016-09-18T10:15:52.117+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not happy that someone got punished, they were probably having a bad day, and the reprimand probably amplified that. I understand that you may have felt upset at his actions, but. Nevermind. Perhaps, (although this may classify as self promotion) you could please read this.\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/mfovL8EQ-being-positive .\n\nYou changed his course, his path in life. I hope you're satisfied. Have a great day.

He told my mate and I to kill ourselves, someone like him should not be in the community as Riot is trying to promote a friendly community. I don't see in any way how your not happy he got banned in any case even if he is having a bad day that even to the extent of telling someone else to kill themselves for your own sake when your upset. \n\nIts not self- promotion, Im not promoting myself in favour for people to be support me against this player, I trying to convey the idea that even toxic people should not go the extent of ending some elses life when they are just playing for fun with their mate.\n\nIf you cannot see that then I suggest you re-read the post.  And also how did I changed his course, his path in life? Not once did I tell anyone to kill themselves even in game because I have no rights to deem someones life invaluable or valuable. I did not change his life, if I were to kill myself then would he be satisfied that a \"stupid\" person like me to argue against him? \n\nAnd to summarise, there is no satisfaction from this nor will I do anything that will involve anything else to fulfil this satisfaction, and I do want you to know that if you missed it that I'm in depression I only said this not to boast myself and have others to feel bad for me, No that is never my intention but only showed that anyone whose in the same situation as I am  that I do not want him in the community of the possibility that  he could affect anyone else like me .\n\nI'll repeat this again, he was instant toxic and there are some people that may be like him. How are you not happy that someone like him is removed ? He was toxic, he repeated empathises committing suicide and insulted my friend and I. So if you wanna feel that he had a bad day then please be my guest and be blinded from that fact that if more people like are removed then the better the community will be.\n\nAnd we did not say any comment that initiated the argument, I was not toxic at all and was ready to co-operate but I will not allow myself to co-operate with someone like him..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-23T20:59:42.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chobi,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4vsHNlsx,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-09-18T09:48:09.950+0000)\n>\n>  I would love to read your opinions .\n\nVery simple.

If I was in your lobby and saw you three (the perp, yourself, and your friend) all talking smack, and being generally toxic, I would of report all three of you (no matter who started it, and who was just defending themselves). \n\nSecondly, adding him after the game.\nProbably not the best idea. I would of just blocked and reported the player. Let Riot hand out the punishment. At the end of the day, you're talking to a person on the Internet and insulting them and trying to show them the error of there ways without any authority to be able to hand out punishment ( it's like a child trying to tell an adult how to drive a car, the player isn't going to take you seriously).\n\nAll in all, good work for reporting him, but please don't go witch hunting them or go adding to the problem you yourself report the player for.\n\n\nTLDR; mute, report, and block,\nDon't add to the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-22T04:15:54.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True true, but my mate stopped talking which I took over in his place.

He got the cake and ate it too. Even though he was penalised, we don't know to what extent ( could just be a small ban). But as soon as his Ban is over he'll keep going until he no longer a gets reactions. Think of it as a bully back in primary/pre-school, he'll keep going until he is board. The only way that will happen is if people just ignore him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
