This was probably one of the most fun finals to watch.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-10-30T22:30:33.444+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even though faker fed, he did a lot of things to contribute to the win. It's hard to explain, you can feed but do other things that can help you guys win.
