There are many different things that can cause this kind of thing to happen with your brain choking but the first step to preventing it is realising it is happening which you have already done.\n\nThe second step is to figure out what causes it which you have already speculated that it could be about knowing your build path. In my personal opinion when this used to happen me back in early season 2 when I was a jungle main was that if something happened that I wasn't planning for or prepared for my brain wouldn't know how to react. This would cause the state in which you have described.\n\nNow what I did to combat this from happening is trying to think a bit more in a situational way. Previously I was going into games having a basic outline of what I would want to do in the game, while in a respect having a plan is very good and you should always have one, always set up your plan in a way that it can adapt to the situation. In the case of being a jungler you have to be ready for getting invaded at level one or being counter jungled from the enemy. When these things happen you need know how to react and adjust your plan accordingly. Notice how I said adjust your plan and not change it, this is a big thing that a lot of people will miss understand when I mean situational thinking. Your end plan as to how you want to win the game doesn't change but the route that you get there might have some tweaks too it. That way you still have goal to work towards and it keeps your brain moving, you just need to figure out how to get from point A to point B in a different way.\n\nSo in a sense always try to be thinking ahead, plan your next steps and always keep your brain active about what you need to be doing and account for things that you aren't prepared for. Things that often cause these brain chokes are most often caused by small things you weren't prepared for building up until its too much for you to handle. Apart from that I would recommend always trying to keep hydrated before you play, having a good amount of water, sleep and food is always good for keeping your brain active and make sure that you take short 5 minute breaks between each game to reflect on how the previous one went. A youtuber by the name of GBay99 did a brilliant video on how losing streaks happen and the science behind it all and I think a lot of the things he talks about ties into this topic.

This sort of thing from I have found can be rare but you aren't alone, there are strategies to combat these you just have to find what personally works for you. Good luck and I'll see you around.\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-12-20T11:42:36.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah this really helps.\n\nI've sought dealt with this like 3 times in a year, 1 being this year.\n\nThe thing is that I realise it is happening and that I face such difficulty in what you said objectives.\n\nThe rank game i talked about, I was playing jng and maybe 15 min into the game I go blank on any objectives I had in mind (like you know what you will do and when to do it without actually thinking about it).\n\nThe problem of what has caused it still remains a mystery even after watching the link you gave.","replies":[{"poster":"Captain Fortune","date":"2016-12-20T12:11:29.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea, keep going though mate if you are able to figure out when it happens after your game try to remember what was going on at the time and write that down. When its happened a few times you might be able to see pattern as to what causes it.

You could try writing down your standard jungle path (or get an idea of them before the game) and deviate from that as necessary based on the game. Items are typically different every game but you can write down notes on what items are best for what situations.","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-12-20T03:35:52.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could be, but this situation happened before I took a break.
