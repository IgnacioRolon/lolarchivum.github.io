Regardless whether we win or not, It was a great moment for all the members and I guess the bond was great between us all.\r\n\r\nThis cannot happen without a great man, **Yasei Doubutsu**. Without him making the club or even planning it out thoroughly this all wouldn&#039;t happen without him, and neither without the members who are in the club.\r\n\r\nI personally want to thank this guy for spending his own expenses to give us $10 RP prize, not many people would be even willing to spend money on someone they rarely know.  This man deserves my gratitude and probably everyone else too.\r\n\r\nAlso I would like to thank Riot Games for helping out with small prizes which is great of them, just also to personally thank a Riot staff- Maraudaur who took notice of the post and other riot staff who also did) \r\n\r\nSo on behalf of everyone who participated, we would like to thank Yasei Doubutsu for spending his own time and expenses to set this all up and hope for the best that if this all  happens again and improved, we would love to have you back again.\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t get paid for this {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}} but if anyone needs any help improving I think Helping Others Improve! is a perfect club for you swell as the man himself Yasei Doubutsu youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8x_OF9Fo1vb8NkaASrXaXQ  His content are great, I&#039;ve seen them myself if you invest some time into his videos, you will surely improve.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Thank you Yasei Doubutsu!\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}  {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-14T01:46:08.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"did you guys end up uploading the video of gameplay??","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-14T12:35:40.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No not yet, putting it together n such","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-11-13T04:40:25.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am now poor :(","replies":[]}]}
