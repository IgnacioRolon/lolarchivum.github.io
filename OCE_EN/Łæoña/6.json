And to stop it is just changing your password. I just want to let everyone know about this. \r\n\r\nThere is also one thing I would like to know regarding to this topic. A friend of mine has been banned because they were affected by the same virus like I have, because his account was sending the same email to everyone, he was banned for this. I just would like to know whether his account can be unbanned for this under the circumstance that he was a victim.","replies":[{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-04-22T13:14:42.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think that you friend would get unbanned, the fact that he clicked on the link is basically risking his account. Rioters have already warned people about not clicking on harmful links but people choose not to listen. It was his own fault and I don't think riot would unban him. It's simple, do not click on ANY links that is not officially permitted by riot. Be careful bro :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-22T02:23:48.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tell your friend to send a support ticket to try and appeal the ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Big Al Dente","date":"2016-04-22T02:16:28.206+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I odn't beleive he will be unbanned.
