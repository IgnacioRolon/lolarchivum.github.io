Personally I feel people nowadays don't get that some people don't give a rats about your feelings and that's fine in its own way. People don't have to care about your feelings and for the most part have their own lives to get on with. \n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the original form of this meme was born out of many people finding her outrage and offence, ludicrous and somewhat immature for a member of the audience of a university open discussion. Many considered her outburst unreasonable and so deciding to make a mockery of her for it. Whilst I do think this is wrong, as ridicule should not be targeted towards an individual for their opinions, there were reasons behind it and the thoughts of those that appropriate this meme are understandable, given that some might take stance against what they might consider an overly unilateral discussion, as was the original context.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-06T03:23:13.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I found the full vid pretty funny.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2017-02-06T00:17:47.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm personally offended by the implications of your post get reported kid","replies":[{"poster":"dont chase me xd","date":"2017-02-06T00:22:48.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shoosh up you flipping ninnyhammer its u who's being reported","replies":[]}]}]}
