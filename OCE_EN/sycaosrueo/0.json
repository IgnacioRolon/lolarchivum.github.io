Consuming his last potion, he gritted his teeth at the sickly sweet aftertaste. How he lusted wistfully for his favourite Ionian brew. Knowing there was little time to waste, and even less before night fell, The Wanderer continued on his path, knowing very well that this night might be his end. Summoning the wind to mask his scent and aid him on his way, he ploughed ever forwards into the deep and mysterious jungles of the Summoner&rsquo;s Rift.\n\n He tried keeping his thoughts from entering into that dark realm that sane minds could not exist in, but only succeeded in pondering his past. He once told himself he would not die dishonoured; promises made are hard to keep. Stumbling down what was once a casual walk, The Wanderer realised just how much trouble he might be in. In front of him was an unforgiving, pitiless jungle, and behind&hellip;.he yet hoped to escape.\n\n Knowing every breath could be his final, he was more alert, but yet more exhausted than he thought could be possible. He could feel every whisper in the trees, every slight change in the breeze -- a breeze that was once always by his side-- now seemed like a gloating, menevalient and forbidding presence. Not knowing how far behind certain death was, he still knew he could go on no further. The damage his body had sustained was phenomenal, and the potion he had consumed made little difference, for wind only fueled fire.\n\n Collapsing on the ground, he rested his body while his mind searched for the possibility of escaping with his life. He found himself subconsciously undoing the band holding his wild hair in place, given to him once by a friendly rockweaver. Not knowing if his plan would work, he decided he might as well try. Holding the long length of handspun wool, he called out her name. Yasuo knew that even just uttering it would give away his position, so instead he decided to defiantly call out, tempting fate. If the end came, he would meet it with defiance.\n\n As wind carried the sound of his voice through the woods, he wearily stood up, facing the same direction from whence he had come. \n\n &ldquo;And so, the inferno begins; with your world ending in fire,&rdquo; said a deep, malicious voice from the darkness around Yasuo. Suddenly appearing out of the darkness -- which defies logic for a being made of fire -- Brand slowly walked towards him; a hunter after its prey.  And although he was metres away, Yasuo could feel the heat resonating from the figure of fire, drying further his already dehydrated throat. Walking behind Brand was a being made of pure darkness, soaking and drawing in all light into the centre of the creature. Yasuo knew without a doubt that this was Thresh in his Legendary form; The Dark Star. His presence was even strong enough to darken Brands&rsquo; eternal flames, from which he was made. In the Dark Star&rsquo;s hand was a  large star, now devoid of life and whose existence was now to serve that which had devoured it.\n\n The creature made no effort to speak, Yasuo sensed that this was because his end was already near. They started approaching him like a depraved coffee addict goes after coffee, lessening the metres between them further with every threatening stride. Still holding onto the length of handspun wool, Yasuo felt something change; the wind carrying the faint sound of rocks colliding. The sounds quickly became louder and Yasuo, knowing his plea had been heard, said only one thing;\n\n &ldquo;No more running,&rdquo;. Using whatever strength he could muster, he artfully dashed towards the dark flames. At the same time, a large moving wall of rock with a girl atop rushed out of the jungle and into the assailants. The wall threw them skywards as Yasuo reached the place where they had been. Accepting that he might be drawing his last breath, he threw himself into the skyborne enemies; artfully striking each three times in a single, flowing movement, before landing in perfect form. Dashing through the Dark Star to gain some distance he heard boulders being thrown behind him and the unmistakable sound of rocks flying into bodies. Yasuo heard the voice of Brand echoing behind him, chanting\n&ldquo;I purify this one!&rdquo; before hearing Taliyah&rsquo;s screams of pain. Feeling something shift the air behind him, he created a wall of pure wind, only just blocking the enchained star from latching onto him, and drawing him into its dark, inescapable orbit.\n\n The Dark Star laughed, a sound that seemed to draw the life force from the jungle around him. Yasuo knew he couldn&rsquo;t leave Taliyah behind after she had just saved his life, and so he turned and faced Thresh, knowing that he stood little chance of beating him now that Taliyah was locked in deadly combat with The Eternal Flame. \n\n Yasuo sighed, a sound of suffering, and rather than engaging while Thresh was weaker, pulled out his wooden flute and starting playing a song of despair and woe. Yasuo didn&rsquo;t just play the flute, he lived through it; channeling all of his emotions into each and every note played. Thresh hesitated and looked confused, as if somehow affected by the deep and sorrowful message of the song. The Dark Star shook his head and continued moving towards The Wanderer, who despite the calmly approaching figure of death, continued to pour raw anguish and emotion into his song. \n\n There was now no sign of the once chilly night breeze; in its place the beginnings of a full blown gale, the wind howling and rushing not only above the jungle but through the trees. This source of fuel only made Brand&rsquo;s flames dancing higher and brighter than before, for wind only fuels flame. The rising winds seemed to have refreshed and refilled Yasuo with a desire to live, a willingness to fight for not only his life, but the life of The Stoneweaver, who he had once taken under his wing. Without realising it he had adopted his all too familiar stance; one that had one taken him years to master, and one that falsely accused him of treachery those many years ago. \n\n He was like the calm before the storm, waiting for the moment that a poor unfortunate had to go outside, only to be greeted by the opening of the skies; a flood unleashed from its prison in the sky. With all the howling winds at his side, he made his move on Thresh. Using the lamenting and unrelenting gale to block Thresh&rsquo;s flying chains and stars devoid of light, he could focus on further weakening the Chain Warden, attacking it with precise and lighting fast movements. As Yasuo attacked, he could feel his lifeforce returning to him, steadily increasing his strength while the Dark Star got weaker and weaker. With a final swift strike, he cut the chains holding Thresh&rsquo;s soul to his form; an ironic way to end the gatherer of souls.\n\n Yasuo turned and saw that The Eternal Flame had been extinguished, and putting the wailing winds to rest, let the night adopt the same flow of air as it had before; a breeze that no longer seemed formidable. He steadily walked over to The Rockweaver, who although could still stand, looked like she had seen better times. Giving her time to rest, Yasuo set back to playing his flute, this time playing a song that sang of better times to come.","replies":[]}
