They do it to keep us happy and because its fun seeing a dude slow walk up to someone then treat them as a basketball.\r\n\r\nBut do we have enough insane characters that may seem to resemble something we have seen before?\r\n\r\nWe need an insane martial artist, not Lee Sin, that fires huge over the top energy beams down lane. Someone who can split into weaker copies. Someone who can instantly transmission across the map. Someone who can transform in to a god damn Super Saiyan. These abilities already exsist in many champs. But I want them on a single person. I want a Son Goku, one that is not Sun Wu Kong, I want an alien with a tail who gets a tiny bit stronger after he dies.\r\n\r\nMost of all, I want to become a Super Saiyan and fire a huge f*** off Kamehameha down my lane and incinerate two waves of minions.\r\n\r\nThis could be a serious of champs;\r\n**The Chi masters**\r\n**Lee Sin** and all his business would be one of them, clearly.\r\n**Tien** - uses his tri-beam at the expense of his HP\r\n**Goku** - uses the power of transformation and extreme durability to outlast his opponent to build up his Kamehameha Wave and blast them into outer space\r\n**Cell** - a crazy android who can poop out baby copies of himself and steal the techniques of any other champion\r\n**Krillin** - the squishy wanna-be karate champ with a 1-hit KO destructo disc, Frisbee\r\n**Frieza** - an alien with a vendetta, transoforming through 3 different stages with different abilities\r\n**Roshi** - an old dude that transforms into a tank then fires all his strength at a single target\r\n**Gohan** - the boy genius with enough power to put them all to shame with his own one handed Kamehameha that is wider than it is long\r\n**Piccolo** - another alien who regrows body parts that are blown off. Builds a huge amount of energy to fire his special beam cannon to one shot anyone it hits\r\n\r\nThe list goes on. But being familiar with characters throughout League, some may see the similarities. I would just like to see some of these characters and feel like I am dominating as one of them.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-12-22T01:20:13.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Those characters belong to the Dragon Ball franchise, and whatever company owns the rights to their images.  So you will never see them or anything too recognisable in League of Legends. And pirating something as iconic as the Kamehameha would bring down a multi million dollar law suit down on Riot's head i'm sure.  So don't hold your breath sorry.\n\n2. If you did have all those abilities on one champion.  You'd never get to play them because they would have a 200% ban rate _(both teams always banning)_.\n\n3. _\"But do we have any Saiyans?\"_  Short answer: Yes. \n\nHave fun ^^\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/edbEnrC","replies":[{"poster":"Kryllick","date":"2019-12-23T12:40:00.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is more the idea rather than straight up stealing them. IP theft is a HUGE deal, but the abilities are easily replicated and have already been (Lux ult (Kameha), Lee Sin fighting style (super speed punches), Elise Ult minions (cell jr), TF ult (instant transmission), Yuumi Q (Yamcha spirit ball) and as you showed Nasus ult AND Kayle ult (super saiyan and different forms of frieza or even stronger saiyans (new idea - dead saiyans reviving - have to int to get stronger?)) ; reskinning and reworking of these abilities would more than suffice on a few characters that would have been balanced by the team at Riot. They are out there, they just look different.\n\nI get why you made the comments, there are a heck of a lot of donkey's out there; but I quite understand what I have asked and maybe I should have included \"Inspired by certain characters from an undisclosed, well-loved, anime series, but just worked into a LoL format and not copy-written versions\".\nWould that have read better?\n\nCheers for the comment!","replies":[]}]}]}
