Technology, gaming and the newer generations literally will NEVER know the hardship of trying to play sports and being physically incapable of participating. Why? Because they have the option to participate in exports. The major defining factors being fun, support and community now dictate where people spend their free time (or work time). Job opportunities are available for the ultra fit and unfit alike on the field or a virtual one.\n\n It is indisputable that league of legends is a great, fun and even addictive game. Hundreds and thousands of hours are clocked daily in League of Legends. The draw of \"making it big\" with what everyone already owns; computer, ability to click and press buttons, has opened the way for hundreds, thousands, millions of players to access these communities. The proliferation of eSports and major events draws millions of viewers that all want to be involved,  unlike traditional sports, they can and do!\n\nNew players flock to their screens either to try something new or see if they have the skills. With the reasonably low entry price of FREE, low hardware costs and even localised servers, joining and playing is easier than ever.\n\nBut how are new players welcomed?\n\nRiot does a great job of introducing new players to the game with tutorials, guides and even the ability to report negative behaviours that may affect a players enjoyment. Playing against bots is fun when learning the champions and basic tactics, mechanics and the horrific challenge of effective CS, but as every player new and old knows, they can be abused. The experienced players clearly show their skill by snowballing at level 1 finishing with 50+ kills. \n\nBut the new players are left in the dust having learned nothing.\n\nNew players move to PvP play, non-ranked, to find more to learn from and even have access to watching replays. This gives the players the ability to try to analyse themselves, other players and how they can improve. \n\nBut.\n\nThe toxicity of these PvP matches is unparalleled. Being a place that players can learn how to fight other players and best another living person is the thrill of ANY sport, digital or not. Your adrenaline spikes at just seeing the other player at the other side of the lane. The rush of getting a kill or assisting in a team fight.\nNew players want to try feel the rush, try to improve themselves and have fun. Stress can be fun when moderated by yourself and not someone else. \n\nBut the flaming of players is indecent: \n\"Learn how to play the game you f***ing noob\"\n\"You suck. Kill yourself\"\n\"Uninstall the game, you’re wasting space for good players\"\nThese toxic players, in a space that has NO standing on a players position in ranked, can literally kill the new player base. The last thing a new player, or even an old one, needs when they make a mistake or have no idea what they are doing, is be flamed for being trash or disgusting. Nothing helpful is mentioned or how they could have improved. And don't even get me started on the mentality it breeds when combined with the youngest generations.\n\nTo combat this, the League of Legends  reporting system can allow punishment to correct these behaviours, but the amount of toxic players far outweighs the amount of punishments. \nI have been flamed for trying to help someone \nMyself: \"We need more situational awareness. Have to remember to look at the map more\"\nFlamer: “Okay boomer.” \nFlamer: \"Or you could alt f4 and then click uninstall.\"\nFlamer: \"Or do you need more instructions on how to uninstall too?\"\nThis comment being from a team mate.\n\nThus, the player base destroys itself, killing all new potential players which lowers revenue for Riot, interest in League of legends wanes and even hurts the eSports community due to a lack of viewers wanting to be involved with a toxic community.\nNow don’t get me wrong, I understand that some people need to build resilience against this type of stuff. But many of these flamers go ABOVE and beyond. There was a reason the report function became a thing and we are ALL aware of these issues.\n\nRiot had tried fixing the new and old player interactions by grouping players based on levels. It stifled the interactions briefly which I suppose led to a lowering range of reportable offenses. But unfortunately I can't even begin to think of the amount Smurf accounts. Players who make a new account to fight new players to: Learn a new champ, trial a new build, boost their ego after a loss streak, destroy players who have no idea what they are doing and flame them for it, etc.\nWhich is a fair enough strategy but, the current toxic community then bleeds down to the new players. The old players who are frustrated, tilted and ELO locked then take it out on anyone without even thinking “This is a brand new player who is having their first PvP interaction and I have told them to kill themselves”.\n\nCan you imagine if your words were taking more seriously? Or you said it to someone who struggles with depression? Some may laugh and display their insensitivity to the world, but that literally tallies you up to having a real life “assisted kill”. You are then partial to manslaughter, a felony for the loss of life of which, we only get one. YOLO (you only live once) is true in every facet of the acronym.\n\nLeague currently offers no option for increasing your ability or a fun, informative way of bettering yourself through positive interactions without asking every person you play with. Third party people, groups and organisations offer coaching. Some of which still flame players who actively seek help. The toxicity of the game has almost been ‘bred’ into players and mentors, changing the vocabulary of those trying to ask for help and those responding to it \"Buy such and such item, you f***ing useless piece of trash. It's better for your champ\" “This is all trash, your mechanics suck”. There are no ‘pick me ups’, no positive reinforcement methods, just burning your own player base to the ground and hoping that someone will push through the abuse and pay you to be mistreated because they ‘want’ it bad enough.\n\nThen the so called \"mentor\" tilts and starts feeding their lane because they don't have the patience to help a new player. And again, this is UNRANKED and plays no role in their standing.  The toxic mindset has even affected ARAM with the same effect, players losing their minds over incorrect builds and plays regardless that ARAM is the PERFECT opportunity for players to try champions they do not have access to. To trial a champ they never would have thought of or even get a condensed version of League of Legends as a whole. A fun way to also practice team fights and laugh at the insanity of 40 abilities all being triggered at once.\n\nWhy have I pointed this out,something that is obvious to almost the entire community? Because I have a proposal for Riot.\n\n\"Mentor mode\", \"Noob mode\", \"Earn and Learn mode\", whatever.\n\nA mode that allows all players to enter and clearly label, \"new\" and \"old\" regardless of player level using a frame or something.\nIt could even be as simple as &lt;30 or &lt;100 (below 100) and >100 (above 100) for new and old positions.\nMentor, or experienced players can still get their ego boost by torching a newbie team but have fun knowing that they are learning. Even coaching how they could try and counter them. \nNew players don't need to fear being flamed for being inexperienced and can even ask for help.\nMaybe the new players get boosted stats or increased income or a newbie item to actually stand a chance against these tough players and keep things interesting for them also.\nExperienced players have a habit of checking items and pinging them when something is wrong. In this area, these players can clearly tell why they bought such an item (new and have no idea what they are doing) and immediately suggest a correction instead of flaming them for it. Have items refund their full price in this mode to allow players to navigate the hundreds of items.\n\nEssentially I think a space needs to be made for players to ACTUALLY learn with only the intent of learning.\nEven the reporting in these game modes should changed from the full set to just reporting toxic players and bots. This resulting in a ban from the game mode for a day or something, instead of a blanket ban.\nYou could even minimise experience for player levels to ensure it is not being abused. Or you could make it based on player voting, \"Leadership tag\" +100 exp for each player tagging it at the end of the match. Or 4 mentor tags getting a loot box with skin shards to promote players to help a new generation of players.\nSomething that would entice them, something they would consider using their time to not get LP.\n\nThis tool should not be used by traditional coaches as they usually focus on mid to high elo players, which is why the suggestion of a level cap exists. You can't teach high elo players tactics on newbies! Save that for traditional blind and draft pick PvP. But they may be able to pick up new players for coaching there if they become mentors.\nMaybe players become eligible to enter this game mode by receiving a leadership tag at the end of a match.\nMaybe the champion selection is also restricted. Instead using the current rotation champs, they are auto assembled into the roles (determined by whatever selection algorithms or riot employee selections tactics) and players are slotted onto each champion at random. That way, it still has the ability for players to learn basics in each role and learn a new champ simultaneously. It also gives more purpose to the rotation champs.\n\nOr do we just need a modified version of the spectate mode? Where players play in a game mode that any upper ELO player can join, give advice to ALL champs playing and get rewarded for it by players checking a box to say whether they were helpful or not.\n\nI am just spit balling and am hoping that this could be built on by the community and hopefully try to build a more positive environment that can leech into the rest of the league.\n\nWe are all gamers, formally NERDS. We have to support each other to ensure our future endeavours in eSports is positive and may actually aid in the problems humans have when dealing with each other. Sports are supposed to unite us with a common purpose of something we enjoy regardless of the team we support, the type of player you are or the gender/race of the person at the keyboard. \n\nWe, as the digital generations, have already conquered the prejudice involved with something as physical as skin, gender or religion. \nWe game in a new world. \nWe still live in the real world. \nWe are the future of both worlds. \nWe should be banding together in game and out. \nWe should aim to be Legends through actions, words, clicks and community.\n\nWe ARE a League of Legends.","replies":[]}
