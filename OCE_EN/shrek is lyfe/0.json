Now i know preseason mmr doesn&#039;t affect ranked next season but does your overall rank? Like if i climb to let&#039;s say plat 3 or so and the season ends will i be put in like plat 4 or 5 after reset? Or will i be put back to like gold 4? So should i be trying to climb higher or not bother? Need some help sorry if it&#039;s hard to understand my English isn&#039;t too good.
