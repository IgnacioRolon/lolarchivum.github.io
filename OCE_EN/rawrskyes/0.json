I feel that this is unnatural and not to mention uncomfortable.\r\nLet's think about it, if you were flying along on a rocket, yeah sure I guess you'd open your mouth every once in a while to let out a \"WOO HOO\"; but other than that could you imagine the dry mouth that you'd get from all the air being forced down your pie hole?\r\nOH WAIT, I forgot, the bugs would moisten your mouth up, mmmmhmmm yummy bugs in my tummy.\r\nOr you know, maybe stop the eyes from moving, that'd make it less creepy. I feel like she's just creeping on me as I'm trying to type my password, it makes it an uncomfortable experience and I'm actually crying right now as I'm attempting to log in because it's just that scary.\r\n\r\nIn short, please stop the eyes moving or let her close her mouth. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nYour bestest friend in the world,\r\n\r\nRawrskyes","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-02-12T23:46:19.109+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why you do dis Rawrskyes I cannot unsee > .. <\n\nBut on a personal note, I think that Jinx SHOULD make you feel uneasy - she's ACTUALLY insane so let that discomfort flow through you.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T22:33:54.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tomblade,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=F9AdqOxQ,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-02-12T23:46:19.109+0000)\n>\n> Why you do dis Rawrskyes I cannot unsee > .. <\n> \n> But on a personal note, I think that Jinx SHOULD make you feel uneasy - she's ACTUALLY insane so let that discomfort flow through you.\n\nor maybe she's the kind of girl that could make life more interesting. who knows, we could actually enjoy being insane more than being sane.\n\nI don't know why im posting on a 2 week old post","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-12T11:50:30.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Disable the animation using the button.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/gbCNCGy.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Rawrskyes","date":"2015-02-12T12:12:16.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I tried that; but her mouth still stays open.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-12T12:16:11.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It stays open but her eyes don't move.","replies":[{"poster":"Rawrskyes","date":"2015-02-12T12:48:51.963+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I wouldn't be so sure about that.
