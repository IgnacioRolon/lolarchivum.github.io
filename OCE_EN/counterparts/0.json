Comment any ideas you think would be useful to be able to spend blue essence on and hopefully rito notice.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-25T06:20:20.807+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would be the point in converting it to ip if you already have all the champs ?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BananaSlayerAMO","date":"2016-10-25T05:19:25.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blue essence can be used together with mastery tokens to reach mastery tiers 6 and 7, which people should earn more of if they own more champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-25T03:31:36.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the moment you need the blue essence (or the champion shard if you have it) to upgrade to mastery tiers 6 and 7. There may very well be future plans for this kinda thing, but I think some kind of IP sink would be sooner considered than another blue essence sink atm since it's harder to get than IP,","replies":[]}]}
