Ryze&#039;s Abilities have the possibility of being technological, robotic or futuristic. \r\nBoth {{champion:13}} &#039;E&#039; and &#039;R&#039; would work really well as the e ability puts that ring around enemies, it looks very sci-fi rather than magic. as well as his teleport being a futuristic kind of thing. \r\n\r\nanyways i thought it would be really cool but i feel like everyone might think it stupid","replies":[{"poster":"HERMES LAD","date":"2016-10-11T07:33:23.786+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats great idea and will look really good but i don't think raze needs anymore skins {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-rainbows}}","replies":[{"poster":"BTSTU","date":"2016-10-11T22:52:37.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah i would like to see more skins on champs that only have 1 or 2, but i really like the program skins and want them to continue it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Chiddles","date":"2016-10-18T02:08:19.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would be a pretty hectic skin but i have o agree we need more skins for other champions with less skins like Aureleon Sol.
