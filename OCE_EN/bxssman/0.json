It's possible you just don't move at all.\n\n[Locked honour will prevent you from earning chests as well, but you will start earning them again once your honour unlocks.

I never yelled at anyone nor did I even sworn at them. I picked a champ they did not like. One of the group members (the snow flake) as I called it, wanted to go mid and wanted to swap with me and I said no to it.  To answer your question, the person is still a human, by crying about me not taking a champ he/she wanted me to take, I call him/her a snowflake and if you not sure what that means, pleas feel free to comment on this again and I'll try and explain it to you a bit better.

After that, it will take some time to earn your way back to Honour 2, which is what you'll need to unlock access to all the \"standard\" rewards again, which may take several months. So far as what you'll be eligible for during that time, it's my understanding that a locked or level 0/1 Honour will *not* restrict you from earning levelling rewards, though it will restrict you from earning ranked rewards, Honour rewards (capsules) and Hextech Keys (reduced at 1, none at 0/locked).\n\nYou can find information about how the Honour system works in the [Honour FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148) on the Support site.","replies":[]}]}
