But today it has been worse, been getting full ping spikes and literally just lost a game because 3/5 people on my team DC&#039;d for a couple of seconds in the middle of a team fight.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s annoying that with the current meta, games go for a long time a lot of games I lose are literally down to lagging right in the middle of a team fight\r\nISP is Internode in Melbourne\r\n\r\nOther players on other ISPs (Telstra, Optus) are getting similar problems","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-20T02:50:00.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Other players on other ISPs (Telstra, Optus) are getting similar problems\n\nThat's very out of context and doesn't really help. What if, say, it was because of a storm in the area, and you only asked a few people in that area (a common occurrence amongst people and their friends)?\n\nDo you have any background applications open while playing League? Do you have any programs set to \"automatically update\" or equivalent?","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-06-22T04:59:25.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No background apps open, nothing downloading, absolutely nothing going on. LoL seems to be the only game affected too, CS:GO has no problems. It's not really a huge problem for me as I'm moving house in a week and won't be getting Internode again but I just wanted to point out that there seems to be an issue with Internode and these small packet losses resulting in micro DCs.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-22T09:00:13.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":/\n\nIt's not like Internode would be monitoring League's forums, or that anyone here is going to make Internode aware of their problems, which you can't even be 100% sure of.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
