I&#039;ve hit Diamond 5 which is well above where I ever thought I could get, so I mostly kick it in some ARAMs and low level normals. I love chatting to people and having a bit of fun, it&#039;s a huge aspect of gaming for me. As Australia is a largely multicultural country, our gamers come from a huge variety of countries. We get a lot of Asian migrants/students which is great for diversity. \r\n\r\nHowever, in gaming it creates a lot of issues due to language barriers. For example, 90% of my games today consisted of nothing but boxes in my chat. No ability to socialise, would have been even worse if I was playing seriously as I&#039;d have no way to communicate.. I was going to maybe suggest a Match Making by location option, I&#039;d be more than happy to wait the extra few minutes to increase my chances of getting English speaking team mates.  Inb4 racist, but it is predominantly players of asian ethnicity that are the worst when it comes to flaming/abuse. If I&#039;m playing for fun, to kick back and relax, I don&#039;t want that crap.\r\n\r\nAnyone else had similar experiences?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-15T09:20:48.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> but it is predominantly players of asian ethnicity that are the worst when it comes to flaming/abuse.\n\nRacist?","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-01-18T04:18:24.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3YHjERHG,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-15T09:20:48.743+0000)\n>\n> Racist?\n\nThat's not racism, it's an observation from his experiences when playing with people of Asian ethnicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-01-18T07:17:19.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generalizing is the first form of racism. Not to mention, he has so little evidence to back up his claim. Also too many flaws in the evidence provided.\n\n+ How does he even know they are Asian? Could just be players who prefer to use foreign languages, for practice or to think they are cooler.\n\n\n+ The sample size is biased. Not only is it too small, but out of players who speak different languages on OCE, most of them will be Asian. Since all other foreign players, such as German or Spanish, will be on other servers due to ping issues.\n\n\n+ If he was able to see the population of Asian players that do not flame. It's likely this post wouldn't even be up here. The problem is he can't see the player behind the keyboard, so he just assumes based on chat. Most Asian non-flamers will go unnoticed.\n\nAll of this means that his \"fact\" that \n\n_\"predominantly players of asian ethnicity that are the worst when it comes to flaming/abuse\"_ \n\nis actually, an opinion.

You've got nobody to talk to who can only understand English besides the enemy team, which you dont need to communicate with to win.\n\nBut as long as there is one person, the one Australian or New Zealander trying to play the game on the server they fought hard for, the server they cried for so they wouldnt have to try and play on 250 ping, it should be on the 4 people refusing to speak the language that 90% of the server is talking to change for the team.\n\nThe sad way League of Legends is now is that you honestly cant speak up against it, they'll just 4 man report you for \"Toxic/Racist\" and you'll get the chat ban and the eventual suspension. Not even abusive, just asking them to translate. They'll respond with \"sb\" or something along those lines, or just cuss you out with their rectangles. Honestly i'd love to know if Riot Sydney even has a team to deal with that, do they have people translating these reports? They could be saying the most fucked up toxic shit but because they just appear as boxes, be getting away with it.\n\nThis honestly doesnt have to be a problem. Garena servers exist. Why people need to go out of their way to play on a server and refuse to communicate when they can deal with the extra 80 ping boost and have people that they can actually cooperate with is beyond me. \n\nHow many people do you see go from the US or any other English speaking nation go onto BR or LAN and play ranked on there, just to speak english and fuck up their team? Im absolutely certain thats report worthy. \n\nIf Riot or the people calling this idea of \"Anybody can speak any language on any server in public matches and if you disagree you're racist\" doesn't think this is an issue, why are servers still locked and transfers still paid? Why not pull a DotA2 and have regions be just a checkbox? Have Russians in every match? Have them ruin your LP gains?\n\nReporting them does nothing either. Every person refusing to speak english i report for Refusal to Communicate, but as with every other report if its not \"Verbal Abuse\" its useless. You're better off greifing them, because at least you wont get punished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-01-15T22:19:28.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am Asian i don't know what sb mean until  i searched on the internet lol","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-03-04T02:28:15.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol i guess you are not from main-land china then?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2016-03-04T01:21:38.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're lucky.

I like them the same.  \n- If I find a duo queue that only speaks mandarin... guess what... they are very likely to speak english as well. If they don't talk to you in english is because THEY DON'T WANT TO.\n- In ALL servers there is people that you SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO OTHERS.  It has NOTHING TO DO WITH LANGUAGE, NATIONALITY or anything else.  \n\nSimply put.  If they don't want to talk to you, they will not.  I've seen it in all servers.  In Fact in LAN it is most noticebly because EVERYONE speaks spanish.  However, if they don't feel like talking to you, they won't.  Saying \"oh they must be american because they don't want to talk to me in spanish\". That is ridiculous\n\n_**In other words.  People are assholes when they are assholes.
