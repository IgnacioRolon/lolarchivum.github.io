Hurry up and introduce a matchmaking ban if you report players enough time.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-24T05:15:54.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its probably due to the fact that oceania isnt a very larger server itself, and not everyone play during the day and afternoon which also means the people you verse could be the same as the system is trying to find someone whose mmr is similar to yours or making a team with average mmr near the enemy teams. even in saying you could be at a low end of the tier so on the V division. the easiest way to avoid versing the same people or playing with the same people is waiting 10min before you que up again. simple. Also if it isnt a valid report riot cnt do anything especially since if your someone who has breached the summoner code your report  against players are disregarded. only players with clean recorded have their reports forwarded, as it comes under false report if it is not coming from a clean background player","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-06-24T05:39:54.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried waiting and I still managed to get him in my queue, it's like he is literally going out of his way to bully me. And that reporting system is absolutely retarded, why the hell would they do that? I may as well sell this account and start afresh if that's the case","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-24T05:57:11.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of a large number of people getting banned for not doing anything wrong they had to make something so they introduced the false report thing. Also people report people cause they are angry, now if you report someone for being bad and dying you have to realise that person is only human and he himself is probably having a bad day right or he is hell bent on one path to try and win his games but it isnt working for him and therefore he is on a massive lose streak. Judging from the fact at the issue raised and response i can say your somewhere in the lower elo's, people tend to make the mistake of taking this game like its a life or death matter. It is just a game and if you dnt understand it your probably gonna rage and flip out but people who do will get better. The best option here for you to improve is try and understand how the game is played and how are you able to win games. Easiest aspect to work on is pressure, what pressure do you put on the map against all your enemy champions. And no there is no need to sell your account as your fresh start is probably gonna put you in the same situation as you are in now. your best option here is seek out help from higher tier players, watch videos to improve yourself, this will help you improve and you will break free of your situation in no time at all.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-06-24T06:11:06.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lower ELO? Mate I was just in my promos for Plat 3, that is not low ELO. And the reporting system is absolutely stupid, my account is busted from so many illegitimate reports, so you're telling me the guy that just bullied me FOUR GAMES IN A ROW wont receive any punishment? That seems fair, because you know, I guess I deserved it? So Riot is basically rolling over to anyone getting bullied so they're basically saying anyone with depression it's their fault for getting bullied? Seems REAL smart. Why don't they just say women deserve to get raped next","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-06-24T06:31:21.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If more people than you reported him than yea he will get banned, but if your the only one reporting him than likely hez not getting anything happen to him, and muting him and dodging does get rid of your problem. also anything below master is considered low elo cause people still have flaws in judgement and skill.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-24T05:40:51.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"JUST BECAUSE YOU REPORT SOMEONE DOESNTMEAN YOU DONT GET THEM","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-06-24T05:16:00.561+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, you obviously deserve to have him on your team.
