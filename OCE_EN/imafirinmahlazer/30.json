Results are scary :/","subforum":"GD","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"So I&#039;m a Diamond 5 player, Top 3 ranking for Malzahar on OCE and a qualified psychologist. I&#039;ve long been interested in the interaction between players since I played back in Season One, particularly the de-individualisation that a large population of players seem to exhibit. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been wanting to level up my smurf for a while and I figured end of season is a perfect time to do so. I had started recording my games and wanted to have a bit of fun, so I had an ongoing joke with my friends to pretend to be a newbie. Asking beginner questions and looking completely incapable, but then surprising my team when I played well. I was expecting a bit of fun, some positive vibes and some laughs. Instead I&#039;ve so far had &quot;Kill yourself&quot;, &quot;This is completely CrepeVictim&#039;s fault&quot; and &quot;I&#039;m afking because he&#039;s new&quot;. Part of me wants to create a highlight reel of the worst players I&#039;ve met. Not to mention every game I&#039;ve been reported for being new, and I am currently chat restricted. So there goes my roleplaying aspect.\r\n\r\nReally, I shouldn&#039;t be surprised. One of my strongest memories of LoL was my very first game. I picked Rammus because &quot;he looked cool and was fast&quot;. I had no idea what I was doing and trying to pick up elements of the game like last hitting, getting turrets and somehow trying to figure out what to buy (recommended built list didn&#039;t exist then). Of course, I sucked and got beaten badly. Someone was saying stuff to me which I didn&#039;t understand, my mate simply said &quot;He&#039;s basically saying you&#039;re rubbish&quot;. So there it is, my first memory is being abused. Nice to see it hasn&#039;t changed in the 5 years I&#039;ve played.","replies":[]}
