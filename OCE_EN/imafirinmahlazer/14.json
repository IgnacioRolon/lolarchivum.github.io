For example: Once an afk has disconnected for X amount of time the team can make a vote and decide to replace the afk with a new player.  The new player would be plucked from the game queue (with a notification that stated they are entering a game that is already in progress in X Role) They can see what the teams are and get a X amount of time to lock champ and Runes.  When entering the game they Join at a level Equal to the lowest level player in the game joined. They're given X amount of gold to shop with (possibly worked out by a Gold per time elapsed or a gold amount equal to what the AFK person had accrued previous to them joining) They shop and join the game like they have been there the whole time! Seems simple in my mind but i am sure there is a whole bunch of issues that have prevented this from becoming a thing in the past! ..... Maybe this is the future of LoL {{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"J0NESY","date":"2020-02-14T02:36:05.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm feeling chat should be taken out of the game all together. Have it in the champ select even in loading screen for set up purposes and then boom gone from the game use pings only. I think that would help the game alot even if they only trialled disabling chat for a fortnight to see the report rates drop would be interesting.\nLets not get me started on the AFK's! Almost Every other game one or 2 people will afk from either team!\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"SugmaDigBick","date":"2020-02-13T14:13:36.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol I feel you. Honestly I think its just a reflection of the state the game is in, atm the game broods toxicity. 100% pick ban rate aphelios and senna - still no actual nerfs. Raka, sona and fuck I've even seen lulu top, they don't even have to cs they just buy the supp item and you autowin lane. I vsed a raka today and I destroyed her, made her go 1/6 in lane, but it didn't matter, come mid-lategame she autowon the game for her whole team. Idk why riot is waiting till next patch so nerf her cos its disgustingly broken... The game is literally cheese or be cheesed rn and its sad but there is no wonder toxicity is so prevalent.","replies":[]}]}
