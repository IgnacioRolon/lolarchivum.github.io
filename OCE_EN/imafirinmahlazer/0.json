Most of the games I&#039;m playing are going for way longer on average now (45 min+) and often results in throws. People need to learn that turrets and objectives win games, not getting a kill and then backing to base. On the plus side I&#039;m consistently getting S+ with the new rating system so I&#039;m obviously playing well, but still losing games. Which just proves the fact that solo queue is just luck of the draw and I&#039;m going to have to accept that","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-05-08T12:06:29.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol the rating system is complete bullshit dont use that to calculate your skill","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-07T08:13:29.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm consistently getting S+\nWhich just proves the fact that solo queue is just luck of the draw\n\nThese 2 are not how this works.\n\nBoosters exist and can win most games and thus it's not luck of the draw.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-05-07T08:56:45.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, they can't win most games, even challenger players have admitted that silver/gold ELO is difficult due to the attitude of the players.
