Mods are rewarded with RP so it technically cost the company nothing. Basically these mods can provide instant feedback to Riot with harsher penalties. Basically, you see these players in the game, you know not to mess around. Riot has said themselves that they don&#039;t want to be the police and want to leave it more up to the community to set &quot;what is acceptable&quot;. This would be a great way of more or less having a RealTime Tribunal, I feel this would be hugely popular\r\n\r\nObviously these mods would be trusted players from within the community.

And I can see the cons of the system, providing certain players with powers that could be abused. But that's why you keep the team at a reasonable volume and punish those who abuse the power.\n\nBut I totally agree with you, I've got to the point now where I have a list of tos breakers. If I see someone that looks familiar, look them up in the list. If they're in the list it's a dodge","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-08T05:20:10.029+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah i was keeping a list but i very quickly realized that i was losing more lp from dodging than i was gaining from not playing with players on the list.\n\nThats when i realized just how frequent these trolls really are, they arent like one off cases where they had a bad day or something.\n\nThese people specifically log into league of legends to ruin peoples days, and yet they are still not banned.\n\nThis is why i have no confidence in riots ability to actually maintain a community, just as people have no confidence in their ability to maintain game balance.\n\nTo be honest i blame upper management for prioritizing money making methods over the health of their game.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-08T05:09:46.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, the Tribunal Voting system *is* coming back.
