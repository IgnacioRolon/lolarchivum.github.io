I&#039;ve never got below 15LP for a win before, just curious if it was due to the DC?\r\n\r\nEither way, pretty frustrating/disappointing","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2016-02-02T06:18:09.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey - the disconnection would have [been related to this issue](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/9rNOyg9Q-login-issues-and-client-disconnection-02022016) - but this wouldn't have impacted the amount of LP you gained from the game - only the disconnection from the game.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-02-02T10:17:22.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the quick reply! Just seemed odd as I had consistently been getting 20+ LP. It is crazy how often I end up on 99LP, I guess my MMR is significantly tanked at the moment","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-03T07:02:41.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It could also have simply been matchmaking, for it to jump down from 20+ to 9 is unusual. It's entirely possible that you ended up playing against a lower mmr team, thus earning less mmr and lp for the win (that's from my understanding of the system anyway). If you were playing at a slow time when not many people were playing ranked (which is entirely possible given the dcs) or just generally got unlucky then this is feasible. \n\nIf your next games were back to giving you 20~ lp then that was likely the case, if they dropped as well then you likely just hit where your mmr is equal to the average of your div so you're gaining less lp and it'll be harder to climb from now on.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-02T17:00:46.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Would Riot not have hit the big Red \"Loss Prevention\" button?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-02T20:55:40.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't appear that Loss Prevented was enabled at this time.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
