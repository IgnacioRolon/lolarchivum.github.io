Pings are more than sufficient for most of your communication needs, so there is no reason to let them bother you more than once.\n\nRetaliating against a toxic player can only make things worse. Not only is it likely to make that person redouble their trolling efforts or start tilting, you are probably becoming a problem to the other players as well. Trolls often are *wanting* you to get upset and show it, so the only way to not let them win is by not responding to them.\n\nPremade mass reporting has no greater effect on you than a single solo report in one match also; reports simply flag the match to be checked by the system, and more reports can't make the system check any harder. False reports are also filtered out, so if you just mute and not give their reports any value they will have no effect no matter how many report. They will even lose weight in their future reports for doing so.\n\nIf you are unsure what it was that resulted in your punishment, please share your reform card so we can look over it.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-12T15:02:59.093+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"On a side note, this discussion belongs on the **Player Behaviour** board.

Are we beyond the point where we can be social in a video game? I NEVER instigate anyone on this game. I merely tell them to sod off if they're being a nuisance. Once again, this advice seems to indicate that the bully/bad guy wins in every situation. \n\nGood to know about the multiple report system though. Having said that, I still feel I was unfairly banned.\n\nNow I will just have to use this account and upset people by being a Diamond player in Silver","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-12T15:32:26.026+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Don't you think there might be a bit of an issue if I'm having to report my entire team?\n\nAn issue with what? That you were punished for your behavior? It doesn't matter who started it, because you'll both be equally wrong. Mute, report, and enjoy your account not being banned while the other people get punished.\n\nYou don't get a 14 day ban for telling someone to sod off a couple times. You should share your reform card. Either this was the culmination of many games of negative attitude and a 10 and 25 game chat restriction that you felt did not indicate your behavior was wrong, or you did something so wrong that it required an escalated punishment (such as hate speech).","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-02-12T16:00:38.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"An issue with the community.

I just hear, time and time after again, that the victim gets punished. \n\nBut it's fine, once the ban is lifted on that account I will only play with friends and mute every unknown player from now on.

It's not going to undo my ban, you're just going to get frustrated so there is no win for anyone. I feel bad enough wasting your time as much as I have. Instead I'll just go have some fun of my smurf to remember why I actually play this game; for fun.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's just a game and I think a lot of people (myself included) need to remember that. I had a guy do the post game add to rage at me the other day on this account. I asked him, if we we're instead playing a game of basketball, would your behaviour be acceptable? He later apologised when I performed exceptionally well the following game.\n\nUnfortunately LoL seems to have developed some undesirable social norms. That coupled with the huge issue of de-individualisation that affects all on-line gaming, creates a pretty nasty environment.","replies":[{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-02-14T15:14:15.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find certain times of the day produce more or different type of people who play. Week end games are the WORST as people who play then are either kids or trolls. The trolls are the worst, at least kids can be muted. But trolls will play crazy combos or plan to do something out of the meta and then complain when the team fails because of their antics. \n\nI once had to play support and i said \"i want to play what i want as support though are you okay with that?\" they said yes. I said i was going to teemo Supp. They said nothing about it so i went with it. \n\nFirst thing i noticed that was wrong was the ADC in the last 3 seconds repicked to Warwick. At the time also the top laner picked brand.. which is okay but kind of strange. Then after we were in the game the brand said \"OH F*CK TEEMO SUPPORT NOOB NOOB\". The Warwick proceeded to say nothing but he didn't come bot. He went top with brand and Brand built support items. At first i thought he was going for a early first blood you know.. but they stayed top. The thing i also noticed which was weird was both picked TP. They joined together in the game so i am SURE they planned to go top and blame me as their scape goat as to why they went top together. The jungle copped a lot of abuse early as they constantly asked him to gank top.. it was 1v2 top and they wanted ganks...\n\nThe mid was silent for a while too, he then complained about me for no reason saying i fed bot. I was support runes and masteries solo bot as a teemo... Against a Jhin and Leona. How am i meant to stop them?? HOW. They were some of the most toxic players i have ever met. And i am sure they planned to do what they did. And they all reported me except the poor jungle how had no clue how to gank because of the weird line up. \n\nReal problem is more reports on you the higher chance of getting the ban. And the real toxic players bait you into an argument, compliment the other players. Then they tell enemy and rest of team they were friendly too to report you ending up with at least 3-4 people reporting you. Where you can only report them once meaning no one sees their crappy behavior or ignores it. This is why i just act friendly all the time and dont respond to negativity as hard as it is to ignore =( i know your pain buddy. \n\nOne tip. Mute all chat on weekends, 3pm -6pm. Or just instant mute people who get angry.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-02-12T14:29:59.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And once again, it seems like I'm getting punished for being abused...\nThe whole game everyone was abusing me, literally everyone on my team.

If he was punished then it means the system deemed his behaviour unacceptable, it doesn't matter who instigated it.

That's what the chat filter is for right?
