Playing &quot;higher&quot; than your division doesn&#039;t gain you ELO, getting decent teams that also play well gains you ELO. \r\n\r\nYoloQueue is literally gambling, it&#039;s no wonder it&#039;s so addictive","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-09T09:59:19.837+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"No it's not.\n\nBoosting exists, therefore your point is invalid.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-14T03:38:53.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you can be boosted by another player then another player can drag you down. \nLogic.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-14T06:40:46.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fact is playing at a higher standard then your MMR (or the MMR of the account) means you will rise, boosters are proof that having a team of feeders makes no difference, cause they will still win at a rate of 90%+ on accounts they are boosting, very few games are unwinnable if your actually playing to win rather then playing to not lose.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-04-14T00:38:21.977+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually until you get to high elo this point is incredibly true.\n\nLower level players do not understand their limitations and therefore will keep putting themselves in dangerous areas trying to outplay their enemy so they keep feeding throughout the game and that is the effect of snowballing.\n\nThis will happen tenfold at lower level over higher levels. I would like to be at a higher level so the enemy can't 1 shot me with 1 ability due to them going 15-0 at 15 mins.\n\nI have to rely on my team not to feed profusely in order to have any impact mid-late game.\n\nEveryone who says otherwise does not have the knowledge or experience.\n\nBoosters just play stupid carry roles that low elo do not know how to stop.\n\n99% of bronze players deserve to be there and the other 1% get completely dismissed because of the other 99% who claim they are better than they are.\n\nIf people used logic to dictate what they do and not emotions then we would have reached a very high level meta by now one that was not even set by the professionals.\n\nI currently have a 70%+ win ratio with ashe and jinx both of which I focus primarily on cs above all else. Since at low elo they take all kills possible from the carries. This happens on both sides making cs a more effective path to take for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-04-09T10:38:34.478+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Until you get to high Elo, this is false.","replies":[]}]}
