It would easily solve problems like today for instance, where I get a troll AFK jungler. Yes, I reported him both times but that will have no effect as my &quot;dobber&quot; level is ludicrously high (I find myself having to report one player per game almost). \r\n\r\nJust make it so you can only block people you&#039;ve reported so the system can&#039;t be abused. There are numerous players for numerous reasons that I&#039;d happily never play with or against again. Make my queue time longer? I don&#039;t care, I play to have a fun competitive game, I can wait the extra time","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-15T05:48:32.430+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">Just make it so you can only block people you've reported so the system can't be abused. \n\nI now report people that are really good or really bad.\n\nSystem is now abused.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-05-15T06:01:25.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really good ones will get penalised so you wont actually be able to play with them....","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-05-15T06:07:24.529+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But you won't play against them","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-15T07:42:55.974+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=lBleXd1M,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-05-15T06:07:24.529+0000)\n>\n> But you won't play against them\n\nyeah saw this idea before, lots of flaws","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-15T08:37:27.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your main?","replies":[]},{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-05-15T05:00:30.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And again, had two AFKs in this game.
