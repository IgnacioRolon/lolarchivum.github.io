Everyone leaves the lobby without reporting the player except someone on the other team reports me for asking to report someone...\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been really trying to improve my attitude but honestly, this community has no interest in making the game a better place.

When I go through my bad spells (currently going through one now actually) I generally get a report per match. It equates to nothing. I've been chat restricted a number of times but it's pretty damn hard to get restricted. \n\nSo what you're trying to say is that I can bully someone, abuse the crap out of them but as long as I don't do it in all chat then I should get away with it? Because if he reports me, I'll just report him back which basically counteracts his report.
