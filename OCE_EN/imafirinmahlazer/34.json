That is their policy. It gets really fuzzy around when it's because the client crashed. To stay on the safe side, and considering how little LP you actually lose for this happening, I'd say you won't get your LP back and your account will be marked for queue-dodging.\n\nYou can [submit a support ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) about it and see if they can do anything about it, specific to your account. Have you tried repairing your client thus far (back up item sets first!)?","replies":[]}]}
