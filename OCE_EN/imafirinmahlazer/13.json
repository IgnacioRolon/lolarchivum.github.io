But my new goal is to purge the toxic players that I meet. I don&#039;t encourage them to be toxic other than being a positive player, but the more fuel they give the more likely they will get banned :)","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-13T09:10:21.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-13T10:23:52.778+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe it was a girl, you dont know.","replies":[{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-13T14:06:58.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"true, i am sorry","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-13T09:49:13.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you just not","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-13T10:20:33.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Not just you can","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-13T07:50:25.750+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you remove the offending summoners names from your post as naming and shaming is NOT allowed on the boards and will only result in your thread being deleted.","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-02-13T08:04:52.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I filtered the names....they aren't the real summoner names...\nBut as requested.

If you did something the system deems unacceptable then it will punish for it. It doesn't matter what instigates the behaviour or what other factors are in play, if you demonstrate inappropriate behaviour then the system will punish. Two wrongs don't make a right, and reacting to abuse with more abuse only makes double the abuse.\n\nBasically, as far as the system is concerned, there aren't really any other factors that are relevant. The policy is basically, that kind of behaviour is unacceptable, regardless of reason.\n\nThat's the simplest way I can put it. Hopefully it addresses your concerns somewhat.
