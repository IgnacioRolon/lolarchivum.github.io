If you choose not to, and begin a flame war with the other person, how can you not be to partly blame?\n\n Like I said before the rules apply to everyone, you're not excused from punishment because he was attacking you. The fact is, by flaming back you've done the same thing he did, and should get the same punishment.\n\n2. **Report**\n\n People seem to believe they don't work. Chat related reports are actually extremely accurate and effective.\n\n If someone is clearly toxic, they will be punished. It doesn't matter if they use offensive language or passive-aggressive speech, the system will pick up on it. \n\n It will not though, identify that you were the victim and excuse you from verbal abuse offenses.\n\n3. **Don't flame back.**\n\n  There is no reason to respond to anyone who is toxic. It will never lead to a productive conclusion, it will never lead to an understanding and it will never lead to an end where someone wins.\n\n If you choose not to mute that's your choice, but just make sure you don't feed the fire. Concentrate on winning, not chat.\n\n4. **De-escalate.**\n \n If someone does flame at you and you feel like helping them out. Respond in a respectful way that disarms the the situation.\n\n Usually blaming Riot is great for this ;)\n\n _\"who the fuck fed lee sin, u guys are all shit\"_\n\n _\"we all messed up, it's just riot balance is terrible, no champion should have that much damage and mobility lol :D\"_\n\nI hope this helps just a little bit.\n\nIf you want more information on Riot's report system or behavioral research, I'd suggest checking out these 2 talks, [here](http://gdcvault.com/play/1017940/The-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player) and [here](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022160/More-Science-Behind-Shaping-Player). They go over what Riot's PhD psychologists think and act, when given common player behavior issues.\n\nYou could also ask Riot Lyte any questions directly [here](https://ask.fm/RiotLyte).","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-07T08:03:46.636+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think the issue is more that the instigator is also verbally abusing but receives no punishment.\n\nIf it sounds retarded thats because it is, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.\n\nId name and shame a few people who i know get away with this crap but thatd break tos.\n\nAnd id get banned for trying to deliver justice to the people who actually need to get banned.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-07T21:52:43.974+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your concern here.

Not to mention going to the \"Riot Police\" actually has negative impact. Toxicity wise I used to be way worse and I never ONCE received anything worse than a chat restriction. No queue bans or anything. Majority of these guys do not receive punishment.\n\nI'm arguing that if a player has been bullying someone, the victim should have some leniency. I got my chat logs back this morning and all 3 examples had me requesting to report the abusers/bullies. No one ever reports those guys, everyone is out of post game lobby instantly. So you're 100% wrong, the bad guy wins 99% of the time, whilst the victim gets punished.\n\nHell I'm not even negative when someone on my team is having a poor game because I don't want to ruin my chances of winning.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-08T04:29:25.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Toxicity wise I used to be way worse and I never ONCE received anything worse than a chat restriction.\n\n+ The improved system we have now is fairly recent and came into effect around 9 months ago. If you were toxic before then, it's likely you were not banned.\n\n Lets be clear here though. The new chat based report system is almost flawless. No one is getting away with reportable offenses. If someone is not banned, you either didn't report them or it wasn't serious enough.\n\n> Majority of these guys do not receive punishment.\n \n+ Why do you think this? You were clearly banned, so the system is working to some extent.  \n\n Do you think the automatic system discriminates against victims? Well, it doesn't.\n \n The truth is, if you were banned but the _\"culprit\"_ was not. It's likely your behavior was actually toxic and his was not that bad at all.\n\n> I'm arguing that if a player has been bullying someone, the victim should have some leniency. \n\n+ If there was no mute button, this would be valid. But there is a mute button, so why didn't the _\"victim\"_ mute? Does he like being the victim?\n\n You don't need to answer back to anyone, this isn't a verbal form of self defense. _**Mute and move on.**_\n\n> No one ever reports those guys, everyone is out of post game lobby instantly.\n\n+ One report is enough for punishment. You don't need the whole team reporting one person. If you report someone for offensive language and the evidence is there, he will be banned or punished.\n\nI urge to keep an open mind and consider that if you are getting banned, but the other party isn't, it may be the case that you are actually the problem.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-02-07T08:20:21.507+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"not hard to mute somebody nobody is physicly in your face forcing you to listen to them","replies":[{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2016-02-09T12:06:00.641+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you mute trolls they will report you for not working as a team silly : >","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DarkDerma","date":"2016-02-07T03:48:45.045+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Amen","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-08T09:49:56.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I couldnt agree more Crepe!!!!
