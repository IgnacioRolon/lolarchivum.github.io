But every promo I get one or two players that can&#039;t even play their champs properly. Someone jokingly said you have to carry to prove you&#039;re worthy of a promotion but that is literally what it feels like. I shouldn&#039;t have to carry my entire team, just to win my promos, especially when some teams just don&#039;t want to be carried","replies":[{"poster":"Myster10","date":"2015-04-08T04:36:26.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually yes, you have to carry.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TotoDudmas","date":"2015-04-07T06:07:05.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol yep","replies":[]}]}
