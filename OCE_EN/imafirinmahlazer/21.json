Yet, if someone bullies me or AFKs/trolls me, I&#039;m going to give them a piece of my mind. And then I get punished for doing this? Play out my restriction, don&#039;t get reported, I even PRAISE people with my limited chats as Riot previously mentioned in my previous restriction I didn&#039;t do anything bad, but I didn&#039;t do enough praising? (MAYBE BECAUSE I CANT COMMUNICATE!?). Anyway, couple of games later I get restricted again out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nSo here I am, restricted, unable to direct/co-ordinate anything with my team whilst the guys that AFKd or belligerently abused me, don&#039;t face any consequences. Purely because Riot has something against my account. So bad that I have to post from this account because they perma banned me from the board on my main account.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story, Riot favors bullies","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-04-27T10:34:19.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YOU ACTUALLY GOT PUNISHED FOR BAD BEHAVIOUR ON OCE??!?!?! I'm being legit serious, I thought only Leaver Buster worked.

And then you contact Riot asking them to fix it, they don't, then begin to threaten to ban your account due to \"suspicious activity\".....WELL DUH, I GOT HACKED. Anyway, they didn't ban but they left me with the rep. So now it literally takes one report for anything, to chat restrict me. On an account that has probably spent close to $1000 on skins. Way to repay the customer Riot! :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-04-26T11:45:15.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once again, get an AFK in my promos.

And I am always positive to my team, even whilst currently chat restricted I still use one of my msgs to congratulate someone on a good gank or play knowing that I will not be able to use it for strategy. What I don't tolerate is people intentional feeding or AFKing as they are not only wasting my time but wasting my MMR.
