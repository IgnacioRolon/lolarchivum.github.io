I&#039;ve spent the last year awarded a prestigious scholarship, I do community work, I&#039;m extremely positive and supportive of my friends. \r\n\r\nSo I was kind of shocked, yet not surprised, when I found out that my main account *is in the TOP 20 most toxic accounts on Oceanic*\r\n\r\nWell, let&#039;s be honest, I wasn&#039;t super surprised but, I feel that my online presence doesn&#039;t correlate with me, as a person. And then it clicked. This game brings out my inner asshole. Not as in, my butthole spreads like a reversible t-shirt, but the people I play against, bring out the worst in me. \r\n\r\nSo, as a bit of fun I figured I&#039;d start a little blog, aptly named how LoL turned me into an asshole. I&#039;m going to screenshot all the abuse I get in game. I am going to be positive ALL of the time, to highlight what disgusting people play this game. I can&#039;t wait to hear the terrible things you have to say :)\r\n\r\nTLDR: flame me and you&#039;re going to get publicly shamed","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-30T21:23:46.459+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL didn't turn you into an arsehole, you already were one.

That said I had an idea how to fix this beyond just mutting someone in this post:\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/GD/9w5gEUU3-should-leaver-buster-be-changed\n\n This concept basicly says \"if you are an asshole, we are kicking you out of our match\". I realy do think that something like that will get rid of the anonimity factor becouse all that will matter is how you behave and people will have the power to \"hot fix\" the problem during the match itself.

I am a pretty good guy IRL if I do say so myself. I have friends, I don't have anyone that hates me to the core, and I am a bit of a goody-two-shoes.\n\nUsually I'm like this in game too. I try to keep calm, even when losing. I stick around after the game to chat with the players, and I rarely ever flame at someone for simply making a mistake.\n\nHowever, sometimes there is just that one player that occasionally gets under my skin and I will start to get angry, upset, lose clear thinking and eventually rage. It's not even \"bad team mates\" (Everyone on the team has responsibility for losing/winning), getting outplayed (I will almost always admit I did gooft or they were just a better player), or losing a highly contested objective (if they get dragon/baron, then that's all there is to it), but it is the ***Attitudes*** of players that really annoy me. \n\nFor example, I hate it when I am supporting say a Lucian, and then they just randomly dash into a 1v2 in lane and expect me to react before getting insta-gibbed by his two opponents, and then proceeds to flame me for not helping out in the 0.6 seconds he was alive after his dash.\n\nOr say I am jungling as Fiddlesticks, and then I get flamed for not ganking when I'm like lvl2 with no effective way of ganking successfully to burn flash or get a kill. Also, getting flamed for not getting a dragon after I sweeped the pit, missing a ward by ~20 units (told by other jg) and getting it stolen from me.\n\nAnd the last thing, is having an enemy type in [all] chat how much he wrecked me, then calling me bad when I still kill him, and then proceeding to continually trash talk and such.\n\nThese are the things that release the inner hole of the butts and what spawns inside even the most sensible and calm players a seed of mass distraction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-30T23:25:54.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know exactly what you mean. I think it's mainly the community, it's like some old school lesson, if you hang out with assholes then you're gonna inevitably turn into one. Obviously you're not hanging out with the League community but if you're listening to the flaming and abuse all the time then it is very difficult to stay positive mentally and it does rub off on you a bit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vive La France","date":"2015-03-30T19:24:15.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool....{{champion:34}} ","replies":[]}]}
