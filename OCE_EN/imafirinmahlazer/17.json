Being chat restricted has been a real issue as I can&#039;t talk and socialise with other players, it&#039;s literally because Riot has a vendetta against me and I must be on their watch list or something (they just made me change my name too). \r\n\r\nBeen playing fine, ACTIVELY praising other players. Get restricted again...ok...must be some residual reports or something. Play them out....CONTINUING TO BE POSITIVE AND PRAISING AS RIOT SUGGESTED. Now I have another 25 game restriction after telling people that they shouldn&#039;t be rude in post game chat as I&#039;m battling depression. \r\n\r\nRIOT, EXPLAIN","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-28T08:49:41.304+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2015-04-28T09:37:24.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually 90% of the community is great to talk with and fun to banter with.

It's literally been a case of what I've said in my other comments, telling people they shouldn't be so rude and being called a variety of things in return, as well as being reported. Yes, I've found out the hard way you can be banned for being positive.\n\nAnd nasty to my team? As I've stated everywhere else, I only abuse those that waste my time. Be it AFKing or trolling, I never actually say anything negative to anyone if they're trying, even if they're negative KDA. We all have bad games, I sure as hell have some. But what I cant stand is people purposely trying to ruin the game","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-28T09:41:24.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you need to leave League of Legends and do something else.

The funny thing is you're probably one of the people I'm talking about. I was just saying to the other team that they shouldn't say horrible things to other players, using my current situation AS AN EXAMPLE, NOT AN EXCUSE. \n\nWhat I'm asking is why do I get punished for trying to the right thing. I just got reported for telling the other team that I reported their AFKing as they were requesting I did. Their ADC then reported me, for reporting her.
