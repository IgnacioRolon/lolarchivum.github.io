Playing Malz mid was working well for me but its way too inconsistent. Looking for a champ that I can just play non stop to gain ELO. I tried cheesing with Trynd but that relies too much on the other 4 being able to atleast go even in lane. I&#039;ve been playing every day and not getting the results I want, no I&#039;m not taking a break because I&#039;m addicted so just let me get to Plat then I&#039;ll take a few months off","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-30T14:37:02.323+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Playing Malz mid was working well for me but its way too inconsistent.\n\nIt's inconsistent because of two facts.\n1) Malz is mostly good at winning lanes, not games.\n2) Your at about the elo where QSS is actually an item that gets bought and used consistently.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-30T16:00:20.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say your point 2 is one of the reasons why your point 1 is wrong.\nIn saying that, Assassin mids really don't have any trouble dealing with Malz's delayed Q. Or his Dmg over time abilities. You'd have to be pretty damn good at landing your silences to stand an even chance at winning lane.\nMalz needs his jungler to babysit him all game. H\ne has no tools to get away from jungler ganks. \nHis Ultimate has a very small but really noticeable delay. It's annoying the number of times an Ahri Charm cast at the same time as your ult ruins the whole combo.\nHis combo requires champions to stay still before him ulting. Meaning he needs some peel to consistently work it off.\n\nI just feel like he's really not good to SoloQ with at all. He is clearly outclassed by Swain in his specific role.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-04-30T16:42:14.815+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just feel like he's really not good to SoloQ with at all.\n\nHis actually better in soloQ then in any team based area because in a team based area he is straight countered by anything.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-04-30T16:50:54.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, that's true.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-05-02T15:05:39.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  I just feel like he's really not good to SoloQ with at all. \n\n\nPretty sure he actually has one of the highest winrates in soloQ at the moment. His w is super good vs all the cinderhulk junglers who stack hp and dont get mr til their 4th or 5th item","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Snek boi","date":"2015-05-06T04:14:28.982+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's not a single champ that will help get you carried from gold to plat, i would suggest maining 3 champions in every role as well as 3 main roles in case you dont get your preferred role.
