He voices all of his frustrations out in chat, and found himself permabanned.\n\nI am more toxic than this friend. The difference is that I say what I am thinking out loud, to prevent it from creating a negative atmosphere in game. I know that the words I say in chat can make or break team morale and directly influence the game. \n\n* Toxic speaking out of game, ridiculously positive, encouraging, motivational words in game.\n\nIf you have constructive criticism to give, wait till the end of game. In game, virtually nobody wants to be told how to play. Especially in bronze. Once you are out of game, put yourself in their shoes. \n\n* Is their score super ultra trash?\n*  Have they copped abuse from other members of your team? \n\nThen they probably don't want to hear your advice and just want to move on as fast as possible. \n\nEven if you and your GF only let lose \"once in a while\", you can still end up being punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-05T07:06:45.074+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's actually easier to say nothing at all.","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2016-05-05T11:17:25.247+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xrxrEEGVdM&spfreload=10 \nLET RONAN KEATING EXPLAIN IT FOR US ALL","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-05T14:45:19.012+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.
