I know chat restrictions work, I&#039;ve been restricted from getting bullied and talking back. But what about intent feeding or AFK? Like if it&#039;s only one game every so often, do they not recieve any penalties? I feel like I&#039;m left with no choice but to abandon my account as it has a high toxic and dobbing rating, meaning my reports more or less have no effect\r\n\r\nAtleast it will be a fun journey to 30 again and I&#039;ll get to hone my skills and learn the OPs (Riven, Zed, Lee Sin). Just a shame you can&#039;t do a skin transfer, I&#039;ve got some pretty rare skins on my main :(","replies":[{"poster":"Teradactyal","date":"2015-04-01T02:27:19.241+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hope they do but without a tribunal (still!!!)in OCE its unlikely here.....","replies":[]},{"poster":"gotbannedagen","date":"2015-04-01T09:39:45.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah feeders dont get banned.

I can't give away the details but I can say that it is quite easy for intentional feeders to be banned for long periods of time or even permanently suspended.\n\nFrom our PB FAQ:\n\n\"**Intentional Feeder Detection**\n\n**What about intentional feeders?**\n\nThere is a separate system that focuses purely on feeders. If someone is feeding intentionally in multiple games then they will face temporary account suspensions and possible bans if they show no signs of reform.\"\n\n[Check out the FAQ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq) for more details on other Player Behaviour systems.","replies":[]}]}
