Realistically, probably a long time coming. Numerous chat restrictions, mostly due to going through an extremely difficult time in my life and some players testing my mental stability. \r\n\r\nI had been working hard on reforming and had improved my behaviour. No restrictions for quite sometime. Progressing my way back up to Diamond and in my promos I had one guy boasting that he was account sharing and playing on his friends account. After some bullying and verbal abuse towards me I got frustrated and gave a bit back.\r\n\r\nThis is what cost me my ~$800 account. No lead up warning, no &quot;you are getting dangerously close&quot;, just there goes your account. Needless to say I was disappointed. I know I had misbehaved in the past, but in all honesty, considering I never intentionally fed, never AFK&#039;d and never acted not in retaliation, I feel like I wasn&#039;t anywhere near as bad as the majority of players I come across. To be honest if my actions were bad enough to get perma-banned then literally ~70% of the players I come across should not have their accounts. \r\n\r\nI know each time you get a restriction it states &quot;repeat offences can result in permanent punishment&quot;, but it had been such a long time since I received any punishment and figured my account &quot;karma&quot; was heading towards a positive grading. I personally think that the account should be notified when close to such a severe punishment. \r\n\r\nI am in no way stating that my behaviour didn&#039;t warrant a punishment under Riots strict policy (it was literally just some swearing). It just would have been nice to have some heads up that&#039;s all. I&#039;d state that I will not be spending any money on any of my accounts but what does Riot care, they&#039;ve already got most of my money from my banned account.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-17T04:31:08.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I didn't read this post and I already agree with the title. \nSorry OP I didn't bother to read but my opinion is, is that doesn't matter what you're gonna get perma'd for, you should get an official notice before saying \"oh keep doing this and it will result in a permaban etc\"\n\nOk I should read your post gimme a second.\n\nOk I read it.

AFKs get you in low priority queue and you have to wait the queue time? do time? ha i'm so fkn funny) in OP's case he doesn't 'pay a fine', the police/government 'delete' his car with no refund.\n\nThough I should add that they 'delete' his car and his 'efforts' in 'maintaining' it (leveling up, ranking up etc) and regardless of what custom upgrades he added (skins which cost money) they delete it as a whole regardless.\n\nbut eh rito makes money off dis sht so dey wont listen lelelel","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-17T06:36:35.876+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It does fit though.\n\nYou get caught speeding once - get a fine\nGet speeding again, get another fine\n\nContinuing to get caught, get your licence suspended\nEven more, complete removal of your licence, and potentially your car if the police deem you to be dangerous.\n\nSame with Riot, except replace speeding with toxicity, fines with penalties, etc.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-17T08:23:55.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Corehog,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1pTqVEWI,comment-id=000200000000000000000000,timestamp=2016-06-17T06:36:35.876+0000)\n>\n> It does fit though.\n> \n> You get caught speeding once - get a fine\n> Get speeding again, get another fine\n> \n> Continuing to get caught, get your licence suspended\n> Even more, complete removal of your licence, and potentially your car if the police deem you to be dangerous.\n> \n> Same with Riot, except replace speeding with toxicity, fines with penalties, etc.\n\nEh, you got me there, wp wp\n\nI guess on the big picture though no matter what 'penalties/fines' you get, having your car completely removed or an account completely deleted still seems like a real big jump from any other penalty.\n\nLike I feel like with the introduction of Low Priority Queue Riot's 'made it easier' to redeem oneself from lets say AFKing whereas back in my day (I feel so old wtf) there were things like \"your account is suspended for x amount of days due to whatever reason\", in my personal opinion that feels longer and harder than completing Low Priority Queue games.\n\nBut still, I do feel for OP but since he has multiple accounts to play on, I only feel sorry for the fact that he said his main had $800 or so spent on it (and I'm assuming it's the highest rank out of all his other accounts since it's his main).\n\nDw OP I still feel for ya","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-06-17T09:14:08.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as i am concerned no bans should occur for text, players have this thing called a mute button.\nAlso no bans should be perma ban for all forms of the game.

The tribunal seems very harsh for minimal offences when weighed against the amount of abuse i face on a daily basis in the gaming community, if the majority of players are indicative of the general behaviour and the bans are handed out on a balance scale to what i have personally experienced then I am unsure how the game is self sustainable since there will be about 1/10th of the players left.  Or do people just keep making new accounts to troll over and over again?   If this is the case they need to start banning IP's not accounts. I would like to get a riot response the the working mechanics of what seems to be a unbalanced tribunal systems.  As the OP said, some transparency.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-17T03:48:22.797+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"bye","replies":[{"poster":"IMAFIRINMAHLAZER","date":"2016-06-17T04:47:55.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's ok I'll still be around, making low division players tilt","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-17T06:25:22.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XrL_F6tnT4","replies":[]}]}]}]}
