I decided that because I purchased another $50 card i&#039;ll use some. And so I did- I bought Dark Star Thresh which was on sale and shouldn&#039;t have cost 1350, but only 975. This came on my purchase history as 1350 though. Secondly, I purchased a mystery ward skin for 380 rp. Instead I was overcharged again and my rp dropped from 2900 (Yes, I did complete some other purchases which worked out fine) to 1500- Just for the 1 ward skin.\n\n\nSo overall, My RP dropped from ~4900 to 1548 after a purchase of Deep sea Nami (On sale and only charged 975), 1 Ward skin and Dark Star Thresh (Which was on 27% sale). I was overcharged at least once through my purchases. \n\nCould I please have a Riot Employee look through my account purchase history and refund me my &#039;lost(overcharged)&#039; RP please. Thanks.\n\nP.s. I have launched a support ticket already.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-26T08:05:32.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As Seph said, support is the way to go here, but to clarify something for you, 1350 RP is the correct sale price for DS Thresh, as it is a Legendary tier with a full price of 1820RP. Deep Sea Nami which is an Epic 1350RP skin comes down to 975RP.\n\nThe total for the purchases you listed should be 1350+975+380 = 2705RP","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-12-26T07:47:03.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe best thing to do in this situation is to wait for a response to your support ticket, we here on the boards are unable to assist with account specific inquiries.\n\nPlease refrain from \"bumping\" your ticket or replying unnecessarily as this will only further delay a response to you.","replies":[]}]}
