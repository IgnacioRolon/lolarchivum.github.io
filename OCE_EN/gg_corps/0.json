Its like we are back in season 1/2 of NA with less options dare i suggest we get to play a dominion once in a while. Lets be honest though who wants to sit in a queue for 40mins. I don't think riot should get to decide that if I really want to play a map that has a long wait time isn't that my choice there is nothing wrong with the servers or the maps just riots choice to allows us to join those q's/maps heaven forbid people get bored of 3's maybe then we won't have as many leavers or dc's. Come on riot its been a year sort something out.","replies":[{"poster":"The Bong King","date":"2015-02-15T15:43:20.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please bring Twisted Treeline to OCE permanently.

Not only that but TT is such a great map that I think riot may need to put a little more effort into popularizing the TT competitive scene (Although this might be for another thread, and also with its own difficulties).\n\nI understand where Klavinmour may be coming from but I'm sure Riot are not lacking in resources. Also no one gets anything if they don't ask!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-06T14:05:53.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However, we do have Teambuilder a lot more than we used to. The community is slowing, and I too wish it would grow faster. Give it time :'(\nI wish Riot would have us RAF though.

It's the community.\n\nWe simply can't support every queue type because we don't have a large enough population on the server.\nIf you want 3v3, good for you, go recruit another 200,000 people to play regularly like every other server has, then you will get your wish.","replies":[]}]}
