I have only about 800 wins in normal  and i feel like i still play like someone who&#039;s like lvl 20. I don&#039;t have much knowledge of the things i should from playing as long as i should. For example when i should build certain items and when i should do different things. I don&#039;t know how to freeze a lane or do a lot of mechanical stuff in game. I really need some help because i feel like i&#039;m  a quite bad player for my playtime. Please, some help would be appreciated. I really need to learn these things. I have friends who started playing a long time after me and still proceed to always play better than me and have a lot more knowledge of different things. \n\nI apologise if this doesn&#039;t make much sense or it&#039;s hard to understand. \n\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-02T04:50:14.756+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll help you, my friend. I'm very good at the game.\n\n1. It's never your fault. If you're an ADC, it's the supports fault for not giving their own life for you. You, as the ADC, are more important than them.\n2. If you get ganked and die, blame the support for not warding, despite the fact you still have your trinket. You're not a support, you don't ward.\n3. If you're midlane and you die, it's the junglers fault.\n4. If you're the jungler and you die, it's top/mid/bots fault as they should have helped you. They need your ganks so they should flash into that Jinx ult because you overstayed.\n5. If you're toplane and you die, don't cry about it. Simply /all report my jungler, useless. Thanks.\n\nIf you lose the game, don't be upset. Sometimes it's not possible to carry those animals and you lose some games. It's not your fault.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-06-29T00:19:30.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"highly recommend watching this series!\n\nCreated by students from University of New South Wales.
