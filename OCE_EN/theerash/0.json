I just find that without proper support i can get bogged down (I&#039;m not good enough to carry tbh).\r\nMid - Some champs i can,some I can&#039;t. Matchups throw me off, etc. I feel i&#039;m not good enough mechanically to make a real difference.\r\nJg - I&#039;ve only really jungled with WW and i&#039;ve had great success. Apprently he is not really effective once it comes to higher ranked games?\r\n\r\nAny ideas you may have would be welcome!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-03T10:26:19.205+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, support main here. Support is a great role to carry with, even in bronze. \n\nBut you have to be experienced to carry. Just **Janna** shielding people and trading some auto-attacks will not carry the team. There are ways to carry on passive supports like **Janna** and **Soraka**, but it's quite hard for low elo players. \n\nI'd recommend getting into _\"lane winner\"_ supports or _\"play maker\"_ supports. Let me explain;\n\n+ Lane winners are champions like **Sona** **{{champion:37}}**,** Nami** {{champion:267}}, **Bard** {{champion:432}}... etc.\nThese guys are usually really easy to win lane with. They have high poke and strong sustain, this means that even if your ADC trades badly, you can just heal to full. \n\n This is great in bronze because people tilt easily and don't know how to come back from games very well. Since it's so easy to win lane with them, you're almost guaranteed to go positive or even in the laning phase.\n\n These champions will teach you to be aggressive, focus poke on ADC, and have good positioning. \n\n The one draw back these_ \"lane winners\"_ have is that they often struggle against burst and engage. Although champions like **Nami** and **Bard** can be mastered to somewhat overcome this.\n\nThe next group of champions are _\"play makers\"_. My personal favourite :D\n\n+ These guys are every ADC's worst nightmare, tanky, lots of damage, and shit tons of engage. Champions like **Leona** {{champion:89}}  , **Thresh** {{champion:412}}, **Blitzcrank** {{champion:53}} and **Nautilus** {{champion:111}}... etc.\n\n These guys can solo ADC's in the early game, while also having so much CC to lock them down in ganks and fights. A good player can be as impactful as a jungler, and will snowball games to crazy levels if given the chance. But, they also play great from behind, and have decent peel in their kits.\n\n These champions will teach you how to; roam, trade smartly, capitalize on mistakes and peel.\n\n The downside to these guys is, that winning lane isn't as straightforward as with **Sona**. If you make a mistake, you don't have crazy sustain to fall back on. Then the jungler will have to help you. They are also harder to play, **Thresh** and **Blitzcrank** are especially hard if your opponent is good.\n\nThat's essentially support in a nutshell. You'll need to learn how to play each of these guys individually, but I hope that what I put here helps.\n\nMost common supports will fit into these 2 categories or be hybrids (like **Taric** and **Alistar**). There are a few more categories of poke and denial supports, but that's getting a little niche. \n\nSorry for the long post!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-03T12:57:44.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly i don't think Sona is a good recommendation at all right now, so many champs do what she does better (hell Nami is basically a better Sona.)","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-04T02:32:59.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're correct on this.

These lanes will teach all those valuable lessons about self warding, roaming, TP, watching the mp. You WILL be punished many times and learn most lessons the hard way.

Pick something that puts out a lot of damage like Sona or Karma so you can pressure the enemy by yourself. If your ADC is absolutely useless, don't be afraid to roam more, such as ganking mid or helping your jungler invade.\n\nEven with that said, you'll always want to play something you like. You will perform better on what you like and practice with than just whatever someone else tells you  to play.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-03T10:32:16.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"love how thats the exact opposite of the other person's post","replies":[]}]}]}
