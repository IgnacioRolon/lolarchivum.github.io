This is because playing with 4 other randoms against a coordinated 5-man premade can be extremely frustrating in terms of the communication difference and becomes pretty unfair.\n\nI guess since there aren't really that many people queueing full 5-man groups it matches you as best it can.\n\nNot saying the system is perfect (as really playing against 4-man premades with a full solo team is rubbish too) but I'm pretty sure that's how the system is working.","replies":[]}]}
