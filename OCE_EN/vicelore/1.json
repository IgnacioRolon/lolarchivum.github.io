I had a really bad first season back in 2013 and had like a 25% win rate, Then went up to around 45 % in 2014 and finished around B4 went 9 / 10 wins in preseason and dropped into B3.  This season ive ive won 50 games lost 50 games. And still havent climbed out of B3 - B4.\n\nI get that my bad MMR from season 2013 etc is still effecting my grade ( Which is BS btw Riot) but apart from that.. \n\nHow does a player that wins every second game and has a healthy kda stuck in the second from the bottom ranking. \n\nSurley there are players getting less than 50 % win rate .. How can 95 Of players ( people ranked higher than me ) win more than 50 % of games. Where are all the players winning less than 50 % of their matches ??? The maths doesnt add up..\n\nIs the player base for B5 - B3 massive compared G5 - G3 ??","replies":[{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-05-27T03:09:24.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont think I deserve challenger. \n\nI do think im an average player, Id say average = to wining half their games..

No.\n\nLikewise, bad players with less than 50% winrate will drop ranks, and play against easier and easier players until they start winning half their games, at which point their winrate will also average out to 50%\n\nHaving a 50% winrate means you are at the ranking where your current skill level is.

Therefore, you are not better than the other. Secondly, you should she how the Gold or Diamond player play, they can have game they get smash but their cs, their objective is still stronger than the game you win in bronze. I have 2 acc, 1 is plat 5 and 1 is bronze 1 (this is my friend give to me because he's not playing anymore). My ave cs for laning heroes (not jungle and sup) is around 150 at 20 mins. Which means not really good, but compare to bronze, even they win lane really hard, their cs is about 100 at 20 mins. See the difference? Next, usually a winning team in gold or higher control dragon and other objective very good, they can push to t3 at 25~30 mins. With bronze, after winning their lane and take t1, they run around and have no idea what they doing. After that, they join team fight a lot but take no objective after each winning team fight, instead they spread out to get more farm which make me angry sometimes. So see the next difference? Winning lane in gold means their cs is away the other team around 20~30 cs or more, in bronze is they might have 2 kills but their cs is below 30~50cs which make no different. So you should see how the pro plays and said why you still stuck in bronze more than complain. It takes me 3 weeks to get from Bronze 1 to here, due to every time I got to series, they match me againts a bit higher rank and I try so hard but can't help to carry the team.
