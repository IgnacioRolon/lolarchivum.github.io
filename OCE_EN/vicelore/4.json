I had no way to escape and  knew it would result in death. \r\n\r\nAnyway I did this 3 times resulting in all outer inhibs going down and dieing 3 times. \r\n\r\nIt worked out for the team and pushed us to have the minions on our side and they could not recover from the minion onslaut.\r\n\r\nLooking back on it I dont think ive done such thing before but it seemed to work.\r\n\r\nWhats your thoughts on this kind of strategy when your stuck with a team that cannot close a game ( 80 % ) of games in bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-10T22:37:35.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on a few major things.\n\n1. Are you your main fed carry?\n\nIf you are this isn't the best thing you can do.\n\n2. Can your team win the ensuing 4v5?\n\nIf not, consider it a bit harder, because this is what your causing in exchange for this inhib, maybe losing a teamfight and being aced.\n\n3. Death timers\n\nThis always has to be a consideration.\n\nEDIT: Apparently it forced me into a number list by using numbers 2/3 in a list that starts there.\n\nI hate boards and it's horseshit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-10T22:06:36.072+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what you are likely to lose during the time you spend dead. If the enemy team is in a position to get an inhib in reply, or pick up an easy baron or teamfight victory because the rest of your team is really weak, its probably not worth it. If the enemy team is poorly coordinated and/or you have lots of turrets up and/or they're unlikely to gain much while you're dead, its probably worth it. In bronze i'd say it'll be worth it more often than not, though be aware that you will probably throw the occasional game now and then because of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-07-10T10:00:52.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is definitely worth it but try not to sacrifice yourself for it if it is very late game because when it is lategame all it takes is one person to get caught out of position and it will be GG. Unless you are in Bronze Elo where nobody have map awareness and doesn't end the game when they can. Either way round do try to make it out alive whenever possible because feeding kills to enemies is never a good idea unless you got a turret which is worth 125 global gold. If you are Tryndamere you just need to have your E and flash and your ult to make it out alive almost 100% unless the enemy have a lot of hard CC. Tryndamere's ult makes you immune to damage for 5s (but not CC) and you can E through walls. Flash should be self explanatory. If you have Teleport you can teleport back to base too there is a lot of ways you can escape as Tryndamere so try your best to run away and not get killed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-07-10T07:28:26.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on how hopeless your team is really and how far to one side most of the power between teams tilt.\n\nif its an even match definitely worth because likely they wont be able to push the minions back to take your towers ect. but then again that relies on death timers too. if they are too long then probably think of another strategy","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-07-10T06:48:35.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how long death timers are. A smart team will push a 4v5 advantage and take more than one inhib if the death timer is long enough.","replies":[]}]}
