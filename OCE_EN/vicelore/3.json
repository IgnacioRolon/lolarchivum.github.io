Just know it's not gonna be a straight up advantage.\n\n*example:\nlet's say your MMR and your duo friend's are, arbitrarily, 10, and being duo counts as a +2.\nAll numbers are made up and rounded for clarity (whoooo, i feel like a ritoer now! CLARITY!)\n\ncase 1:\nyour team: you and the duo (10&10, counted as 12&12), three randoms (a 10, a 14 and a 12)= average 12. enemy team are 10, 12, 12, 14, 13, 11, with an equal average of 12. You have better players in both teams, but you are way over your head.\n\ncase 2:\nyour team: 10&10 (12&12), 10, 11, 10. average 11 (actually 10). enemy team: 8, 13, 11, 12, 10. average 11. While you count as the best players in your team due to being duo, the \"best player\" in your team is barely the average level of the enemy team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2015-05-21T03:12:33.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are S5 and B3 so reasonably close.. \n\nThe point you make about one of us normally ending up as ADC or sup makes a good point.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-05-21T01:49:18.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's dependent on you and your duo...\n\nare you both average players in the same mmr? get away from each other\nare you both for example, silver 5 but both consistently do well and belong for example, silver 3-2? duoing in that scenario can be very good...\nbut you need your roles to connect... in general if you duo one of you will be first pick, the other 4th or 5th pick. \nyou can expect your duo partner to be forced support/adc so having a duo which is decent in those roles + another role is quite important.... \n\nso if I as silver 3 but felt a lot better than my current elo I would find someone of similar skill whose roles connected with mine, but they would also have to be decent at support/ADC in case they were forced into these roles...\n\nduoing is also good if you have a gold/plat/diamond/challenjour friend who's on a silver 5 account... basically free wins every time...
