And you can send a message to Riot by submitting a ticket to Riot Games Player Support at support.riotgames.com. If you're unsure where the ticket goes, submit it as a General Question. I'm sorry you had this negative experience, and please utilise the in-client report feature when possible.\n\nCheers!","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-21T05:44:33.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there a riot member in particular we can send this too?
