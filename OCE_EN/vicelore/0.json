This means that your 7 wins may have only boosted you up to like b3/b2 mmr, where as a new player starts at s3 (I think?) mmr, therefore even though he did pretty badly, he was placed in silver.\n\nThis applied to me as I used to duo with a lot of plat friends, thus making my mmr unusually high, when I did my placements I went from S1 (last season) to P4 (this season).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jehovahs Witness","date":"2014-12-10T01:58:40.934+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 of my friends got Silver V from winning 2 games...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Emit","date":"2014-12-10T02:10:56.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its based on how many wins you get out of those 10 matches and the mmr of your team and the enemies.

By your post it comes off that you are annoyed that you're still in bronze while your friend is in silver even though you had a difference in provisionals. If you think that is where you belong then you didn't really need to include it.\nI was wondering whether I should explain how placements work to you, but your rudeness makes me consider whether or not I should. I think I will anyway. Your position at the end is influenced by the number of games you win, of course, but not simply by that. It is also influenced by the people it set you up against and your performance against them. The system isn't going to match you up against bronze players for all of your provisionals if you are not a player with a low-bronze MMR. Otherwise, someone who belongs in silver five could have ten games about low to mid bronzes and get put in gold three for example, and that would just be stupid.\nWait no, ignore all things I have said that are constructive and my understanding of what is and is not relevant to the information you are ultimately seeking out and allow me to adopt a similar attitude to you.\nomg, thatz not wat u ment? nu u ar dumb %%%% oooh %%%%","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"vicelore","date":"2014-12-10T01:47:16.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SO im assuming normals effect your MMR ?

Here is my story feel free to make of it what you want)\n\nI screwed up my provisional games, the second I got 30 I jumped into ranked games and only won 2/10. I got placed Bronze 3.\n\nI stopped playing ranked for a while and practiced,\n1.) I learned how to CS properly (no idea how much of a difference this makes... cs at the start is more important than kills, at least in my opinion.)\n2.) I learned how to ward and get better vision (less deaths and I'm much harder to gank, it also makes it easier to know when to run to a different lane to help them out & get an easy kill/assist)\n3.)  I learned a bit more map awareness (kind of linked into the above)\n4.)  I learned how to play against all my counter champs for my main (no more me dying over and over again to Talon, Syndra...etc I now kill them).\n5.)  I stopped just going to any spot and actively asked at the start for the spots I was best at. (I don't always get them, but more often than not I do. its better for the team if I'm playing spots I'm good at rather than being hopeless).\n6.)  When someone rekt me in game, I sucked up my pride friended them and asked them what I did wrong that let them kill me most people were more than happy to tell me all the silly little things I did to leave myself open to being killed.\n7.)  I learned that Objectives are more important than running 3/4 of the way across the map chasing a super low HP champ.\n8.)  And the biggest thing I learned was when I first started playing ranked I thought I was a good player, but playing ranked and playing at higher MMR's is a completely different game. What works in normal games / low MMR's lets you snowball and win just doesn't work at higher MMR's and ranked games. in fact its usually the opposite, those super risky plays end up with you dying and the other team snowballing.\n\nI'm sill not the best player, but since learning those things, I have around a 70% win rate in ranked (some teams I get put with are worse than beginner bots, and I cant carry).\n\n*I made it out of Bronze 3 to Bronze 2\n*Then in Bronze 2 when I got to 73 LP I got a message \"you've been promoted to Silver V\"\n*Then just recently in my Silver V promo games I got a message \"You've been promoted to Silver 3\"\n\nIts just a shame it was all out of season 4 & in the pre-season so I didn't get the pretty borders...etc but I'm hopeful that I will make Gold.\n\nI have friends who started playing ranked at the same time I did, they also got put in Bronze 3 with me. They are both Bronze V now and just cant get out. When we play together in normal games, they get a a higher KDA than I do, but in ranked it seems that they just cant progress and cant get more than a 50/50 win ratio no matter what they try. I can see them making the same mistakes I did when I first started playing ranked but even when I tell them what I did to improve and get my rank up its seems that they don't think that's what it is, they know better and its that they are always in bad teams.\n\nI now have quite a few Diamond & Platinum friends who I play normal games with (and when I play with them we always get matched against gold / Plat / diamond players) and I can hold my own against them. They  keep insisting that I play more ranked games as I could easily get my rank up and that I'm much better than my current rank.\n\nAnyway, that's my story I hope that it could be useful for you to get out of bronze and I wish you luck!.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-10T10:27:11.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"depends on mmr\n\n> Am I the only one here that has noticed the swearing isn't censored!?!\n> Riot - have you finally gone and done it!?!\n> \n> Also your placement isn't just based on your number of wins, it depends on the current MMR pool of players you play with.
