Remember when we all transferred from NA to OCE?\r\nWell at that time everything was all fine and dandy. Until one day, ping went from 100 to 340. Like what?!\r\nSo after infinity years of searching to solve this problem i have yet to find a solution. Tried all sorts of methods from changing Internet Providers to\r\npurchasing fiber optics. I have also noticed all my other friends get the same problem. And it's getting worse. Every 2nd or 3rd game i find myself with teammates or opponents disconnecting and resulting in chaos and frustration. I'd like to hear a word from you guys.\r\nThank you for you concern\r\nThierry200 \r\nPS. i live closer to Australia than North america","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:32:43.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Every 2nd or 3rd game i find myself with teammates or opponents disconnecting\n\nIf you are playing games with random people then this should not be happening.\n\nAnd as for your connection, could you tell me if any results you get from going to this page http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/ turn up orange/red?","replies":[]}]}
