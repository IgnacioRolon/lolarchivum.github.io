Here are two diagnostic readouts.\n> \n> Anyone else with Telstra having issues at the moment?\n\nHi Havocry,\nI have been going through your results and have noticed some commonalities between the ones to our servers and the ones you have done to bigpond and google. Please see the image I have attached and notice the highlighted sections.\n\nAll these \"hops\" are within the Telstra network and no matter which service your and trace routing too (Our game servers, google or bigpond themselves) you are constantly getting a high connection to them. This indicates to me that the path your internet connection is taking is (nearly) always going through these hops and causing you high latency. Unfortunately there is not much we can do from here as it is Telstra's infrasturcture.\n\nWhat you could try doing (and I know you mentioned you have called them already) is speaking to their technicians with showing them the trace routes you have run and see if they can do anything about those hops having issues.\n\nSome common problems could be:\n1. congestion\n2. an issue with the hardware\n3. over subscription in that area\n\nSecondly I noticed you are using a wireless connection to your router, it is highly advised that using a wired connection is preferable when playing league as otehr factors can cause issues with wireless.\nFor example:\n1. ducted airconditioning\n2. storms\n\nWe are sorry you are experiencing these issues, but hopefully the information I have provided can enable you to work with Telstra to restore your connection to better, more enjoyable playing state.\n\n-ToxicHawk","replies":[]},{"poster":"Killkong1211","date":"2014-12-04T11:33:33.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reviving this thread as I'm experiencing the same issues.\nBegining about 9:10pm","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-11-30T18:20:47.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's something *very* dodgy going on with Telstra modems.\n\nVery long story short, try going into the modem settings and **changing the name of your wifi** and see if that fixes it.","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-12-02T03:33:04.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There's something *very* dodgy going on with Telstra modems.\n> \n> Very long story short, try going into the modem settings and **changing the name of your wifi** and see if that fixes it.\n\n**Yo I'm not kidding if you haven't tried this do so and let me know if anything changes please.

Helping the noobs understand technology.\n\nYeah pretty much tell your ISP that you will change service providers if they don't figure out the problem. That usually gets them going because if they don't seem interested in getting it fixed, they could lose their job. :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-30T23:44:33.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank God mine is fine, I wouldn't want to DC while playing a real game, like Final Fantasy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Victisaadi","date":"2014-11-30T12:39:58.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Telstra's been bought out by Vodafone iirc, and I've just been having awful ping spikes constantly.
