I&#039;m from South America so I used to play in Latin America North (LAN). But when I first transferred my account to OCE I realised that the direct transfers from LAN to OCE are unavailable {{summoner:3}} {{champion:32}} This makes me very sad because I travel constantly back home for a couple months to visit my family but I still live in Australia so my solution is to transfer my account constantly to keep enjoying the summoners rift at its most! \r\nI would like to know if theres any chance that in the future you guys open the direct account trasnfers from LAN to OCE since i find it quite unfair that theres so many posibilities of transfer (Including OCE to LAN) but the option from LAN to OCE is not available {{item:3073}} \r\nI hope you consider my request!\r\nThank you and have a great day {{summoner:31}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-11-29T11:57:48.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, it is very strange if this is a consistent issue you encounter. If it's just this time, it's because server transfers are still down for end of season, but you post makes it sound like this is a persistent problem for you?\n\nI know there has been quite a few transfer issues on OCE this past year, so it's possible you have just been unlucky.\n\nAt any rate, once transfers are back up, if a direct transfer is still not available, I'd recommend shooting a ticket through to support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIf for whatever reason direct transfers aren't available in the client, but the transfers themselves are possible, they can usually manually transfer you (they will still deduct the RP of course).","replies":[{"poster":"Revs","date":"2018-12-03T16:19:23.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Seras Dragon, but the problem is jsut that the transfer from LAN server to OCE server is just not an option, I've transfered my account before and what I have to do is transfer my LAN account to EU server or NA and then, transfer it to OCE. The direct transfer is just not an option which is very sad because I have to spend twice as much RP to trasnfer my account from LAN to OCE.\nI tried sending them a ticket but they said they can not manually transfer my account sicne it would be unfair to other players, they just suggested me to psot it here on the boards and hopefully get them to make the trasnfer an option. {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-04T03:20:57.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very odd, but it's out of my scope of knowledge.
