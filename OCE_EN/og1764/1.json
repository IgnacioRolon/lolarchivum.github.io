The fact that it's only Summoners Rift and only Normals - Blind Pick just feels very off to me\nAlso:\n>What if I don't have a Alistar Champion, do I still get the Black Alistar Skin?\n>\n>Yes. You may use Black Alistar upon purchasing the Champion.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense to me, cause I unlocked the Medieval Twitch, Grey Warwick, Riot Girl Tristana and Dreadknight Garen skins through the Refer a Friend and FB + Twitter promotions and they all unlocked the champions. They didn't \"become available when I bought the champion\" they give you the champion with the skin if you don't already own it.\n\nSo yeah I don't believe it but hey we'll find out for sure in 2 days lol","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-12T00:03:22.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Notice how you were looking at a GARENA page?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-11T23:37:27.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like a rioter made it, and there seem to be rioter comments in the comment section","replies":[]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-09-11T20:11:53.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its garena only it seems atm.. fingers crossed we get it over here..
