Riot could actually use NURF to make URF even better.\n\nIf Riot gave us NURF on Thursday, just before we get URF, then it will give the community a chance to try out the mode and more than likely come to hate it. However, that wouldn't be an issue in that situation. That would actually be a good thing, Since we'd be getting URF straight after we finished with NURF, it *should* actually improve the URF experience. The \"how\" of it is actually rather simple. Because NURF is effectively the opposite of URF, it will likely be a slow and boring mode, something people will come to hate quite easily. Because of that, people will be much more appreciative of URF, they will realise what they love about URF and the fun everyone manages to have with URF *should* be increased respectively. NURF could be the mode that gives URF that boost of awesomeness everyone is waiting for, if Riot utilizes it correctly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Anserem","date":"2016-04-17T01:07:10.001+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I read in a red post collection, that NURF was deemed terrible by the general quantity of Riot- apparently there would be situations where you would use your ult at level 6, and then by the time you upgrade your ult at level 11, you'd be able to use it again...\nIn my opinion, I wouldn't find that game-mode very attractive... but then again, some people liked Nemesis draft when it was trashed pretty badly by the community...","replies":[]},{"poster":"SexyChickenWings","date":"2016-04-15T15:06:15.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha i think the game itself is slow paced and if i'm correct \"NURF\" is the opposite of urf so it will be incredibly slow.
