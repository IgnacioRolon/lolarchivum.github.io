I think it would be great for a ton of people to join up at watch the worlds and cheer on whoever, regardless of whether the Chiefs make it or not.\r\nThanks,\r\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"GeneralCoxy","date":"2015-08-09T23:34:47.279+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey I am glad you had a great time. We are using satellite transmission for these events to make the quality as good as possible. We had some weather issues that caused some outages but I am glad you had a great time. We are looking at how we can use cinemas going forward for big events like worlds but only where we can maintain the quality of the stream.","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-09-08T10:23:14.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey GeneralCoxy, just as a follow up on this,\nDo we have any news of a Viewing Party occurring for the World's final in Perth?","replies":[]},{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-08-10T12:14:55.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does this mean that, as a result of there being a particularly bad storm on Saturday, a cinema stream won't be held in Perth? Obviously I'm more concerned with it occurring in the general location of the Perth Metro Area, while Riot would be more interested in the physical location. \nFurthermore is it likely to be dependent on the teams playing (ie, only if the Chiefs make it) or is it going to be on regardless of whether it's SKT or EDG or whoever.\nThanks,\nog1764\n\nps that Malzahar cosplay was pretty good","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"paddy984","date":"2015-08-12T10:34:52.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that Crown Casino is trying to organise something for worlds.\n\nThey just showed DOTA Internationals at their Sports Bar, they had all 3 big screens showing the games and want to do the same for League, they are just trying to find someone who can contact the WA fans and help organise/confirm numbers.","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-08-14T06:16:50.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So would this be ok for people who are under legal age?","replies":[]}]}]}
