However, when it is compared to the icons of other teams, in the OPL or otherwise, it looks pretty low quality, as seen in the attachment.\r\n\r\nIs there any way that this could be fixed so that it&#039;s a bit smoother? It looks pretty bad (in terms of quality) when I&#039;m loading into a game and I&#039;m always disappointed that such a nice icon looks so bad. Even if it&#039;s not done on Riot&#039;s end, is there any way that we would be able to edit them so that, for the individual at least, it looks a lot crisper?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-09-09T00:41:50.081+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey og1764!\n\nI'm assuming you're referring to the jaggedness? I agree it's a bit poop! I can assure you that the jaggedness isn't in the asset itself (I put it together).\n\nFrom my understanding as a designer, it's to do with the way the client sizes the icons down - it's not applying any anti-aliazing. Basically, when it crunches things into different sizes, it's not smoothing out the inbetweens.\n\nThe reason that some icons (like the Absolute icon) looks worse than others is due to the design itself - some colours/shapes lend themselves to look worse than others when there is no AA.\n\nSorry I can't provide any action items/solutions as I'm not involved with the client but I totaaaally feel the pain. One day... one day it will be fixed ><","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-09-09T02:11:14.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply Tomblade :)\nIs there any way that we would be able to go into the Riot Games files and smooth it out for ourselves? Or is this like an inherent coding issue where it just will not scale properly? If you made it really high quality would it scale better?","replies":[{"poster":"Tomatoblade","date":"2015-09-09T08:12:14.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man it's not really a problem with the graphic files themselves but about how the client processes it. If you were to get the file from the game and opened it on your computer, it won't look jagged but once its back in the client, the problem will still be there.\n\nTLDR; it's an inherent way with how the client does stuff and not related to the original file being used.","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-09-09T09:58:18.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers for the help, thanks :) It's a pity that the client works like that.
