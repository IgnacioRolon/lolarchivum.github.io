Buffing her attack range\nI understand that this could make her a little bit too powerful, but a small buff of 25 - 50 more units would probably make her more viable.\n\n2. Allowing Quinn and Valor to have separate cooldowns.\nThis also has the potential to skyrocket Quinn&#039;s power, however I feel that it could be fixed if, for example, Quinn&#039;s vault no longer provided a mark for 10 seconds after skystrike was used. This would give Quinn an escape after diving deep into enemy backlines, but not add significantly to her burst. If this is too mobile, then champions such as {{champion:7}} or {{champion:238}} should be looked at as well.\n\n3. Allowing Quinn&#039;s vault to position her in any direction.\nYou know how you can direct where Draven&#039;s axes will go if you click before the axe hits the champion? I believe it would make Quinn more playable if her vault allowed her to choose where she went. It would make it much easier to escape a mobility boots + alacrity + dead mans plate Shyvana, and it could also help her chase, by vaulting onto a minion to catch up. This would be done by vaulting onto a target and then clicking in a direction around that champion, and Quinn will vault to her maximum attack range in that direction. In order to make it a bit more fair, the range directly opposite where Quinn is standing could be reduced, and if there is no second click, vault could work as it does currently.\n\n4. Fixing her goddamn passive.\nIf Quinn&#039;s passive&#039;s AI were to be fixed, even just a little, I think this would help her a lot. I believe it should be random(ish) before attacking another champion, obviously prioritising low health minions in order of monetary wealth, and then sometimes marking champions. However, when in an engage, Harrier should mark the **lowest health** nearby champion. Not the one with the lowest percentage health. Quinn can easily chunk an ADC out in a few basics from half health, but not the 45% hp Nautilus sitting next to them. Making Harrier more reliable would also fit in their characters as being a dynamic duo. The sheer randomness of Harrier is personally an issue as she is more reliant on random chance than Twisted Fate. A damn Gambler.\n\nIf any of these considerations are taken into effect I believe that {{champion:133}}  will finally become a viable champion again, one that isn&#039;t completely ridiculed by everyone at every tier.\n\nThanks,\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-14T07:23:53.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"she is viable just go top with her and she is op","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-14T10:50:49.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or take teemo support and never lose lane due to the double blind","replies":[]}]}]}
