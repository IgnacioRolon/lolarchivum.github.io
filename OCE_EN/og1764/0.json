I&#039;d like to buy a mystery gift for a friend but that leaves me a few RP short of buying Championship Kalista at the 975RP that she&#039;s advertised for on the PBE. Is there any chance of that amount of RP being gifted **OR**, in a probably better scenario, of Championship Kalista being on sale when the skin is released?\nThanks,\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-10T05:13:16.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"87....................................................................","replies":[]},{"poster":"Infected Walnut","date":"2015-09-10T00:33:39.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah they rarely, if ever, give more than 30 rp","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2015-09-09T23:56:37.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At 87 you're probably dreaming but you can try draw a picture and submit it to support to see if they can help you out\nI imagine 87 might be a bit too far but can't hurt to try","replies":[]}]}
