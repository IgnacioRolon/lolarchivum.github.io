I&#039;m even more concerned as I haven&#039;t seen Atlus cast any of the games so far. Is he going to be casting? If he has already shout-casted, then feel free to tell me which games he has.\r\nThanks,\r\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-10-11T05:54:59.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's in fact going to be casting in 2 hours! =P\n\nAlso casted the first 3 games of day 6 of groups too if you missed it =)\n\nThanks for the support man, the world stage is reallllly big!","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-10-11T10:49:26.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries, I personally much prefer the OPL casters to many of the other LCS casters.\nWill you be casting in the quarterfinals, the semifinals, or even the final?
