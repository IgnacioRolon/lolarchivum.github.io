Would it be possible for each region to have their own snapchat (or have one big shared one) so that we can have a look at the players, the crowds, and the sets in a way that we could otherwise not be able to see. Even if NA / EU don&#039;t see this, I&#039;d love to see the behind the scenes for the OPL, even more so in the finals, where it&#039;s all on LAN and the players are there. \r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to see this happen, and in sure many others would love it too. It wouldn&#039;t be hard, and it might draw more people towards the OPL.","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-01-22T13:43:49.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi og1764, \n\nI'm the social media manager for OCE so I am probably the best person to answer this, for our region at least. \n\nWe currently share any behind the scenes content for the OPL on our existing social media channels; Twitter (primary), YouTube and Facebook. \n\nSnapchat is a trending social platform and may be more suited to sharing BTS content, but because there isn't as much engaging BTS content as compared to other regions like NA / EU (e.g. we don't yet have players playing in a live studio etc.), we don't have enough to share to warrant it. It's a pretty poor experience to have players follow an account just to see a piece of content once every few weeks.\n\nWhat I do suggest is that if you're really looking for that extra content, I recommend that you follow the individual OPL teams social media accounts to fulfil that need. Hope that answers your question!","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2016-01-22T15:54:28.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for your reply LittleMissCheeky,\n\nI think the main issue that you believe is that there simply isn't enough extra \"stuff\" to be showing on Snapchat. But I believe that the number of people who will reach out to the snapchat will be happy with small glimpses into the way that things are done. In order to be engaging, you don't have to be showing pictures of players all staring intently at the screen, as that's what everybody who plays the game does anyway. People want to see the casters getting makeup on, photos that include the cameramen, the cue-cards. People want to see the analyst desk reacting to some dank play. Snapchat is the perfect medium to do this. We don't want super high production quality on the short photos or videos. We want to see the actual people who do what we love to see. We want to look at the casters practising, watching old footage to get better. We want to see all of the cameras being put into the right place.\n\nTo be honest, it doesn't even need to be of the OPL itself. You could show videos of scrims (if you happen to spectate), the Riot Office in Sydney, show un-spoilery bits of code that people are working on. Old bits of concept art for ocean week, or perhaps stuff from past events that definitely isn't going to be used, but someone thinks it looks cool. I'm sure that all of the people who would watch the Snapchat for the OPL, would also be interested in a look at the way Riot works and the environment that Riot employees work in.\n\nI'm trying to say that what we see doesn't have to be different every week. We can look at the same sort of video of people getting ready for the cast once every few weeks. Production value can be low. We will consume it and we'll love it. Snapchat is perfect for the sort of unplanned, rushed photos of things that just \"look cool\".\n\nI'm sure that this post won't be the one that changes your mind in regards to this, with only one non-rioter comment, but I hope that you might be slightly persuaded to reconsider your stance on it. \n\nThanks again for taking the time out of your day to reply to the original post {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-01-22T23:00:10.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the feedback :)\n\nI'll definitely take note of it and will also pass it on to the teams, players and shoutcasters themselves so that at least in one form or another (whether it's an OPL snapchat, or people's individual accounts etc.) you'll get a glimpse of that \"world\" you're seeking.","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2016-05-23T13:48:59.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey LittleMissCheeky,\nJust wanted to let you know that I've noticed that OCE now has a snapchat; IAMOPL\nI don't know if you had anything to do with it or not, but thank you! :)","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-05-24T01:01:17.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fish is heading it up ( https://twitter.com/Maxzzie ) :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-01-23T03:40:31.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2016-01-23T03:42:26.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Puumbaa","date":"2016-01-22T11:48:30.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Dude, spend 5 minutes making a snapchat, chuck the account details to the PR/Media guys and it's good to go, this is totally doable.","replies":[]}]}
