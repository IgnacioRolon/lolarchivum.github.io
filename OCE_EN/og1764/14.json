I feel like almost all of the other casters have had an opportunity to cast some of the knockout stage, whereas Pastrytime and Rusty have only been casting in the group stage. I asked a similar question in the group stage and Rusty (I think it was Atlus actually, but they're all good) ended up casting that day, so I'm hoping that a similar thing is going to happen today :)\nThanks,\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ferlyn","date":"2015-10-28T02:12:26.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello Hello!\nAre you speaking about Worlds Semi-finals/Finals?\nOur boys will be in Berlin to enjoy the show as part of the crowd!!","replies":[{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-10-28T10:06:47.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is there any way that a Twitch stream or a podcast could be set up with them casting?\nObviously this is just an expression of interest, and then _they_ have to want to do it  and riot has to organise pay and all of that hassle, but it would be really cool if they were able to!\nThanks for the reply,\nog1764","replies":[{"poster":"Riot Ferlyn","date":"2015-10-29T02:30:15.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The boys are there on a vacation and to be a part of the crowd!
