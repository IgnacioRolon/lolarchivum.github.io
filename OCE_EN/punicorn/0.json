Who at Riot HQ thought it was a good fucking idea. All I wanted was my Sylas and URF and the crit item reword, but now I have to wait till Day 3 for Sylas and all the other bullshit I can&#039;t be bothered going on about. I also despise Nexus Blitz. Why did anyone think it deserved more play time than URF?!?! Next time just release everything at the same damn time ffs. Please upvote so Riot can see my anger cause this game has just been progressively getting worse.","replies":[{"poster":"ClickClack472","date":"2019-01-24T08:36:19.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get it, waiting for a patch and than having to wait longer can be annoying, but not really worth getting mad over, and they only took down blitz so they can freely work on improvements","replies":[]},{"poster":"Montiness","date":"2019-01-24T06:13:05.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah.... we have all the info you need to play ranked this season, but we're not going to tell you any of it until you've already placed and been fucked over by it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCEshots","date":"2019-01-24T03:15:12.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine starting ranked, having a new champ come out - dealing with patch changes... and trolls.. so many trolls.....
