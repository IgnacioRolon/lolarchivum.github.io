Its literally an extra click that the person does and then the alt tab back into whatever they were doing plus most solo and duo players don't take their team or their enemy's team composition into account to begin with so the whole thing is null in that regard.\n\nAlso people still leave during loading? In the old system the same thing happened as it does now. People would still choose their champion and then not arrive into the game. This really has nothing to do with champion select and the lock in doesn't help it in any way that I can see. Most people who don't appear in game after champ select have either had a problem launching the game or had something pop up that out valued the league game no one just 'forgets' to alt tab back in for a whole game.\n\nWhile your in the champion select there are minutes upon minutes of you doing nothing at all but watching. I don't see how you even made such a claim such as 'whos says you wont afk during those games'. \nIf you watch any streamers for league most are off doing other things when they are in champion select. Playing hearthstone or some other quick game. \n\nFor me changing how things have been done for so long is a hard thing to unlearn. I have caused my fair share of dodges because I keep forgetting that it is a new thing. Its was a running gag with my friends.\n\nMaybe a compromise would be some sort of way of alerting you to lock in but as it is now its a pain in my backside.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-03T13:45:09.644+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The client pops up over everything else when it's your turn to do something.

And while I usually do 'select' my character I have a bad habit of not locking in mainly because I have never had to, I am usually playing around with my mastery's or talking with my friends on Coms about what we should play. Its merely about breaking a habit that I developed. \n\nI remember the old clients audio being a lot more noticeable. On the update I remember complaining about the countdown sound being too quiet... especially if it is under music. \n\nI am simply stating my own personal experience with it. I did dismiss it originally at just being easily spaced out, but at the very least the OP has the same issue I do. I feel like more can be done to ensure people get into the game the first time every time, instead of changing it to make it more likely that people do not.\n\nEdit:\nShould probably clarify that I also mainly play blind pick which auto locks your character once the timer ends. This inconsistency is probably why I don't lock in when I should in ranked/draft mode. \nI can imagine people new to tanked mode will also have similar situations.

You can turn it up.\n\nI rarely play ranked, and therefore also rarely lock in, but I'm used to the requirement and understand why it exists, as you say, it's just about breaking a habit. \n\nI would much rather know that my team is present and prepared (as much as we can anyway) than get into game and have someone come back just as we remake cause they had to \"go number 2\". If you're gonna do something time consuming then do it before you get into the damn select. Alt tabbing is fine, everyone does it, but if you're queueing up for a ranked game then that ranked game should be your priority, not whatever youtube video or hearthstone game you are playing in the background because it's the commitment you made first.","replies":[{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-06-03T17:16:10.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like I said. I have no issue selecting the champion its the remembering to lock in. Jumping between both modes basically throws you around with that habit (also the countdown timer/music has no repercussions in blind pick other then selecting the character which dosn't help again). I would prefer if they made it consistent all round but like I said its just something that effects me and a few others judging from the OP. Its easy for you to adjust, but for me it is not. Its a minor thing that occasionally has resulted with a dodge timer and others with my friends yelling at me to lock in.\n\nI completely agree about people who mis-prioritise their time so much that they arrive to the game late for some silly reason. I've seen games ruined by people who (in draft pick) completely ignore what the current team comp is and just lock in something stupid at the last second. I can accept once you have picked your character (and locked) you can quickly go and sort out some quick things before the game such as going to the bathroom as long as your back and ready by load in. I will at most barely tolerate someone arriving before the first minon spawns however anything can happen before then. However the locking thing isn't an issue about not being prepared I have literally watched the client while the timer ticked to 0 without realizing that I had not.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-06-04T03:34:59.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice would be to just start locking in blind as well.
