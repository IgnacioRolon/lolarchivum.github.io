While on the other hand, premading raises your mmr I think.\n\nSo if you have a bunch of low level banding up in a normal game, it's likely they face diamonds sooner or later. Some diamonds queue normal games when there're no games around for them because the queue time is horrendously long.\n\nThe smaller amount of total population and unfavourable play time like mid night or later also helps the issue.\n\nAll in all, it's totally possible.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BfM DevOuR","date":"2014-11-29T13:13:30.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked MMR != Normal MMR Firstly, also you are obviously smurfing so nut up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-29T13:12:55.119+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Answer: Normal game and premade.","replies":[]}]}
