Two wrongs do not make a right, and under Riot's system, both wrongs will be punished, regardless of who started it.\n\nDefending yourself is not the same as retaliating. One is fine ,might not help much, but is perfectly ok. The other is punishable. Don't stoop to their level, don't flame them because they flamed you.\n\nIt is only a chat restriction, it is a warning that your behaviour was unacceptable and a warning that if you continue to demonstrate that behaviour you will face harsher punishments.","replies":[{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2016-11-15T15:23:37.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.facebook.com/loltyler1/?fref=ts\n\nTyler 1 can play again getting unbanned and play With TSM so doesn't all banned players get chance as well?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T00:42:19.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tyler1 is an extreme case, and he as a player has been banned not just his account.
