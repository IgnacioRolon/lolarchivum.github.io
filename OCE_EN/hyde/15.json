It hasn&#039;t been a problem for me because I play a lot of support in ranked, and that always finds a game really quickly. \r\nMy idea:\r\nThe new design of the queue, I think is really good, allowing you to choose two roles you want is awesome, better games and more wins. But It is no good if you can&#039;t even find a game. SO I thought why not have an option to, after a set number of minutes in queue, automatically changes your secondary role slot to fill. however if you don&#039;t want this option and you want to risk a longer queue time with the reassurance of the fact you will get  one of the two roles you wanted, then you can just turn off that option and wait it out. \r\nThis would resolve the real issue of people being more concerned about queue times than what role they get. \r\nOf course .... you could just click fill ... I mean it is an option and I am sure it will get you into more games if it is really an issue for you, and in that way its not really much different to the old queue. \r\nThat&#039;s it for me. Just thought I wold share an Idea. feel free to share your ideas too. If you don&#039;t like it and are just here to hate ... hey, well, just don&#039;t :D \r\nGL HF &hearts;","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-02-21T13:12:13.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I put in top and jg and never have a problem","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-21T09:02:23.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most people (if they are smart) will cancel que after 10mins and do this anyway.","replies":[]}]}
