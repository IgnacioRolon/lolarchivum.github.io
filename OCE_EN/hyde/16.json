I had a game not so long ago and during the lane phase I experienced some quite long game freezes .. i&#039;m pretty sure this isn&#039;t lag or FPS drops because they are usually very stable and I they feel quite different. its just like for a few seconds everything just stops not like idle animations .. it just all freezes up .. like no motion at all .. I&#039;m not sure if this is a game fault of my computers .. but if anyone else is having these problems or know how to fix it, please comment below :) Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-29T10:37:50.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What OS do you use, and what are the specifications of your computer (including graphics card)?","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-04-29T23:11:18.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am on Windows 8.1 pro with a 2.5GHz I5 processor, 4GB RAM, Nvidia GT 635M with 2GB VRAM. 64 bit","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-30T12:20:12.273+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your computer shouldn't be struggling to play league at all, even on the higher graphics settings.\n\nIt *might* be related to the new summoner's rift general sloppiness, but it doesn't seem this bad for most people.\n\nHave you made sure to turn off automatic maintenence and updates from the settings of Windows?
