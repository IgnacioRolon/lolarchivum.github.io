I want to start up a team of 5 that can play on a regular basis say once an evening or more (I would be open to even just a few games a weekend) but I would like it to be structured like a club where we meet up on skype at say 8 and play a game or 2 together. I am in Bronze 3 now with just over 500 normal wins. If you are interested ask some questions and comment :) Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Tealey","date":"2015-09-06T01:50:32.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver 3, Keen to play ranked 5's\nIGN: Tealey","replies":[]},{"poster":"nomad90","date":"2015-08-31T11:19:40.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have a team of 3 and were looking for 2 more an adc and top laner \nwe havent been able to do much ranked as there is 3 us \nwe play a few game in the week and have a drink on fridays and saturdays \nwe always skype and use viber to have a chat room where we are all connected to lol talk where i post the latest rotations and patch notes and comes in handy if you have time for a game you can just send the msg and we all get it","replies":[{"poster":"Tealey","date":"2015-09-06T01:49:10.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver 3, Keen to play ranked 5's\nIGN: Tealey","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alien1521","date":"2015-09-01T03:23:45.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you guys still looking for one more??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-09-01T00:00:49.828+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This sounds great!
