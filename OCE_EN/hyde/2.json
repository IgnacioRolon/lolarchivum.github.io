The thing about playing with unlocked is knowing where to centre your screen to get the best view of where you are.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Master Namer","date":"2015-07-20T10:59:20.599+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"get into the habbit of scoping your surrounding alot more, the pros use locked camera in teamfights especially adc's but if you watch them during streaming when they are in laning phase they use unlocked simply because they are able to look at a larger portion of the map and they are able to cover more of the map quicker around them (side bushes, junglers off to the side etc)\n\nIts a good ability to have playing with a unlocked camera, tbh i cant see how u can see a gank coming if u dont play with unlocked camera unless your camping the minimap with your eyes\n\noh and to answer your question, just start playing with it unlocked, give it a few games and youll forget about locked/unlocked all together.
