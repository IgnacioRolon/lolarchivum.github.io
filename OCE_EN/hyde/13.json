However instead of going to the champ select the entire client just fully quit out, no error warnings, no trying to connect to server .. nothing, just completely 100% closed! now I have a 5min wait time to get into a game, not really an issue but it wasn&#039;t my fault in the first place.. just wondering if anyone else having the same issues?
