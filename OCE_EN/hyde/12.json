I was playing a game with Shen today and I hit a few of my taunts one in particular fully hit I even saw the red taunt animation thing by their feet .. but for some reason it just didn&#039;t taunt them, they just kept walking away (this is a {{champion:236}} btw) Thought it would be worth looking  into. That&#039;s a pretty big problem if it does occur.
