It has been that pretty much ever since I created the account and now when I go to click on it, it selects it but I can&#039;t hit the save button because it is greyed out and just won&#039;t save it. However for every other icon I have tried it has worked and let me save it. Is this a bug for just the new Client or has something happened to that one particular icon and will it get fixed? Not exactly a game-changing issue but it is just kinda weird. Thank you. :)\n\nUPDATE 1: I see here on the boards my icon is still the sprout soo ... yea still weird. \n\nUPDATE 2: just logged into the client again and now I can change my icon to the spout and save it so its all working again. sorry for this. Thanks anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-16T07:22:50.959+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has been an issue with some icons not displaying correctly on the new client. It's only a display issue, and everyone else can still see your icon, it just doesn't show up properly for you. Usually a restart will fix the issue. Likely you weren't able to select it because it was already selected :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-11-16T08:30:16.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh thank you!
