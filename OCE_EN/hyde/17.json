You just need to take a step back for a moment and see the bigger picture here. I know this probably won&#039;t make it close to making a difference and most of you would have just stopped reading by now because.. its just another one of those posts. But coming from a person who doesn&#039;t easily get tilted, this is the absolute worst thing about LoL, in fact it is getting so bad now that it is making LoL in general bad. What makes it worse is that I really love the in-game communication, its what makes LoL different from a lot of other games I paly, so it bugs me when I have to mute someone or the thought if chat being taken away altogether, I don&#039;t think that should be the fix. I just think that reporting at the moment either isn&#039;t enough or not enough people can be bothered to report. At the best of times this game is amazing fun, very competitive and exciting. However when someone just flips out and suddenly the entire team is blaming each other and what was an easy win suddenly turns into a demotion. then at the end everyone just leaves and no reports are given and the cycle continues. this has dragged on and I know its not the only post like it but come one, shouldn&#039;t the sheer amount of posts about this just concern you? at the very least talk about the issue in a blog you do or anything! just tell us there is work going on, anything even if it is a lie, I don&#039;t care I just need you to at least know this is an issue!! plis I beg you! from the bottom of my heart!","replies":[]}
