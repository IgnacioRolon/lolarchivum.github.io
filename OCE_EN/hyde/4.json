I found that if I bound the unlock key to a button on the side of my mouse I could easily switch between the two modes so I could have full control of the fight with a locked camera in a team fight and when I was chasing an enemy around the jungle or looking around during laning phase. So I still can&#039;t fully play unlocked but I can use it when it is needed and take the easy road when farming and such like with a locked camera. I just wanted to know what you people think of this idea? is it good? bad? stupid? are you gonna say I should uninstall because I can&#039;t play unlocked? or think about other ways to use the customizability of this great game? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T08:16:40.654+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok here is what you do, have the camera always unlocked, and whenever you need to center the camera on yourself, press the space bar. If you hold space bar, is stays locked onto you until you release it. This is how i have been playing pretty much since i started, and it is how all of the best league players play. Depending on what champion and position i am playing depends on whether or not i am focusing on myself, the enemy, or other team mates. For example if you are janna in a team fight, you want to be focused on your carries at all times, so that you can peel for them and keep them alive. If you are an assassin, you want to be focused on the enemy carry that you want to kill. And if you are an AD carry, you want to be focused on yourself and your positioning, staying as far away from the enemy assassin as possible. You will also be using space bar allot in lane because it is much easier to farm(well i find it is) when the screen is locked. It is also good for getting used to skillshot and auto attack ranges from the centre of the screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"XSirCution","date":"2015-06-09T04:23:54.177+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you should just play whatever ur most comfortable with","replies":[]},{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-06-07T08:04:07.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unlocked camera.

Which wont show anything except champs and red dots. Those red dots could be a teemo shroom, a caitlyn trap, or even a minion. But because you lock your camera, you can't tell.\n\nI dunno, unlocked camera is the better way to go in my opinion.

But because you lock your camera, you can't tell.\n\nActually, if you pay attention to the situation, you should be able to tell, at least be able to differentiate between minions/pets and traps. Is there a stationary dot on the map? No: \"they're minions/pets\" or Yes: \"It's a trap\". Whose on the enemy team? Just Teemo: \"it's a shroom\" or just Caitlyn: \"it's one of Caitlyn's traps\".","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-06-07T11:52:31.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If there's a caitlyn and a teemo, now you don't know which one it is.\n\nI prefer seeing the whole thing visually rather than it being represented by dots.

My point is you don't have to see it to know whether it's a pet/minion or a trap, and you don't always have to see it to know what it is exactly. A locked camera doesn't prevent a person from distinguishing between them.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-07T09:23:22.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">also, the only thing you can use to check the map while locked is minimap.\n\n*sigh*\n\nIf you hold click (for me it's middle click) on the minimap, you can do the same as a unlocked camera except with easier control.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-06-07T09:46:19.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As somebody who was raised on Command and Conquer and Warcraft 3, using my mouse on the sides of the screen to scroll is easier than minimap view control.\n\nBut, to each their own.

Maybe it helps if you're really bad at keeping track of where your champion is or moving the camera properly but in the long run I'd say your better off just learning how to play with unlocked even if means you're slightly worse right now. There's also a hotkey for centring the camera on yourself (but not locking it) which you might find useful.","replies":[]}]}
