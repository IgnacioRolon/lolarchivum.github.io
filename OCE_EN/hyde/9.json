I know that some ADC&#039;s build differently but I always find myself building very similar items every game, compared to pretty much any other lane where I feel like I can change up my build a lot to suit the game.. is it ok to branch out and buy different items as an ADC or will I suffer because I don&#039;t have the max AD or such like? \r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-22T16:58:29.964+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the most efficient and common runepage for every adc is AS quints AD reds ARM yellows and MR blues. the safest change to this is switching out 2-3 blues for scaling MR, otherwise, besides ARM pen reds, you can run that on every adc","replies":[]},{"poster":"SorakaXHealBoT","date":"2015-09-22T10:43:20.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sell Shiv late game for a Phantom dancer and maybe sell your boots late game if u don't need it for a Trinity force (i don't think trinity force has much synergy with sivir tho).

Extra Health to survive a little longer and mana for boomerangs and extra crit chance to increase your frequency of crits. Overall its a good item and is definitely a lot better than your shoe so why not sell your shoe when you are really rich.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-22T12:49:16.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay, so now you're saying it HAS a lot of synergy with her?

It's still worth mentioning cause OP said ADCs, not specifically Sivir. Just that they play Sivir.\nOn paper it sounds like it works with Sivir to me, although I don't know if she has AP scalings at all that'd benefit? Still worth swapping for boots end game I'd say.\nOr if you didn't get Zephyr that's an option too","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-09-22T22:12:05.817+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No it is good.
