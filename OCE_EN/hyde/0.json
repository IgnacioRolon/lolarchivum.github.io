So I was thinking:\r\nWhat is we had a little bar or number that showed up how many reports we had against our name and showed us how many more we would need before be actually got punished. That way we could see that people didn&#039;t like my behavior last game because now I have a few extra points on my score. But the honors system with friendly and teamwork and helpful could take a point off the report counter and allow it to go down. Now I know that this might encourage people to troll a bit when they know they wont be banned.. but I mean people troll anyway.. all the time.. and this system might stop them doing that if there counter is getting close to the max number. Also it would encourage people to work harder for the honors and overall improve the game. \r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2015-12-23T22:12:29.899+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Knowing exactly how close you are to a punishment only results in people toeing the line intentionally so that they can stay as toxic as they can as long as possible. A 10 and 25 game chat restriction (the first 2 tiers of punishment) are pretty mild, but should be an eye opener for people that actually care to change; the ones that make it to a permaban never cared about temporary punishments or they would've stopped their toxic behavior already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-24T10:16:21.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a ton of good ideas out there, and this one I have not heard of yet.\n\nBut there is always the other side, the chance that it will give the trolls more power to troll without getting banned.\n\nAs much as there is always a good idea, it can be viewed as a bad idea if you look at it from the other side.","replies":[]}]}
