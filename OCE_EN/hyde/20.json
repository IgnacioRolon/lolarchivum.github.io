Does it really just depend on what you are trying to kill? or how well you are going in game? I am not sure. Finally When is it good to get Armour pen. I understand that it will increase your damage either way but going for the 40 AD Armour pen seems weird when you can get a 75 AD item instead. I would build the armor pen against tanks who are stacking armor but say if the entire enemy team are all just squishes without any armor items, surly the higher AD items would give a higher damage output? Maybe you know of a graph that shows your damage output vs like armor pen amounts compared to ad amounts at different armor levels? Sorry if this is a little confusing. I just want to understand these stats a little better. Thanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-05-12T03:01:20.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Armour pen is good against tanky teams and for ad casters like Zed, Talon, Lucian and Varus. Attack speed is good on most adcs that don't rely too heavily on their abilities, champions such as, caitlyn, vayne, Ashe, and Trist. Corki is a weird one as he is an AP caster that is also a marksman. Back on topic, raw damage is good against squishy teams and for champions with high AD ratios, so champs like ezreal, graves, jinx, jhin, draven, sivir. However you need to have a mix of all 3. Having too much of a single stat makes the items giving that stat worse. For example with tanky champions, having 200 armour and 100 magic resist is useless if you only have 1k health. What good is having 300 ad if half of it is mitigated and you can only attack once every half a second? If you're playing a champ like lucian though, having a lot of ad isn't that bad because his passive and constant proc of his passive from abilities makes up for his low attack speed. Its all about finding the right balance for the champion you're playing and building for the right situation. \n\nThe reason why armour pen is good on casters is because often your abilities dont scale 1:1, getting armour pen for the cost of its gold compared to ad, will make your abilities do more damage compared to if you bought ad. For example, 10 AD vs 10 Armour pen. An ability that has a .7 ad ratio will will only then use 70% of the items gold cost, where as the 10 armour pen, will make you do 10 damage and use 100% of the items gold cost. However if your abilities scale something like 1.2 with AD, then having a lot of AD becomes better than armour pen, and generally those champions will want to focus squishy champions because their burst and raw damage wont be mitigated. \n\nTaking two assassins as an example here. Zed and Talon. Talon is a champion that is insane with Armour pen, where as Zed is better with raw damage. Talons abilities hit multiple times and have low ad scaling, so naturally you want the BASE damage which is high, to go through. Zed's abilities are geared towards doing big chunks of damage until he can assassinate them with his ult, the more RAW damage he does, the more damage his ult will do. Which is why hydra is becoming more popular on him now than blade of the ruined king. Building Armour against a Zed often cuts out a lot of the damage he can do to you, while a talon will still be pretty comfortable with slicing your throat and so building health rather than Armour is better against him. \n\nAttack speed simply judges how often your auto attacks will hit. If you're playing a champion that benefits a lot from that, vayne with silver bolts, ashe with her q, kog with his w, cait with her passive, etc. Then you will be benefiting from getting your attacks out more often. This is why rageblade was so insane with devourer because it allowed you to benefit from getting 'attacks' out more often without actually attacking. \n\nI think that about covers it.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2016-05-12T11:20:18.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Drag0nicOverlord,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GpzyF8gK,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-12T03:01:20.103+0000)\n>\n> Armour pen is good against tanky teams and for ad casters like Zed, Talon, Lucian and Varus.

This helps so much! I totally forgot about abilities and such like. I feel way more understanding about all that stuff. Excellent! Thank you so much!! You were a great help! â™¥","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-05-14T05:16:24.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Glad to be of assistance :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
