(I don&#039;t know if she has a chroma pack but the balls were red) It was possibly one of the worst games I had ever had... I just couldn&#039;t see her orbs... If she put them in with her own red minions they were all but invisible and I kept getting stunned out of nowhere. I have played against normal Syndras before and I could see the balls easily but with this skin ... plis how can I change this? is there a way to contact Riot and tell them about the problem or do I need to switch to color blind mode? Thanks.","replies":[]}
