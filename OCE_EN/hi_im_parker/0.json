The only LP changes when a remake occurs is for the dced/afk player, who experiences a loss. For everyone else the game effectively does not exist. If a remake occurs it's not a real or fair win, so it would be silly to grant LP for that.\n\nIf you mean an early surrender as in at 15 mins, then give it a little and see, sometimes match history just takes a while to update.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-26T04:43:34.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just to clarify it was ff15 since the dc was at 5 min mark, after the possibility of remake","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T04:52:32.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, has it appeared in your match history yet?
