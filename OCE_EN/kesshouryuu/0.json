The Templars served to protect the Infinite Spirit which governed Runeterra and the entire universe. The Templars’ enemy were the heretical beings who embraced undeath in the Shadow Isles. The Infinite Spirit gives life, but also takes life with time. Those who deny their time are to have their souls locked in the eternal light prison. But, the forces of evil have grown strong. They have been laying siege to the monastery where the Stone of Life is held, the physical anchor of the Infinite Spirit to this world, and where time itself began: Urtistan Tower. Unknowingly, Zilean meddled with temporal magic here near the stone, and the temporal providential power had shaken his mind to the point where he had attained the condition Chrono-Displasia.\nThe Templars have been granted the ability to manipulate time in small, local areas, able to slow down or speed up time. The steel city, build on the old land of Urtistan, has fallen to the corruption, and the darkness is making its way to the tower. Templars held the line… but succumbed by the unquantifiable darkness encroaching. All communications to the satellites have ceased. Zurvan ran to the centre of the tower to grab the stone. As he grabbed the stone, he felt a sense of unimaginable dread. He turns around… and there he is, the head of the undead legion, the millennia old Deathsinger: Karthus. The stone is beginning to crack with Karthus so close. He begins to sing his unholy requiem. Just before Zurvan’s soul is taken, he unleashes the forbidden power: turning back time.\nZurvan goes back millennia through time, and lands just where he was in Urtistan tower. He leaves the tower and sees that he is in the time soon after Urtistan was destroyed. He can sense that Karthus is here in this time, too, but very weak compared to what he had become. Knowing that he must stop Karthus before the doomed future repeats itself. He imbues the stone into his sword, and sets off.\n\n**RÔLES**\nPrimary: Mage, Assassin\nSecondary: Support, Tank \nNotes: He can be played mid as a caster, or support as a tanky AP kind of guy.\n\n**ABILITIES**\n**Passive – Holy Retribution**\nAfter Zurvan is killed, he marks enemy champions who killed him (killer and assisters) for 5 seconds. Whilst they are marked, the receive an additional 10/20/30 true damage from your allied champions' basic attacks and single target spells (Scaling at 1/7/13). The additional true damage is not counted as Zurvan's damage, but the allies who dealt it.\n\n**Q – Searing Light**\nZurvan turns his sword into a bow of pure light, and charges an arrow of light for up to 5 second, from 400 range to 800 at 3 seconds (Zurvan's movement speed is slowed by 20% whilst charging). If the arrow hits an enemy champion, dealing 30/50/70/90/110 (+ 35% AP), and slows the target for 3 second by 8%/16%/24%/32%/40%. The target is marked for 5 seconds, allowing 3 basic attacks from yourself or allied champions to deal 4%/5%/6%/7%/8% of the target’s CURRENT health in magic damage. If the arrow isn't shot, or if the channel is disrupted, the ability refunds half the cooldown and mana cost.\nCooldown: 10/9/8/7/6 seconds\nMana cost: 60/70/80/90/100\nRange: 400-800\n\n**W – Anima Assault**\nAfter targeting an enemy champion, Zurvan begins to drain his victim’s soul through his hand. The drain steals his knowledge, gaining vision of enemy champions in a 800/1000/1200/1400/1600 radius of the enemy being drained. The drain lasts for 5 seconds, and can be broken prematurely by reactivating the ability, casting another spell, basic attacking, or if the target leaves tether range. Zurvan takes 5%/10%/15%/20%/25% reduced magical and physical damage from the target under the drain.\nCooldown: 12 seconds\nMana cost: 80/90/100/110/120\nRange: 600 to cast, 850 for tether\n\n**E – Temporal Distortion**\nZurvan immediately dashes through time, teleporting 500 units towards his cursor. He then gains 80% bonus movement speed which slowly decays over 2.5 seconds.  After time jumping, his next attack deals 3%/6%/9%/12%/15% (+2% per 100 AP) of the enemy’s MAXIMUM health, and silences them for 0.5/0.75/1/1.25/1.5 seconds. His sword is imbued with the power to slow time for 5/6/7/8/9 seconds, causing his basic attacks to slow the enemies' attack speed to reduce by 5%, stacking up to 2 times, lasting 3 seconds.\nCooldown: 18/16/14/12/10 seconds\nMana cost: 70/80/90/100/110\n\n**R – Timeless Conviction**\nZurvan transcends his physical body, and becomes the glowing spirit of providence for 10/15/20 seconds. His divinity increases his AP by 5%/10%/15%, and causes his basic attacks to deal an extra 20%/30%/40% of his AP. His holy resolve is imbued into his comrades, causing allied champions to gain an extra 10%/20%/30% movement speed when moving towards him.\nCooldown: 130/100/70\nMana cost: 100\n\n**PROS/CONS**\n*Pros:*\n•\tCan be built tanky\n•\tCan be built as a high AP caster\n•\tLots of slows\n•\tChasing potential\n•\tHigh burst with ult\n•\tSustained damage with the basic attack enhancer on ult\n•\tAbility to see where enemies are\n•\tReally strong passive, hurting gankers, etc.\n*Cons:*\n•\tSquishy\n•\tCan be easily kited\n•\tHigh mana costs\n•\tLong cooldowns\n•\tReliant on ult for high amounts of damage\n•\tExtremely reliant on Q and E combo to be deadly\n•\tHigh skill cap\n•\tOnly effective against one person, limited group killing potential\n\n**PLAYSTYLE**\n*Mid/Top:*\nAs a mid laner, I would recommend the skill order of R>Q>E>W. Land Q on an enemy, then use E straight after to follow up. The Q mark, and the E slow helps you lock down your target and deal lots of damage. If you are being camped, save your E for escapes if they gank. W is just as useful as Fiddlesticks’ drain in mid lane; it can be easily broken, so max that out last. You can, however, use your E on enemies to check if their allies are ready to ambush you. Your ult acts as a mini rabadon’s deathcap, so it increases your burst substantially (the more AP you have, the more deadly his ult is). The extra basic attack damage granted by his ult can be coupled with his Q and E combo to be incredibly deadly. Using DFG atop this can burst down a single target easily. He still has a limited group potential.\n*Support:*\nAs a support, I would recommend the skill order of R>Q>W>E or R>Q>E>W. Landing your Q can slow the enemy ADC to help your ally go in; the additional damage from the mark can boost your ADC’s damage in early game trades. Build AP tanky on him as a support. You can use your W to scout for junglers if the enemy laners are acting up. Q can be blocked by the support so be ready for that. Your ult can help your ADC or team follow in your engage, or even help them escape by letting them run towards you. Your slows can be effective in granting your ADC or team kills, but he has no hard CC so all you can do is slow them and sacrifice yourself in order to keep your ADC alive. Building tanky AP as a support allows you to deal substantial damage with your ult. \n**ITEMS**\n(Not in order)\n*Mid/Top:*\n•\tSorcerer’s boots/Berserker Greaves/Ionian boots of Lucidity (if you don’t take Athene’s and want 40% CDR)\n•\tAthene’s Unholy Grail/Rod of Ages\n•\tNashor’s Tooth/Lich Bane\n•\tRabadon’s Deathcap\n•\tZhonya’s Hourglass/Lich Bane\n•\tDeathfire Grasp/Void Staff\n*Support:*\n•\tIonian boots of Lucidity/Ninja Tabi/Mercury Treads/Boots of Mobility\n•\tMikael’s Crucible/Athene’s Unholy Grail/Rod of Ages\n•\tZhonya’s Hourglass\n•\tRuby Sightstone\n•\tFrozen Heart\n•\tRanduin’s Omen/Twin Shadows/Locket of the Iron Solari/Abyssal Scepter\n\n\n**WIP**\nI created this before the change to how stats were gained; I'll adjust the stats, but until then, this is what I have ^^\n\n**Changes/Edits**\n\n*5/12/2014*\n•\tHoly Retribution no longer deals % based true damage after 5 seconds.\n•\tEnemy champions marked by Holy Retribution now receive 10/20/30 bonus true damage from allied champions' basic attacks and single target spells.\n•\tSearing Light is now a skillshot\n•\tSearing Light initial damage changed to 30/50/70/90/110 (+ 35% AP) from 60/115/170/235/290 (+75% AP) \n•\tChanged the mark duration of Searing Light to 5 seconds from 6 seconds\n•\tSearing Light mark disappears after 3 basic attacks\n•\tSearing Light mark damage changed to 3%/4%/5%/6%/7% from 2%/4%/6%/8%/10%\n•\tRange changed to 400-800 (now that it is a skillshot, no tether)\n•\tThe HP and MP, and Damage components of Anima Assault have been removed\n•\tZurvan is now able to move at normal speed, rather than stopping completely, whilst using Anima Assault\n•\tAnima Assalt's knowledge drain radius has been increased by 100 at all ranks\n•\tAdded a silence to Temporal Distortion so as to give him at least 1 form of hard CC\n•\tChanged Temporal Distortion to do the jump first, then decaying movement speed, instead of building up movement speed, and jumping\n•\tChanged the movement speed slow to an attack speed slow, and adjusted the stats of the slow accordingly\n\nOn a side note, I would like your opinion on keeping the silence, or removing it. I put it in there to give him more utility as a support, but this may prove to be overpowering for his mid or top lane playing. Perhaps if I remove it, I can keep him concentrated as a time support, focusing on speeding allies and slowing enemies. Thoughts on that please ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Vorling","date":"2014-11-28T10:54:43.740+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"**TL;DR  Looks like CertainlyT would design this guy, way too much in his kit, way too strong and yet at the same time way too weak.**\n\nThis looks like they would be incredibly op. The passive alone is really, really stupid. 15% of the killers max hp? Causing damage to everyone that assists? At least you can dodge kog'maw, and cho'gath's ult is a single target nuke. That should definitely NOT be true damage, and not a % based damage.\n\nThe Q is also extremely strong, I'm hoping this is just me misreading it on my part or bad wording but it appears to be a point and click ability, with the whole 'target an enemy champ' bit. Assuming i am wrong about that, it is still incredibly strong. The damage is insanely high on the initial hit, it then slows AND applies a mark that makes you AND your allies do % based damage? Akali's Q at least doesn't have insane damage on the initial hit as well as the mark being for her only, one proc and no slow. Possible changes include:\n-Reducing the damage from the initial hit of the skill\n-Removing the slow\n-Making the mark a proc once thing\n-Changing the mark to not do % based damage.\n-Making it a melee ability(If this is done could probably remove the channel on it with a combination of some of the other options)\n-Possibly reducing the range a bit, going along with the melee ability\n\nAlright, the W. I'm not sure what it is but you seem to be quite obsessed with having % based damage on this guy. It honestly should not be on this many abilities, it would make them either incredibly op, or, nerfed into oblivion. Just going to list a few changes that could possibly make this more balanced:\n-Change the % based damage to flat, or remove the damage completely but make the tether like Karma's in that he can still move.\n-Slow is fine, could even buff it a bit.\n-Remove the convert 25% of HP + MP thing, either MP or HP only, or removed entirely. \n-The knowledge drain thing is really, really cool. Could possibly even increase the range on it just a tad.\n\nThe E. This is the ability I probably have the least amount of complaints about. Could probably do with a few buffs, It wouldn't have great synergy with the rest of his abilities too well. Maybe make it so you do the teleport dash first, come out at full speed and lose the speed buff over time? I don't mind the % based damage on this one, is fine as it is. The slow is way, way too strong. A 10% stacking slow on AS? That would be horrendous. Either remove it and reduce MP cost or something, or remove the stacking capability. Also you only have 4 levels of the slow.\n\nNow for the ult. Looking at this it is probably fine to be kept as it is.I would reword followers to ally champions because it seems a bit off to call team mates followers, and it would be a bit strong if it also included minions.\n\nIn all honesty, this champ probably wouldn't survive in mid or bot. Giving him some passive sustain, maybe on his W or convert his passive into it as well as some AOE to clear camps a bit better and he would rekt in jungle. His current form would be, imho, best in top lane. In mid he would get out poked due to long cool downs and high mana costs. He wouldn't be able to harass or farm effectively and would be very vulnerable to ganks. In top he should be able to trade well with most top laners, would have to see how he comes out, and still be able to farm. He also shouldn't be based around the idea of being an AP caster, he seems like he would fit the role of an AD caster very well, more along the lines of pantheon. A melee bruiser that uses the power of the Templar to reinforce his strength so as to conquer his foes. Something along those lines.\n\nIn his current form he would become extremely gimmicky, not a viable pick. He doesn't form a very effective assassin as he either uses his E to go in, or to get out. Not both. Changing him into a bruiser would allow him to be something more along the lines of a great imitator. Fly in with the E into the middle of the enemy team to disrupt them. Q their carry, pop ult, pop W(If the change of being able to move with it still on go through) then wail on someone. Would be a great engage to carry in on. \n\nJust my two cents on this guy.","replies":[{"poster":"KesshouRyuu","date":"2014-12-05T03:36:13.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you very much for your input on it. The high mana costs and cooldowns are there to make up for power, though I think I really did overshoot with his Q; the Akali comparison actually put it into perspective for me as to how much damage it really puts. You gave me a really great idea with his W, too. I'll think about his E, also. As for viable or not, it's not a champion that I want to be played a lot; a pocket pick, if you will, like Cassiopeia. That being said, if he be a support, then I should make his kit more attuned to that so he's at least not left out to the other supports. Again, thank you very much with your input.\n\nEDIT: I also got an idea for his passive!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sylpharion","date":"2014-11-29T01:19:23.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely agree with you, just having one % ability is already killing us, have you seen what happened to Elise?\nAnd just how strong of a shredder Vayne and Kog'Maw is ? \n\nI find not just his %  / True damage stats overpowered but the base stats, ap ratios and overall gameplay of him.\nSearing Light has already just nuked their health and 10% of their max health, now his W another 10%, and now 15% of his maximum health.\nThat's a total of 35% max health, you can't forget his Q is already a big enough nuke with a low cooldown and his ultimate allowing his basic attacks to deal potentially 600 damage per hit if you get mejais, rylais, rabs, deathfire grasp, zhonya's and any single other item.","replies":[]}]}]}
