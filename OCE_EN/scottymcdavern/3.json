You would think that if you pick Jungle as your Primary role that you would get to be Jungle one out of ten to fifteen games. Sadly this is not the case and I have a lot of Support games that are quickly burning me out as a player. I&#039;m just wondering if anyone at Riot can help fix the situation and let me have my primary role more often.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-19T12:36:12.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis thread is better suited for the [Gameplay & Strategy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy) board, this board is for discussion relating to technical issues with the game.","replies":[{"poster":"ScottyMcDavern","date":"2016-02-20T00:38:47.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought this would be a technical issue, the game can't be working that well if you only get your preferred role 5% of the time.","replies":[]}]}]}
