Also unnecessary flash afterwards\nThese were more of misplays from the enemy, but then again its still fun to watch.\nWAY to much time on Maokai's death. Could've snuck in another clip.\nVayne clip was pretty good but you should've q'd a bit earlier to get a triple kill and a guarenteed death.\nZed picture was a good addition but was pointless. Put it like between 2 clips to make a better transition.\nSO MUCH SLO MO. Try and not slow mo everything otherwise it stretches on too long and people will get bored.\n\nWell that is all I can think of. For a first zed montage its pretty good.","replies":[{"poster":"Gensho","date":"2016-05-07T10:57:36.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to give me these tips! The zed plays were only  from 3 games so they weren't the best quality. Next time i'll spent more time looking for better plays. \n\nThat's a lot of good tips :D I'll make sure to make my next montage much much better!","replies":[{"poster":"Xilbur","date":"2016-05-14T07:40:06.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are welcome! :D","replies":[]}]}]}]}
