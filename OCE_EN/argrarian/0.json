Last night i decided to delete all the LoL files and re download the client, the patcher seemed to download all the files but now i can&#039;t play at all.","replies":[{"poster":"Conrad","date":"2015-07-21T10:21:30.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds to me like you may just have a problem with poor internet.\n\nI say this because it should not take 5mins to connect otherwise and perhaps the difference between it working before and not working now . May be to the fact that using your internet to download LoL may have used a lot of your net allocation up and perhaps your internet has been reduced to speeds to slow to even open LoL.\n\nIf you eventually get an error along the lines of \"Error could not connect\" or something like that, this is probably the case.\n\nYou may want to investigate into getting faster internet.\n\nGL!\n\n-Conrad.","replies":[]}]}
