It&#039;s your system and how the game currently is. First with the ranking system. I feel it&#039;s very unfair for the low ELO players (Sliver and down). It is literally impossible for me to climb not to mention enjoy playing. The LP system is really ridiculous, I lose more LP than I gain. On average I gain 16LP (18 highest), that&#039;s regardless if I got promoted or have 3+ win streaks. It&#039;s really annoying to only gain 16LP and lose 21 LP, that&#039;s just unfair. (Side note, it&#039;s been like this ever since i got demoted to sliver 5 from 4.)\r\nAnother issue is the player base. I will not say every game is the team faults but every now and then you get players who are down right toxic and trolls. You would argue that &quot;your just not good enough.&quot; is that mean you can only be a gold player if you can 4v5 or even 3v5 every single games? How is that fair?\r\nA buddy of mine who keeps getting feeders in streaks finally loses and said a few things he shouldn&#039;t have said and got banned and where the feeders did not. I have reported multiply players and non of them seems to even get banned. Riot should really take an insight into these sort of issues, as this will cost your player base. Im sure a lot of people feels the same. Im literally on the edge of uninstalling this game, really look in to this as this is slowly destroying the game. \r\n\r\nSorry for bad grammar and if this is in the wrong section, don&#039;t remove it put in the right section. Every time I post something you keep removing it and saying its in the wrong section. Well tell me where it belongs and give me a chance to actually change it.","replies":[{"poster":"xEARTHSEA","date":"2018-11-05T13:49:23.719+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey send me a friend add, if you want i can help review your replays and give you some tips on how to improve :) \n\n(im low elo too, got hardstuck p1 last season)","replies":[{"poster":"iljame blossom","date":"2018-11-05T14:31:01.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes will do! thx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"NORBIT1234","date":"2018-11-07T21:39:31.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah fuck thanking god someone actually points this shit out thats how i feel when i play aswell bloody stupid system should fix this bullshit","replies":[]}]}
