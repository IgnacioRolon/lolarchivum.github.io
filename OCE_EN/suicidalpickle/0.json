I cant decide over which to get so im asking for opinions. Im currently thinking about Sejuani  {{champion:113}} for her tank and cc. Maokai {{champion:57}} also looks nice for his amazing tank. Nocturne {{champion:56}} is also in the picture due to his dmg and ganking with ult and I also looking at skarner {{champion:72}} since they are gonna kinda buff him a bit and i luv that ult. So can i get some opinions please?\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-13T10:29:29.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{champion:72}} \n\nYou have no idea...\n\nBuff?

Basically meaning, that if he had say 300 AD and his ult is still at level 1 for just this scenario and he has no AP. He is going to do 640 damage with his ult. 800 if levelled to 3. He also now gets 100 movement speed (along with the attack speed and mana regen from his passive) when he ults a target, meaning he can drag them even further now. He also gets his passive stats when stunning a target with his E passive. So... yeah. I guess it's good people think Skarner is weak.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-08-14T01:19:10.224+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And what is Skarner going to do with those lovely 500 range pillars, that are easily captured and controlled by enemies over him?

His old passive is now on his E and doesn't need 3 stacks to apply the stun (major buff). They have already compensated for being out of Crystal Spires range, by letting him have his passive stats while ulting a champion or stunning with his E passive. I don't see people saying 'Rek'Sai's tunnels are useless because enemies can easily destroy them.\" or \"Heimerdinger's turrets are useless because enemies can easily destroy them\". \"Skarner is useless for having counterplay\"... okay.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-13T22:29:47.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=PRIMAWESOME,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=zY7FLb5f,comment-id=00000001,timestamp=2015-08-13T16:29:58.259+0000)\n>\n> Skarner's ult does 20 base damage twice because it also applies 100% of his AD damage twice (making it 200%) and 50% AP twice too.
