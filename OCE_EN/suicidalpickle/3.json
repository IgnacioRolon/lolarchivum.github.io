Targeting a Blaze effected champion with Pyroclasm is a good way to get it to hit 2 champions but after the second hit anything could happen if they are not already effected by his passive.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lone Summoner","date":"2015-09-05T14:21:35.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Brands ultimate will bounce off any enemy no matter what but it prioritizes the blazed enemies.","replies":[]}]}
