Everyday, I get matched up with noobs who can not even farm. Including retards who constantly feed for no reason at all and decide to troll for fun, Riot is not making this any better. Riot instead does not seem to be picking out the feeders, the people who actually do random crap. Even though they are saying &quot; we are banning noobs, removing feeders&quot; i see people just more likely to feed because they are saying this. Not to say Riot&#039;s matchmaking process, there should be a rule that every 3 weeks, a player is tested on his ability to play a game and once they have finished their games (like provisional) they are ranked on how good they are and therefore can actually be matched up with players of the same skill not above their skill or below but at their pace.  However, Riot is not trying to solve the problem but keep on introducing skins and champions including the recent release of Tahm Kench. Riot STILL doesn&#039;t know the troll ability of the champion and continues to keep it that way. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#039;m trying to say is that, Riot should make the game more enjoyable instead of making the game frustrating to play, since the matching of noobs and the existence of feeders is still a large problem. If Riot continues this very bad way of gaming people WILL become frustrated, eve though it&#039;s just a game, everyone knows the feeling of losing due to a troll on your team, if that was a rela player you could have won, but no, it HAD to be a troll.\r\n\r\nSo Riot PLEASE... do something smart for once, I am not trying to offend, just expressing my feeling about League and how it is working for me. There SHOULD be change, and PLEASE make it quick.\r\n\r\nPlease, if anyone feels that something is wrong please tell, I am open to quitting or playing League, but it is really getting on my nerves.

Let me laugh even harder.\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nRiot doesn't ban \"noobs\". If someone hasn't figured out how to play that's called lack of skill. They're not breaking any rules or the summoners code of the TOU and EULA, they just haven't figured out what they need to do and how they need to do it yet, kind of like you. Yeh, you're a noob mate. I've seen your stats, sh!t cs, rarely a decent K/D/A, carried more than a few times recently and can't even win a 3v2 against a couple noobs in Bronze V.\n\n> Riot is not trying to solve the problem but keep on introducing skins and champions including the recent release of Tahm Kench.\n\nYou realise the Player Behaviour team and the Champion/Skin teams are two completely different things, right? They can't just do each others job. Riot work on both at the same time by having teams that specialise in each field, they don't have a bunch of people who know a little about everything jumping from team to team as it suits them.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-20T09:22:12.100+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't know whether to laugh with you or to add more points to your statement haha","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-10-20T07:26:15.677+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh look at that, a troll ability on a champion? What about Bard? Actually no.\n\nWhat about Janna? You can FLASH_ULT the entire enemy team into your team to give the enemy team an advantage.\nThere are many abilities like this in the game.\n\nYou wanna know why Tahm Kench exists? LOOK AT WORLDS!\nAmazing plays have been happening around this champion.\nNot to mention this is so far the best year of LoL I've ever seen, champion diversity is through the roof. 70+ unique champions played at worlds, YoloQ and Normals are more varied than I've ever seen them.\n\nI complain a fuck load about seeing Vayne, last two/three seasons I've seen her in roughly 90% of my games, but this season I've not seen her as much.\n\nAlso here's a little side note which is probably part of your frustration. The game is not balanced around gameplay in Bronze level, it's balanced around gameplay at Plat and higher. Just because you think something is OP or troll, doesn't mean it actually is, that's just how you perceive the game in a limited skill pool.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-10-20T07:19:09.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it fun.","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-20T09:23:16.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As do i (The Adrenalin Rush is real) especially when my lane opponent is good causing me to play alot more seriously then what i usually do","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-10-22T21:47:55.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Little Kohai,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=lvIq7ZQI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-10-20T09:23:16.041+0000)\n>\n> As do i (The Adrenalin Rush is real) especially when my lane opponent is good causing me to play alot more seriously then what i usually do\n\nthat name tho, I should rename to \"Big Sempai\"","replies":[{"poster":"The Unseen Inter","date":"2015-10-22T21:50:52.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you wouldn't be the first haha","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2015-10-20T07:33:00.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must take it too seriously.
