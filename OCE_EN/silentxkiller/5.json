In many normal games, it is very frequent for people to instant lock in any champion in any role that THEY want to play, not considering the current team&#039;s wishes, without asking. Even though this is frequent in normals, this has also happened in Ranked Solo/Duo and Flex. I wish there can be some new way to prevent such behavioural issues, if they can&#039;t be decent humans than why offer them a chance to play the game? I recently encountered a person who autolocked Kayn jungle even though he was given support and later added the excuse that: &quot;I don&#039;t want to play support... ... If I want to play a role, I just play it, why do I need to ask?&quot; I would like a Rioter to address this issue and come up with a way to deal with it. Yes, I know you can dodge but this has many downsides such as losing LP, having a waiting time for dodging and other issues. If one was to have a smurf than this would be no problem, but I can confirm that many people would like to keep playing on their main account as a priority. If anyone has a solution that anyone can implement, I wish to be informed immediately.\r\nThank you all for your time and best of luck on the Fields Of Justice!\r\nFellow League of Legends player - SilentXKiller\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}
