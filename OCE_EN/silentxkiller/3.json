(preferably)\nHP: 453 +3.5/5 sec +98/lvl\nRage: maximum 150.\nSpeed: 375\nMagic Resist: 28 +0/lvl\nArmour: 15 +3/lvl\nPhysical Damage: 56 +8/lvl\nAbility Power: 22 +4/lvl\n\nPassive: Eternal Heart\nCorrosion gains increased health regeneration (10/11/12/13%) while in combat with champions and also gains an extra 3/4/5/6 % increase in attack speed. For each auto attack used on a target, generates 10 FURY to a maximum of 150 fury, at 100-150 FURY, next ability consumes 75 FURY to gain extra effects.\n\nQ: Co-Existing Hearts\nCooldown: 6 seconds\nNo Cost\nCorrosion senses the beats of the hearts of all enemies and targets one unit and amplifies her next basic attack on the target by 13/15/17/19/21% of AD and 1/3/5/7/9% of AP + 50 physical dmg (all ranks).\nFURY effect: consumes 75 fury to slow the target by 9/10/11/12% if facing towards Corrosion and stuns the target for 0.9/1.1/1.3/1.5/1.7 sec if facing away from Corrosion and also applying the slow.\n\nW: Vein Lash\nCooldown: 9 seconds\nNo Cost\nCorrosion slaps her arm to a target champion and drains 10/11/12/13/15% of their current health also dealing damage equal to the life stolen and dealign extra max 15% of AD.\nFURY effect: Vein instead consumes 75 FURY and lashes to 3 closest enemies including minions and monsters and drains 5/6/7/8/9 of their current HP and deals extra maximum 10% AD. If enemies are still within 350 radius, they are rooted for 0.9/1.3/1.7/2.1/2.5 seconds.\n\nE: Blood Rush\nCooldown: 4 seconds\nCost: 5% HP\nCorrosion expends 5% of her max health and deals damage to all units within a 500 radius equal to 14/15/16/17/18 % of her max AD and heals for 20/40/60/80/100 HP total. Each enemy hit with Blood Rush gains a mark of Blood Loss.\nBlood Loss: attack speed is reduced by 8% stacks to 3 times. Does not effect minions and all stacks are lost once not again refreshed within 6 seconds.\nFURY effect: consumes 75 FURY and 5% health to deal damage equal to 16/17/18/19/20% of max AD to all units within 600 Radius and heals for 40/60/80/100/120 also applies stacks of Blood Loss.\n\nR: Heart of the Void\nCooldown: 100 seconds\nCorrosion channels for 3/3.2/3.4 seconds binding all champions within a 1000 radius are passively shackled to Corrosion, but still can me and cast abilities(at all ranks) and after channeling deals damage equal to max 50/51/52% (minimum 40/41/42%) of her AD depending where the enemies lie in the radius, the closer, the more damage dealt (radius is visible to all champions) and also heals allies for 50% of the total champion damage dealt to the during the last 2.7/3/3.3 seconds. During this time, Corrosion moves 5% slower and can only cast her E.\nFURY effect: Corrosion instead channels for 0.2/0.3/0.4 seconds fewer and shackles champions within 1050 radius and deals same amount of damage and heals allies also extra 100 HP.\n\nHope you guys like my suggestion, if there need be any change with the scaling of AD/AP or anything please let me know!\n:D\nHave a good day!","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-10-03T20:11:50.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The name is kind of... Needs some more work, that's what I would say. Just because of the names we have in the league already alongside that without a general idea of what you want the champion to look like, the gender shouldn't matter.. Unless you want it to be the Black Diablos of it's race... Which is probably taken by Rek'Sai (Monster Hunter Reference)\n\nThose base stats are very scary, the passive healing is interesting depending if it means [ hp regen + passive ] then it's fine but if it means it's % max hp then I think that's overkill, like really hard to kill for a ranged champ alongside that you forgot to give her the units of the range.\n\nHer Q is kind of weird... Generally you would want the stun if they go on you not if they run away from you, it's a chase down ability on a ranged champion.\n\nThe W is not very well described. (I don't blame you if you used the main site for writing descriptions.) But you're missing duration time, without that we can't tell if that's good or not alongside the fact does it work like Fiddlesticks drain?\n\nHer E is overkill on the self-healing alongside such a large range, you're also missing is that 5% max hp? Is it current? Or maybe mising hp? Does it scale? Is it a one point wonder. Etc.\n\nI don't fully understand her ultimate myself, does it lock them in place? You can move around.. So like Morgana ultimate without the stun? I don't really get the point of it.\n\nOverall I think we're lacking more in depth on the champion design, like it's cool and all but it's not fleshed out enough. We really need it to be more descriptive to fully decide if we want it or not. Alongside that, the AD focus is more so hurting the champion that benefiting it, if the ultimate was AP Scaling then you could go Rylais and use the slow to help you out and alongside that you could also get Zhonyas. Where as if you go AD, you're a non gap closer ranged champion with a ton of self-heals and lack-luster CC without being an Assassin. If you go tank then you're just out classed by any other tank in the league. Even Shen!\n\nI'm not good at saying what is right but I'm good at saying what is wrong, I hope that this give some insight to what I personally think you did wrong and you can use to improve the champions design for when you re-present it to us. Thank you for being innovative and have a great time on the Fields of Justice, may you be Victorious as well!","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-03T23:32:28.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-04T05:54:27.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hehee, there is no ability power scaling on champions/levels. and the damage is broken too. 192 damage(base) at level 18 is broken. So is 375 speed should be like only 335-350. the ability scalings are abit...well 18% is like 40-60dmg so :/","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-04T01:35:25.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah Corrosion is a bit overloaded with the heals in my opinion, and the fact that not many scale with champion level or ability rank makes them a bit weaker than (Shen) most tanks. Especially for a ranked champion, she can do with some twists","replies":[]}]}]}
