It is based on the fact that you, the player can not see the minimap or allies&#039; vision. You are in a normal Summoner&#039;s Rift map and you are picking a champion that your allies cant see and when you go to battle you can only see through your own champion&#039;s vision impairing allies&#039; vision, chat and minimap use. However, you can see invisible units and wards in a small radius around you and your normal view range is slightly increased. Wards bought are times 2. you may buy 4 vision wards which only 2 are usable you may buy 10 wards and 1 sighstone only which the normal wards, only 8 are usable. Items such as {{item:3023}} are enabled and another AD item like this one will be available for purchase to seek out enemies around you. For each enemy you slay, places a wards which lasts 40 seconds on the corpse of the enemy and is visible to the enemy upon contact and can be destroyed in 3 shots. Chat filter is that you can only type words that aid allies such as Top, missing, drag, baron, ward, etc. Also your vision will only be your champion and your wards, nothing else.\n\nJust an idea i made up completely on the spot, if you like it please vote below and share your comments and thoughts!\nMay victory be at your side in the Fields of Justice!","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-10-29T09:42:08.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like it, I like it a lot. I would make a few changes though\n\n1. I would just disable Eve and Teemo from the game mode, and maybe other champions that have good stealth like Shaco and maybe Vayne. The stealth along with the vision nerfs would just make them OP. I would keep Twisted Fate and Nocturne in, but alter TF's ult so that only he gets the vision and not his team.\n\n2. I would keep the vision range the same, and the amount of wards the same too, but I would make it so that each player has their own vision and that's it. No vision granted by revealed enemies, nothing like that.\n\n3. Chat restrictions wouldn't apply, but I would remove the username and their champion being played from the chat log, so the chat would be anonymous. \n\nThere are a bunch of other things I would change too, but I can't be bothered to write them down right now.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-29T09:46:47.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm gonna keep all champions now because that just shows how much more skill is required to outplay these champions, because each champion will be warding up very highly, this game is based on the fact that you need to ward up every few minutes making it more intense, one small mistake causes a huge loss. Vision range I will make normal, however wards, I am definitely not gonna take off. Sorry. But thanks for the advice!","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-10-31T10:54:44.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess it was advice, but mostly I was just sharing my actual opinion. The reason why I think that this would be such a great game mode is because it might actually finally show newer players the importance of warding. Yeah almost (sadly it is not all) every one knows to grab a Sightstone when they support, but besides that, people just usually grab trinkets and that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-11-01T06:11:37.221+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great minds think alike!!!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-31T07:07:45.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like this idea as it sounds good.\nBut, I don't know why you would remove the mini map.\nSince we can't see allied vision does that make all wards useless or can we see the vision our own vision wards?","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-11-01T06:11:15.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can see through your champion and your own wards only.","replies":[]}]}]}
