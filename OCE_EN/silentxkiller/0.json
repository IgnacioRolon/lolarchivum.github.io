Sometimes, Riot can't differentiate between aesthetic software (such as what you are seeking) and software that gives an unfair advantage, so if you use such software just be aware that you may end up with punishments regarding third party software.","replies":[{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-19T10:36:11.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a note\nProgram that DOESN'T affect other people and players experience won't be banned\nLike skins !\nBut skillshot dodger is not ok","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-19T12:11:28.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Program that DOESN'T affect other people and players experience won't be banned\n\nThere's no guarantee of that. Riot has stated before that third party software is \"use at your own risk\" *because* they can't always differentiate between what is aesthetic (like customs skins) and what gives an unfair advantage.","replies":[{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-23T12:18:04.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But for right now,custom skins is ok","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
