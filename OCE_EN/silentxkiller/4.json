He mentioned about how: \n&gt; i have this idea for a support champion but i cant think of the rest of the champion so can you suggest to riot a support champion thats R is a move that disables all items on an enemy champion for 10 seconds? so if the had like 6 infity edges the would be instantly down to base ad and stuff? if you do mention my name like down the bottom or something. you can take it over because there is no broken supports and this one will be.\n\nSo basically we have all these support champions which have hooks and heals and speed and all those kind of support champions, so i thought why not have a unique champion that has the ability to reduce not only a champion&#039;s normal stats, e.g. armour, magic resist, etc. but to also reduce physical damage and ability power.\n\nAllow me to introduce to you a new champion: Xen&#039;Saith the Unsatisfied Hunger.\nsince most support champions to be honest are barely from the void, i have designed this champion to be one from the void. (Void support, what next???)\nAttack type: half ranged, like thresh.\nRace: Void born.\nLooks: probably something a bit like Zac except black, grey or even dark blue coloured and slightly gooish in looks, like mud.\nHP: 495 + 5.4/5sec (regen) +135/lvl\nMP: 321 + 3.5/5sec (regen) +103/lvl\nSpeed: 345\nMagic Resist: 25 + 0/lvl\nArmour: 15 +0/lvl\nPhysical Damage: 42 + 5/lvl\nAbility Power: 20 + 5.5/lvl\nPositions suitable: Top, Mid, Support (main support)\n\nPassive: Soul Crippler\nFor every spell cast on a champion applies a stack of Cripple on target champion (max 3 stacks). Applies to max 3 champions.\nCripple: steals 5/7/9% (per stack) of AD and AP from the enemy, however stolen AP, AD is not converted to Xen&#039;Saith. After 9 seconds, if no other ability hits the same champion/s stacks will lose 1 by 1 over next 3 seconds.\n\nQ: Deform\nCooldown: 5/4.7/4.4/4.1/3.8\nMana Cost: 35/40/45/50/55\nFires a ball of void energy in straight line of radius  and marks the first enemy hit with Cripple and slows for 5% for 0.5 second at all ranks. Deals damage equal to max 15% (depending on range, like nidalee&#039;s q) (lowest dmg equal to 10% of total AD) of Xen&#039;Saith&#039;s total AD plus 75. \n\nW: Rage of Fury\nCooldown: 8 at all ranks\nMana Cost: 70/75/80/85/90\nXen&#039;Saith howls with fury and swiping around him (only on his left side and his right, not in front or behind) dealing damage equal to maximum 40% of AD (dealing 1.5x dmg to minions) slowing enemies hit by 20/25/30/35% for 1/1.4/1.8/2.2/2.6 seconds and also gaining a 20/25/30/35/40% increase in attack speed over the next 2/2.3/2.6/2.9/3.2 seconds. Also adds a mark of Cripple.\n\nE: Ravenous Bite\nCooldown: 7/6.5/6/5.5/5\nMana Cost: 65/70/75/80/85\nXen&#039;Saith takes a bite out of a target. If the target is a champion he stuns the enemy for 1.5/1.7/1.9/2.1/2.3 seconds and deals 30% max AD dmg and heals for 20%. If the target is a caster or melee minion, Xen&#039;Saith instead deals 1.2 of the dmg supposed to be dealt to champions and heals for 45% of the damage dealt. If the target is a siege/cannon/super minion, the dmg dealt is x1.5 and heals for 50%. Or, if the target is a neutral monster it is x1.35 dmg and heals for 50%. Enemies are also marked with cripple.\n\nR: Everlasting Hunger\nCooldown: 75/70/65\nMana Cost: 120/110/100\nXen&#039;Saith shows his true form and increases size by 20% (speed decreased by 10/11/12%, attack speed decreased by 10/9/8%, AD increased by 5/6/7%, AP increased by 5/6/7%) granting him Soul Crippler every 5th basic attack and reducing the effects of 1 enemy&#039;s items (all items) by base 25/26/27% and an extra 4/5/6 for each stack on cripple on the enemy. Items spells are also disabled, e.g. Blade of the Ruined King.\n\nSo that&#039;s my concept of Xen&#039;Saith, I hope it&#039;s a good idea and thanks to Bread Bullet for the great idea, if there are any edits needed or slight tweaks please comment to make him better or worse. Hope you guys liked it!!! \nPlease vote underneath!!! =D","replies":[{"poster":"SilentXKiller","date":"2015-10-02T12:18:17.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be quiet honest let's just make him a mid champion?","replies":[{"poster":"Suki no Sukiru","date":"2015-10-04T05:56:31.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can click the edit button to change stuff.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Snapdragon053","date":"2015-10-03T10:26:31.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see a few of his(?) abilities are based on some of Rek'Sai's, like the swipe attack and projectile shot.
