I just came back to the game after a year and a bit and whenever I log in I have the option to get a legend for free but when I go to select the legend I want the button goes away. I have hit esc and gone into my loot tab as the information on the daily rewards says to do and I cannot claim it there as a matter of fact it doesn't even show up. If anybody knows how to fix this I would much appriciate it if you could tell me how to please, thank you for listening to my rant and I pray that we can solve this.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-12-15T05:21:09.250+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Thanks for reporting this, we'll need to gather some logs to investigate further.
