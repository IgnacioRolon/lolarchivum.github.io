I appreciate that it takes a lot of valuable resources to release a new skin. I&#039;m aware of (some of) the intricacies of video game development and how a business runs. However, as a lowly Heimerdinger main, I noticed that his last skin came out around the time of his visual update. Which, if I&#039;m not mistaken, was a long time ago. After the release of Dragon Trainer Tristana, I realised an opportunity for a new skin for him. After you guys mentioned that you wanted to expand the universe of certain skins (releasing new Blood Moon, Arcade, and Star Guardian skins). Now, Heimerdinger is a yordle inventor. What if, say, he was a yordle dragon trainer? Much like Tristana.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s a skin that I would buy on the spot.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not going to list off a bunch of champs that also need new skins, because I&#039;m sure you guys are already working on them.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know Heimerdinger is definitely not the most popular champion (hence why he&#039;s barely buffed or nerfed), so it&#039;s understandable that he doesn&#039;t get many skins, but I&#039;m sure the Heimerdinger players would love this skin if it&#039;s done well.\r\n\r\nWith much respect for everyone except the people that coded Tristana&#039;s W,\r\n\r\nMe","replies":[]}
