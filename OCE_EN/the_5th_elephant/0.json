The first account I just wanted to  see how toxic I could become (Riot told me stuff like &quot;only 5% of players are this bad &quot; etc), and the second account I got permabanned all of a sudden for a string of games where I was foul mouthed and ill-behaved.\r\n\r\nI would like to think that I am not foul mouthed all of the time; and I do make an effort not to be nowadays. Recently I had a discussion with two other players who were in one of my teams who also had issues trying to be non-toxic, one of whom was banned 8 times and the other 4. I think lots of players do make a real effort to reform; I&#039;ve only been toxic in one out of maybe my last 20 games, where I just lost it. Aside from that I try to control myself and be civil.\r\n\r\nFollowing up this line of thinking, I think it would really help people like myself who are reforming if Riot could have more obvious reminders of the need to be civil. I don&#039;t want to be toxic, and I don&#039;t want to be permabanned, but sometimes your emotions can get the better of you. \r\n\r\nIf there were more ways that players could be warned and reminded of proper behaviours I think many people would appreciate it. I believe there used to be a function which would tell you when you had been reported for something by other Players. That feature no longer seems to be in effect. I would love for that to come back and for other things like that to be implemented. (I believe it was something along the lines of &quot;You have recently been reported for Verbal Abuse. We know that [insert something about the game being intense or something I don&#039;t remember] but please remember to [be a nice person or something]&quot;).\r\n\r\nIt would really help me and players like me, and just the community in general, in my opinion, if features like this were brought back, or made possible. Knowing that you have been reported prompts introspection or awareness of one&#039;s behaviour. \r\n\r\nThanks Riot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR  -  would appreciate support for reform(ed)(ing) players in the form of notifications and reminders","replies":[{"poster":"KawtYouNow","date":"2016-09-16T01:49:21.054+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is actually really relatable. i try not to be toxic in my games but sometimes i can't help myself. i haven't ever recieved a ban but im positive that i've been reported numerous times. I think your right in saying that there should be some kind of warning system or a reminder system to try and get players to stop being toxic. I know you can't expect this to make everyone non toxic but i feel like it would help. Rather than getting a straight ban out of nowhere without any warning.","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-09-15T20:25:57.615+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't git mad GIT GUD SON!\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-09-15T15:14:55.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played a game with you earlier today on my smurf lol, u were toxic. {{champion:154}}","replies":[{"poster":"The 5th Elephant","date":"2016-09-16T02:23:54.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"What is your smurf? If you were SouleySenor; then you have 0 reason to call me toxic.\nSouley was disgustlingly rude to our Zac who was learning how to play Zac. \n\nOn the other hand if you were not Souley; I apologise for being toxic. I don't remember any other instances of being notably toxic except to a Nami a lot of days ago and that was my fault.\n\nHaving checked your profile, it appears you were SouleySenor; you are incredibly hypocritical; please know that I reported your smurf for Hate Speech, Verbal Abuse and Unsporstmanlike Conduct. I hope you get banned forever. The attitude you displayed to our Zac was disgusting.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fukushu","date":"2016-09-15T15:25:55.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Perhaps this would help u?\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/sn5IQ","replies":[{"poster":"The 5th Elephant","date":"2016-09-16T02:19:58.521+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm not worried about that line at all; I do not consider it offensive due to the fact it was a play on words; additionally the full chat logs of that game would vindicate me completely; SouleySenor was being incredibly toxic to our Zac the entire game.\n\ncontext is this: souley says he's D2 Zac Main, keeps calling our Zac (level 20), trash, tells him to kill himself etc etc, whenever our Zac misplays or dies he gets similar treatment, abuse went on for the entire game.\n\nYou will also notice that it was our Zac who made the comment Dumbass first; in reference to what SouleySenor had just called him, which was \"dumbass\". As swear-words go; dumbass is definitely on the lighter side. The full chat logs will show you that I spent the entire first 20 minutes asking Souley to stop being toxic to our Zac.","replies":[]}]}]}
