Is there a way to stop this from happening? I want to get better first before I enter ranked matches and embarrass my self even further. I play with Ashe and I&#039;m currently level 11. \r\n\r\nGetting kills isn&#039;t an issue as I average around 10 kills a game, but I&#039;m dying the same amount of times, maybe more, every game and it tends to annoy me a lot. \r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-01-12T05:31:26.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a marksman (ashe's primary role) you should be using your range to stay away from the fray of battle, and sit on the fringes picking off vulnerable targets. Being new to the game it is very easy to have yourself positioned in the center of the battle, and as a result, get blown up because you are a squishy carry. Ashe also does not have and escape other than the flash summoner spell (which may not even be available at your level) which has a high cooldown, i recommend playing a marksman who has an escape skill (lucian, graves, quinn) if you find yourself constantly getting caught in the middle of fights and using the escape/dash to reposition yourself outside the fray, atleast until you get the hang of proper positioning.","replies":[{"poster":"Chronosima","date":"2016-01-13T01:34:18.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who would you suggest using between Lucian, Graves and Quinn?","replies":[{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2016-01-13T22:28:43.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on your play style.\n\nof the 3 I would say Lucian is the easiest to play (that does not mean hes easy to play) and the most consistent all round. High Mobility, High Damage, and his Ultimate really tears apart enemy champs (albeit quite hard to master at first).\n\nGraves has uncanny burst damage though his reload feature and be a little difficult to master (his Q can be tricky, utilize the terrain aspect when you can), he also gets a nice resistance buff after his dash which gives him that little bit of edge he needs to stay alive during a fight.\n\nQuinn is my favorite, she does require a greater understanding of her kit than the other two, primarily around proccing her passive in such a way that your hit all 3. she is by far the best duelist of the 3 and her escape functions as an interuption rather than a straight dash.\n\nIn a nutshell\nLearn Lucian first\nthen graves\nthen Quinn","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-13T03:59:40.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Chronosima,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=ALPsO6yj,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2016-01-13T01:34:18.307+0000)\n>\n> Who would you suggest using between Lucian, Graves and Quinn?\n\nLucian is the best in bot lane as ADC\n\nGraves is best in top lane as a bad ass\n\nQuinn is best jungle/top/mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-13T03:53:38.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer lucian of those 3, as he is the most mobile and just frickin fun to play","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2016-01-13T05:54:51.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make more smart decision. Like should you really join this teamfight? Also warding is a big thing that low elo players don't really do. Ward more so you know where the enemy is at and know if you can get a kill or you have to avoid that place. I don't really play adc but all I know is that understanding your champion's kit is really important. If you check my match history, my vlad and vayne games are atrocious and that's because i'm learning their kit. However if you look at most of my Zed games then it's mostly positive since I understand his kit alot and know when to engage and when to back off.\n\n\nEdit 1:\nIf you have anymore question just add me and I will try to answer them with the best of my ability","replies":[]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-01-12T05:59:43.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is something you will learn with time, where to be safe while not on the other hand being deadbeat useless. Trading kills isn't good and newer players do that a lot. Diving etc is some silly fun especially if you get a kill out of it but it is not a good habit, start working on that now by not throwing yourself into danger so much.\n\nWhile you are doing that, watch how you are dying and make up strategies for next time on how to not get where you are again. You are still very new, just focus on learning the basics but do play more against other players. Bots are terrible teachers for how to play the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Amaryliss","date":"2016-01-12T05:29:10.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note: The following is all just my opinion, feel free to disregard and tell me I'm wrong(If I'm wrong please point it out, that would help soo much thx:))) \n\nHmm well I'm lvl22 and I dare say ADC's one of the hardest positions to not die from(had my first adc games with tristana today and lost them all-.-) Positioning is super important as an adc, if you're in a position where an assassin can get to you easily, you're dead. If you're in a position where somehow their front line can still land loads of attacks and abilities on you, you're dead. I personally don't enjoy playing ADC because of the fact that everyone targets you. You have to be super careful with positioning(a position where you can attack an enemy but they cant get to you is a perfect position but if thats not possible, just stay at the back and fire out shots whenever you can without starting a suicide run just to get that last auto on the enemy Nidalee(if she's in a vulnerable position by all means go for it but dont chase her into the enemy team and etc.).\n\nWhen playing Ashe feel free to land some autos on the enemy whilst running since it'll slow them and often you can even kill them(again this is situational, dont do this when the enemy is right behind you or something else:P)\n\nI've added you in game, maybe we can play and learn the game together!!:3","replies":[]}]}
