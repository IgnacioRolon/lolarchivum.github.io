But I decided to come back now that I have purchased a new laptop so I can finally handle LOL without the terrible lag!\r\n\r\nI&#039;m a little rusty at this game and have only been playing against bots for now, gradually moving myself up to a harder difficulty (currently on the second one). So I&#039;m just looking to make a few friends on here that I can play with and maybe get a lot better at by receiving tips and strategies! This would be really helpful. As stated above, my username is Chronosima. I&#039;m able to get on everyday, or whenever I just feel like playing. You can send me a Facebook request if you want to get in contact with me and I&#039;m not online. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I&#039;m not to sure if this would help but I&#039;m 19 going on 20 next year so I&#039;m not one of those screaming, prepubescent teenager! :)\r\nCan&#039;t wait to hear from you all!\r\n\r\n- Chronosima","replies":[]}
