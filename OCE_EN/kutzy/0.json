As time goes on the gaming population is multiplying greatly. Social media and digital interaction between people is more and more common from an early age.\r\n\r\nKids are less educated from an early age about bullying on the internet and how it affects people. Everyone has had their bad games of league. So everyone can relate to this.\r\n\r\nPlayers saying things like &#039;kill yourself.&#039;, &#039;i hope you get cancer.&#039; Dont know the repercussions of how it may affect people. Suicide rates from cyber bullying is at an all time high and there needs to be some incorporation in the game.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion. When someone has been reported for this kind of behavior. Check the logs. Perhaps lock the account untill they have watched a video compiled of families affected by suicides due to cyber bullying and how it has affected their lives becahse of some stupid uneducated child acting tough on the internet.\r\n\r\nNoone may read this but i believe something needs to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-04-26T02:43:34.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think it would be better for people with sucidal tendency to not play online multiplayer games. It is such an unsafe, out of control environment. People with that sort of mental illness/problems should seek extensive help immediately.","replies":[{"poster":"Kutzy","date":"2018-04-26T03:49:52.713+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not exactly the right approach to take though.

Take the war on drug as an example.\n\nI've suggested that these people should limited their contacts with unknow elements; Due to the unpredictable nature of it. If their mind set is already in a dark place, any small ammount of words is gonna push them over the edge.\n\nThe internet is a place that require \"thick skin\"; You can meet the most caring or the most hateful.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2018-04-26T07:33:42.685+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with The Emperor.\n\nIf you have suicidal thoughts or tendencies, bless you. I feel so sorry for you, and I hope you find the help you need. Don't hurt yourself.\n\nAlso, limit your exposure to flawed and potentially toxic environment like online gaming - unless you're prepared to take measures like muting everyone in every game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Scottez","date":"2018-04-26T11:43:44.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You can't be serious man. The chat system is overtuned to an all time high and you want MORE things put in place? If you suicide because someone told you to kys or was racist OVER A SCREEN then that is almost natural selection at that point. Imagine what would happen to that fragile person with REAL life troubles. Now don't get me wrong i am not an advocate of suicide, i am just a realist. If you get hurt bye words online your part of the problem with the world right now. You have no backbone? Then maybe league isn't for you, go play Skyrim, a place where NPC's will still insult you but its a NPC, so that's alright isn't it?","replies":[{"poster":"Kutzy","date":"2018-04-26T21:08:27.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol.\n\nThis doesn't directly affect me. This isn't all about creating a protective barrier around the victims. Its about stopping the unintelligent kids sitting at home who think its okay.

A couple of light arguments with heated words leading having to watch cyber bullying videos, especially as an adult, would result in me quitting the game.\n\nI've never used phrases like Kill Yourself or anything like that, I may call someone a retard when extremely heated, but that's about it. But I have no doubt they wouldn't change the current system to only target people who say things like  \"Kill Yourself\" and would be a broad stroke system like it is currently.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Oriphix","date":"2018-04-26T03:00:47.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it funny that we have a option to \"Uncensore\" what we want to see in the game.\nPerhaps there can be a improvement on this system. \nFor players that have this option ticked the game can give you a editable file where you can put words you don't want to see so that you can compile.\nPersonally /muting everyone apart from your duo / friends does wonders.","replies":[]}]}
