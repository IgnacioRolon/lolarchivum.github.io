Sadly this is not the case, it's been a pretty solid statistic since WoW days that not even 10% of the player base ever visits the forums.\nHow many are you expecting to lodge tickets? I'd hazard a guess that if 10% of the population visit forums, 10% of those (1% overall) actually ever bother lodging a ticket unless it's to contest a ban or deal with another technical issue that affects them personally. What you're asking for, simply won't happen.\n\nBipolar, your antics aside, you hit the nail on the head. Too many league players are trolls anyway, they just don't care about the overall health of the community. Nor their enjoyment of ARAM. Thus it comes down to players like us, to literally push for this ourselves.\n\nJason, i appreciate that you took the time to reply. However i must admit your knowledge of addons is probably sub-par and you're confusing external programs with addons. Addons would not get detected in the measures recommended in my opening post as they are built-in features of the league software.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-31T07:23:00.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iv had games with bot 1 bot 2 and bot 3 before","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-08-31T06:44:34.492+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report and send a ticket.\n\nSidenote, there's a lot of addons for League of Legends that people use, and banning everyone that uses addons will cull the population of actual players significantly.\n\nfurthermore, every game, ever, has had problems with botters. They are unfortunate, but still the minority.","replies":[]}]}
