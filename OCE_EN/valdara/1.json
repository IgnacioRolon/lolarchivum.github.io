Warships innumerable and armed to the teeth. \r\nI hoped that it wouldn&#039;t come to this, why couldn&#039;t we just have peace?\r\nSoon after, I said goodbye to my family, and packing my armaments I left. I would miss my dear sister whose innocent would be stained before the week was over and  my ageing parents who knew full well how war turns out and would miss their son.\r\nI attended the war council, my peers and I looking hopeful towards the Elders who decided our fate. I was ready for what the enemy was going to throw at us. After all, it was an ambush that was planned. Ambushes are impossible to get wrong. \r\n\r\nAnd for the most part I wasn&#039;t wrong.\r\n\r\nI felt my sword hit flesh time again; the plan was working! And yet as the tide of the battle slowly turned to our favour by way of the ambush I smelt something off. \r\nI looked around and spotted near the top of the valley was a man wrapped in bandages with a contraption of sorts. As I observed the strange man he pressed several buttons which caused the machine to spew forth a green liquid that launched around the battlefield. Where it struck the caused the ground to fume with a pungent gas. And where it struck man the burning of skin and armour occurred. \r\n\r\nYes, I the futility of it all. I tried to get as many people to safety even the enemy for they realised what was happening. Their allies had turned against them. \r\nI helped a woman whose armour was half corroded by the strange acidic substance, giving her a roll of gauze as I rushed to get others to safety. But I had taken too much time. The valley was filled with the screams of the dying. The chemicals ate at flesh, the fumes burned the eyes, and I soon felt increasingly weary. \r\nAs I felt my eyes close and vision blurred, glowing green filled my view and I felt the sensation of being lifted from the ground. \r\n\r\nI felt myself waking on the side of a hill my helmet long gone and I felt myself all over, looking for wounds. Not a scratch, but my hair had fallen out consequently from the chemicals I was affected by. I looked around and found myself completely alone with nothing but my father&#039;s sword I had brought with me to battle that day. I walked slowly towards the hilltop in the distance that I called home when I saw a glowing green. \r\n\r\nShards of a large ebony blade laid at the bottom of the hill where I woke and the runes upon shone a dull virulent green. I passed it by and walked towards the hopeful possibilities and the meaningless strife. \r\n\r\nI said goodbye to my comrades, my friends. I couldn&#039;t bring myself to curse those I fought today. They were as much effected as we were possibly worse. But I curse the man who fought with such chemicals. Who couldn&#039;t, no, wouldn&#039;t fight with weapons or honour. Such weapons that killed without thought or process. \r\n\r\nHow terrible","replies":[]}
