The players we have at the moment are nice and have good attitudes. We communicate a lot and we spend time to make team comps and organize picks and bans. I wish to make this team legit as in be in diamond for r5. At the moment we have a plat 1, diamond 5, plat 5 and a plat 4. In saying this players must be at least Plat. \r\n\r\nPlease you must be available at 8pm on weekdays, weekends are a bit hard to pin point exactly when we will play but if you communicate to me when you think you will be home that would help. You must be 18+ ( this is because I am done with dealing with trolls).\r\n\r\nWe are a serious team, I am easy going and if people upset you I do deal with it. You won&#039;t be raged at, you will find we are a group of boys who are good mates even though most of us met over the net.\r\n\r\nPlease have skype and add me my ign is skt1 DemonSlayer","replies":[{"poster":"NewTronix","date":"2015-09-20T23:44:34.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im a gold 1 player who doesnt play much solo q, but outta 44 solo games i've won 33 this season (75%).
