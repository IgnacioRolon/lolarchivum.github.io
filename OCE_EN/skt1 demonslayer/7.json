The team is currently Gold 5 in ranking but its highest was gold 1. I am looking for players who are gold + in rank. Looking for players that have the goal in doing their best as well as making good friends. I don&rsquo;t believe in having a 100% serious team because it just kills the fun of playing League of Legends. \r\nWhile when we ranked 5 we are very serious, there is nothing wrong with socialising a bit before we play and even after we finish. Meaning, I will be organising customs and hope to really strengthen the bond between the players. I am a very experienced captain and I love meeting new people! \r\nJust to make the point clear! I am looking for players who want to improve and be serious in ranked 5, as well as make good friends! Players must have mics and be able to talk! \r\n\r\nAdd me =)","replies":[{"poster":"Leviathan","date":"2015-12-06T00:08:55.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: Leviathan\nRank: plat 1\nRole: Adc/mid\nXP In 5's: Alot of casual, nothing serious\nMain champs: Vayne, jinx, ez Mid: ahri, lux, vel\nAvalibility: Just about every day","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vitrolix","date":"2015-05-07T08:40:08.996+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver 1 going on gold, gold 3 last season. top laner and always keen\nign Vitrolix","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unsoft","date":"2015-05-05T03:04:47.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Added you, Gold 3 player. 5's team got gold 5 last season but stopped once got gold in 5's.
