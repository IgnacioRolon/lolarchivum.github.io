Maybe medium/low graphics and the client in \"low spec mode\".\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752654-Minimum-and-Recommended-System-Requirements\n\nLook at these numbers and try to get closer to the \"recommended\" than the \"minimum\".\n\nTo run league well you are looking at a machine that will cost closer to 600-700.\n\nAlso after a quick browse on pctraders, if you are looking there i'd look elsewhere, they seem like a big rip off at those prices.","replies":[{"poster":"Yásuo","date":"2017-06-15T11:42:19.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man would you know of a good laptop to run lol for around 300-400 if you could have a quick look for me would be helpful ,add me on lol if needed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-06-15T09:55:44.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"AMD is TrAsH","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-06-15T09:21:16.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would depend on your graphics card and what graphics setting you play on. Personally, my graphics card is HDD, and I can run medium-high on 60 fps. \n\nFor integrated graphics, it should run at 60 fps on low, and perhaps medium provided you have a good processor (which it seems you do). \n\nIf you have a good graphics card, then 60 fps on high should be easy. \n\nI had a laptop with a 1 GHz processor, worst graphics, really old, couldn't use a web browser because it was too much strain, and *MS Word* caused it to overheat and turn off, and even then I could play LoL (granted I had 15 fps with 500 ping on low-spec, the loading and victory/defeat screens would last forever, and patch updates would take 2 hours).","replies":[{"poster":"Yásuo","date":"2017-06-15T09:32:50.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that.
