However, it booted one game and everyone connected to that. There was another champion select lobby launched afterwards and everyone had to repick their champs? This went champ select lobby was on a continuous loop at which people had to keep picking/banning which eventually stopped after a while. We finished the game that was booted (we won) however it has been registered as a loss with no stats applied from the game to the team. The opposing team did not go through to the next round either.","replies":[{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2018-06-05T12:02:36.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey! Sorry to hear about that, personally clash was a little underwhelming due to the many yasuo smurfs, but oh well that was my experience. \n\nI recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) as no one here is really able to help, it seems like a technical issue so talking with a riot employee would be the best course of action.\n\nAlso I advise getting as much material (such as client logs etc) and submitting it along with your ticket so the technician can check out your situation!\n\nGood luck, Summoner! :)\n\n(Official Rioter comment on another post like this, [here](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/iWxeammU-second-clash-game-crashed?comment=0000)","replies":[]}]}
