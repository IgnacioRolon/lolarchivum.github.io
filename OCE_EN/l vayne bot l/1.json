I had a tf who was inting in ranked because we were trying to ask everyone to communicate so we could win a game. His acc name is *name removed* he&#039;s Silver 3. So if there is any chance a riot employee can review the game we had and give the tf a punishment it would be great, i don&#039;t think other summoners deserve a tf who ints in game and does not communicate in their team.","replies":[]}
