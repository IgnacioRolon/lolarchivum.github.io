Also not the tribunal. i wont change peoples behavior as there are always new players coming in that have yet to come in contact with that system. the problem and thats is the reason why this game enables toxicity lies within the game itself. First of all this is a game that is displayed as a multiplayer game. however if you loose a teamfight and you try to help your teammates you get nothing out of sacrificing yourself. Also you see how the game focuses on kills by last hits and not by kill participation. This shows that even though its a 5v5 game it really focuses on the individual playtsyle and less on the teamwork. So first of all it is a game that provides players with a high source of egoism potential.","replies":[{"poster":"CarpeDiem EUW","date":"2017-08-04T18:46:00.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Secondly this game enables toxicity by being so transparent on peoples mistakes and also their success, which is all determined individually as opposed to a teamwork game. \n\nI give you an example. A person that has a hard match up has like 150 cs after 25 mins in top. The team starts loosing. Bot supp presses tab because he thinks he didnt make a mistake based on his kda and his warding. he sees top farm and starts flaming him. Now yeah its still the people that are toxic, but the game provides them with the necessities to do so and basically puts it over their hear if you understand what i mean. And this is only one example. i didnt go over dmg dealt to champions that can be overlooked by all of the 2 team on each other. i didnt go over kills which basically only means last hit. i did not go over assists(which usually arent mentioned in these kind of debates and the supp is usually blamed since has no kills just assists but ok). And there is much more such as match history and other things. So when i am saying riot does nothing against toxicity i dont mean nothing against the behavior of the people but nothing to prevent this behavior in the first place by not providing a source and a game that drives on these kind of emotions.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-05-19T16:17:51.141+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Are you in primary school? \n\n\"Riot do the best they can to stop us from being toxic\"?\n\nRIOT HASN'T DONE A SINGLE THING!

That's the whole premise of a free to play game, you give players the OPTION to spend money. That freedom usually makes them more inclined to do so too. League isn't pay to win, though it is sometimes pay to get shit faster if you are in the lower levels.\n\nFact is, no-one HAS to spend money on League, and yet a metric butt-ton of people do, so clearly the goods and the platform are desireable enough to warrant that. But how much League is worth varies from person to person. To you, it isn't worth anything, to someone else it might be worth $20, to another $1000.\n\nThat's the beauty of it, you choose how much you want to pay for it.
