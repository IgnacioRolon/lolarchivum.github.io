As a child, Annie was often seen playing with the giant bear on the outskirts of the colony, playing in the murky waters or under the droopy willow trees. \r\nBut now that Annie is coming up to her 18th birthday, and her powers and abilities have grown stronger over the years, she feels that because she is almost an adult, she has outgrown Tibbers and she is now ready to say goodbye and set him back into the wild Voodoo Lands from which she had first found him. \r\nWhen the moon was high in the sky and her parents were sleeping, Annie took her small, stuffed bear outside. Gently, she placed the toy on the ground and it morphed into the giant bear. Annie hated that people were scared of Tibbers; he would never hurt anyone unless they dared pose a threat to Annie.\r\n&ldquo;Come, Tibbers&rdquo; The pair walked well past the outskirts of the village, so that any who seeked vengeance on Tibbers for accidentally destroying something, or just felt he was too dangerous, wouldn&rsquo;t find him and hurt him, or worse.\r\nThe moonlight was bright enough to notice the tears slowly falling down the girl&#039;s cheeks, Tibbers did not like seeing her so upset. Immediately he sat and let out a grunting sound.\r\n&ldquo;No Tibbers, come&rdquo; He stood, but did not follow. Nudging Annie&rsquo;s arm, he looked deep into her eyes, as if pleading for her to explain what was wrong, but this only made her cry harder. Annie slouched over the bear, clutching his fur as she sobbed quietly.\r\n&ldquo;You have to go, okay?&rdquo; Annie stood and wiped her face, they were standing at the edge of a dense forest, it would be a good place for Tibbers to hide and hunt, she was pretty sure there was a cave in there too so he would have somewhere to sleep.\r\nAnnie pushed Tibbers into the foliage, she placed a kiss on his snout, &ldquo;Goodbye, Tibbers, I love you&rdquo;\r\nStepping back, she wiped her eyes once more, before giving a sad smile and walking away. Still standing where Annie left him, Tibbers let out a moan, but Annie kept walking, the tears streaming faster down her face.\r\nIt&#039;s better this way, she thought.","replies":[]}
