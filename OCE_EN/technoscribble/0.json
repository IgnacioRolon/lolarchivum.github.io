The tiles on the roof quivered and shook. The chimney rattled, sending smoke everywhere. Sounds of metal against metal rang out as the grunts grew ever louder and more determined. Suddenly, all was quiet. One final, slightly muffled metallic clang erupted through the house, some small beeping noises, and then a roar of triumph.\r\nGaren&rsquo;s cake mix was finally ready and cooking. He took off his apron, folded it, stowed it carefully in a kitchen drawer and walked down the hallway.\r\n\tAn hour later, Garen raced out to the kitchen at a full sprint, determined to try the cake. He tore the oven door off of its hinges and went to pull the hot tray out. A roar of pain followed. Garen tried again, this time with oven mitts on. He pulled the cake out, sat it on the table, and began delicately icing it. He spent another twenty minutes arranging the pink marzipan toppings just so, making sure that they were equal distance apart and they didn&rsquo;t mess up the icing.\r\n\t&lsquo;CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!&rsquo;, Garen bellowed, shaking the walls of the house. One of the windows cracked, straight down the middle. Garen didn&rsquo;t notice. Lux walked briskly up the hallway and into the kitchen.\r\n\t&lsquo;Oh! It smells as though you&rsquo;ve done a good job, brother dear. Mind if I try a piece?&rsquo;\r\n\tGaren nodded, looking pleased with himself. Lux produced a knife from the cutlery drawer and carefully cut herself a slice of cake. Garen grabbed the rest of the cake, put it on a plate, and proceeded to shove it directly into his face. Fifteen seconds later, he pulled the now-clean plate from his face and gave Lux a pink-icing-covered thumbs up. She took her last bite, and said, &lsquo;That was very good. You might even win the contest today!&rsquo; A massive grin spread across Garen&rsquo;s face. Lux wiped the crumbs off of her dress and walked back down the hallway.\r\n\r\n*Three hours later, at the baking contest&hellip;*\r\n\r\n\t&lsquo;Gooooooood morning, everyone! Well, not as good as me, of course. Welcome to the annual Runeterra Bake-Off! Today, we have three wonderful-but-still-inferior-to-me contestants! Let&rsquo;s give a big hand to&hellip; er&hellip;&rsquo; The announcer looked down at his palm card, frowned, and pulled a pair of spectacles from his coat pocket. He pushed them onto his nose, looked at the card again, and continued with his speech. &lsquo;Ziggs, at bench number one!&rsquo;\r\n\tZiggs, covered from head to toe in a flame-retardant HAZMAT style suit with the contest apron over the top, flashed his too-wide grin for the crowd. The audience clapped wildly. One yordle threw a bouquet of roses for Ziggs, which caught fire in mid-air and scattered as ashes into the wind. Ziggs nodded approvingly, then fell over in hysterics. Once he was back at his bench, the announcer continued.\r\n\t&lsquo;At bench number two&hellip; Garen! Ugh, a Demacian. Everyone knows Noxus is the best! Am I right or am I right?&rsquo;\r\n\tGaren&rsquo;s shoulders slumped a bit. The shift in muscle mass tore straight down the front of his apron. Two people cheered at the comment, while everyone else was silent. It was later discovered that the two people were the announcer&rsquo;s parents.\r\n\t&lsquo;And at bench number three&hellip;&rsquo; He held the palm card further away from his face, and then brought it closer. A puzzled expression crossed his face. &lsquo;Pan&hellip; Pantheon? Did I pronounce that right? Anyway, he&rsquo;s over there. Whatever. And of course, we have the amazing, sensational, devilishly handsome&hellip; Me! Draven, announcing for all of you today!&rsquo;\r\nThe same two people in the audience cheered again, while the rest gave blank stares. A few rolled their eyes.\r\n\t&lsquo;Now then. Let&rsquo;s get into it. You have two hours each to bake a cake. You may use all of the ingredients you see before you. You will also notice that every pan is shaped to look like my face. This is intentional. Bonus points will go to whoever can capture my likeness most perfectly. After the two hours, one mister&hellip; let&rsquo;s see here&hellip; Kench? Yes. Kench will come around to judge the cakes, and he will announce the winners. Your two hours start now! May the best baker win!&rsquo;\r\n\tZiggs immediately left his bench and speed-waddled (Yordles have short legs) over to his oven. He began cranking the oven up to maximum heat. Once it had hit 250 degrees Celsius, Ziggs waddled back to his bench and grabbed two bags of flour. He poured them into a single pan, added a pinch of grey powder from his suit pocket and made his way back to the oven. He jumped, grabbed the handle on the oven door and swung off it until it opened. Ziggs stood back, grabbed the pan and flung all the flour into the heat. The resulting dust explosion sent him flying off into the distance, screaming with insane, unbridled happiness and tearing off the remains of his apron. Ziggs landed half a kilometre away from the competition. One down, two to go.\r\n\t&lsquo;Folks, we have a new record! Ziggs has managed to eliminate himself within the first minute of the contest! It all comes down to these two remaining bakers. Who will get lucky?&rsquo;\r\n\tGaren felt a surge of confidence. Ziggs had won the past two contests, he recalled, by detonating the other contestants&rsquo; ovens. With that possibility out of the way, Garen smiled to himself and began making his cake. He recalled a recipe for chocolate cake, nice and simple. Flour, two cups. Water, one and a half cups. Both went in the bowl. He mixed the batter, slightly overzealous, and wiped it off his face and bench thirty seconds later.\r\n\tGaren took a moment to calm himself down. He focused his mind on staying calm and only using a fraction of his strength. Flour. Water. Eggs. Milk. Cocoa. A dash of Sentinel elixir. A small Brambleback root. The root dissolved in the mixture as Garen stirred. The procedure was smooth and soon Garen had a bowl of cake mix. He poured it into a Draven-shaped pan.\r\n\t&lsquo;One hour remaining! Contestants, bake faster!&rsquo;\r\n\t\r\n*Meanwhile, at the Bandle Summoner&rsquo;s Institute&hellip;*\r\n\r\n\t&lsquo;Focus. Be calm, and think deeply. You&rsquo;ll get there. Try and summon something small, like&hellip;&rsquo; The instructor looked around the room, glancing at the insignia on the back wall. An image of a ripple across the surface of water was emblazoned on the doorway, a symbol of calm and focus. This gave him an idea. &lsquo;A fish. Try and summon a fish from Bandle Lake.&rsquo; The young summoner-in-training looked up, tears in his eyes and exhaustion etched across his face. The instructor stared right back at him, stone-faced. In silence, the child stared back down at the table and concentrated hard on the sigils carved into the old wood. He felt a surge of previously untapped power flow through him as he focused his mind, locking onto a small carp and attempting to bring it to him. Suddenly, without preface, the mind&rsquo;s-eye view of the fish and the flow of power ceased. But there was no fish to be seen. The young student put his head down on the table and began to sob.\r\n\t\r\n*Back at the contest&hellip;*\r\n\r\n\tGaren tore the oven door open, determined to get the cake ready before his time ran out. He slid the cake onto a shelf and closed the door gently on its remaining hinge. The oven was already at the perfect temperature, so Garen walked back to his bench and waited. As soon as he started to glance over at the other bench, Pantheon had turned away with a mix of guilt and confusion on his face. It seemed Pantheon had no idea what he was doing. Garen sighed. Maybe some people just weren&rsquo;t cut out to be bakers&hellip;\r\n\tGaren watched Pantheon for a while, and saw him using exactly the same ingredients and quantities as he had for his own cake. Flour, water, eggs, milk, cocoa, sentinel elixir, brambleback root. Pantheon looked slowly at Garen, who shook his head. He looked back, shrugged, and placed his cake into the oven. Had Garen been watching his own oven, he would have seen a slight eruption in his pan. \r\n\t&lsquo;All cakes are in the oven! Judging will commence shortly!&rsquo;\r\n\tFourty minutes later&hellip;\r\n\tThe toad creature nodded and patted his oversized belly. The entire cake, still whole, slid down his disgusting maw. He held up seven chubby fingers.\r\n\t&lsquo;Pantheon has received seven points! Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at Garen&rsquo;s cake. It&rsquo;s probably trash.&rsquo;\r\n\tGaren shot Draven a dirty look, and held out his cake for Tahm to inspect. He stared at it, sniffed it, and chomped it in half. The audience held their breath. Garen looked extremely confused. Tahm held up both hands, fingers splayed. A perfect ten.\r\n\t&lsquo;It seems Garen has done it! He&rsquo;s appealed perfectly to Tahm&rsquo;s tastes, and seized victory!&rsquo; The audience roared.\r\n\tGaren still has no idea how the fish guts got into the cake.","replies":[{"poster":"Blayzeatron","date":"2016-07-10T11:29:27.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for reading mine and commenting, so I thought I'd return the favour!!! I really liked how you captured the likeness of the champions in this piece. Ziggs blowing the oven up straight away was brilliant. Definitely got a good couple of laughs from Garen forgetting the oven mitts at the start as well. Well done on this very interesting story and good luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Technoscribble","date":"2016-07-10T10:59:16.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Side note: Exactly 1500 words.
