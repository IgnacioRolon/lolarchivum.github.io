We are competitive players with a drive to win, but also to learn from our mistakes, and discuss what steps could have been changed in order to secure a victory.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have team mates that are committed to playing together even once the Open League tournament season finishes, into the Ranked 5 Team season next year, however our primary focus for now is indeed the Open League tournaments.\r\n\r\nBoth myself and the co-owner are 20+ years old and are relatively mature, and would like to find team members that are also relatively mature but can stil handle the odd bad joke and take a defeat on the chin. We would prefer applicants to be at least 18 years old, but exceptions can be made provided you are happy to play with a bunch of old codgers.\r\n\r\nWe are currently looking for the following roles:\r\n\r\nTop Lane Main\r\nJungle Main\r\nMid Lane Main\r\n\r\nFill Substitute 1\r\nFill Substitute 2\r\n\r\nOur current roster:\r\n\r\nADC - Bolskies (Gold 4)\r\nSupport - Drew Carry (Gold 5)\r\n\r\nOnce we fill the main roster of 5, we will commence practise rounds as a team and will work on filling the substitute roles as a secondary priority.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure you are able to at least attend 3 nights of practise this coming week, as well as the first leg of the open tournament on this coming saturday (6/12/14) before registering your interest.\r\n\r\nPlease reply below with the answers to the following questions if you would like to join Symmetry Gaming. Please note that we will only be accepting applications from high silver upward.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummoner Name:\r\nAge:\r\nChosen Role:\r\nMain Champion Pool:\r\nCurrent Rank:\r\nRank Season 3 (If applicable):\r\nVoice/Headset: Yes/No\r\nAble to play during required hours: Yes/No\r\n+ Any further information you think is applicable.","replies":[{"poster":"E Bubble","date":"2015-02-03T10:41:24.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Summoner Name: BM Angie\nAge: 15 turning 16.
