One thing I dislike about this game recently, is that every four patches they change everything so much that you have to go relearn champions. Never used to be such widespread changes over a short space of time. Currently on the PBE they are changing marksmen again (basically admitting that the preseason 6 changes were trash), and some items will function like they did in season 4. I guess they want to bring the magic back, but constant major changes bother me.\n\nBeen playing Fortnite Battle Royale, its not too bad. NEACE switched from league to this, and he's pretty good at the game now. That game beats kids that whine and curse in every ranked game of league. Also kids that don't know the difference between logic and toxic.","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Master","date":"2018-05-02T11:08:43.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very true, don't get me wrong i love the hell out of league and have spent 2 grand on my main account, however i just had one game about 20 mins ago where there were 2 blokes on my team intentionally feeding, and we were still going to win the game easily and then our Akali decided the 2 feeders didn't deserve to win and went afk.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-07T03:31:53.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes I see that a lot in OCE. In other regions the toxic players at least still play to win the game, they are not vindictive like the kids in this region.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-02T10:55:58.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't enjoy the game, there is no compelling reason for you to continue playing. Move on, try new games. Battlerite and Fortnite (Battle Royale) are both ftp, Overwatch has a strong community, and there are boatloads of singleplayer games I could recommend.\n\nEnd of the day, League is a game. The point is to have fun, so if you're not having fun, why play it?","replies":[{"poster":"Akali Master","date":"2018-05-02T11:00:33.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How can i possibly have fun with the amount of people that are constantly trolling and throwing games and ruining it for everybody else. I have played this game for about 5 years now and it never changes and i feel as though the people constantly messing it up for everyone else go unpunished.\n\nThanks for the advice anyway, i already play both of those games :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-02T12:19:44.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I haven't played solo in a good while. I play this game for fun, and have no particular ambitions for ranked, so playing with a friend or two is always going to be a better experience. It means that when we do come across trolls or other unsavoury types it's fairly easy to just ignore their behaviour and play our own game.\n\nPerhaps that's what you need to enjoy the game again, perhaps not. I can only speak from personal experience.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
