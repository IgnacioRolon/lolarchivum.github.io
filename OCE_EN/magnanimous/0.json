Only those who were at least silver last season but preferably gold. We are looking for players who can play 3 games or so as a team nearly every night. Toxic players need not bother. We are looking for a group of people we can enjoy playing with and progress as a team.\n\n As for my own experience I have been playing off and on since s1. I have been gold or plat every season I have played ranked with normally 100-200 ranked games played a season. Feel free to add me in game.
