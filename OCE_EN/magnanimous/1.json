Previous Seasons my main was always mid/jg as these are the positions that can control the map and the game the most. I have played and own every champ except Jhin and Illaoi and  am confident in playing at a bare minimum of gold skill level with all of them. Over 4k normal games under my belt, ~ 2200-2000 Win/loss. \n\nI would be willing to fill any position a team needs and would dedicate myself to strictly working on champs to fill that position. Feel free to add me in game.\n\nAge- 25\nLiving in western Sydney.\nWilling to use any form of voicechat and available UTC +10:00 any time after 6:00 pm every night except Tuesday. \n\nThanks and if you have questions just ask.","replies":[{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-07T00:57:16.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idm playing serious for Season 7 Pref normal ranked but yeah i wanna main mid eventually, However im Main Sup,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-11-06T03:58:44.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ahem.\n\nYou fucked up.
