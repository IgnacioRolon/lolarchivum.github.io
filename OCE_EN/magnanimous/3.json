Plat+ in Solo/duo, Gold+ in flex pref.","subforum":"Team Recruitment","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are currently looking for a Supp to join our team. Our current schedule is Sunday and Thursday @ 8pm (GMT+10) for flex matches and Monday 8pm (GMT+10) for review/strategics as a team. We generally play a couple flex matches after the review. Wednesday we play in a Iron-Plat tournament through Battlefly that starts at 6pm (GMT+10). We will probably not qualify for it too much longer in which case our tournament will move to the Plat-Challenger tournament on a different day. \n\nAny applicants must be able to make these times if you can nearly make these times or can't make one of the flex/review days we could possibly change one day or the time around slightly.\n\nWhat we are looking for in members is a cool head, map awareness, basic mechanics, the ability to learn and take criticism, and a general understanding of the macro play/lane control.\n\nOne tricks are of no use to us due to the tournament that we do on Wednesday if you are a one trick you will just get banned out.\n\nIf you have any questions please feel free to ask.\n\nThank you.","replies":[]}
