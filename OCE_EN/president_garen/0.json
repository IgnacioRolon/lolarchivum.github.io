I mean sure the items are really risky choices but sometimes you just get matched with people who are very new to the game or have a very hard time picking it up and there&#039;s only so much you can do to try prevent them from giving up more kills all whilst trying to keep yourself safe from the 20stack soto and mejais diamond 1 Evelyn that is probably in your jungle waiting to 1-shot you if you even think about trying to take raptors. Yeah, not fun.","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-30T23:05:03.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That problem lies in smurfing existing at all, not SoTO and Mejai's. They exist for making snowballing easier and giving experienced players an easier way to climb if they feel everyone around them is a low MMR noob.\n\nSmurfing, on the other hand, is made to make sure everyone around the player is a noob when that's specifically what you should avoid. At least some of them have the dignity and respect to end games quickly instead of not pushing to get 50 kills, see how much they can get Baron in one game and to further humiliate the other 9 people","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-06T16:32:09.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So a noob or a few noobs are letting you down?\n\nGood, why would you want to carry these noobs.\n\nMove on.","replies":[{"poster":"President Garen","date":"2015-09-29T18:22:23.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because my LP in on the line and I lose more from a loss than I gain from a victory.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T01:30:33.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The moment viktor has 800 ap with only Mej Archangel and Perfect Hexcore","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-07T01:28:59.513+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The moment viktor has 800 ap with only Mej Archangel and Perfect Hexcore","replies":[]}]}
