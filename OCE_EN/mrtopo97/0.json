I came back after maybe like a 2 year break and got to play for 2 days. Then 5.14 came I this happened to me. I could finally play again yesterday and now 5.15 is here. Guess what? Bam. I'm honestly surprised you got a riot response. I had made 3 posts with no replies. I sent a ticket and only got a response after it fixed itself. So an almost 2 week wait. Honestly you are better off going and playing NA because it works fine. Sucks if your main is on oce like mine is because we have to pay to get a server transfer because riot login server on oce sucks. God forbid they add error codes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-08-05T23:18:15.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi!\n\nThis kind of error generally occurs when there's a problem with your computer actually reaching the League of Legends servers. There's a lot of places where this could be a problem, but it's a good idea to start at the most common places that could be an issue  - just a few questions below to try and break that down!\n\nHas this been an ongoing issue over multiple days or only today? \nAre you using a wifi connection? \nAre you able to try on another computer on your home network?\nAre you able to try on another connection (like tethering your phone) on the same computer?","replies":[]}]}
