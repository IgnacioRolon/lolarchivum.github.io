It also came up when I tried to make any sort of game, even co-op vs ai. I've looked on the boards and found other people who have experienced this problem in the past but there were no solutions there, instead it seemed Riot did something to fix it. Does anyone know how/why this problem has occured and possible solutions?\n\nEdit: If anyone does have this problem, try simply restarting the client. That seemed to have worked for me. This post is no longer asking for help, now it is a possible solution for if you have this problem. Apologies for wasting anyone's time.","replies":[]}
