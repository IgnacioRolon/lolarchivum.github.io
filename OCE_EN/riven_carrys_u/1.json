Will you guys change the price of it in the future or alter the skin in some way? As it really is just a scam for newer players who think that the highest priced corki skin is the best one...{{champion:42}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-19T06:08:19.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Red Baron Corki was created before all the good particle effects and skins.
