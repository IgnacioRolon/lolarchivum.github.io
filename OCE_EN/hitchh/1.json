It turned up fruitless, I followed all of the 3 steps and read the edits, but still nothing helped the launcher open.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck I have no idea what is going on.\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows 7\r\nOce region\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I should add more details to help come up with a solution or not, but ask if you need more info.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-25T08:39:51.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok, firstly, the reddit guide is one year old. It's referencing the older patcher, not the one which is current. Secondly, this guide presumes there is nothing wrong with your patcher, but there is something wrong with the patching process, which may or may not be your case (deleting those particular files cause a repatch of data your computer should have already had on it, it can occasionally solve issues).\n\nAnd you are right, I'd need some more information about it. Mainly, a description of the crash itself. What exactly happens the moment you open lol.launcher? What events transpire?","replies":[{"poster":"Hitchh","date":"2014-12-26T06:55:16.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll do a step by step process from opening the start menu to the end crash of crash.\n\n-> = next process.\n\nstart menu -> click lol.launcher.exe shortcut -> League of Legends Logo pops up -> (.2 second later) vanishes -> (.2 seconds later) returns with a very small loading bar beneath the logo (at glance looks like 15% loaded) -> again vanishes but for good.\n\nIt's not much to go off..\n\nI hope I described it clearly enough for you though.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-26T07:46:27.185+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why the reddit post didn't help, it seems that your patcher isn't starting at all!\n\nI must say that was a very concise explanation of it. Thank you for it.\n\nA simple solution for it would be to just reinstall the entirety of League, though I can see how that would be extremely bothersome (internet data, settings resetting and time). Since it seems that it's only the patcher, here's what you can do:\n\n1. Go into the Riot Games directory (this is where you selected the files to be saved when you first intalled League; default is C:\\Riot Games\\)\n2. Go into League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\n3. Depending on what has happened in the past, do *either* a. or b. (not both)\n  a. If you've ever switched server, and you want to retain access to that client without waiting for a repatch, then copy every folder but **lol_launcher** and **lol_patcher** to another folder.\n  b. If you want want access to the OCE client, copy the folders **lol_air_client**, **lol_air_client_config_oc1**, **lol_game_client**, **lol_game_client_en_au** to another folder.\n4. Using the Control Panel, uninstall League of Legends and all it's related programs, then restart your computer.\n5. Redownload League of Legends from the [website](https://signup.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload) and install just the patcher. **Do not run the patcher yet.**\n6. Go to the folder you saved the various League of Legends folder to, and copy them back into the correct directories.\n7. Start the patcher. After scanning all the files, it should be ready to play (may still take a few minutes to read them all though).\n\nIt's almost like reinstalling, but you don't have to redownload absolutely everything again. If you want to keep your configuration files as well, then be sure to copy all the files in the Config folder which should be in the League of Legends root folder.\n\nIf you're having trouble with any of this, post another comment asking about it. I'll be glad to help.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Hitchh","date":"2014-12-27T10:24:57.568+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I uninstalled league and reinstalled it, seemed to have fixed itself.\n\nI would of had to go with option B but I didn't have the lol_air_client_config files due to deleting them following the Reddit thread I previously linked.\n\nThank you so much for your help though, you reassured me with your sound knowledge on the matter.\nCheers,\n\nHitchh.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-27T11:50:10.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's happened to me before. ;) And sorry about mentioning to copy lol_air_client, I'm very forgetful.\n\nGood to hear that everything went right.
