I have built shiv first then IE. I am not a good farmer but I reckon my CS has been decent. I&#039;ve played like ten matches and haven&#039;t gotten any better. I have played top and mid and in all matches went something like 5/11 or 3/15. Could someone please give advice or tell me what I am doing wrong. I will happily answer any questions related to the post. \r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"Sniff","date":"2015-04-17T10:32:44.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cs is a must, yasuo is super item dependent and will get shit on without them. Yasuo is a champion that will take you a load of games to get 'good' with since he has a high skill cap and  is extremely squishy. Just keep trying him everyone plays him differently just find your style.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-14T10:01:35.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got spirit guard udyr with a mystery skin once.

It's your main source of damage and even though E does more base damage, you can't use it more than once per something like 10 seconds on any target you've already dashed to/through. With decent attack speed, you can Q 3-4 times in that same amount of time. The small base damage doesn't seem like much, but it adds up. Your E is used as a catch up. Let your lane opponent think you are zoned behind your minions, and then dash to an enemy minion near his back, and then hit him with a Q. In the few seconds you have (1-2), Q another minion or him if you're still close, then you e towards him and hit q to knock him up, followed by your ultimate and land a few autos on him, killing him.\n\nOr they flash/dash away before you get the knockup on them, so you go back to your tactic of farming with Q and poking with the tornado.\n\nHe's not a totally hard champ to play, but he is very squishy and will die very quickly. You'll need to build damage on him which doesn't leave much for defensive stats, and if they have a lot of bruisers you wont be able to chew through all that HP. Knowing your team comp is almost as important to a good yasuo player as knowing when to dash in or stay safe.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scimitary","date":"2015-04-13T00:27:09.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiananmenSquarÃ«","date":"2015-04-12T23:05:41.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are versing an opponent with skill shot abilities, use the creeps to your advantage. Stand behind the minions so they tank the damage or use your e (dash thing) to dodge abilities. Your windwall (w) can protect you and your team in sticky situations.\n\nSince yasuo got nerfed (I cri evrytim), I max his dash (E) as the cooldown reduces and does more base damage. Every point you put into your Q increases its base damage by 20 (20/40/60/80/100) + 100% AD, pretty pointless imo. E's base damage is much larger (70/90/110/130/150), Max damage on E - (105 / 135 / 165 / 195 / 225).\n\nYour maxed e and a few points in q is much stronger than maxing q first. Q scales 100% of your AD, and along with your e, good poke damage.\n\nIf possible poke your opponent with your tornadoes. \n\nGood luck with yasuo :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Realm","date":"2015-04-12T21:41:36.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, most Yasuo's outplay themselves, at least you don't have that going for you.\n\nDepending on the matchup is how you want to play...\nIm no Yasuo main, but I think I can help.\n\nVersing Xerath, Brand etc, try and max e to slide in and out of minions for poke.\nVersing Kat or Ryze etc, try and play passive, max q, and focus on cs.\nVersing Zed or Ahri etc, these matchups in my experience can go both ways, depends on skill really.\n\nJust try and poke with your tornado in lane, it helps.\nTry not to push too much, Yasuo dies easily from ganks as he has no real escape. If you must push, ward.\nTry and predict their main spell, eg. Ahri Charm; and windwall it. It helps with practice.\nIf you're not sure you can land it on someone with huge mobility, try and land an e,q tornado combo then ult, you should win unless they're fed, or you went ham on a doubtful situation.\n\nPractice... 10 games isnt enough. It can be for some people, but generally, if you're losing, its cause you're simply not used to his mechanics quite yet.\n\nAnyway - have fun :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-04-12T21:19:36.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your face isn't rolling hard enough.\n\nMaybe he just isn't for you, there is that too.","replies":[]}]}
