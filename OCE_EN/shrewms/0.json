I completed it and they said it&#039;s not matching, afterwards i asked if its about the actual 3150,4800,6300 ip champions or the ones that costed 3150/4800/6300 ip in the past.\r\nThen they said they can&#039;t tell for security issues? Are you kidding me? How am i supposed to know what to tell the support if the questions are not eloquent enough for me to comprehend them. I&#039;m not saying that its bullshit that they ask me about them because of course someone should remember what champions he bought 6 years and a half ago, or he should remember when exactly he made the account(not even the 1st champion bought date, just the exact day when he made the account). Not only that the questions are pretty damn out of hand(ask yourself, do you remember the day you created the account or the date you bought your first actual/or at the time 3150/4800/6300 ip champion? Yeah i guess you are confused and don&#039;t even understand what you should write there, not considering the fact that you most likely(90%) don&#039;t remember all the specified information(some of the people don&#039;t even remember one of them) ).\r\nCan i get a little bit of help from the staff or anyone that can help me towards recovering my account, or just some nice words that can make me feel better(at the moment i can&#039;t even play because it&#039;s banned for security reasons so Riot can ensure you don&#039;t have any bit of fun during the recovery process).\r\nThey won&#039;t even take information that specify when i bought certain items from shop that i have in the logs with my friends on skype or teamspeak, like is either what they asked you or nothing, the additional information is not taken into consideration whatsoever.\r\nI&#039;m extremely sad i spent more than 1000$ on this game and riot doesn&#039;t allow me to play the game anymore because i locked it myself for the fact that i wanted to have a better secured account.\r\nI even went to the PAX events, and i could say when i unlocked the PAX skins but no, it&#039;s not the first 3150 champion 6 years and 6 months ago, so it&#039;s useless for us.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n*Please read the entire thread before posting.\r\n**Sorry for the eventual grammar mistakes and for the fact i sound very pissed off, because i really am you know? Is like someone saying &quot;Fuck You!&quot; after you knew them, raised with them and spent all of your time you can no longer take back with them.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-23T08:17:00.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Shrewms! Sorry for the late reply. My personal advice on the issue is to provide as much information as you can about the account you're trying to recover. As I see it, they're just trying to get enough information to confidently verify that you were in fact the account creator. It'd be pretty feelsbad if someone could take control of your account because the Account Recovery process were too lax, and that's what Riot Support is trying to prevent. \n\nBeyond directing you to the [Recovering Your Account](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751694-Recovering-Your-Account) Riot Support article and my take on the situation above, I can't really be of further assistance in the matter. However, if you have any additional general questions about Account Recoveries or anything else, don't hesitate to ask!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shrewms","date":"2017-10-19T06:57:50.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BUMP.","replies":[]}]}
