I play Thresh, Nami and Leona. Thresh is my main and I will always use him unless he&#039;s picked or banned, but I am still capable of using the other 2 quite well. I am currently bronze 3, but I am comfortable playing with and against people up to high silver. I can sometimes do higher, but I don&#039;t want to be the bronze on a team of golds and hold people back. If it&#039;s needed, I can be a substitute ADC as I play a large amount of it in normals. I can comfortably play most ADCs, with best being Vayne, Corki, Caityln, Twitch, Jinx.\r\n\r\nMy summoner is UnholyDemigod, feel free to add me if you&#039;re looking for a support. I don&#039;t use these forums so I probably won&#039;t see any replies. If you wish to message me I&#039;m on reddit with the same username","replies":[]}
