I can play both roles interchangeably. ADCs in my pool are: Vayne, Cait, Jinx, Twitch and Corki. Supports in my pool: Thresh (my #1 main), Nami and Braum. I have good mechanics, but I&#039;m poor at macro, so I would do well in a team because someone else can make the decisions and I&#039;ll just follow suit. I have skype and curse for chat. Here is my op.gg prfile: \n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=UnholyDemigod\n\nIf you need either a support or an adc, reply or add me in game. You can also message me on reddit (same username)","replies":[]}
