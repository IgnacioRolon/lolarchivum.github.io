The only people who play them are either people who are legit keen on climbing rank, smurfs or otherwise absolute fucking idiots and kids who have no clue what they are doing they just rush into rank games and you get paired with them and then on the opposite team you&#039;re versing the people who legit come to climb or the smurfs. So now you&#039;re stuck with some dumbass kid who can&#039;t even properly cs or properly lane phase and you&#039;re stuck supporting this fucking idiot and that tilts the absolute fuck outta you!","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-08-27T11:24:21.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey friend!\n\nGenerally new - to rank players will decrease below the rank where an experienced player will be, so if you think you, yourself are experienced you'll find you will climb inevitably, it's a 40/60 chance you'll get a smurf on your team, odds may not be in your favour but a lot of the time when someone on your team carries you forget these instances. & only remember the poor experiences.\n\nTips for climbing:\n\n* Focus on yourself, what YOU can do better, what YOU can change to climb - you can't change what other people do, only yourself.\n\n* Ignore the toxic players (yourself) mute them and play YOUR own game. I'm classed as a high elo player and I too get \"inexperienced\" players on my team I am sometimes the inexperienced player in some circumstances, we all have bad games.\n\n* Forget rank even exists, play to win, stay positive and don't flame. If you're positive you're more likely to not tilt other players.\n\n* Try communicating via pings rather than typing - This does not mean ping mia on someone's dead body, or when someone does something silly haha :D \n\n* Have fun :) \n\nI hope these pro tips help you climb and stay positive! \n\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
