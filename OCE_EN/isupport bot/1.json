Because the fact that a people like you (not saying at all that your the cause) who gives off a negative atmoshphere for people like him who are trying to do better but because of the atmosphere through words you gave him then this would made it harder for them to pick themselves up without be criticised on. \n\nIt is also partly his fault for understanding and not seeing things through- maybe due to your experience allowing you to make the better shot calling- however he may not like following orders and do his own things which is one bad side League has. \n\nLeague is aiming to create a friendly environment where people co-operate and win together as team and help build each other with constructive criticism- he prob most likely reported you for harassement, toxic, such along the line of being awful to them.\n\nYou said said and I quote \"You want me to be toxic?\" this is already one bit to say that your threatening to ruin their experience- that which nobody likes including those who are no directly involved. \n\nI am well aware that people don't listen to you because of the experience you have in making the calls to win the game and they don't listen and pay attention and making pings to avoid allies being killed, but then again you may make mistakes and its not really up to you to decide whether it may be that you to say its not fair on you than there it is for them dealing with your toxicity.\n\n\" iSupport Bot: stfu lux you're not in charge of everyone\": But is it right for you to make the judgement to tell the shaco not to get dragon? I won't criticse too much about this but it is fair that they won't listen to you if you don''t understand from their stance- it is better for those who are no involved or tilted to make the all- which a research showed that support tend to make more of the calls and win more likely than those are in other roles.\n\n\"iSupport Bot: never your own wrong doings\" I understand that it is not your fault either and that you want to win for the sake of you and your team and they sometimes never co-operate but personally for me I try and that it is not always that I understand what happen wrong on my side of the fight or whatever it is but I also tend to blame those who made the call and had me killed without gaining much. But overall its being a hypocrite. \n\nSo far dialogue shows that you are toxic and blame them for your death- but I cannot be entirely sure as I havent read anything on their side .","replies":[{"poster":"iSupport Bot","date":"2017-08-29T04:23:09.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"1.) It was actually me who had the half a bad game and was putting up with crap from the lux 2.) Yeah I said that after getting sick of hearing her rant and rave at me and everyone else doesn't constitute to anything as I never went full toxic mode 3.) never told shaco not to do dragon just pinged him back as stated 4.) Lux is allowed to go around telling everyone else what to do and telling them they're bad yet I am telling her not to play rank games as mid until she learns more stating its the hardest role to master. There's a pretty significant difference in attitudes there! But finally 5.) I have put up with much much worse from other people and still never had to be bothered to report them as what does it really achieve in the end? why can't people grow some balls in this day and age is what I did truly responsible for a 2 week ban on anything this game is becoming a safe place for cute little snowflakes who can't take some harsh criticism sounds like including yourself by pushing this crap!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-09-04T02:22:53.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Probably because you were acting like a peanut.","replies":[]},{"poster":"iSupport Bot","date":"2017-08-29T00:27:05.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seriously I'm gonna be waiting for someone to give me a valid point as to why I should have been banned just because someone had a bad game and decided to take it out on me?","replies":[{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-09-03T08:17:55.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ANOTHER DELUSIONAL IDIOT! \n\nI will wait for riot staff to post your REAL CHATLOGS then I will laugh again!\n\nTHERE ARE ALWAYS AND I MEAN ALWAYS 3 GAMES WORTH OF CHATLOGS THEY GIVE YOU!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-29T00:56:23.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 bad game ü§î","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-08-29T00:51:01.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"most **retarded** shaco OCE\nnot the jinx whos **retaded** either\nsupport is allowed to roam **stfu**\nseriously yall **fucking suck**\n**you suck**\n**stfu** lux you're not in charge of everyone\n**shouldn't play ranked mid or top if youre as bad as that**\n\nNeed i say more...\n\nI've bolded all the things the system picks up, this is toxicity, i've been banned on terms similar to this\n\nNormally there is more than 1 game of chat logs, it doesn't just pick up your most recent game, it picks up all games since your last report, so either you're not showing the full story with the other logs or its been too long since the last report thus it doesn't send you the logs either or, you're stuck and riot aren't gonna help you :)","replies":[{"poster":"iSupport Bot","date":"2017-08-29T00:53:58.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Literally hit the \"copy text\" button on the log that is everything there!
