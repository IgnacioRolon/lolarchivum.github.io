I&#039;d love to recycle them and put them towards skin shards or take a chance and see if i can get a champion that i want or a skin for one i like playing.\r\n\r\nThe champions are like old trophies just sitting on a shelf gathering dust!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n=]","replies":[{"poster":"lIlIlllIlllIlllI","date":"2016-09-20T09:18:35.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would love to trun my old and unused skins into shard, so this way i will buy boxes and if i get good shards i can have the skins","replies":[]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-04-01T23:15:55.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">anybody have champions they have bought but no longer play and don't plan to that would like to recycle them out of their pool and put materials from breaking them down towards skin shards?\n\nIt wouldn't work, it would just encourage grinding and possible botting, something Riot is trying to stay away from. Could potentially work for champions, but it is generally expected that you try out a champ on free week first before buying it (so you know if you actually want it or not) + you get 3 refunds for this purpose.\n\nJust save up your champions till that inevitable point where you own everything ;)","replies":[]}]}
