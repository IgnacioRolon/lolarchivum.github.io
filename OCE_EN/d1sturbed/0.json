I am hoping to find a group or skilled person to help me get back into understanding this seasons meta and increase my mechanical skill in game.\r\n\r\nI refuse to be carried and only ask for patience from those that play with me while i quickly learn the ropes again and enjoy the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Sanity","date":"2015-06-07T09:00:40.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i was b1 now back to b3 almost b4 if you want to duo add me\n- Deep Sanity","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saggy Racks","date":"2015-06-02T09:31:52.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey im a silver 5 player, i too am looking for someone to play with :3 add me in game if you still need someone 8)","replies":[{"poster":"D1sturbed","date":"2015-06-02T20:24:19.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added you S/Racks.","replies":[{"poster":"span","date":"2015-06-03T06:35:54.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: span\nlets start a team!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"D1sturbed","date":"2015-06-02T08:38:20.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"added you billy,","replies":[]},{"poster":"Laurent","date":"2015-06-02T08:02:32.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a top/mid/jungle Bronze 1 player! :3 Almost identical situation as you.
