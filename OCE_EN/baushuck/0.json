He has been alive longer than normal people because of his wand and it&#039;s power to control the dead.\nHunched over like an old man. Skin is tight and stretched. Mostly bones and skin, his body is worn and doesn&#039;t have much &#039;meat on his bones&#039;.\nHe still moves quick and with vigor even though his body is decayed. his movements show confidence and force and no fear.\nHolds a wand. It is a wand made of bone with a small dragon skull on the top. The skull has a glowing orb in its mouth. This wand gives the necromancer his powers.\nMost of the outfit is there to cover his flesh to hide how weak he looks. He wears a cowl to cover most of his face and hangs to midway down his back. \nKosta has a skull on his mid torso that is held there be a crossover of leather straps.\nHe wears a belt with a skull as the buckle. And has small skulls hanging from a rope from the side of his belt.\nKosta wears leather arm and leg guards that have bones stitched to them for added protection.\nThe eyes to every skull he has on him glow with the same light as the wands orb.\n\n\n**About the Necromancer**\n\nKosta is intended to be a middle lane, ability power hyper carry.\nLow basic attack range. He has armour ability to use when in close range for basic attacks.\nHas two utility abilities, one low cooldown average range damage ability and one summoner ability.\nEach ability gets amplified by the passive stacks.\nHe should start ramping up at 200 stacks of the passive.\n\n**Base Statistics**\nHealth                     |500 (+80 per level)\nHealth Regen\t\t|5.5 (+.6 per level)\nMana\t\t\t|280 (+40 per level)\nMana Regen\t\t|6 (+.8 per level)\nRange\t\t\t|450\nAttack Damage\t|42 (+3 per level)\nAttack Speed\t\t|0.62 (+3% per level)\nArmour\t\t\t|25 (+3 per level)\nMagic Resist\t\t|30\nMovement Speed\t|335\n\nNote: These are just rough ideas for stats and haven&#039;t had much thought put in.\n\n\n**Abilities**\nNote: I haven&#039;t really considered Mana Costs and Cooldowns because play testing will change exact details.\n\n\n**Passive - Bone Collector**\nGains a stack of bone collector for every monster kill.\n\n\n**Q - Hands of the dead**\nA wall of Skeletal arms appear from ground slowing all enemies by 5/6/7/8/10% (+15% of Bone Collector stacks) in the target area.\n\nThe target area is a rectangle. \nRank\t|Width\t|Length\t|Slow %\t\t\n1\t\t|400\t\t|200\t\t|5\t\t\n2\t\t|550\t\t|200\t\t|6\t\t\n3\t\t|700\t\t|200\t\t|7\t\t\n4\t\t|850\t\t|200\t\t|8\t\n5\t\t|1000\t|200\t\t|10\t\t\n\nRange is 700 for all ranks.\nCooldown should be large for rank 1.\n\nNote: The idea is to block off the enemies exit in order to get into range for basic attacks and Raging Skull casts.\n\n**w - Raging Skull**\nThrows a skull in a straight line in a target direction. \nThe skull will explode when reaching the maximum range or hitting an enemy Champion.\nThe explosion can be activated be a second press.\nThe explosion does 40/70/110/150/200 (+40% of Bone Collector stacks and +30% AP) damage to all nearby enemies.\n\nRank\t|Damage\t|Cooldown\n1\t\t|40\t\t|7\n2\t\t|70\t\t|6\n3\t\t|110\t\t|5\n4\t\t|150\t\t|4\n5\t\t|200\t\t|3\n\nRange is 500 for all ranks.\nExplosion radius is 200.\n\nNote: This ability will allow a little harass in lane but will shine once a few items are completed and the minion kills are high.\n\n**E - Bone Armour**\nCreates a barrier of bones on a the Champion increasing Magic Resist and Armour by 10 (+15% of Bone Collector stacks and 50% Armour) for 4 seconds.\nCan be cast on friendly units at 70% effectiveness.\nSkeletons get 50% effectiveness of skill but all skeletons get Bone Armour.\n\nRank\t|Cooldown\n1       \t|20\n2\t\t|20\n3\t\t|17\n4\t\t|15\n5\t\t|13\n\nNote: This skill is intended to give the champion some protection while getting into the fight to trade in lane. And also to help protect friendly units in team fights.\n\n\n**R - Raise Skeletons**\nSummons 1 (+1.4% of Bone Collector stacks) skeleton on enemy Champion.\nSkeletons chase and hit the target for 150/200/350 (+35% of Bone Collector stacks and +30% AP) each over 6 seconds.\nSkeletons have 180 (+100% of Bone Collector stacks) life.\nSkeletons have a movement speed of 280 (+50% Bone Collector stacks).\n\nRank\t|Damage\t|Cooldown\n1\t        |150\t        |120\n2      \t|200   \t|100\n3      \t|350  \t|70\n\nNote: They can be controlled like Tibbers once the initial target is dead. They only attack Champions. They are ignored by and ignore Turrets.\n\n**Edit April 15**\nI was scared that the ultimate would be too weak and over compensated by making the skeletons immune to damage and slows. I have taken that out.\nI also crunched a few numbers to better get an idea about damage and scaling. I reduced a few base numbers and lifted the scaling. I also buffed the W a bit because the champion needs to be able to farm to get stacks.\nAt about 140-160  bone stacks (10-20 minutes into a game) he should be becoming a threat. At 230-250 bone stacks (25-30 minutes into a game) he should be a strong carry.\n\n**Q - Hands of the dead Changes**\nReduced slow from 5/10/15/20/25% to 5/6/7/8/10%.\nIncreased Bone Collector scale from 5% to 15%.\n\n**w - Raging Skull Changes**\nIncreased base damage from 30/55/100/150/200 to 40/70/110/150/200. \nIncreased Bone Collector scale from 20% to 40%.\nReduced cooldown from 10/9/8/6/4 to 7/6/5/4/3.\n\n**E - Bone Armour Changes**\nIncreased Bone Collector scale from 10% to 15%.\nCan now be cast on Skeletons for 50% effectiveness.\n\n**R - Raise Skeletons Changes**\nIncreased Bone Collector scale on the number of skeletons summoned from 1% to 1.4%. \nReduced Base damage from 150/250/400 to 150/200/350.\nIncreased Bone Collector scale on skeleton damage from 20% to 35%.\nSkeletons are no longer immune to damage and crowd control.\nSkeletons have hit points of 180 and scales with 100% of Bone Collector stacks.\nReduced the cooldown from 180/140/90 to 120/100/70.\nSkeletons now have a movement speed of 280 and scales with 50% Bone Collector stacks.","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-04-29T22:37:35.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sounds fine to me tho bard seems the exact opposite since he so fat (he is santa in disguise told to my brother he is like YAY I WONT A 50 RP CARD FOR XMAS!!!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-16T02:12:37.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought Rocco siffredi was the Lord of bones","replies":[]},{"poster":"bausHuck","date":"2015-04-15T08:13:38.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Made some changes.
