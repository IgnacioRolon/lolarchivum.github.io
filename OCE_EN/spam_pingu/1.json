Tank Ekko. It wasn&#039;t too hard to get the score that I did (23/0/16), but the thing that triggered me after was the fact that I had only achieved an S- after a game like that. I just don&#039;t understand how I can get an S+ when that score only gives me an S-. Please Riot. :( The link is the post game stats to show I did get an S- and that that was my true score line. \r\n\r\nBut really, Riot come on. Please.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-04-13T02:59:56.140+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't a set score you need to achieve, it's all relative to how everyone else on the server is doing with the same champ in the same role.\n\nFrom Riot:\n\n> It’s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of top lane Ekko gods. \n\nRiot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-04-13T02:52:20.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Pretty obvious actually. You took too long to close out the game. If it was under 25 or maybe 30 minutes you would've got an S+ easily. I got one just last night playing nami mid and ended the game nice and quick. Seems pretty easy too me.","replies":[{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-13T03:09:37.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You would have gotten it because there are much less players taking Nami mid, so it is easier to get a higher grade. I don't think the time of the game affects it, it seems a lot harder to get a higher grade in a shorter game to my experience. Of course, there's no Riot confirmation on this, so I could be wrong.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Featherpirate","date":"2016-04-13T03:08:33.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because it's comparing you to every other Ekko top player like Princess Yaia said, it basically is saying there's about ~2-5% players who did a better job. (percentage is a bit of a guess, I read that S+ is the top 2% of players)","replies":[]}]}
