The only time it goes down is when power goes out and I bring it back up instantly then as its just power overload during summer.\nI have about 450 slots available and only have 10% of that used on a daily basis at one time, so I would like to fill it out as I run this server at my own cost and would to make sure it gets as much purpose as possible.\nSo im offering free rooms to any groups of friends/teams that want one!\nI keep the server clean and laid out nicely so no mass amounts of icons or multiple sub channels, Im on fairly regularly and if not there should be another server mod on at all times.\nYou can do what you want with your rooms (outside of offensive titles/descriptions and multiple sub channels that make it messy) so you can set your title, your password and descriptions. If one of you have net troubles and lag out (like with using skype we all know that one person who dc's if theyre in it) you can change the audio quality/codecs to make the room use less bandwidth as you talk.\n\nSo if you would like more information join us at 58.178.88.47 or you can either leave a message here or add me in game - IGN: R3cip3.","replies":[{"poster":"Diviara","date":"2015-02-18T09:07:32.211+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I log on regularly. I think I usually see 3-4 unique groups. Ranked teams, ARAMs or anything really.\n\nTS or skype they are all usable. Atleast on the TS server I can just randomly go into a room of strangers and say hi, maybe organise a scrim.","replies":[]},{"poster":"NEON Skybax","date":"2015-02-18T22:45:45.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like the idea of this since majority of the time i play with my friends we all lag since we are using skype, im the one that always lags and dcs.........

It's lighter weight (less memory/cpu usage), it's a simple join group chat. And most importantly (to me) it has actual individual volume adjustments (something I can't believe Skype doesn't have (although I quit using Skype a long time ago, so it may now)).\n\nOn top of that as this post was originally intended for, it allows opportunity to meet more like-minded friendly people. Be it people to play with, or people to practice 5v5s against. It is a lot more open.\n\nIf it is not your preference, then leave it be. If it is however your (whoever is readings) preference, I highly recommend checking it out. As a long long term user of it, I know it is a great community, hosted generously for free by R3cip3 with almost flawless up-time. That said, my room on the server is always unlocked if you don't know where to start. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
