Its purely there for voice chat and is less bandwidth intensive (unless theres a LOT of people on and talkign in one room) so yeah theres rooms on it which you join and talk in to people (youd have to look at it to know what i mean its simple though)\nso basically its good for communities/groups of friends/teams you can just log on see whos on and yeah. \nI run a PC 24/7 for it and use my bandwith/data for it so in power terms yes it costs me but the server itself didnt as its running on an non profit licence.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-04-29T23:42:38.694+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OK so I'm new to teamspeak.
