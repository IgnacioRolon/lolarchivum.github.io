If I found it to be a good game, or feel the other team is worthy of some respect for their attitudes, I'll say \"gg\" (and yes that does occur more often when I win, it's only natural that winning makes a person feel better than losing). Similarly with \"wp\" I'll say it if I feel most of the people played well or if the other team is worthy of respect for the way they played (and they didn't ruin the game with their attitude). There are times when I wont say anything though, because I know I'd probably get reported if I did say something. I rarely say more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dig Bick","date":"2015-05-06T04:08:33.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If I win, I say \"gg\" since I'm too lazy to say anything else.
