I main jayce, have a master lvl 5, but I recently started playing Yi because he would always kick my ass. So of course... my first game with Yi was 32/3/2. And my second was 6/6/1. So now I'm confused... is he good or bad? But then, I played him again: 45/3/3. So now I am beginning to play Master Yi a lot more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2016-01-06T12:15:34.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, love the dps king","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-01-06T12:31:23.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stuff it, thats 2 much work\n\nReported","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2016-01-07T01:29:15.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"um, k?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-01-06T17:37:07.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"best chump eva to be made so not broken at all an not op","replies":[]}]}
