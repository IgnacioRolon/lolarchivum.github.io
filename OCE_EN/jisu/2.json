If this launcher works, simply replace your shortcuts with this one.\n\nIf that doesn't work, follow these steps:\n1. Go to your League of Legends directory (\"C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\" by default)\n2. Go to \"RADS/Projects\" and delete \"lol_air_client\"\n3. Launch \"lol.launcher.admin.exe\" - let it patch","replies":[]}]}]}
