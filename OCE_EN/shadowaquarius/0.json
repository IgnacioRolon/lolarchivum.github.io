But I share your interest in climbing a little bit. I'm a Bronze 1 support main who can play jungle, adc and mid at a decent level. My champion pool mostly consists of Lulu (my best support), Janna, Sona, Xayah (my best adc), Tristana, Ashe, Lux (my best midlaner), Ahri and Warwick (my only jungle lol). I'm trying to learn other champions as well, as well as the mechanics of toplane. Feel free to add me if you wanna duo or flex or whatever.
