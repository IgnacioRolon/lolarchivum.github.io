That's just the way the meta is at the moment. Games get away from you fairly quickly with little chance of clawing it back.\n\nPlaying by yourself all the time can get fatiguing though. I've found myself trying to climb with my best champs, but the game gets a little stale for me playing the same 3-4 champs over and over. So I like to mix it up, head to normals and play a role/champ I wouldn't usually. I've discovered some fun champs this way.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T02:00:12.481+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"100% agree with ^. What I will say though, is although snow balling is quicker and faster, the current meta in it's wisdom has also allowed for scaling champions to have more effect on the game. Which means if you make it to the point of the game when the scaling champions hit an item or    experience spike you can counter snow ball more effectively than before. \n\nAlso 100% agree with playing by yourself and fatiguing. I am constantly trying and trying to try new champs to learn and develop but I literally commit game suicide if I'm not playing a carry champ. Unfortunately it's either carry you're way up the elo and be serious or try and develop and learn but continue to stagnant in my experience.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ducksource","date":"2016-07-12T01:56:53.595+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The only reason why you're not enjoying LoL is because you're trying too hard bruh.....stay calm and use {{champion:53}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2016-07-11T14:28:31.015+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk man, I climbed from Gold III to Plat IV pretty quick primarily playing Solo Q.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-11T14:48:30.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because you are a plat player, and a quick gloss of your Season 5 stats, say you probably deserved higher even last season.\n\nFact is if you are any place close to your \"Real\" MMR, you will struggle to win games (as in if you are low silver, and are really a silver 3-2, you will struggle.)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-11T11:57:02.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it should be renamed solo QQ \nI'm just getting back into normals now after almost a year of not playing/maining aram.\nYeah i'm getting stomped. lvl 2 champion mastery laning against lvl 7s xD\nBut honestly people generally have a winrate of 50-60% and if you have higher, you're either constantly improving really fast or you're playing opponents worse than you.
