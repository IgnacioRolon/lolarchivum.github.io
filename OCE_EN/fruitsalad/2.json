We have no funding in OCE.\n> The amount of money to even do these bootcamps is huge for OCE orgs. and (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) get practically no help from RIOT.\n> OCE gets fuck all in terms of competitive drive and sources of development. yet punished when they are proactive and seek it.\n> Those bootcamps bring so much back to the OCE Region. the knowledge, habits and mentality they learn actually trickles down the ladder.\n> \n\nWhile I understand account sharing isn&#039;t a good thing to do. I feel like we just don&#039;t have recourses in OCE.\nWhen you compare us to other wildcard regions we have close to no support or ability to increase our skillcap.\n\nSome wildcard teams play on EUW and can scrim pro and challenger teams. _(likkrit and other star players from multiple regions have stated this and the fact OCE is STUCK! in AMA's)_\nOthers scrim on NA and have options there. \nthe rest can scrim on china\n\nthat leaves japan, India and OCE.\n\njapan server I&#039;m told is very competitive and driven. games are very serious past gold 2.\n\nIndia isn&#039;t really started yet, however it will have access to Chinese teams which will allow Indian teams to catch up to other regions quite quickly\n\n**OCE has nothing. \nWe have no international events in our region, we don&#039;t have teams visit our region. and we have a very small player base.**\n\nDo I believe the fine is fair? **No I don&#039;t.**\nDo I believe the bans are fair? **Yes I do, but only just.**\n\n\n\nEdit: Sorry about the spelling and grammer.

I believe a strong league needs strong teams and vice versa. It's critical for the success of esports in Oceania that our teams continue to evolve; become businesses, grow fan bases, etc. Look at your favourite NRL/AFL team - they create content, they field professional teams, they have fans, they give back to the community and they operate a business. That's where we want our esports teams to get to. There is a ways to go, but we're making progress. There will be growing pains, but this is part of growth. We believe to achieve this we need to focus on three pillars:\n\n1. Financial support\n2. Mentorship + non financial support\n3. Standards of operations\n\nThe financial support we are offering teams this year is around double what it was last year. All 8 teams are now in gaming houses in Sydney, players earn more than last year and they compete in our studio. Studio games allow teams to create content which is appealing to brand partners who also are injecting revenues, plus it's obviously great for fans. We've also introduced a number of investor opportunities to teams, some of which have now been realised. \n\nWe are also assisting teams in growth where possible as requested. We share data they can use to pitch to sponsors, provide feedback on materials they send to sponsors and give tours of our facilities to prospective partners. \n\nThe third is standard of operations. As esports evolves, it requires everyone to evolve with it. Contracts, official communications and deadlines are all important. If we want to provide teams with the framework to grow, we need to expect and enforce certain operational standards. \n\nHopefully this gives you an idea of what we've made the decision we have in this case. You're clearly passionate about the OPL which is awesome, so please, continue to support your OPL team.\n\nCheers\n\nRiot Stupendous\naka Daniel Ringland","replies":[{"poster":"Raijin Bokun","date":"2017-03-16T03:48:34.548+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like that riot is paying attention to these issues however posting a lengthy version of \"yeah nah we do heaps aye\" doesn't get to the root of the issue nor does it acknowledge that the riot support of the OCE region is sub par. if we cant easily scrim against other regions or travel internationally to compete why would e sports clubs continue to invest in the region. i believe that pushing this issue aside and refusing to take responsibility is only going to further hurt a region that is widely called a joke among all the other regions. i would hope that this spurs a few people into action in working to ensure that a club has more support both domestically and more importantly while traveling, or at least put us all out of our misery and admit that OCE will never be a focus of \"real\" change.\n\nAlso the argument of  \"we put in a lot to the pro scene this year\" is a bit redundant considering it hasn't been to spur OCE ahead but to make it almost but not quite on par with all other regions. Dont make the mistake of thinking the fans of OPL are going to be eternally grateful that you finally manage to take us to a point that korea and even NA were at 4 years ago.","replies":[{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-03-16T05:51:43.717+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Rajijin Bokun\n\nCompletely understand the sentiment but just to be really clear we do actively support Pro teams, both locally and internationally in terms of logistics, as well as financially.\n\nTo avoid all doubt and not give you another 'yeah nah' - We provide accounts to professional players in any region they wish to visit and make introductions to local teams in order to help facilitate scrims. When it comes to international competition, we support the whole process - providing (and paying for) visas, flights, accommodation etc for the competing team. \n\nTo your point about not being able to easily scrim against other regions - outside of these boot camps and international competitions, there isn't a way for our Pro teams to scrim with other regions without having huge ping issues, thus they do not bother. This is something that is unfortunately just due to the nature of our location and doesn't have any easy solution other than encouraging teams to boot camp internationally.\n\nFor the point about us putting a lot into the pro scene this year, although we haven't publicly disclosed exactly what we pay - all the teams are living in gaming houses (up to 7 bedrooms) that are heavily funded by Riot among lots of other things. I agree with you that we are still years behind NA/Korea, but we are definitely working as hard as we can on bridging that gap.\n\nI think it is also important to note that there is more that we invest into the scene than purely financial investment - we are working really hard on establishing good long term partners who provide value to our players, spending a lot of time and effort in establishing a solid foundation for OCE Esports - from a behaviour expectation perspective to centralised revenue generation for teams, to more Live playing experience for players etc\n\nI really hope this provides some more concrete answers and examples of how we definitely are working on bridging the gap between OCE and the other regions - we want our oceanic fans to be proud of their region, teams and players and unfortunately there are naturally some growing pains associated with getting there!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-03-15T05:19:53.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"think you should read this\n\nits pretty concerning from an outside POI\n\nhttp://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1spn2ta\n\n\nEdit: \nIt feels like what you have written here was for the very thing posted on reddit a few hours ago. Not my original post.\n\n\nEDIT2:\ntouching back on the chiefs fine topic\nThis is exactly why i think the fine is unjustified. Most orgs give or get nothing. Here we have an example of an org doing nothing for the players and giving no money. \n\nchiefs being the best org in the OPL would still find the financial burden concerning. \n\nYou need to look into both the chiefs fine, and the TM Issue.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Link02","date":"2017-03-15T05:32:38.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I came looking here to see if this ^ was posted!","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-03-15T05:33:42.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have posted it.

People need to realize that these people are role models for the whole community (whether they like it or not) and need to hold themselves to a higher standard to encourage fair play, not be part of things like this.\n\nIt is a failure of management if the team didn't have the resources required for the trip. And and even bigger failure to allow the players to break the rules.\n\nI think the punishment is very light, if they found themselves in the same situation again would they still be tempted? Probably. If the punishment was a disqualification from the current split altogether and automatic demotion to the Challenger Series(very harsh, yes) would they risk it again with that much at stake, probably not.","replies":[]},{"poster":"belquin","date":"2017-03-14T23:38:50.366+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Guys, it's really good to see that you guys care about the region and our players ability to train internationally etc, as we do.
