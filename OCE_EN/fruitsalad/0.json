While boosting does exist, you aren't going to be encountering it every game or two.\nI played a lot of Karma support, for example, then went mid as her and dominated a few games. Also, whenever I have started a new champ I have been able to land a heap of skillshots because nearly every character I have played has skillshots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-15T21:52:52.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo Boost - Waste of money.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-15T21:53:19.391+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And deal with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-01-15T20:23:00.392+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that people do get boosted and that it is super common. Something that you are failing to realise, is that you can get good at a champion, so that you don't miss skill shots and can stomp enemies as well as getting near perfect cs. You can also do this 'gitting gud\" without it being recorded in your match history;  just play custom games and don't kill a nexus. \nSeriously, I play custom games quite a bit to practice my CS and it has essentially doubled in the past couple of weeks. I also have great positioning and harass on champions that it would appear that I have never played before because I play custom games and lane against my high elo friends. Super awesome quality map awareness also comes with practice. Watching twitch streams and youtube guides can also help, as you learn to recognise the patterns of the game. \n\nSo yeah, most people that you describe will be getting boosted, but some will have actually gotten good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-15T14:14:45.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"if boosting exists, then that means you can solo carry.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-01-15T15:39:55.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so true and if i cant carry its my fault also if i'm not a team player i cant win either\n\ni'm at the this elo because i belong here i dont deny that. \n\nbut they dont belong in my elo anymore than i belong in thiers.\n\nyes they can carry out of this elo, but they are usually quite abit higher skillwise as well.. \n\n\nits like david becham playing soccer competitively agianst 5yr olds.. its just completely unfair and really not fun at all.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-15T15:53:25.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">its like david becham playing soccer competitively agianst 5yr olds.. its just completely unfair and really not fun at all.\n\nA) it's beckham\nB) that's completely horse %%%%, your comparing bronzes to 5 year olds and generally at best plat's/diamond's to the world stage (fact is they are a long way off, which is why they have time for boosting)\n\nYour gonna have boosters, not much is gonna change that, play to learn and get better, not to win.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-01-15T16:30:27.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A: sorry forgot the K its 3am pls forgive\nB: it was to emphasize the scope of skill difference.  you cheecky little pri*k\n\ni play games to have fun, learn and get better. yes i also play to win.. which is kinda the point as well\n\n\ntrue boosters will always be in games, but that doesnt mean they have to be.\n\ni think its a lack of moderation and control that there a quite alot atm.\n\nwilling to bet most get paid bucket loads and refuse to work real jobs.. prob also collect centrelink.\n\n\nbut meh\ndon't care, over it. \n\nuninstalled 5 min ago. no longer worth my time nor money\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Deadspec","date":"2015-01-15T14:35:25.755+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Elo boosting to a degree exist in all competitive games there is not much you can do, One positive way to deal with it is to study them since they are far above your elo just try doing things you see them doing","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-01-15T15:41:51.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree and understand that but its just so common in this game its brutal. \n\nsometimes you get people who are just completely destroying the team and just constantly put the other team down.. \n\ni try my best to reflect, learn and improve\nbut in these games tbh i just switch off. its the only way i cope with it.\n","replies":[]}]}]}
