Do i think i&#039;m able to reach gold before season ends? maybe i don&#039;t know honestly, i will try but the hill has turned into a mountain.\n\nthe overall quality of ranked atm feels very low, and skewed.\n","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-08T08:34:04.614+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Show the match history of this player & i'll believe your story, but on the topic of your opinion.\nThere's often a good chance you'll have a smurf on your team if you're solo queuing & you don't complain when you get carried so why complain when you lose games to smurfs.\n \nI myself have 3 accounts, D5 P3~ and G4~ the ~ is around that elo i dont keep track bc i play for fun on those, not to brag or to say i'm one of those smurfs/boosters. Just want to bring to your attention there are few mechanically talented players in silver/gold who aren't smurfs. Just genuinely silver. \nI lose many games on my Gold account because of it, I wouldn't accuse them of boosting or smurfing - I blame myself for losing lane and in most cases I can pinpoint where i've made my mistake & what I should or should not have done. - In saying this my point is the same to you, focus on becoming better, focus on what YOU are doing wrong and what these alleged smurfs/boosters are doing right. All you can do is learn.\n\nBe happy it isn't a game like CS:GO where you get insanely punished by a smurf to the point you can't do anything or learn anything because it's just reaction speeds/aiming moreso than game sense.. \n\nAs you said you're silver - I have a **bold** assumption majority of smurfs are infact platinum elo. \nIf you think you have a chance of getting gold before the season end then why are you complaining about smurfs? low plat-gold-silver are much the same  just as D5-mid plat is the same. Focus on how the game works & what you can do to shutdown a smurf or outcarry them. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-09-08T11:39:28.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cannot show his/her name.. that's naming and shaming and is against board rules.\n\nI do agree with everything you say here, i try very hard to focus on what i'm doing wrong and how i can improve on that. i strongly believe its half the reason i have climbed so well over the season. in the ADC position no less.\n\ni'm always happy to take the loss on the chin, this isn't an issue. the issue i feel atm is right now the system feels very skewed. Why is that a bad thing?\n\nits end of season, people are getting help because they are either not good enough to climb, too lazy or feel entitled to rewards they don't deserve, if i don't make gold i'll be sad but it wont be the end of the world, i'll just try again next season and if anything, i'll know i can achieve it.\n\nMy concern is why is account sharing, duo boosting and paid boosting the accepted norm? \n\nI don't believe the ladder is this bad all the time, but at the moment being the end of season i feel this call is justified.","replies":[{"poster":"She Loves Me","date":"2017-09-08T19:15:55.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your friend, of higher skill level offered to duo w/ you would you say no?\n\nAs someone who likes to spend time with my friends, league of legends is that gateway to do so - In the past i've duo'd with my friends of lower skill level, not to boost them, not to make them happy, but just to have fun and climbing is inevitable over the course of 20+ games.\n\nReverse the situation too, if you're a higher skill level and you have a friend of lower tier but really enjoy spending time with him/her are you going to limit yourself to normal games?
