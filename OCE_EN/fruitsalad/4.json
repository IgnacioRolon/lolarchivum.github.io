Would reduce the amount of Account sharing and people who use alt accounts to just stomp while trying to learn new meta.\r\n2. Would reduce the amount of abuse during this period.\r\n3. Would promote learning. \r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#039;t think we have a the ability to use it 100% of the time. but in the first week of a patch i strongly believe it would make OCE a better place.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"Sp1rit Rush","date":"2017-08-10T16:53:12.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are multiple reasons why this isnt Possible. \n\n1. Queue times Will be Huge if they want a quick draft, you wont find it here. They will be the same if not longer than ranked and there is a high chance it will impact the queue times of solo Queue negatively. When you get to challenger queues can take 15+ Minutes. \n2. Dodging would increase if people don't get the role to play the Adjusted/added Champion or it gets banned (With 10 bans this is highly likely)\n3. 99% of people don't follow the new meta for days after the changes are put through, they almost always wait for it to be tried and tested by Pros\n4. The Community promotes learning not a Queue type\n5. In all honesty if people do want to do this normally just go into flex with some mates and test the waters there. If not go into a custom game, play 2v2 or 3v3.\n6. Most people play ranked not to Test the meta but to Climb, Blind pick is the best place to meta build as you cant have what ever you want to play banned away or Drafted away from you. \n7. Adding a new Queue type takes a fair amount of work server side as well. Is it really worth Implementing it for 2 days of use in a fortnightly period?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ceness","date":"2017-08-10T11:44:21.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But there's a new patch every fortnight, thus it would be turned on 1/2 the time...","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-08-10T12:23:59.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then make it 48 hours.. \n\nmost who play ranked want just a quick few drafts to get the hang of things and learn.","replies":[]}]}]}
