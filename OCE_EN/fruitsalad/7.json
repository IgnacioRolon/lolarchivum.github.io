Talk over a video game and just see what happens, go along on the journey and try and keep pace. There's always so much more to things like this that meets the eye! \nJust like players can be challenger in LoL, the champion doesn't change, the items don't change but how the players prepare and use it does!\n\nWe're always around to be asked questions if you or anyone else have any and thanks again for the kind words.","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2017-08-20T07:38:28.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No dramas.\n\nthanks mate for the reply :)","replies":[]}]}]}
