But i noticed with shaco when u ult and shaco dies the clone does nothing it stands in one spot. I feel like shaco should have tibbers ult to be honest. His ult isn&#039;t the best with damage unless your ap but still a tibbers ult with shaco&#039;s clone would be epic. If your a shaco main comment and tell me if you agree.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2016-09-26T17:07:43.587+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Firstly, \"unless _*you're_ AP\", \"if _*you're_ a Shaco main\", not _your_ (I don't mean to be a grammar Nazi, but your/you're, there/their/they're and to/too are the ones that bother me. These were drilled into me while I was of single digit age and I feel compelled to point it out).\n\nSecondly, @Nightjar: IIRC, the clone takes increased damage, and doesn't take damage for you, so it really doesn't double your HP. The increased dmg taken on the clone is one of the best ways to identify the real Shaco.\n\nNow, onto my opinions on this subject.\nAs an ARAM only player, I play AP Shaco (I have a few S grades on him, even though only mastery level 3), and have great fun with clone mind games. I have baited many an Ashe ult etc into the clone. Standing in a bush while controlling the clone, and moving like a player would, running to grab the heal, etc. So many giggles to be had. Or {{summoner:32}}  in, shiv squishy for a kill, ult and immediately stealth, and they think the clone is you. BOOM!\nBut yes, I agree with OP. Dying and then watching the clone just stand there like a muppet is sad. It should attack nearby enemies within sight range, prioritising champions that are within range.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-26T23:53:28.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"QAPLA I feel aram is not a good measure of how viable a champion is and Shaco is very strong at the moment on summoners rift. Also, even if the clone takes increased damage, are you really going to tell me that when you're low hp and two shacos pop up in your face, each of them doing around 250 damage an aa (If he's has a hydra), you are going to stay calm and work out which one takes more damage, or are you going to just try to pop everything you've got to try to get away or burst whichever one is hopefully the real one. I don't know about you, but I've seen players in gold who have been juked by the clone. Also shaco is squishy, so the damage difference isn't exactly that apparent in a high pressure assassination scenario so it's not that reliable for working out which shaco is the real one unless the shaco decides to build a few defensive items and even then most people won't tell the difference. Having the shaco clone there can also be incredibly useful for burning enemy abilities and ults, which means he can make you alot more durable and helps cheese dragons, towers and barons really early, even if it only does 75% of the damage because of items such as the hydra which does onhit damage that is not affected by shaco clones damage reduction. Also easiest way to identify the clone is whichever shaco is facing the top of the map when he ults is the clone and also that the clone won't have any of the stats from the shaco player's runes. Also buffs from things like kruggs, spellblade and such won't show up on the clone (however this is still hard to spot, though much easier than your method and you still see shaco's building things like triforce and lichbane). You don't need to bother hitting the clone to tell which one is real but no matter how you do it, it's hard to pull off in the 1-2s it takes for him to kill you.\n\nAlso I will say it again, use ALT+CLICK to control the clone NOT R+CLICK. It's much much less buggy and the shaco clone will almost always chase unless the enemy becomes untargetable such as tahm belly, kalista ult, zhonias, lissandra ult, ect... I got mastery 6 on shaco once (though I haven't been playing him much recently) so I know a fair bit about how he works ok.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-26T12:03:48.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay as someone who plays alot of shaco, firstly, if you set shaco to attack a target specifically, so long as they remain targetable, your clone will chase them (and only them) or at least it will if you do it right. Next the shaco clone pretty much doubles your hp and damage if you do it right and it's base magic damage is big anyways so it's alot of damage if used right even on ad builds. The shaco clone also makes splitpushing really easy since it lets him dodge pretty much any spell if timed right, doubles his aa dps and then forces your enemy to fight essentially 2 champions. Shaco's ult is not weak, though I do wish it was a little less buggy (tip: the clone is alot easier to control if you just spam the alt key inbetween mouse commands rather than press R. I don't know why, but it does't work well with the r button, so try using alt if you can. Also if you don't use the alt+click, when you die, the clone usually won't chase as opposed to when you use alt click). His ult is one of the best abilities in the game and the amount of things you can do with it are ridiculous and make his build path very flexible. AD burst, full AP, Tank-Bruiser, the ult just works so well with all of these.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-26T12:04:16.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In summary Alt+Click >>> R + Click.
