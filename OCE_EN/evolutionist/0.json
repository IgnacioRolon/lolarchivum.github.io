This is just what’s going to be happening in the immediate future, and we’re specifically focusing on high elo because that’s where the problems are the most extreme. There will be more changes for 2017, and they will not just be for Diamond and above. We’re not trying to neglect other players, we just need some more time before we make our next announcement.
