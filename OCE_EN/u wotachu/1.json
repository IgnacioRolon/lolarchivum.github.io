So AM times are my restriction / constraint.\r\n\r\nHowever I am constantly stuck in insanely long Q, O.K well it is late / or well early in the AM.  This is unavoidable, I figure deal with it.\r\n\r\nBut what isn&#039;t bearable is these SALT   &quot;AICHATENAMENT915&quot; etc... bots. \r\nREALLY? \r\nOH GOOD GOD! \r\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THIS GAME!\r\n\r\nToday I was playing an Aram, my favourite mode, got stuck with an AFK bot.. greeeeeeeat.\r\n\r\nSoon after my next game start, it became obvious this team was also all bots, but NOPE not for the other team.\r\n\r\nDespite bots now not all sharing similar summoner icons or names, that look like they are European Italian something and the behaviour has been updated somewhat, they still suck. \r\n\r\nSoon after start and as always, the afk bot is yet again in my team, ALWAYS, no exaggeration there.\r\nSo I get salty as fork, I have to admit. \r\nThe game drags to it eventual unclimatic end... yaaaaay......................... aaa...\r\n\r\nNext game, I see I(SALT) all bots. \r\nSo I rage quit out at the Q.  \r\nOK well fair enough, TIME OUT, wait before can play again. \r\n\r\nBut then next game I get is also all bots! \r\nOK I think deal with it that&#039;s your lot suffer.  \r\nBUT THEN TWO OF THEM AFK!! \r\nOH COME ON!! \r\nARE YOU JOKING ME!! \r\nWhile the opposition team were two humans, of which Teemo was one and the other was Kalista.\r\n\r\nSo next game I see again my team all bots!! \r\nOH come on its like past 10AM local time,  there is not a single other human player in like over 3.5 hours for me to team with :O  EVEN 1 \r\n(SALT)\r\n\r\nSo now after quitting my last Q, because still ALL BOTS, because their afk and just lack luster performance, I now have plenty of time, 30 mins, before I can play again to type this.  \r\n\r\nPunished for refusing to play with sucky RIOT AFKING bots!  \r\nThe AFK bots are Riots issue poor design development.\r\n \r\nNow I have a banishment handed to me because of the providers, RIOT, bot issue&#039;s and refusing to play in that continual fail scenario! \r\nWhat&#039;s even the point? if I&#039;m going to go against a couple of  humans and my all bots team 1 or 2 of them will AFK!!!! \r\n\r\nHOW IS THIS EVEN FAIR  ?- Terms Of Service -?  get salted!!!! \r\nSUCK PRODUCT!\r\n\r\nI cant believe a game with world wide standing! and a server that is open to at quite varied wide time zone, that there isn&#039;t one human for me to play with and against in several hours!. \r\n\r\nWith the remaining time I&#039;m locked out of playing coz refusing to play with RIOTS (salt) BOTS.  \r\nI&#039;m going to go and see what other free to play games are out there that at least have some humans!  \r\nThose that are worth my time and worth and eventually investing dollars in.  I&#039;ve spent a few hundred in online games, quality ones! -.-  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately  as much as I like league, it supremely fails dismally to meet very basic requirements. It ,OCE, isn&#039;t good.\r\nIf I wanted to play bots I would select bot mode!! &gt;|&lt;\r\n\r\nAlso as for modes why rotate them? or have modes not available more product available the more sales.... cant sell product if peeps only wait every so many weeks for their favourite mode.  Casual players / dollars can become full timers more sales .. the logic defies...to not have content.\r\n  \r\nI seen someone post say about the popularity of URF... \r\nWell if its popular product why not make it main stream option?  A smart salesperson sees the trends and takes advantage.. \r\nSO where is the logic in removing a popular product from the shelf or in the real life store and then selling less of an inferior or less in demand product in its place... is that really a great way to generate revenue...\r\n\r\nSo now, I&#039;m getting the shear joy to wait 30 mins, time out in naughty room, because I wont play with feeding or afk bots. \r\nOr enemy bots that tag team with 0 ping jump on your head and delete you.\r\n  \r\nGood grief Riot! This is not the behaviour of a fair reputable or honourable company.\r\n\r\nThis game is becoming a yawn in OCE.  \r\nI tried creating an account, to NA server, my same friend who first told me about league, said never have to wait long there for a game and far fewer bots...  \r\nI tried to make an account there, but t redirects me to this OCE disgusting service server.  &quot;Oh Cant Ever&quot; want to play on this = OCE\r\n\r\nP.S bet this post don&#039;t last 30 mins!  My mate said they censor fair comments / feed back!  \r\nEven though other post with f bombs, about people wanting their money back because the sucky dynamic Q are there.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-08-17T23:22:55.669+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=U Wotachu,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=KaFJiaA1,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-08-17T23:12:31.528+0000)\n> P.S bet this post don't last 30 mins!
