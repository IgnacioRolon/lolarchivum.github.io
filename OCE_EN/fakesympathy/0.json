All of my friends told me how fun the game was, and at first, it was. Then I started playing by myself and learned how brutal this game was if you made mistakes or failed\r\n\r\nEven when I got used to the basic knowledge of the game, I could never find myself improving. I wasn&#039;t playing to have fun (rather couldn&#039;t have fun) nor was I playing to climb the elo. I was stuck in bronze for all three seasons I&#039;ve tried. And that&#039;s where I had my limit. I just saw myself giving up on learning a champion if I didn&#039;t do well in 20 games. I sucked at 90% of all the champions I&#039;ve tried (all lanes), and even with 10% of the champions, I was good with I couldn&#039;t climb the elo because I was simply terrible at this game. Hell, my rank actually WENT DOWN from b3 to b4.\r\n\r\nSo then, you may ask &quot;Well why don&#039;t you play for fun, not to climb?&quot; Well, for me the definition of &quot;having fun&quot; is playing a champion that I am good at from the get-go. If I was feeding, not carrying, or failing my role, I just got mad and started to say some really mean shit to my teammates and even my friends.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was one of those people who were the first people to start the surrender vote or vote yes when someone else did. I didn&#039;t and still don&#039;t believe in comebacks, especially when the enemy team knocked all of our towers, 3/5 are dead, and they are about to get the mid inhibitor. I yelled at my team for wasting time and called them idiots for not seeing a loss.\r\n\r\nI am actually asking myself wtf have I been doing with past 3 years of my life. I will probably move on to other games that are currently meta (Fornite and overwatch, here I come), but I don&#039;t think I will EVER look back at this game.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\nWasn&#039;t having fun nor improving. Got angered easily especially when the team didn&#039;t surrender an obvious losing game","replies":[]}
