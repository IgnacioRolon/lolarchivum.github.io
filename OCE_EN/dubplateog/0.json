I cycled right and left multiple times and only gangster and pick pocket skins were there, but they were locked. I only have a screen shot of after the game saying I purchased the boost, it doesn&#039;t say what skin I got. The SSW skin isn&#039;t even available for purchase so I assume it shouldn&#039;t be granting it for a boost and is a bug. It is only a small amount of money but still, I want a refund. Search \"skin boost bug\" I am not the only one.
