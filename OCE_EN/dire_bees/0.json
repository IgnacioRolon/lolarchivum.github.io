A predator previously unknown to them stalked their feeding grounds, its large clumsy feet trampling the flowers in its excitement to devour the creatures that desperately tried to escape their impending doom. \n\n\tAcidic saliva dripped from its maw, melting everything it touched, the rising stench of burning fauna alerted nearby animals to flee what would otherwise become a grizzly massacre. The butterflies were not so fortunate, their aerobatics would soon not be enough to keep them from the bottomless pit that was the Kog&#039;maw&#039;s stomach.\n\n\tThe voidling creature, not dissimilar to their own young with their endless hunger, nipped the air between itself and the beings of its violent curiosity. Harsh and acrid huffs of air sending the insects fragile bodies into a disorienting tail-spin, many came perilously close to the hungry mouth below, their tiny hearts beating with ferocity matched only by their frantic wing beats.\n\n\tKog&#039;maw leapt gleefully over rocks and bush, its fanged straw-like tongue distending out as far as it was able in effort to suck the dainty creatures out of the air. \n\n\tIts belly elicited a hungry burble from deep within the little monsters body, a hunger only butterflies could satisfy. After all, what better way to know ones fellow life-forms than to have them nestled in ones stomach acid? To taste is to know, and the hungry void puppy was desperate to know everything. \n\n\tDid the different colours mean different flavours? Were their beautiful wings going to be sweet? He would succeed in his efforts, there would be nowhere these tiny morsels could hide, not when he had so many questions, not when he was so painfully hungry.\n\n\tWhen at last the first of the helpless creatures succumbed to the hunger of the voilding, its tiny body pulled form the sky by a great intake of breath, the frantic wing beats were replaced by the unholy sound of its body being sucked into the tubular tongue echoed throughout the meadow. It would be the first of many, only through repeated tasting could Kog&#039;maw be sure to satiate its curiosity.\n\n\tEvery new victim created its own morbid rhythm as the small bodies bounced off the inner flesh of that murderous tongue, until the meadow was filled with a grim and steady beat, punctuated by occasional monstrous sounds of delight. \n\n\tThe once beautiful flowered meadow now sizzled with the destruction of its ruined fauna, while the creature responsible sucked up the last of its targets with unrestrained glee. There would be other meals, and soon, the need to know and taste and devour all things on its relentless journey to find the prophet Malzahar had become a never ending mantra in its hunger driven mind. \n\n\tThe plump little voidling would be bursting with knowledge when it found Malzahar, a true academic in its own right. The prophet would see the brave little creatures endless hunger and bountiful understanding of Runeterra and know to open the way. That is why Kog&#039;maw must try everything, it must know the taste of all the delights this surface world had to offer, ready to pass on its findings, ready to please.\n\nAfter all, Daddy would be coming.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T10:47:34.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've always thought Kog'maw was cute.
