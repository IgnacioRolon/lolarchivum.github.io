Sadly this all changed when the people in charge of tweaking and balancing champions have single-handedly changed this from being my all time favorite game into one that I am bordering on hating. For a game with so many resources at their disposal their seems to be an issue with finding out the real issues with balance. It has an enormous fan base and yet the team seems to take delight in ignoring any and all negative feedback they get. Take the Veigar changes for example, I have not seen ONE post with a positive outlook on the changes made to his stun. Effectively he has been left dead in the water with no real CC unless the enemy team decides they want to give this one to him and leisurely walk into his ring. I know that the general sheep following will stick around because they have been told the game is popular, and I do not imagine this will change anything, but I am pretty close to leaving. You have been nerfing and changing champions like Zilean, Janna, Soraka, Veigar etc... The list goes on. The only thing you seem to think are balanced are the champions that the majority of the community has issues with like Yasuo, Zed, Le Blanc, Fizz and all those other people that are lending themselves to the \"League of Assassins\" meta that is currently rife in league. The simple fact that you have a champion that can one man an entire enemy team, while not having any sort of gold advantage speaks volumes to the fact that your prioritizing incorrectly. Please for the love of god, shift focus onto the champions that are actually in need of balancing and leave those that are underplayed as it is alone. An alternative is to send out emails to accounts older than 2 years that have gone innactive when the balance team has figured out that the things going clunk in the corner are actually the broken bits in the game that are presently not working.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-27T08:32:14.040+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its literally been 2 days. People always complain about changes. When they realise they have to change up their playstyle and not aim to hit the stun but rather aim to box people in or some other way to use his new kit it should be better.\n\nWhen Kalista first came out, people said she was awful. Now she is pick or ban. Shows what people know.\n\nSorry that a champ that literally has a point and click delet button got nerfed a little. Totally ruined the game LOL\n\nZilean change is awesome. Soraka change is strong.\n\nAlso paragraphs are your friend.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhui Aalimor","date":"2015-02-27T16:08:57.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"If my paragraph structure is your biggest counter argument then there are issues with the points you are trying to make. With Veigar's ability set boxing them in does not work, the delay on his E means that you require hard CC to hit is. Boxing them in may stop them from running for a bit but there is enough room in the stun ring for them to get out from underneath dark matter. I get that you are some kind of fanboy in whose eyes Riot can do no wrong, but please at least play the champion before responding.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-28T08:01:38.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets highlight yours points then for you to see:\n\n1. For a game with so many resources at their disposal their seems to be an issue with finding out the real issues with balance\n\n  - the point is moot, its never been balanced. Why you hating on it being unblanced now when it never was.\n\n\n2. You have been nerfing and changing champions like Zilean, Janna, Soraka, Veigar etc... The list goes on. The only thing you seem to think are balanced are the champions that the majority of the community has issues with like Yasuo, Zed, Le Blanc, Fizz and all those other people that are lending themselves to the \"League of Assassins\" meta that is currently rife in league. \n\n - Zilean: they got rid of all global passives. His new bomb is op since it stuns with a large radius now.\n  Janna: Changed purely because of how good she is in pro play\n  Soraka: her changes were needed since her pick rate was borderling urgot and she was just a spam bot. no real gameplay.\n  Veigar: Only recently changed. Will probably be tweaked.\n\n - Yasuo: was nerfed into the ground. Only recently with a small buff has seen more play again.\n   Zed: was nerfed and is still being looked at.\n   le blanc: was seen as a piece of sht only a couple months ago. went unchanged. People started playing her again and thought, hey she isn't that garbage. (probably will happen to Veigar in a few months)\n  Fizz: just got changed a lot and is still being tweaked.\n\nLegaue of Assassins is a much more fun game than League of Tanks or League of Waveclear, believe me. You don't want 60 minute average games because Ziggs and Orianna refuse to let you touch their turrets.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhui Aalimor","date":"2015-03-02T00:02:34.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=BarryButcher,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=EJUtp9ba,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2015-02-28T08:01:38.563+0000)\n Legaue of Assassins is a much more fun game than League of Tanks or League of Waveclear, believe me.

Zed may have been \"nerfed\" but the difference it made is negligible. Soraka had low picks but was more fun back then, actually worked as a safe support whereas now she functions more as a consumable, most soraka players wont heal you when they hit half health because they are too scared. I do not expect anything to change just because large portions of the community think that they should. Riot proved they didn't care what we thought when they went through even after the red post.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-27T05:13:41.205+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just need to use his stun properly.\nIts like Soraka's snare, or Karma's snare.\nThey are good.\nJust don't use them really silly.","replies":[{"poster":"Zhui Aalimor","date":"2015-02-27T16:09:35.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is nothing like those however, the area you can hit with his stun is a tiny ring around the edge.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-28T00:34:14.706+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is like them in the sense that they have to be used at the right time to work.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
