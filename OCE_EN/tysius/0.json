We both agree&#039;d that we&#039;d book our time off starting April 1st, purely based on our excitement and anticipation of the release of URF. To us, who don&#039;t get much time in our busy days to play League, this was perfect. You&#039;ve utterly ruined our plans for the next week and we&#039;re left without anything to do but share our disgust and disappointment via Skype.\r\n\r\nI really hope you can justify this lack of URF with something better than an idiotic Draven bobble-head in-game feature.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMichael (aka Tysius)","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-04-01T15:54:09.227+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"They already said that were was going to be no URF.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-04-02T02:19:01.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes but they said that about a month ago.

But to make up for it, they are going to be releasing it twice through 2016.\n\n> We’re announcing it now is because two years in a row, we delivered the Ultra Rapid Fire game mode in increasingly absurd ways.

Sure no one expected it yesterday (April Fools Guys, no URF). BUUUT today, April 2nd, its no longer April fools, jokes over, give URF back its rightful time, WITH VENGEANCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Eliea","date":"2016-04-02T11:03:34.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you expect RIOT to joke about it not being up for around April fools. \n\nAll things need to go through testing before it comes to the live servers. With the new rotating game mode queue being tested currently, RIOT didn't have enough time to also test U.R.F. for any bugs with new items / champions.\n\nJust be patient, it will come out eventually. I'm sure people don't want to play a game mode that is broken. It could be unplayable for all we know.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"claw09","date":"2016-04-01T20:21:18.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I am just as upset as you, because I too am frantically awaiting URF, in RIOT's defense, they did make an announcement that URF would not be released today, a few weeks in advance too.","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-04-01T21:00:56.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont think they quite understand the implication when they posted that.
