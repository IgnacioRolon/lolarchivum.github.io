I will however try to remain calm and logical as I present my arguments. I am aware that anything I say now has likely been said before (which is obviously a terrible argument to make btw) but I still hope to promote intelligent and reasonable discussion with people of both similar and opposing mind to my own on the matter. Please, if you disagree, don't be dismissive, don't be judgemental and cringey. Tell me in a thought out and comprehensive way why you believe I'm wrong. Btw it might be a bit of a read, dunno haven't written it yet, so strap in.)\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I'm fairly new to the game, only been playing for a month or two and while I was initially drawn to the flashy mid, adc I have gravitated eventually and by far most strongly to the top-lane. I would say this is both because it is where most of the champions I am drawn towards (bruisers and similar high damage/high sustain melee champions) and because it seemed (at least as a brand new player,) the closest to a pure 1v1 (as bot is obviously not 1v1, same for jungle and mid lane seemed to be expected to roam more and seemed to be ganked more. \r\nSo while I'm sure junglers, mid-laners, adcs and supports can all complain about the most frustrating thing in the whole game to play against I am going to be speaking about what I feel (from my experience as a top-laner) is the most irritating thing in the game. \r\nI don't feel like the meat of this issue lies entirely with it being overpowered or impossible to play against (despite the fact that it very often is, or at least feels that way) but with the fact that it detracts (significantly) from the amount of fun that can be had playing in the top lane. I'm talking about ranged champions and tanks. They both represent subtly different issues that both ruin the top-lane experience, for me at least. I would like to talk about the two separately but the fact is the issues connected to each of them do overlap so this might be a bit of a mess. \r\nI feel the problem with these champions is that they simply remove a great deal of skill from what I consider to be the most pure, undiluted part of the game: the laning phase. I understand that some champions are weaker and some are stronger early, that's obviously inevitable and fine. Where variety exists, the game can never be truly balanced. The problem is though, some champions being weaker or stronger early often just presents a new layer of skill. For example a champion like Kayle {{champion:10}}  with a fairly weak early game still needs to get levels and cs and she is vulnerable while doing that because she is no tank, and because she has to put herself in a vulnerable position in order to do so. Despite her being quite overpowered my point still stands, because she is not as strong as a lane bully such as Renekton {{champion:58}}  or Darius {{champion:122}}  early on, there is an extra layer of skill added to the laning phase. A champion like Kennen {{champion:85}}  (and other ranged lane bullies like Jayce {{champion:126}}  or Teemo {{champion:17}} ) on the other hand, has(/have) the ability to both be incredibly safe, and play as a lane bully (very aggressively) and poke their melee opponents out of the lane entirely. That doesn't seem entirely fair now does it. I think I encountered the epitome of this issue when I encountered a Caitlyn {{champion:51}}  top player a few games in a row. Regardless of the perceived power of a pick like this the fact remains that it is absolutely not fun to play against. Her range was so long that if I ever attempted to cs, she could take a solid third off of my health bar in an instant, even at level 1. On top of this, she was able to play so far away from me that I stood absolutely no chance of ever contesting her so long as she deliberately played safe. Maybe she could've bullied me more and played more aggressive, maybe that would've even been optimal. Either way, the fact is she prevented me from being able carry or be as impactful as I would've obviously liked too, basically just by existing. To make matters worse, if I ever somehow managed to close the gap between us without losing most of my health she STILL had access to cc and a dash to escape. I feel this style of play where the enemy can simply play as safe as possible and utterly refuse to engage in fair fights or trades is also exemplified in the tank class. Where is the fun for either player in sitting back, and simply preventing the opponent from doing anything meaningful. Just preventing them from having any significant impact upon the outcome of the game by, instead of engaging in a fast paced battle of skill and smarts, just choosing not to engage at all.\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\nChampions like Kennen {{champion:85}}  or Jayce {{champion:126}}  shouldn't get to be incontestable ranged lane bullies in the lane designated to melees.\r\n\r\nRanged and tank champions shouldn't be able to play incredibly safe in the early game and then not be punished for it. Bruisers often need to get fed early to be impactful on the outcome of a match and it unfair that mages and tanks have access to extraordinarily gold efficient items like Sunfire Cape {{item:3068}} and Hextech Protobelt {{item:3152}} so they're able to spike in power earlier with less need to play skilfully (to get kills).\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm getting a bit bored of writing this now if I'm totally honest and I kinda just want to get to bed. I'll wrap up by proposing that the lane might be better and more skill dependant if there were some disincentive to play ranged lane bullies and super safe champions in the lane. For example that Caitlyn {{champion:51}} I played against might get less gold/xp in the first 5 minutes of the game in the top lane. I understand that this is limiting and it arguably  diminishes the depth of the game but I would say that it could only improve the game and allow the lane to have as a great an impact on the lane as that of the mid lane or bot lane. I don't think the a playstyle that essentially makes the top lane the most unimportant lane in the game should exist as it is alienating and detracts from the fun and the skill of the game.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"LeBeanus","date":"2019-05-07T15:40:54.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn just looked over that after posting, sorry, bit of a fucking essay, if u dont wanna read all that i essentially say it all in the tldr","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2019-05-18T12:36:37.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"So I'm fairly new to the game, only been playing for a month or two and... \"\n\nAnd it's time to learn more about the game before proposing changes to ranged champions that can play in any lane that players choose. \n\nAnd for all of those top laners who are complaining, its time to actually understand the game, and not play like hashinshin and then cry about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A Beard For All","date":"2019-05-16T19:31:17.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"honestly you just need to now what to use against them man and how to play it. so kayle you want to freeze lane in front of your tower and if she comes near kill her but keep the freeze so you get lots of cs and she cant get anything. darius renek you have to farm as safe so possible and poke if you can but don't go out of your way to et them make a mistake. like try get a build up of 2 or so waves and if they go in your minions will do so much damage you can kill them if not tower hug and level up a scaling champion because both fall of.  kennen watch for his basic attack empowerment and avoid it most of the time they will move really close to try get it of for the stun. so soon and he uses it on a minions go in for a quick trade but make sure you have minions blocking so he cant hit his q. he either has to run or go in on you in your wave. if jayce stand behind minons and weave to the side of them to try bait his long shit so it misses minions and you. go in for quick trade he will more likely than not knock you back after you get 2 abilities off don't chase. go back behind your wave again. teemo. if he uses his blinding dart and youre trynd or something soon as he uses it go in on him like a second after and it will end by the time you lethal tempo winds up when you spin in on him. kill him straight up.\nnever actauly had cat top lane. but id say cheese her. wait in bushes start of game soon as she moves in to cs give her something to think about. if trynd wait for the front 3 minions to almost die spin through them at her so you kill all three and get a nice rage bar started then beat her arse abit, avoid her traps at alls costs they will wreck you very very fast","replies":[]}]}
