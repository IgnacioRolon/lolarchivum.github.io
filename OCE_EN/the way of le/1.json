Dont know why dont know how even i havent rage quit nor Afk in game but i got the warning. your report system is a joke. I know you guys trying to improve the system but come on still got far too much Toxic people roaming around on the OCE server. Every game i been in always a least 1 toxic piece of shit in game and the other team always refuse report the toxic player on your team in most cases im pretty sure they going report you cause they a fking %%%%. They dont care long as they win game. few of my games and i watch my mate playing lately always have one asshole start doing stupid stuff and throw games just because i told them dont do stupid stuff and play care, then they just never listen. I just dont feel like the OCE report system do jack shit atm, if soo many game i run in people like this maybe my bad luck, i dont know but i run in to them soo many time it mean they not really care about the System nor they scare of it. Maybe just maybe only happen to me hopfully that just happen to me.{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-07T06:18:16.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The leaverbuster system is not tied to reports. It is tied to AFKs and dodges. Remember that in the new system forgetting to lock in a pick or ban will result in a dodge.\n\nThe report system is different and deals with the post game reporting system. The punishments it issues in order are a 5 game chat restriction, then 25 game chat restriction, then 14 day ban, then perma.\n\nIf you have been punished by leaverbuster it is because you have afked or dodged multiple times. If you really believe it is a false punishment, submit a support ticket and the support team can look into it for you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-02-06T21:09:55.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-07T05:35:47.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Well if you count a 15 sec waiting for a item is AFK.
