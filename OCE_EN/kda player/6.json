Hope this advice helps!\n\n---\n\n**Camera Control**\n\nI really like the idea of how you used the cinematic shots in this montage but I think when recording just the gameplay itself you might want to think about how you are moving around the camera. You might find the small change of the camera always on the move even if its slowly (Could even do it locked camera on the champion) will keep the viewer engaged and sometimes even guide the eye for where you want them to look. \n\nDon't go to crazy with it, but if you can find the right speed to capture the emotion of the play you are editing and keep it moving smoothly it can make a noticeable difference.\n\n_Quick Note:_ I did notice that at a few points while there was the cinematic shots that they would just stop in place before transitioning that might be something to look at.\n\n---\n\n**Transitions**\n\nThe next thing I want to talk about is transitions. I would suggest playing around with a few different transition types to add to your current editing \"toolkit\" as at the moment I could see that you are using majority jump cuts. While effective it can be nice to mix it up with stuff just as simple as a slide, fade or some real fancy cinematic ones to do with it transitioning behind bits of the map or characters.\n\n---\n\n**Colour correction**\n\nNow I notice that you did use quite a lot of colour correction in this video which does create quite a cool effect, but the thing I would be looking at is that while it is cool, should it be used for the entire video? Thinking about it in this way you could possibly slowly build the colour correction up towards a big play or have it change with the pace of the song. Possibly play around with even de-saturating the entire video during certain parts of the moment calls for it.\n\n_On the topic of the music:_ I don't know if this is just me, but the music and overall volume of the video does seem a bit low, and at around 2:20 just kind of seems to cut out to start the outro music, which I feel might be a bit too early considering there are still plays going on afterwards.\n\n---\n\n**Wrapping things up**\n\nOverall very nice video mate, keep at it and you will improve. I hope this advice helps. If I can point you in the direction of some things you may want to research I would suggest having a look at this video by NiceTryIan:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udDYq9P2N0c\n\nIt goes over some of the things I brought up here and may give you some extra transitions and things to add to your \"toolkit\".\n\nIf you have anything you want me to elaborate on or any other advice, let me know!\n\n~Elam","replies":[{"poster":"KDA Player","date":"2017-05-03T07:39:36.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man thankyou so much for your advice and feedback, ill defs keep in mind alot of the things you have noted. cheers so much in advanced! :)","replies":[]}]}]}
