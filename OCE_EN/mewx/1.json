The problem is that I cannot get on the loading screen or in game (basically I can&#039;t load to get ingame). I have tried refreshing my laptop, logging off and on and etc.. I have tried playing on my smurfs account thinking maybe its just my account however its not, I cannot get on the loading screen and when its supposed to be the loading screen instead its a black screen which I cannot ult-tab from. I asked a friend to play for me and he said he can get on the loading screen easily but I can&#039;t, hearing from him, now I don&#039;t know whether its league or its my laptop. If you had this problem and solved it please help.","replies":[{"poster":"Mewx","date":"2015-09-28T10:34:21.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After a long while, i have found the solution. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jewr24hXCgo","replies":[]}]}
