After we had finished, we tried to make a new game but it said that &quot;something went wrong, please try again&quot;. Obviously, we both logged out and logged back in yet when we got back to league, it dragged us into a &quot;game&quot; (of which we did not create). So now, not being able to quit ingame, we are both stuck on the &quot;reconnect page&quot; and a false summoners rift. Has this happened to anyone else?\r\n\r\nIf any Riot employees see this, please fix this bug(?) as both CatGod and myself are stuck on the reconnect page.","replies":[{"poster":"Girty Dipsy","date":"2017-09-26T00:43:08.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep same stuck on reconnect also after finishing a normal relogged client and stuck in game >.<","replies":[]},{"poster":"Man of Steel","date":"2017-09-26T00:28:07.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got the same issue","replies":[]},{"poster":"HomelessJhin","date":"2017-09-26T00:08:37.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that makes 7 of us now lol","replies":[{"poster":"Mewx","date":"2017-09-26T00:09:45.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=HomelessJhin,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=adA3xees,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-09-26T00:08:37.284+0000)\n>\n> that makes 7 of us now lol\n\nfeelsbad","replies":[]}]}]}
