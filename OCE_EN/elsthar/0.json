I'm not sure of your PC setup, but have you tried turning some of the video settings down to see if that helps?\n\nAre you seeing your FPS getting hit or your ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Elsthar","date":"2015-02-08T09:01:11.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for super late reply, no fps hits, just straight up dc/lagging. My setup can handle 120+ fps easily without even sweating so it's not that. Upon further inspection, these little dc's which I thought happened in fights are seemingly random, but relatively common (about 8 times in a forty minute game)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-02-08T03:17:15.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a quick update, If you run an ATI based graphics card as I do make sure you use v-sync. League Of Legends runs on DirectX as its graphics API where as ATI cards are built with OpenGL in mind, there seems to be a heavy translation cost in League which will cause certain actions to lag.\n\nThings that can cause drop in FPS:\n\nMoving things from buffer to buffer\nParticle effects being buffered and then rendered\n\nTl;dr you have two options, get a very new card like mine (R9 280x), I play uncapped at about 300fps but when i enter fights it can drop to around 65. Or go with nVidia which seem to do DirectX rendering a lot better.","replies":[]}]}
