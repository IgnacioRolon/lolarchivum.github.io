Was quite surprising last night though, in one game where King and Destiny&#039;s team (they were duoing) were winning something like 30 kills to 20, and then they started losing badly, King suddenly exclaimed &quot;how are we losing?&quot;. The level of understanding in strategy between KR and OCE is phenomenal. They mainly lost due to King constantly getting caught as Jhin (didn&#039;t use blue trinket for 3 minutes), and the fact that they were doing silly chases while all the time being outscaled and never having wave control in the side lanes. They felt it hard when catching the enemy Jinx out of position a couple of times and still not being able to use the numerical advantage, because of no pressure/wave control. On the whole their mechanics are awesome (playing at low KR diamond level at the moment). Destiny was constantly hitting hooks with thresh and k1ng scored a pentakill the other day. But there&#039;s also so many facets of war strategy that top OCE teams just are clueless about. Let&#039;s hope they learn a lot in 3 weeks and take it to the Chiefs next split.\n\nhttp://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=lgdwk1ngv\nhttp://www.op.gg/summoner/userName=lgdwdestiny","replies":[{"poster":"HierosGodhead","date":"2016-12-14T15:20:41.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OCE will never be relevant on a global stage simply because we don't have anyone who can perform at that level and likely never will.

I don't think \"never will\" is realistic. Nationality or Region has nothing to do with it.  Like Lakigr says, we need to play the best to be the best. We also need better training and better commitment, which boils down to better funding really if you think about it. So the Dire Wolves getting in practice now is great for them! i just thought it was funny that a challenger didn't understand why the match was turning. I guess he's young (only 18) and has a lot to learn, which is fine.","replies":[{"poster":"jimuskin","date":"2017-01-27T02:45:11.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The players here in OCE are more skilled than those in other regions, it's mostly team based stuff which lacks.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-12-14T22:05:49.540+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only reason we suck so hard is because they only teams we can scrim against on a regular basis is the oce teams and the only time we vs other teams is during things like IWCI","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ozchuckle","date":"2017-01-10T12:46:57.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Iron sharpens Iron.\nIt's true for boxing and it is true for anything else competitive.\nThe OCE's best hope is that the money gets good enough they can afford to do training camps overseas.","replies":[]}]}
