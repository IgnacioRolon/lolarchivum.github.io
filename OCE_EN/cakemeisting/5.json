If I buy new CDR items, will it get even lower?\n\nNo, you sit at a maximum 80% CDR (with whatever exceptions are implemented by Rito)\n    \n>Can you teleport out of a battle when people are focusing you?\n\nTeleport can be used unless one of 2 things happen, you get stuned in some form that stops the teleport, or the tower you are teleporting to is destroyed.\n  \n>  Are gold generation items rendered inefficient in URF mode?\n\nNo they aren't, but considering that URF means that kills are the majority of gold, they certainly don't do as much as getting kills does.","replies":[]}]}
