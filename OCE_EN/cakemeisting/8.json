In the Caitlyn game, the team defeated themselves mentally before we even got on the rift. Bot lane was winning lane but every other lane was feeding. Of course the Caitlyn support got the blame (\"Report this Cait!\"). Unlucky. But funnily enough, no one said a word about the Kog'Maw choice. We won that game.\n\nDisco time! {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]}
