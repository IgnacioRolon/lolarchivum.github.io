Here&#039;s my take:\r\n\r\n**Jungle Updates:** Trivial, but will promote the tank meta. Sion smite top anyone?\r\n\r\n**Keystone Masteries:** Will be interesting to see what level the shield is on the new Courage of the Colossus mastery.\r\n\r\n**Items:** R.I.P. Aegis of the Legion, unless it is buffed to compensate for the removed aura, in which case, hello tank meta.\r\n\r\nKnight&#039;s Vow - Will top laners and tank junglers both use this? Seems interesting. \r\n\r\nRedemption - Will the actives and passives stack? Let&#039;s hope not.\r\n\r\nSorcerer&#039;s Bane - Lucian, Jhin and Miss Fortune say thanks for that, I&#039;ll use it! Should go well with Duskblade of Draktharr and Youmuu&#039;s Ghostblade, all of those shields and movement speed, perfect for these ADCs. In fact if it has no passive, just buy three of these or even four! ZOOM ZOOM\r\n\r\n**Assassin Update:** \r\n\r\nKatarina - looks like a strong update\r\n\r\nTalon - forget assassin Talon, hello TALON JUNGLE with a broken E and Poacher&#039;s Dirk. 3 Lethality items + boots + Jungle item + GA should be enough to snowball on the cheap.\r\n\r\n**Stealth Mechanics**\r\n\r\nInvisibility - Welcome back to the meta the hard carry Vayne!\r\n\r\nControl Wards - First team to the baron pit wins! Good luck getting close for the 2nd team! Will kinda put a heavy emphasis on taking down that mid tier 1 tower.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-10-19T04:26:01.434+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"really don't like the idea of these plants. But then again, i didn't like the idea of Scuttle or Smite Bonuses when they were announced they turned out ok, so i will reserve judgment until I play.\nGuess it makes the jungle more interactive for everyone rather than just champions with smite.\n\nI find it funny how Riot are going back to the \"anyone can jungle\" style we had when Rangers Trailblazer was a thing by adding a heal to every camp.\nCould be interesting. I just feel that junglers who sole reason for jungling is they don't get low (like Fiddle, Nunu, Warwick etc) lose their advantage when that becomes a thing.\n\nAssassin changes look like the ADC changes last year. Will shake the meta a little and will be fun to play. Zed will be broken. Talon just looks fun.\nShaco might not be \"useless\" in teamfights if he can just drop boxes and fear people for free with his ult.\n\nKnight's Vow + Bond of Stone. Just try to kill an ADC now when their damage is translated to \"lifesteal\" for the support.\n\nInteresting that they talked so much about \"adding counterplay\" this year, but they deliberately give Shaco and Wukong an \"uncounterable\" device (invis not revealed by anything) in order to try and force them into being relevant champions...\nAlso i didn't see it, will Akali be invis or camo'd while in shroud?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-10-19T04:43:18.773+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"To touch on your comments about invis, I think red trinket will still reveal their position (they just won't be targetable), but there won't be any full reveals. Most champs have at least one skillshot nowadays and with the other changes I think it will just emphasise the need for red trinkets (and actually using them). Where junglers used to swing between red and blue, it seems likely many more will be taking red trinket. As to how that will play out balance wise, we'll find out when we get to play it ey.\n\nAs for Akali, their definition was along the lines of \"if you move around the map with it (Twitch, Rango, Eve) then its camo, and if you cant then it's invis\". Akali's shroud is pretty long but it also doesn't let her move around the map, so I'm thinking it will count as invis and not camo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rich3331","date":"2016-10-19T04:28:25.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"invis","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Combilizer","date":"2016-10-22T05:21:33.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like we are in for league of tanks (smite Sion will be broken with all of those new resolve masteries and smite changes) and assasins (enjoy the new Kha'Zix one shotting your mages and adcs). Support items look like they are nerfed (r.i.p. aegis of the legion and others with health removed from them) to the ground. Good luck to all of those ADCs that are thinking of surviving, let alone carrying. League of meatheads is here.\n\nRemoving item sets and lasers from base turrets is pretty lame. I dunno why Riot remove all of the good little things that make the game a little more original at no extra programming cost. Kinda like when they removed inner towers tier 2 aegis protection. Guess its becoming league for meatheads after all, [despite riots claims of depth vs accessibility](http://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/2016/10/dev-on-depth-vs-accessibility/).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rich3331","date":"2016-10-19T04:26:25.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure rengar will go back to building ad not crit \n\nI'm a bit unsettled by the kha'zix changes, I appreciate the scaling ad passive but his early game (pre lvl6) dps and ganks was hit hard. I think he will be fine though, as long as the isolation radius isn't increased.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Frommo","date":"2016-10-19T02:50:27.302+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally like the new style these assassins have, it makes all of them not the same jump in, insta kill champ and jump out. They all have their own diversified way of getting things done. \nNaut and Sion will love that new keystone,  same with Ali and Leo so I feel like they may be seeing some play depending on how much of a shield is given. However Poppy is definitely staying in meta because that W just went up in value big time.\nThe control wards are a cool concept and I don't think it will be first to baron wins because of the new fruits that have been added and you do get a very small window of vision when placing a ward down before it gets taken down by the control ward.\nThe items are interesting especially the Aegis changes, not sure if Locket still has the AoE magic resist, I hope it does so we have three different types of Aegis but Aegis is just the base with no AoE benefit so you can pretty much change it each game depending on who your team is coming up against while always having the same base stats the Aegis gives you.\nI really hope Talon jungle is a thing, it'd be a nice change to see someone like talon in the jungle and that mobility makes his invades terrifying (also makes him a badass).\n\nJust my two cents on how I feel about it, love to discuss more honestly love new seasons and how different they are. {{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-19T00:45:37.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i personally dont like the new Kat Update .. rengars q will take time to get use to RIP Crit Rengar??","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-10-19T00:41:33.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty similar to mine!
