I have an idea... I moved to LA with all my things after my military service to hopefully make gaming content that people care about. If you like my videos a sub is all I ask.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UfO7qOHx5M","image":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5UfO7qOHx5M/hqdefault.jpg"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey guys been meaning to do a post on this topic for awhile now but haven't till now anyways. \r\n\r\nWhy is RANK so toxic ?. In my personal opinion I believe why the reason rank is so toxic is because riot isn't addressing what the issue is instead they ignore what the problem is and do all these other fancy stuff like chat limit ban or perm ban ect but it obviously isn't working and it isn't going too.\r\n\r\nHere's why \r\nSure you can chat ban someone who is swearing ect. but that isnt going to stop him from swearing \r\nSure you can perm ban someone but he is just going to make another account.\r\n\r\nHowever have you guys looked at it from a different point of view ? \r\nwhy is that person swearing and raging or being as what people call toxic in the first place ? \r\nFrom my personal experience and I'm sure a lot of you as well feel the same way' most of us play rank and play it seriously we want to rank and get as high as we can and not to be fuccked over by some moron wanting to try out a new champion in RANKED or is  feeding and making it impossible to win... however we don't get the choice of who we get team up with so whoever we get if they are shiiit then we're screwed and we lost LP. I know there is team ranked but most of us don't have a team or know enough people plus team rank isn't where the toxicity is coming from its from solo and duo que. losing a game because you a get a bad or just pure retarded person once or twice is ok' but losing games consistently over and over again because 1 or 2 of your team mate is feeding over and over making it harder for you to carry can get pretty frustrating and shiiity and it gets even worse when you get qued up with the same retard from that earlier game in your next game you either dodge and lose LP when you don't deserve too or  go through the same shiit you just did?. Have you guys  notice  its always the person with the shiity score or feeding that is bitching about others being toxic ?. I mean it's your fault they are going to lose a game and LP yet you don't want to be bitched at? then have a sook and report them ? for getting up you ?. RANK ISN'T A TRAINING GROUND for you to get better at or to try a new champion that's what draft/normal game is for . If it was me that was feeding and doing shit then I would be completely ok with people bitching and raging at me because I know it's my fault that they are going to lose and i deserve it.. If i was doing good and they bitched at me for more reason then thats a different story but you guys get the picture.\r\n\r\nso what the real question comes down to is how do we stop the toxicity ?\r\n\r\nWell first of all ' people wouldn't be bitching and swearing in the first place if they aren't going lose due to someone else fault would they ? \r\nMost people play rank seriously they don't play to troll or fuuck around and pretty sure not to lose LP on purpose\r\nIf they didn't get that single or duo scrub who is feeding and causing them to lose then there would be no toxicity in the first place correct ? \r\n\r\nOnce again it all comes down to as most people before have mention a (KICK SYSTEM)' I would rather take my chance with a new person in my champ select then the same feeding moron from my previous game as i think most of you would agree with as well. I would be ok if i lost the next game with a whole new group of people knowing the fact that I got to choose whether i wanted too or not play with the same person from before or not.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a 100% fix for the toxicity in league however I believe this is a big part of the reason why rank is so toxic and that it would help improve rank alot.\r\n\r\nSo I would like to add as well for all those people bitching about people being toxic you are the reason they are being toxic so either get good or don't rank if you rank and you're trash and make 4 other people to lose because of you\r\nthen don't get butt hurt when people bitch at you and report them for being so called toxic. I know people are going to reply to this and say that league  isn't just afew people its for everyone to play and I agree with that. But I don't agree with the fact that 1-2 scrub single hand causing 4 other people to lose is fair and then they get reported on top of losing a game and LP because they got up the scrub for feeding or trying out a new champion in a RANKED game or whatever the reason is in their team.\r\n\r\n>>>(KICK SYSTEM)","replies":[{"poster":"Addicted To This","date":"2015-03-24T16:40:04.175+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I beat toxicity by just muting everyone at the start of the game and saying something polite like \"Muting all, no offence, Ding Lots Please, If it's urgent txt me 02148181\" \n\nI like to assume my team and me are on the same page throughout the game and know what is happening and where we need to be and when to take towers etc  etc etc and so i don't feel such a need to communicate ... \n\nA lot of what's said between players within the game is irrelevant to the actual game anyway and i ain't playing to be social :/ \nand when people do say stuff about the game it's really short and blatant .. no real strategy between teams are discussed it's just:\nAll Mid\nHelp Top\nBaron\nDragon Up\nJg gank bot plz. \nand really all of them can be covered with dings. \n\nI personally become toxic when i get flamed or if i mess up and someones's like \"WOW\" or like \"that flash tho\" or just some little fucking comment to kick me when i'm down...\n\nIncompatible play styles get's to me as well.. like if i'm ADC and i want to be passive but get paired with an agro ass support.

Not condemn and ridicule.  The person can do well in regular games and think they are ready for ranked... then they get stomped on by their own teammates as well as the enemies.  It has not been pleasant.  I like the game, but not all the game calling.

The more people are actually educated on how this game works, the less toxicity there will be.\n\nThis isn't my main acc in total I've played thousands of games.\n\nYou know what I meant, if you haven't much experience with a champion it's usually unwise to pick it in ranked, for example I buy wukong, I play him for 3 games in a normal, go \"Yeah this champ is cool\" then go into ranked and go 0-15 top because I go against a master riven with 800 games, do you think as the wukong you even have a slight chance? nope, understand how to play out a scenario on a champion is far too important, you can have all the map mechanics in the world, but if you're unsure of the limits of your own champions you're going to do badly, notice how when someone plays a newly released champion they usually suck or are very passive and don't play to their potential?\n\nThere's such thing as a bad game and a bad player, we all have bad games, but some people are just do it far too often, I'm not saying I'm pefect, I've had bad games before, but If I have a 75% win rate with my main champion, there are obviously ways to reduce having a 'bad game' too often. Stating that people educated on this game would reduce toxicity would be correct, but the fact is most people who play ranked usually don't have a solid understanding of the map mechanics or character mechanics which leads to the game going to shit.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-25T01:50:51.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Which is why those people end up in Bronze.
