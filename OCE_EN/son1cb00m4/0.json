But still lose due to a really fed adc(if mid) or fed jg(if adc). Now it probably is partially my fault for losing due to me playing the &quot;carry&quot; roles and I&#039;m probably not doing my job well enough(just view my history make your judgement). Anyway back to topic, I just find it annoying how I just lose since either, one persons toxic(not bad, skill wise) or really friendly but bad(but can you really hate them, idm them...ish)\n\n\nAnyway(x2) Rant over now to what I wanted to really say\n\nIs there anyway(either champions or strategies) in which I don&#039;t have to rely on my teammates or still rely on teammates but increase my communication since I do tend to only reply to what others say, or occasionally &quot;gj&quot;. I main Leblanc, Ashe, Viegar and Xayah . Probably around that order. I&#039;d prefer just discussion here. not any, &quot;git gud&quot; type of comments. Thanks for any help.\n\nDo note that the wins are when I duo with a friend(b2). Probably cause I win against lower skill people and is why I can&#039;t climb.etc\n\nEdit, thanks everyone! For the advice I played two games(yes two is a lot for me) but I've been winning games solo queuing again. Thanks for the advice!!","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-10-30T03:31:16.724+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It doesn't matter how much gold you have or how many times you killed your laner, if you don't put it to good use. The game isn't won because one person has a lot of gold, but because one team out pressures the other.\n\nLet's say you're Le Blanc and the 6/0 ADC appears in your lane and one-shots you. Is it your fault the ADC is 6/0? Of course not! Bot lane are to blame. The real question is, did you do anything about it? Had you properly warded, you wouldn't have made the 6/0 ADC 7/0. Control wards only cost 75g. Always try to buy at least one whenever you back. *But that would put me 75g behind my next item*, I hear you say. Literally just W + Q the three caster minions (~60g) and back, and by the time you're in base you should have earned 75g. How hard was that? Spending 75g will save you time (from respwaning and walking back to lane) that you can use for farming. You will easily make that gold back, and then some.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat else could you have done, besides warding better? Wards aren't going to stop the ADC being 6/0. To which I say: *Roaming*. There's not really much point making your lane opponent 0/5. Le Blanc is very mobile. Hard shove the wave after you kill your lane opponent, walk bot, and attack the ADC during the early levels. And guess what? They walk away. They burn a summoner or two. Heck, they may even need to base or end up dying. That took you, what? 20 seconds? What else could you have done in that time? Hit a tower with your weak mage auto attacks before the early game fortification bonus disappears?\n\nWhat you did was use your advantage to apply pressure, even if it was small. That summoner they wasted or their low health means that their 6/0 state is delayed. Did you kill them? Great! Now their tower is chunked to 1/3 of its health. Who's going to stop you? The dead ADC and Support? Their Jungler cannot 1 v 3. If your enemy laner appears Bot, they just lost a lot of free gold and xp to their Mid Lane tower.\n\nSince you had pressure Bot, the enemy will flee when they see you. What if you go into Fog of War and send a clone Bot Lane while you back? They will run and give your Laners the advantage.\n\nAnd then rinse and repeat. Kill or make your laner low, shove the wave, appear bot for some light pressure. Did you waste their summs? Good job! That's pressure! Either back to lane or to base. Did you kill them or make them base? BOOM! Free tower and shove to the next one. Now they have the choice of either losing a lot of xp and gold to their Tier 2 tower, or losing dragon. Either way, now your Bot are ahead in gold and levels. Now what? Take top. Take Herald. Et cetera...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSame thing if you're ADC. There are two of you. You can have twice as many wards. Bot side River and Jungle should be lit like a Christmas tree. Don't be afraid to get Control Wards.\n\nYou need to look at the map as well. Did you see the enemy Jungler gank Top? Shove lane, ping your Jungler, and take dragon. The enemy bot are either going to lose the much needed xp and gold (since they're behind) or lose dragon. Either way, it's a win-win for you.\n\nIs dragon not up? Why not go and ward the enemy Jungle? How about taking some of those camps too?\n\nNow lets say you get the tower. Now what? Is dragon up? Shove to Tier 2 and take dragon. What if it isn't? Shove, then base, then gank your Top Laner, and just like that you have Herald and Top tower advantage. Who will stop you? The dead Top Laner? The Bot lane that are far behind trying to get farm on botside? That just leaves their Mid and Jungler. If their Mid leaves, then your Mid will either follow, or shove lane and make them lose a lot of xp and gold. Either way, the fight will always lean in your favour.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope this helps you :D Basically just warding and learning to apply pressure (not matter how small) to other parts of the map.\n\n{{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-11-01T10:44:11.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Challenger Eve,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=foqmrpnO,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2017-10-30T03:31:16.724+0000)\n>\n> It doesn't matter how much gold you have or how many times you killed your laner, if you don't put it to good use.

A lot to read, communication seems to be the reason why I lose then, well that and not roaming. I'll try to keep this pro active mindset, and see what advantages I can capitalise on. Although I do buy control wards(mostly, I have times where I forget). I'll put roam and rotate as a focus.

Yes Galio is strong and yes Galio was banned or picked a lot in Worlds.  And yes he was nerfed hard in the 7.21 patch.  These champs are picked or banned in pro games because they are hard to punish or have very strong team fight utilities under good communication, but it doesn't mean that they can be as effective in solo queue where players have much weaker mechanics and nearly no communication.  Champs that can help you climb are not necessarily the strongest champ in pro games.
