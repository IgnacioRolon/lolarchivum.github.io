The chat in the champ select screen is also submitted to Riot.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T10:27:01.658+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately the following still means you lose your LP. Screenshot all chat during champion select and proceed to dodge the game. Then submit a support ticket to Riot with your issue and screenshots attached.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-09-17T10:41:53.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible. I know of some games that allow you to report players after you have finished and left a game. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to your game crashing like LoL does after it is over or you just wanting to get away from the abuse your team is handing out.\n\nThe same can be done once the game has started but not yet started. The game client can easily be made to save all chat logs and player behaviour, how fast did they select a champ and lock in, what was said and so on.\n\nThan you just hit report for whatever, the screenshot and stats go with it and done.","replies":[{"poster":"DW GunGale","date":"2015-09-17T10:57:08.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Chat logs in champion select are already recorded by Riot. That's why you send in screenshots to Riot through support and they will check the champion select for that game themselves.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-17T11:45:53.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"so many think your not allowed to insterlock but you are there is no rule agenst it there is also no rule saying if you are at the bottom of the game and have last pick that you get what ever role is left if you were first pick went top and I was last I could go top and riot wont do anything as there is no rule","replies":[{"poster":"Oman2","date":"2015-09-17T12:10:10.160+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are no rules, plain and simple.\n\nThat said, we make community rules so that games can be fun and fair at the same time - you *can* insta-lock, you *can* feed, you *can* troll.
