I have as many computer problems as the next guy and these problems have caused me a slow gradual increase in my low priority queue time. I understand DCing is a problem and AFKs are a problem but over 10 min queue time is ridiculous the game are long enough. Please as a consumer of this product and a lover of league of legends let me enjoy this game without being pissed off all the time at it.

The average person would not have so many computer problems that they would end up being hit with leavebuster repeatedly, which is how the system is intended to work, yet the fact you have so many computer issues just goes to show that you have **more** computer issues than the average person. In fact, it explicitly states in both the TOU and EULA that the **PLAYER** (not Riot) is **SOLELY** responsible for maintaining a suitable computer (in terms of connection, software and hardware) to play the game, something you have clearly failed to do since you've been repeatedly hit with LPQ. Basically, it's your own dam fault.\n\n> over 10 min queue time is ridiculous\n\nI think you're missing the part where this is a ***PUNISHMENT***. It's intended to be unpleasant. Personally, and I think there are plenty of people who would agree, I think it shouldn't stop at 20 minutes but rather reach up to an hour. It already has the 5 minute - 10 minute - 20 minute, just need to add in, for example, 30 minute - 45 minute - 1 hour. Piss people off even more so that they learn to sort out their sh!t or leave the game and stop ruining the experience for other people.","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-08-21T14:11:39.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe not 1 hour long because as your waiting a big screen pops up and you can't do anything.
