Your skill level isn't determined by your best plays, its determined by how you play on average. Is some guy that goes 20-1 against you one game but then feeds for the next 10 games and loses every one better than you? probably not. In the same way, you could dominate for a few games, but if you tilt and lose the next 5, then you're not better than the people you're playing with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-03-25T11:15:18.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nah, they're not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-25T06:16:29.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Problem is most \"New Players\" are smurfs.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-03-25T10:57:47.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still, some people know that they can abuse that fact and just make new accounts for the sake of its easier to rank up when they can't get out of bronze, I have a friend who couldn't get out of bronze and _bought_ new accounts until he got one into silver...
