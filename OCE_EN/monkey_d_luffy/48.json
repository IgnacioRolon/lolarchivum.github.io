I mean depending on what I need I have like 8 different item set pages and 4 different mastery pages for shaco (rip after the rework, going to stop playing him) depending on how I need to play him and what item spikes and adaptive options I need (AD 1shot crit assassin, AD damage Armour Pen, AD lifesteal atkspd, AD duelist, TitanicTank, Splitpush, AP Jungle, AP TopLane, AP Support) so I always have a quick way to pick my item build options and optimise the shopping experience. I'm sad shaco will get reworked before I can use him in ranked tho. {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-10-27T04:43:30.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">How does the game decide whether a person put the wrong masteries on or not? \n\nHe means when you accidently have no masteries set at all (Those people you usually see with no keystone)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-10-27T04:28:06.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Miicka,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=tOTk1qEO,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-26T11:45:30.527+0000)\n>\n> You could literally start a petition on change.org if you really are passionate about it.\n> \n> I do like your idea, however it has its flaws.
