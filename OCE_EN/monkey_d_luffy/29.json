I've spent 1k on this game thank you very much, what have you spent? Thought so... People will hate it and lots will refuse to pay which i have done with a lot of games, but if someone really wants it knowing they're getting ripped off they will get it.\n\nYes it does matter because this is the persons hard earned money we're talking about, i like that bull%%%% you pulled out of your ass at the end there, donating money to Riot and not getting anything in return? That's hilarious, go ahead and donate to developers that made 1 billion dollars in 2014, what a very stupid thing you just said.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T11:20:53.363+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"I enjoy playing league, and i would willingly donate to them, so what if they earned 1 billion dollars?\n\nFact is i can be charged $60+ for 10 hours of play value, or go with whatever i want on this game for as long as i can play.\n\nNot to mention this \"price hike\" is fair.","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-08T14:18:07.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are a complete **r**e**t**ard if you willingly donate to Riot, you are just pulling **s**hit out of your **a**s**s **mate.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-03-08T14:25:26.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't listen to this guy, all he does is %%%% talk to anyone and everyone","replies":[{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-03-08T14:37:52.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Noticed lol, not responding to him anymore he's just talking nonsense.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-03-08T12:44:41.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could work. Some maths later and the $ to base RP rate seems to be $1=104RP (for AUS), with the exception of $35 (which could be considered an outlier), using the changed RP rates. Using that it would be reasonable to assume $14 would give you 1456RP, or about that. The problem lies with *bonus RP*. There's not any specific conversion rate in regards to bonus RP, so calculating that would be quite difficult. It's not even increased exponentially as the amount you pay increases, rather it's a bit more random.\n\nHonestly though if something like this were to be implemented I wouldn't be surprised if it had reduced RP rates and/or no bonus RP to discourage people from using it in place of fixed value purchases.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-08T06:18:14.388+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Personally I think that every time should have a fixed USD price. \nThen Australia can pay the converted rate based on the strength of the dollar.\nI have made this decision off reading the comments in the main thread. \n\nI also think you should be allowed to buy RP in bulk for the bonus RP, as well as just the individual items.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T06:19:50.200+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"And there was a red post saying why this isn't the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-08T06:25:17.082+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There post was that it would be too confusing. \nPersonally I disagree.\nIf someone is spending money online, the concept of conversion rates and different prices for different dollars is a basic one. \n\nDisplay the;\n- RP Price\n- USD Price\n- Conversion Price based on selected currency. \n\nThen have a currency selector in the top right corner of the shop, as well a the current conversion rate displayed next to it.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T06:55:07.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">- Conversion Price based on selected currency. \n\nHint: this requires an updated client.\n\nFact is it is complicated, and honestly, you have to take into account the twelvies that play this game.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-08T07:07:36.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well yes I guess the client update is where it's get complicated.\nHowever I stand by my point, if they are mature enough to spend money online, the concept of conversion is not that complicated.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-08T07:29:10.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> if they are mature enough to spend money online\n\nI had a laugh at this.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-03-08T04:56:11.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be fantastic for the consumer as it would waste less money for us.
