I don't see it as sportsmanship I see it as something that's just become \"normal\" with no real meaning to it anymore because I so often have  people saying gg when the enemy has an afk or what not, this isn't a complaint thread triggered by any personal rage  it's just about something I see too often and  I'll end by saying what justifies saying gg these days?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-01-14T10:46:01.744+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're the little sht that walks away after losing with the shts instead of shaking hands after a game huh...\n\ngg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robin Song Robin","date":"2015-01-14T10:54:32.493+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sore loser","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-14T20:47:55.959+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Robin Song Robin,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mg3nOpia,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-01-14T10:54:32.493+0000)\n>\n> Sore loser\n\nSona :D\n\nAnd yeah it is more an acknowledgement, as aforementioned, like shaking hands.

Since you both have to waste your time to 20 min mark to hopefully see an end to this. But they still shake your hands in acknowledgement of your skill despite you being completely wiped, that's sportsmanship. If you just walk away from that, that's well no good aye.\n\nGG is a give and take or otherwise thing, if you don't want it, that's cool but what isn't cool is you saying \"everybody is a hypocrite by saluting a game with respect\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2015-01-14T15:58:24.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg = git gud","replies":[]},{"poster":"SoLaZexal","date":"2015-01-14T13:45:40.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But its etiquette","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-01-14T10:23:18.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're just gonna troll then don't bother posting..,","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnsoNoob","date":"2015-01-14T08:59:53.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-14T08:29:15.343+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"gg","replies":[]}]}
