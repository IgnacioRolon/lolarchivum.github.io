Then it's a bad team, everyone will get them sometimes, it wouldn't be harder to carry, it would just require better team play strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the suggestion to remove secondary roles.\r\n\r\nTanks: Remove their damage, make them actual tanks.\r\n\r\nMarksman: Remove their self peel, make it so they 100% need their team.\r\n\r\nMages/AP:  Should just be damage dealers of a burst level, not people with high resets that can decimate a team by themselves.\r\n\r\nFighters: These guys are okay except for the ones that can get tanky and still do heaps of damage.\r\n\r\nAssassins: The problem is   that  some assassins have high burst yet can still sustain themselves in a fight which takes away from their high risk high reward.\r\n\r\nSupports: The problem I see is that a lot of supports are really tanky and have heaps of utility,  and some supports can even hold their own if played in another role due to their secondaries, supports need to be people with high utility that aide their team.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would  make it so team play is more encouraged and that you need your team, of course league is already a team game this would just make it more so, I don't really want to add a tldr but I will, just make sure you read the whole post if you have an objection:\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Take away secondary roles and make roles more dependent on other roles to enforce higher reward in teamfights.","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-15T22:29:10.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So pretty much you wanna make it so that teams are only as good as their worst player...
