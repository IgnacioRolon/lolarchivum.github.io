Very mobile plus strong dmg early. Gotta learn his mechanics though. Don't rush Q though if you're a bit unsure. Save the gap closers. I'd say if it's possible use E first then Q for more dmg. Heck if you learn how to ward jump I'd say walk into whatever lane you're ganking (they have to be pushing a bit) then ward jump at their back and E-passive-slow or E-slow them if they're too fast. You can always ult them to your teammate for securing it. \n\nAlways save the gap closers for later. Don't be the ones that only waits for doing an inSec everytime they play Lee. That's not the only combo you can do. It sometimes gets you killed if done incorrectly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-09T15:35:25.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Vi if you understand how new Jungle works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-09T11:36:16.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shaco if played correctly","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-01-09T07:26:22.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no one even mentions the bloody op af rengar with teh root and 99999999999 dmg","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-01-09T04:06:10.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nautilus is quite a good ganker, i m mean his lvl 6 ganks cannot even be evaded with flash alone.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-09T04:03:08.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sion has good \"ganks\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-09T03:12:04.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rammus, can lock down people for nearly as long as a Morgana snare.","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-09T03:04:18.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd say Lee or J4","replies":[]}]}
