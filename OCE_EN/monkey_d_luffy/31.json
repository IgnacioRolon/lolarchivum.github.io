(invisible spears most common on head hunter nidalee)","replies":[{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2015-01-11T19:23:14.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This has been happening for a long while now. The first time I heard about it was when I was playing Nidalee in game and the enemy accused me of hacking saying I was, quote \"leaping and blinking around everywhere\" I thought it was just her new passive they were talking about, but a few games later, with a Nidalee on the enemy team, I saw what they were talking about. It happens on the minimap too, which really confuses people. If she is right on the end of your vision radius, then she will certainly bug out. If she goes out of vision then comes back in it glitches momentarily as well. This also happened to me with champions such as Vi, Xerath and Varus, when they charged up a Q on the edge of our teams vision radius, they would freeze, and then blink to wherever they had actually released it from. I don't know if it still happens with those champions, but it still happens with Nidalee for sure","replies":[]},{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-11T10:35:55.432+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"send a support ticket","replies":[]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2015-01-11T10:34:27.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep I've seen that too.
