(Would really appreciate a RED(Riot member) reply","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Alright so, it's late 1:50 AM and I think to myself: I have RP to spend whats something nice i can buy? so I'm scrolling through and ultimately decide on Eternum Nocturne, I goto nocturnes page and when i goto the skin it just doesn't pop up with the option to buy, then when i went to the store i couldn't buy it from there too, so a  little annoyed I logged off and logged back in, i then proceeded to open the shop and just as I'm about to start  searching for eternum nocturne I get a message on skype, I minimize league and reply to my friend, now somehow I've really messed up here, i bring league back up and in the corner of my eye I just see the word \"eternum\" now since this skin is new it's at the top of the shop, it also has the same color  theme as its the same skin theme and my mind must of been absent at the time because I managed to buy ETERNUM REKSAI that's right, I screwed up hard on this one and I'm really annoyed  and I'm hoping to try and find a solution. so i did some searching and I eventually found this page https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751864-Content-Refund-FAQ  it says that if you accidentally buy  a skin you don't get a refund: \n\n\"I ACCIDENTALLY PURCHASED SOMETHING! CAN I HAVE A FREE REFUND?\nWe will not provide free refunds for accidental purchases under any circumstances. The only way for you to refund an accidentally purchased item is by using your refund token. When making a purchase, please double check to make sure you are buying your desired item. The store will prompt you to confirm before completing the purchase.\"\n\nI saw this and I thought, well great, at this time I've already submitted a ticket but it wasn't exactly my fault (Yes it was my fault but let me explain)\nthe first time I would of easily bought eternum nocturne and been happy however, Riot's shop glitched out on me, if this hadn't of happened then I never would of had to re-log.\n\nI haven't used to Rek'Sai skin, and I don't plan on using it either, it was an honest mistake and half Riot's fault too, I know what it says but I'm really hoping I can get some leniency here, do you think I will?  If not then it will be a complete waste of RP and  not to make threats but if I won't be able to get a refund or atleast swap the eternum Rek'Sai and use up what would of been the rest of the cost from the rp on my account then I won't be purchasing RP again, just because I wouldn't want to purchase something from a company that I deem to be unreliable.\n\n\n(PS: It was fully my fault on the second part, the only reason I believe I should be able to  refund the reksai skin and then buy eternum nocturne is because of Riot's shop messing up on me and for the sole fact that I won't be using it and haven't used it so it'd just be a waste of RP, and it's something so simple, if this issue is resolved then It'll just give me more faith in riot but if something this simple can't be resolved they've definitely lost a usual customer).\n\n(I have 0 refund credits left).","replies":[{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-02-09T23:51:35.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I know, NZ consumer guarantee laws only protects faulty items. So if it is faulty, regardless of the store's policy they ought and must give a full refund. \n\nNow, as far as a change of mind, it is not protected AT ALL. Which means, some stores generally do it for a gesture of goodwill so that they wont lose out on that customer. Now this means that their policy matter. \n\nFrom what I read of the refund policy, Riot gives you 3 refund tokens as a gesture of goodwill. You are not meant to abuse these, as these are meant for those 'accidental purchases' that you might do. They give you 3 errors. That to me, is not ripping people off, because as I said, a change of mind is not protected under any consumers laws in NZ. \n\nYou can take my two cents or leave it.

So much corruption in NA and even in Aus to some point.\n\nIn NZ people actually care about each other and their community lol. \n\nIf they ripped me off, I would be so pissed lol. I would go to internet cafe, contact my mates, get around 1000 reports from their previous purchases, and sue them.\n\nLuckily I have not yet been ripped of by Riot. \n\nSay if you are unfairly treated by Riot, they should have treated 1000 others the same way. It is not 10 dollars now, may be 100000's of dollars when ripping of 1000's of people.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-08T21:58:05.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You realize The T&C you agree to mean you can take them to court and only waste your own money yeah?","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T22:08:51.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the agreement is created in a way to rip off the users, then it can be taken to the courts and you win. Lots of companies bigger than Riot got sued that way. \n\nA T&C that is fair to one country like NA does not mean it is fair to every other country where that particular government value consumers more than businesses.\n\nMy point is if Riot is ripping of 1000's of people intentionally, an agreement can make them pay less fine. The punishment might be reduced, and they may pay less fine, still they name is ruined to NZ gamers as a untrustworthy company where every1 should be careful.\n\nAs I said, they have not ripped me off, so i don;'t really care lol ;D","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-08T22:15:11.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hint: your ripping yourself off, the T&C aren't designed to rip off users.\n\nFor example, it is all OP's fault he bought the wrong skin, not riots, they are not obliged to give a refund.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-08T22:28:30.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If he bought a wrong skin while his screen is glitched then yeah.

You can submit a report to consumer.org.nz if you live in New Zealand and they contact Riot. If Riot don't give you a refund, then they will be blacklisted for consumers to be aware of. Especially this can be dangerous times for Riot since they are lag issues caused by their upgraded servers.\n\nIf Riot is blacklisted in NZ, Aus may follow, but since Aus is capitalist they may not.\n\nBut NZ is consumers oriented. Riot implementing Rip off policies like they do in Capitalist NA and Australia lol.\n\nThe sad news is NZ is slowly turning into a capitalist country due to greedy John Key who is a elite banker and capitalist Arse kisser.\n\nRiot is still not aware of this issue.\n\nAll it needs is 100 reports from 100 different people.
