You are not supposed to chase Kalista if you are doing that she can kite you like hell. I main Kali too, 60 percent winrate. I feel Jinx is better in everyway when compared to Kali except when dodging skillshots. \n\nKali is little Op when she goes ham on melee, but as mentioned by MATUTINUS any kind of CC will easily wreck her to shreds. She is insanely squishy. So CC her and one shot her, game over.\n\nYou are playing on low Bronze, so people are still learning how to tackle her in that elo. DON'T CHASE KALI IF YOU CAN'T CC HER. End of story.\n\nGood Luck. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-02-12T01:24:51.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That singed game didn't really have any bearing on my opinion of kali, for a while now I've thought this of her, it's just what pushed things over the line. \" Don't chase kali\" in other words don't fight kali in other words you can't do anything against,  i didn't chase kalista in that game as I know it's pointless, I wasn't able to do anything against the kalista, and so much cc can just be dodged by kali, and cc shuts down every champ so it's not really fair to use that.","replies":[{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T01:34:38.290+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friend Of Golems,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=YTkPatYn,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-12T01:24:51.180+0000)\n>\n> That singed game didn't really have any bearing on my opinion of kali, for a while now I've thought this of her, it's just what pushed things over the line. \" Don't chase kali\" in other words don't fight kali in other words you can't do anything against,  i didn't chase kalista in that game as I know it's pointless, I wasn't able to do anything against the kalista, and so much cc can just be dodged by kali, and cc shuts down every champ so it's not really fair to use that.\n\nHere is the problem, the Kali you played against was an exceptional player. I saw history on that Kali player, his KDA is through the roof. So I am sure he is a smurf and main Kali. I have rarely seen good Kali players in this low bronze elo. So your bot lane feeds Kali early and her power increases dramatically like Kat. Don't feed Kali early game. Also in the hands of any good ADC player Kali can be played decently and efficiently.\n\nI still don't think she is OP, she is just annoying to deal with. She can be easily locked and shut down easily. I rarely seen good kali players in Silver elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-02-12T02:02:52.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"How is his kda through the roof? if you're referring to the custom then it can't count...

You have not played many games against Kalista, give it some time and you will realise how easy it is to counter play her. \n\nYour ADC must be really unskilled player inorder to feed to Kalista. That means you have an unskilled ADC.   in your team. Don't blame Kali seriously. Jinx, Vayne and tristana can me more OP than Kali once she is fed.","replies":[]},{"poster":"godsmustbecrazy3","date":"2015-02-12T02:15:57.334+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Friend Of Golems,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=YTkPatYn,comment-id=000000000000000000000000,timestamp=2015-02-12T02:02:52.566+0000)\n>\n> How is his kda through the roof? if you're referring to the custom then it can't count...

Kali has an OP passive...\n\nLook at all his games:\n\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=yodaman108\n\nHe had the same amount of kills with WUkONG 19-4 does that mean Wukong is OP?\n\nHe had Vayne 26 / 10 / 8, does that mean Vayne is now OP?\n\nIn the hand of a skilled player especially with ADC, positioning is everything. If you can't break through Kalista's positioning in team fights then you better practice playing against her frequently. Kalista, like Kat can be OP if people don't realise how to get to her.\n\nNormal games don't even matter dude. When playing ranked just choose someone with strong CC to play against her. GG.
