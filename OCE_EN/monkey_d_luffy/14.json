For them you are stopping them from playing what they want, effectively ruining games.\n\nThats why you are wrong, just because you want something you ruin what other 4 other people want, even when you have the ability to get what you want by following the system that the other people have respected, but you are superior to them and dont have to follow that system because what you want is the most important, not the other 4 human beings wants.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-25T15:59:35.769+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=LetsTwitch,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AcJwHLNJ,comment-id=000c,timestamp=2017-01-25T14:40:54.826+0000)\n>\n> [stuff]\n\nWow necro batman!\n\nThis thread is 2 years old..","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2017-01-26T04:00:20.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SEKAI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AcJwHLNJ,comment-id=000c0001,timestamp=2017-01-25T15:59:35.769+0000)\n>\n> Wow necro batman!\n> \n> This thread is 2 years old..\n\nIt showed up on my page so i replied to it.
