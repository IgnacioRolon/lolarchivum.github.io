I haven&#039;t played league for about 5 months, in which time I&#039;ve switched to windows 10. Running the game in compatibility mode for windows 8 fixed the bug for me.\r\n\r\n**Run the game in whichever windows you last used before switching to 10.**","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-03T01:41:09.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the tip!","replies":[]}]}
