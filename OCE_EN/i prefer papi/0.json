I got pretty upset at him and passive aggressive but I don't think I did anything that deemed a 14-day ban. I told him I was reporting him for telling Kaisa to kys and for calling me a f****t.  idk if chat logs auto detected that I said that but I'm very confused? I've read through the transcript Riot provided for me after i re logged. The only thing that I said that was arguably bad was when Voli said \"you've been nonstop typing and not playing\" (which wasn't true) and I said \"you've died 9 times. Looks like you've been playing less.\" Which is arguably an insult but a 14 day ban? I'm just confused to be honest. I tried hard not to get tilted and even post-game I told told yas gg because although he didn't do too hot he wasn't rude like voli. It's pretty frustrating to see this since I try incredibly hard not to get titled/etc during a game always keeping a calm attitude and trying to help the team which you can see in the chat logs. I've seen people do a lot worse go unpunished and I'm just confused. I created a support ticket but they've yet to get back to me?

We're missing a lot of information here so do take that into consideration.\n\n**If this IS your first punishment** this is more than likely a false positive. It wouldn't be impossible to receive a punishment from such a log with no prior, but it would generally involve a lot of reports for repeated but minor infractions, and I don't see any way it would prompt a 14-day.  \n\nDo be aware that the system does not use the same context for NA as it does for OCE (that context is player driven). The cultures are different and thus the context of what is and isn't punished is too.\n\n[Submit a ticket to player support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) asking for a review of your logs, explain that this is your first punishment and they will take a look. You may get a macro (pre-written) response as your first reply. If it doesn't answer your query simply reply to the ticket and say so. Second contact always uses custom responses.\n\n**If this is NOT your first punishment** that lends legitimacy to this punishment. In that case we'd need more information on what your priors were and roughly when they occurred to say anything with any degree of certainty. Naturally, you are still welcome to submit a ticket for review, but boards can't really give you a feel for what the likely outcome would be with so little info.","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-06-27T14:35:13.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Do be aware that the system does not use the same context for NA as it does for OCE (that context is player driven).

This metric is region specific, so the OCE system does not use data from NA to guide punishments, and the NA system does not use OCE data. For example, profanity is generally treated with much greater leniency on OCE than it is on NA because of the cultural differences in their impact.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"damageguy69","date":"2019-06-25T11:07:08.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn unluggy chief if this was all the context then thats not worth a ban tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"swen","date":"2019-06-24T04:23:47.080+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You got baited hard.
