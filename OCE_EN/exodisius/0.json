I mean, bard has a beard and hops around. The speed boost he gets from chimes and health stations could make him get a sled or something. His &quot;meeps&quot; could be small elves that follow him. His health stations could be snowflake shapes. His Q could be a snowball. His ultimate could make a snowdome appear or simply just freeze everyone.
