Which got me thinking about a character information, abilities, lore and design. Here is an idea of a champion concept that I have put together, and soon in the up-coming months I'd like to post a character design to go with this link so keep in touch...\n\n**Ha-skii the Deaf, Dog Whisperer**\n\nHa-skii Lore: (coming soon)\n\n***Passive***: Summon Flow, when Flow is by your side increase movement speed and Tenacity.\n\n**Q:** ***Scout/Stay:*** Command Flow to move to target location; if pressed again stays at location and returns when under 25% maximum health\n\n**W:** ***Strike:*** Command Flow to strike at target champion and stun if under 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% maximum health.\n\n**E:** ***Feed:*** Flow takes a bite out of target and heals Tab for 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6% of maximum health.\n\n**R:** ***Ravage:*** Attacks target champion and latches on; applies a bleed while slowing the champion by 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6% for missing health.","replies":[]}
