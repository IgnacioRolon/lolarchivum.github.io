I think after fnatic lost 2 games to origen they arent looking as strong while SKT are still winning in Korea where the entire region is looking absolutely superior again. I think china is in a bit of a throwup not sure whos the best or how they match up to the wold anymore, although Edward Gaming is still looking very dominant and I think they will win against everybody but SKT this time. Anyway here are my Guesses.\r\n1st. SK telecom\r\n2nd. Edward Gaming\r\n3rd. KT rolster\r\n4th.

They now have a faker of the top lane in Marin and from what weve seen of Bang and Wolf they are amazing bot lane. And we have to take into consideration that when EDG last played SKT they didnt play Faker until the last 2 games after easyhoon had already lost 2 games.\nAlthough EDG also contain 1 of the few mid laners that can stand head to head with faker but their top lane may fall behind a bit but making up for that with the amazing bot lane that china tends to create.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kenjishin","date":"2015-08-25T06:26:32.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope: CHF\n\nRealistic: LGD (IMP is better than Deft)","replies":[]},{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-08-25T02:31:19.859+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Faker.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SpawnTheCaster","date":"2015-08-25T00:58:34.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is one of those conversations that its as much educated guessing as anything at this point.\n\nI think EDG will win - but realistically they havent even qualified, they are just so strong in KORO1 Pawn and Deft and have the best Jungle Support DUO IMO.\nLGD SKT and QG will be the next closest to securing the big prize in my opinion. They all have something special \n- LGD macro play and a really good ADC. \n- SKT Championship coaching and Faker\n- QG just may be the best team fighting team I have ever seen with a beast jungler.\n\nI dont think that a western team is top 4 this year unfortunately but here's to hoping right.\n\n#CHFWIN","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-08-24T23:49:43.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who I want to win worlds\n\n1.
