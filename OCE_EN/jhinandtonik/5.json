Im looking to improve as much as possible as i feel i can make those improvements. I am available the entire week at all times. I want to hit challenger by the end of next season, I do think with the right work ethic and help i can achieve it. To improve im looking for a few diamond/plat players to play with in a team or flex queue to get used to better players and learn a lot.\r\nBecause i did ATAR i didnt have time for league so decayed down to plat 5. But linked op.gg to show that my MMR is higher than plat 5 supposedly.\r\nSummoner name: Muon\r\nCommunication: Discord, skype, teamspeak, curse\r\nAge: 18\r\nGot a good attitude and can be quite a meme at times.","replies":[]}
