Now to the real reason Im making the post. I was an ADC main and will agree as will most people that before the rework ADC&#039;s were quite broken and wayy too snowbally. Although what the role has been brought to know is quite a joke. I want to know what you guys think needs to be done to bring the ADC role into a usable enjoyable place. I havent played this game for a while but to see a role that I used to play a lot be reduced to this point is quite sad.\r\nLooking forward to seeing a few good suggestions","replies":[]}
