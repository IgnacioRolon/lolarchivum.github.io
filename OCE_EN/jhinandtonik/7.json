By this I mean I lack my map awareness warding and general team play and map movement. I will win lane or go even but lack the skill to transition that into team fights or map movements. Want to play some norms with much better players to see how I should play and get better. Want to play with you guys as I think it will be a good learning curve and will give me what I need to reach plat/diamond myself.","replies":[{"poster":"JhinandTonik","date":"2015-03-09T12:34:07.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can someone plz send me a message in game or add me in game I would find it really helpful\nUsername: Spontanious Burn","replies":[]}]}
