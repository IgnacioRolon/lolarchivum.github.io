The brand mid ended up 21/0 and those fuckers were even on other lanes meaning that they were almost ALL fed; my entire team was doing 0/5-10. So despite doing 24/3 the mid and top got destroyed and in the end I lost to a base race while those broken toasters were almost all mid still doing nothing.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} \nFIX YOUR SHIT RITO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"milos131","date":"2017-06-17T04:45:47.662+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt know this to i reported tem and flame them (4 of them in one game all 0/20) but i could win JUST BRONZE 2 THINGS{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chowlet","date":"2016-07-05T00:48:53.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just had a intermediate game with 4 bots on my team\nnone of them replied when i said \"if you are not a bot reply to this message\".

Chance vs XP vs lower XP was to high.\n\nSo I leveled in bots. \n\nI had the same issue. A feeder bot. If I called middle the bot would ping like a mad man about getting out of the lane.\nThen go into die. And do it over and over.\n\nThey really need to start stopping this bots vsing bots.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-07T08:26:28.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bots are a real issue in low level ARAMs as well as co-op vs ai games (especially intermediate).\n\nRiot do know about the bots in aram and co-op vs ai games. They cant do anything about it unless these bots are consistently getting reported. At the end of game screen, report them under \"cheating\", because it is a script they are running.\n\nRemember, every report counts! ♥\n\nLike Niji said, it isn't Riot doing this. It's people levelling accounts/IP farming to sell the accounts.","replies":[{"poster":"TheCurryIncident","date":"2016-05-07T09:15:20.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"right ok","replies":[]}]}]}
