Even though its been 6 months I have not engaged in flaming from teammates or to another people on my team usually mute button does the best. Anyway so are any special privileges removed after first chat ban?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-04T09:28:28.516+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"The biggest thing you lose when your account is punished is your honour level. Your honour level will drop to 1 or 0 depending on your specific circumstances, and you will be locked from earning any honour for the duration of the punishment. Being honour locked also prevents you from earning key shards. Once you climb back to Honour level 2, everything on that front is back to normal.\n\nThe other thing that you have to be aware of is your punishment tier. Punishments typically follow 4 tiers:\n\n    First Offense: 10 Game Chat Restriction\n    Second Offense: 25 Game Chat Restriction\n    Third Offense: Two Week Suspension\n    Fourth Offense: Permanent Suspension\n\nSo for example, if you have received a 14-day ban, then you are on tier 3, with next punishment being a permanent suspension. You can restore your accounts tier status to 0, but it takes a substantial amount of time. It takes the average player about 3 months to drop a single tier, but that time is also variable much the way that honour is. If you play less, or exhibit negative behaviour during that time, it can take much longer, and visa versa.\n\nNaturally, the tier status of an account is obscured to prevent people from abusing it.\n\nThe only other thing to be aware of is that having previous punishments and negative history puts your account under higher scrutiny, and may push a more borderline offence over the line into punishment-worthy. This effect too can be erased with enough time and good behaviour.\n\n___\n\nIt is not a fast process to return your account to good standing, but it's worth pointing out that none of the impacts that bans have are permanent.","replies":[{"poster":"LordMegatron","date":"2020-02-04T10:35:09.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks  :)","replies":[]}]}]}
