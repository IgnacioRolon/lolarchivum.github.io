Great, how often do you express that at a store or service provider beyond perhaps a brief \"thanks\"? Don't get what you wanted (regardless of whether it's justified or not)? You're probably going to complain to someone. That's just human nature, and it's rooted in negativity bias.\n\nOCE boards in particular don't get a huge degree of engagement. It mostly exists as a problem share/solve space rather than a content space, so the majority of posts are exactly that. The larger servers tend to attract the content creators regardless of where they actually play, because the audience is simply bigger.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2020-01-18T02:26:47.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"One thing you need to consider is that everything you see on the boards is a very tiny amount of what actually happens withing the community. LoL itself has millions of players daily, having even a dozen individuals show up on the boards talking about being banned is going to be a very small subset of player that are actually banned, as is situations where players show up to complain about \"overpowered\" champions, talk strategy etc.\n\nUltimately, it's not so different from any game with similar daily numbers. You could jump onto the relevant forums and probably find about as many people on those talking about their various in-game punishments in much the same way as happens with LoL. It's just a matter of there being so many players that the relatively tiny portion that actually receive bans is larger than many people would expect, since everyone tends to struggle to grasp the full scale of such large numbers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Synct","date":"2020-02-04T01:44:12.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Almost the first thing you learned in marketing is that only 1 in 20 people are inclined to complain.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-17T22:21:21.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Because literally everything is considered offensive to Riot here. \nI'd say walking on eggshells is similar to what we have to do, but even eggshells are more solid than Riots feefees.","replies":[]}]}
