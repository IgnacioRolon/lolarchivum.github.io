In my case, I got friend requests from people I was previously friends with when I had my account on the North American servers putting them in a separate folder for friends from that server. Meaning that you can now add people from different servers to chat with them over league which is really cool!\n\nIn your case, if it is similar to mine, these might be old friends of yours back from when OCE wasn't created (around season 2-3)!\n\nHope this helps.\n\n{{sticker:poppy-wink}}","replies":[]}]}
