It&#039;s a match made in heaven/shadows. Of course his scythe/Rhaast would be the candy cane, in Rhaast form his horns could be reindeer antlers and in Kayn form he could be a Christmas elf. Instead of his long hair in Kayn form he could have a long elf hat.\r\n\r\nhttp://shelleybhomeandholiday.com/raz-christmas-elf-hat-decoration-18-inches/\r\n\r\nMaking Rhaast a full reindeer would be great too, a red nose and everything. And Phreak if you&#039;re out there, this could be a great opportunity to get back out into the world of puns, you&#039;ve fallen off the radar in recent times.\r\n\r\nAnyway, those are my thoughts on a Christmas skin on Kayn. This skin will not come any time soon because Kayn is new champion but it could be for next Christmas.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T11:17:55.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen some pretty cool iterations on this idea.
