But this was not deserved. At random times after champ select my screen splits (a gap in the middle of the screen that my mouse cannot pass) as soon as the client launches (loading screen). This only happens whenever a match starts  but I am forced to restart my whole pc to fix this. This has never happened with any game that I played. I am worried about getting my account banned because of too much afk at the start of the game. Is this a problem with my client or my pc? ( This only happens with league)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-01T06:24:27.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Always test in custom games\n2.

If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[]}]}
