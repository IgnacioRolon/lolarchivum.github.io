You really should uninstall that and use proper protection. Unless that's just what you're calling Window's current security tools. The features have been integrated into the OS now, leaving the installable program in the dust.\n\nOk, here's what I want you to do. Open Task Manager (usually Ctrl+Shift+Esc, Ctrl+Alt+Del if that doesn't work) and find where League is currently sitting (just in client form, not in game) in your **Processes** tab. Sort by alphabetical to make sure it doesn't jump anywhere. Then, start up a custom game and attempt to enter it. Watch what happens in your Task Manager. What should happen is two more executables for League will open and one will steal your focus, which is the game. If what you see happening is those two executables open and then one of them immediately closes/freezes, then that means it's the game crashing, which means that it could either be a connection issue or just general crashing.\n\n[This page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201761974) will help if it's a crash, and [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) will help if it's a connection issue.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Get on my horse","date":"2015-06-20T04:10:53.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When i open the client there is 3 processes; LolClient.exe, LoLLauncher.exe and LoLpatcher.exe.
