I couldn&#039;t find any recent email from riot. \r\nSo I logged into the website and under account settings I notice my email has changed to a Japanese/Chinese/korean name/email. \r\nThat is not my email address. I&#039;m assuming my account has been hacked into and they have changed my email.\r\n\r\nIs my account recoverable?\r\n\r\nI have about 5+ years on my account :*(\r\n\r\nFirst time I&#039;ve ever had someone hack into anything of mine online.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-07-07T08:10:34.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Submit an account recovery ticket with Player Support.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n-> **I need help recovering my account** -> logout if you are logged in -> fill in the details (use an email you know to be uncompromised, if your email has been changed on the account then likely the intruder knows the email that was previously attached to the account, so I would recommend using a different one)\n\n**They'll ask you a whole bunch of questions to verify ownership and once ownership has been established they'll work on securing the account then getting it back to you. **\n\nThe questions are a guide only, and some people struggle to remember the details so there are a few things worth mentioning:\n\n* You don't have to answer EVERY question, just most of them, you are purposely given more than is necessary to cover the bases.\n\n* You can give more info than just what is asked for, any information not visible on the account (e.g I bought x skin on release day or I bought y champion with RP not IP)\n\n* You can get creative with your answers, as long as it demonstrates ownership (e.g instead of answering \"When did you create your account?\" with a date, you could answer it with \"around the time x champion was released)\n\n* Information that is visible on the account or via third party sites is NOT useful, and is a waste of your time and supports so avoid it (e.g a list of every skin you own or your past ranks)","replies":[]}]}
