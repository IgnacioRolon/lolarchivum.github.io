It looks super fun but broken AF.","replies":[{"poster":"H3RO1SCH","date":"2017-07-16T10:17:58.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah its intentional.

No champion should be able to leave the map like that for any period of time, it's just too unbalanced and unpredictable. Riot is likely working on a solution as we speak, though it *might* cause a delay to Kayn's release depending on how long it takes them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-01T01:18:51.764+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It should be a bug moving outside the map is broken and should not be something that you can do in League","replies":[]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-07-01T00:15:00.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems like a bug, he's still not properly released, most champions have bugs like this that are found during PBE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-30T13:26:34.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is a 1250 warning range when he is in walls to enemies, other than that he is invisible to everything.","replies":[]}]}
