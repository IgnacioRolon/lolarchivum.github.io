I just want to say to people like fitzy and jasonwazza who have been pretty salty as of late, if this game pisses you off so much, why don&rsquo;t you just quit? There&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from pressing that uninstall button and just leaving. But you don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s because league is the best designed game I have ever seen, and we all just take it for granted. Now to all you people bitching about riot games themselves. They are an AMAZING company that actually CARES about their playerbase, and listens to us about our concerns. But note that they are a COMPANY, and COMPANIES need to make money, its their job. So don&rsquo;t go around saying that riot is shit coz they want to make money, because they are people and they need money too, and I&rsquo;m sure if you were in that sort of position you would try to make good money as well. Sure, riot makes mistakes sometimes, we all do, but in general they do great things and this game is an amazing thing. \r\n\r\nrant over *prepares to be attached in the comments*","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-22T12:22:05.268+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I'm sorry you've found things to be a bit negative, its true that the boards aren't always cascading with positivity. But you have to consider the purpose of the boards, they are here for discussion, and really, if everything is perfect, there is no discussion.\n\n_\"Summoners rift looks mighty fine today doesn't it chap!\"\n'Oh yes old boy! quite right, quite right.\"_\n\nWho wants the boards to be as boring as that?\n\nI also disagree with you about your statement:\n\n> if this game pisses you off so much, why don’t you just quit? There’s nothing stopping you from pressing that uninstall button and just leaving.\n\nThe reason they (or any of us) complain, is because we DO care about the game, and want to make it the best game it can possibly be. It's because people care that they make complaints.  Each of us has our own vision of where we think the game should go in order to be better, Fitzky has his, JasonWazza has his, I have mine, and you will have yours. I care about this game a lot, and so I will fight tooth and nail against a change that I think will be unhealthy for the game. even if it does make a post with a negative vibe. Fitzky and JasonWazza do the same as do many others.\n\nThe game isnt perfect, and will never be, but it's the quest to _try_ and make it perfect that is what actually makes positive changes to the game.\n\n_______________\n\nLike HeartVine says, there are loads of 'better' games than league.\nTaking HeatVine's example of Elder Scrolls here, the elder scrolls game that's closest to league is ESO (Elder Scrolls Online), now it would probably take me literally an entire day to walk across the whole map! _(as opposed to the 50 or so seconds it takes me to traverse summoners rift)_ and every 30 seconds there is a new highly detailed quest available, each with its own new characters and voice acting, rewards, story. Not to mention innumerable ways to customise your character and itemisation. as well as amazing graphics for a game of that size, so in pretty much every category it classifies as a better game that league. _(especially seeming all league is, is essentially just playing the same board game again and again and again with slightly different rules)_\n\nESO Is an awesome game that you could play non stop for years and years and not be able to do all there is to do in it. But quite frankly, they don't give 2 shits about their player base! My favourite armour in the game costs **$50 USD** as a micro transaction! and literally all it is, is the ability to re-skin your in-game armour _(no functional purpose either)_, and you can get the armour for free anyway if you try hard enough. Also, the only way to get decent things from the micro-transaction store is a lucky dip system _(obviously heavily favoured towards giving you the shitty things)_\nLike, honestly what self respecting company asks $50 _(more like $65 in our money)_ for something a player can get for free anyway.\n\nDoes Riot care more about their player base than the ESO developers? **YES!** does that make them have the better game? **NO!**\n\nHowever! The difference is: \nI'm not going to post on the ESO forums every day _(or maybe even at all)_, because I know that no one will give a damn. If they want to charge $50 for essentially a chroma pack to someone who has already paid $100+ for the actual game itself, they sure as hell aren't going to care enough about their players to listen to my little suggestions or issues. The conclusion is that ESO is a good game, but it will just stay a good game. Where league is a good game, but has the potential to just get better and better _(or worse of course)_.\nI mean a couple of years ago it looked like this:\n\nhttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q90pDrndMOI/maxresdefault.jpg\n\nAnd coming from that to what we have now is in no small part due to players voicing their concerns and suggestions.\nWhich is why people like Fitzky and JasonWazza are doing more for this game than 90% of players because they care enough to come to the forums and tell Riot without fear, what they think is bad and how it should be changed.\n\nSo ESO will eventually get outdated and die, it relies too heavily on large player bases that it treats like shit, it will take a wrong turn at some point _(because they haven't listened to the people)_ and will haemorrhage players and that'll be that. and it'll be a tragedy.\nBut League will live on because it isn't a 'good game', its an 'adaptable game'. But it can only adapt if we tell riot what is wrong with it.\n\nUnfortunately, as many people have pointed out, Riot is making very big mistakes of late, short term moneymaking ones, and it _appears_ they aren't listening as much to the players anymore, which is all the more reason to speak out and make the will of the players heard.\n\n_________________\n\n#**TL;DR:** \nI would argue that people like Fitzky and JasonWazza care more about, and do more for the game than 90% of players. Because out of all of all the players in the server, **they** are the ones that come to the boards and stand up to say _\"Hey, this is wrong! The game can be better than this! We aren't going to settle for anything less than that best you can give us!\"_ and that is how league grows and becomes better. It doesn't get any better if we all just sit back and shake eachother's hands about how wonderful the game is.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-22T15:13:09.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't have said it any better {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-11-23T02:08:12.647+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah, I agree with u on the most part but just COMPLAINING without suggesting a solution is what pisses me off so much.

Hell, I'd even say that Faster Than Light, Stick Fight and Please, Don't Touch Anything are better than LoL is in it's current state. Don't assume you know all that about what makes games great, because it certainly seems you've got a few misconceptions. There's been a lot of changes that Riot has made in recent years that have been terrible decisions, and a lot of changes that seemed good at first but turned out to be terrible. LoL is no longer about the player experience, it's about the money, and that's all that the *company* called Riot Games cares about anymore.\n\nSo while the presentation of their arguments may leave something to be desired, the people like Fitzky and JasonWazza have the right idea. They know what Riot has become and are right to speak out about it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-22T10:39:38.210+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow heartvine, you ok?

It may not always be easy to understand where someone is coming from, especially when they have an opposing viewpoint, but I think that's an important thing to do when your intent is to \"debate\" rather than \"argue\". I may not always have shown it, but that's what I believe.\n\nRealistically speaking, I've thought these kinds of issues existed with Riot for a couple years now, since the sh!t storm that was the Oceanic \"Server Skin\" (though to a lesser extent then than now). With the way things were last year, it was a lot easier to focus on what was still good about Riot, but coming through this year, and even up to the end of the year in pre-season, I just can't help but think Riot has dug their own grave with the decisions they've made, and have next to no hope of recovering from it all.\n\nFact is, there are so many better games out there that I can't help but wonder why I've spent as much as I have (probably about $1000 AUD at this point) on LoL, and how much I'm actually missing out on because that money has gone to a company I can't support anymore.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-22T11:15:23.380+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Honestly never thought i would see the day, but it's good to see Heartvine.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-22T10:21:58.358+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're either incredibly stupid or so brainwashed you can't see bullshit in front of your own eyes. If you actually follow League of legends and Riot on social media and forums such as Reddit you would know that the MAJORITY of the player base has been angry for the past week because of all the preseason changes. Don't single me and Jason out just because we have the balls to actually speak and give Riot the proper criticism they need. Before EA decided to go full retard with the release of Battlefront 2, I had never experienced such a terrible company such as Riot. Sure lots of smaller companies have done dirty things, but for a company with it's level of popularity, the decisions they make with regards to both in-game balance and player behaviour management is ridiculous. \n\nBefore we get to that I'd like to also mention, regarding a recent post I saw here on the boards, that their technical team for a company their size, isn't so great either. Someone pointed out that it has been over a WEEK since the release of the new blitzcrank skins and STILL players are unable to purchase them. For a company that owns and controls the largest pc game in the world they sure must have some really massive \"bugs\".\n\nNow back to the main topic, remember when Riot decided to buff ap galio? How much of a nightmare that was? How much it literally made NO sense? For reference Dong Huap explained it very well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlRhxM5iNww (I've made a post on this before but for the sake of this comment I've provided evidence to back up what I'm saying) Now let me remind you that this isn't the first time Riot's balance team have gone full retard with their decisions, but this time it was so off the scales that Riot Meddler was prompted to actually PROVE that their balance team was Diamond+ : https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/4juB9T8l-quick-gameplay-thoughts-october-27\n\nNow finally, PLAYER BEHAVIOUR MANAGEMENT. I'm sure some of you common board users have seen over the past few weeks the amount of posts that have been made regarding players receiving 14 day suspensions/permanent suspensions over as much as ONE WORD. You can clearly see that over the course of time Riot are getting stricter and stricter, it was already stupid beforehand, but now its just ridiculous. It makes you wonder if they are actually understanding what happened in a players game or just straight up seeing that their little system found a \"trigger word\" and went \"alright see ya\" and boom that's another player, along with hundreds of dollars that they spent down the drain. It just really makes you start to think of how much Riot caters to the \"Pure Christian\" players and just gives 0 fucks to everyone else. Like sure if someone swears off their head in an angry and attacking manner they should be deemed \"toxic\", but the game is tilting enough as it is and sometimes people just let off a little steam. They are not actually toxic players, most of them are probably nice people irl, but to take everything they have with this game away with them because of \"one bad game\" is unfair. What's also unfair is when players troll in this game and ruin your experience and you are punished for yelling at them like you are the bad guy. The trolls get away scot free because they stayed silent, hidden in the shadows doing their dirty work, and you get banned for raising your voice against them. \n\nThis is exactly what happened to me, I learnt from my 14 day suspension, I changed my ways, I kept my mouth shut when a bronze player did something dumb. But the one game I opened my mouth because some asshole decided to ruin a ranked game, not only for me, but for 3 other innocent people, I get permanently suspended and lost $300 along with the years of experience I had on that account. That was the day I had had enough, I will not sit by and let this kind of bullshit exist in this game that I LOVE. Yes you are right, I don't choose to uninstall League because I like the game, and I believe it can be fixed, I believe it has a chance. Which is why I RAISE MY VOICE AND LET IT BE HEARD. RIOT NEEDS TO LISTEN AND LEARN ON WHAT THEY NEED TO FIX NOT ONLY IN THEIR GAME BUT FOR THEMSELVES. So I will continue to post, I will continue to provide my opinion. You don't have to agree with me, it's an opinion after all, not a fact. It can't always be right, but it can be loud. It can be powerful, which is why I often repeat things across multiple posts, so Riot can see, so they can notice me and what I have to say. So hopefully, they will listen.\n\nSo really all I can say is, don't call us out like we some kind of trolls or hate bigots. I can't say anything about JasonWazza, but all I'm trying to do is speak my mind, and let my opinion be heard. Because sometimes you need to go that extra mile, sometimes you need to use bigger and harsher words so that they are noticed. Otherwise they'll be lost among the rest of random and \"unthoughtful\" comments.\n\n“I am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I hope to produce some good by it.” \n― Abraham Lincoln","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-11-23T02:10:55.426+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"U are doing a good thing yes, and I myself was pretty salty when I made this post coz I’m just sick of all the anger on these boards, but to u and everyone else just try to come up with solutions instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-22T08:48:36.897+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're full of shit. Riot was one of THE most profitable games companies for several years running on the back of one game. Stop belittling their developers like they need handouts. Those guys made 2Bn revenue in 2013 and 1.6bn in 2015 WITHOUT horrid microtransactions and were hailed as one of the companies which best implemented a profitable free to play model.\n\nThey dont need your sympathy, particularly not when they engage in questionable practices to squeeze money out of their player base. You haven't got a clue what you're talking about if you dont think they didnt make money before these changes to a loot box model and you are actively encouraging lol being a vehicle for profit as opposed to an excellent game which also makes a profit.\n\nThey dont need your sympathy - 37 year old Mark Merrel is worth an estimated $2.3BILLION (thats $2,300,000,000) as of september 2017 (2 months ago) https://thenetworthportal.com/celeb-net-worth/businessperson/marc-merrill-net-worth/ so fuck off with your \"they need money\" bullshit. These are not unshaven neckbeards running a game from their mums basement who need cash for doritos. Merrel is just shy of James Packer in terms of net worth - he doesnt need your misguided sympathy.\n\nThis move is because tencent bought riot games as an INVESTMENT and are observing a declining revenue stream because a natural decline in the player base (there is a reason they have not released figures since 2014). Much like WoW, there will likely be a servicable population in LoL for a few years yet but it has probably peaked. The accountants have taken over, and the strategy now is to fleece the remaining players for all they can through a microtransaction driven game - new players pretty much HAVE to spend money to obtain champions, erecting a barrier to play, and the older players will have to grind / pay for what they used to get easily. There is a proposal to BAN this type of in-game transaction / loot box in europe because it is seen as an unethical way to suck money out of impressionable teenagers. So dont imply that this is anything other than a profit seeking cash grab.\n\nAnd as a side prediction, bots will become even more of a problem because the grind is so tedious and people would rather pay a botter to level up a toon for $30 than drop $200 to get it there themselves.\n\nSeriously mate dont have a crack at Jason and fitzky for offering reasonable criticism of what is going on if you are still pushing the \"oh poor developers they should totally do this because they need to be paid for this free game\" because you CLEARLY have no idea of the worth of the company or the individuals involved and it utterly belittles the efforts of the 2,500 staff of this incredibly successful global enterprise.\n\nI thank riot for giving me a great game I was committed to for a long time and dropped a lot of cash in. But just because I have enjoyed the game it doesnt mean I cant criticise this un-lubed buggery they are subjecting us to now with the move to loot boxes and the overzealous player behaviour team that bans for bad words but lets bots, trolls, and feeders go unpunished.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kLfBtMarshall","date":"2017-11-22T08:19:39.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":8,"body":"that jasonwazza is the most saltiest person ive ever seen, even for league. but dont worry he will act high and mighty with a response while still being salty","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-22T11:14:53.102+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"I mean, i don't even need to respond, even Heartvine a riot volunteer is saying that Riot doesn't deserve all the ass slobber it gets.","replies":[{"poster":"kLfBtMarshall","date":"2017-11-23T10:11:43.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"this guy, i mentoin he will act high and mighty while being salty and in the first line i read form him \"i dont even need to respond\" but responds anyway dam kid you are made of salt","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-23T10:22:17.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From where I'm sitting, JasonWazza isn't the one who is being salty.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-23T10:14:47.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Sorry maybe i wasn't clear...\n\nI don't need to respond to the main post, i was responding to you calling me out for no reason.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-11-22T08:47:10.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"attached?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-11-22T08:44:41.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly agree with you, but you have to understand that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and the reason people get so toxic and frustrated with Riot when they make these changes is because it effects a game which they may have a lot of passion for.\n\nThe reason for this onslaught of hate and negativity towards Riot recently has been because of the new BE system, which is quite frankly, extremely shit. It is honestly been a game ruining experience for most players, and the result of this has been negative backslash from players who want the system to be reverted.\n\nHowever, I must admit that the nature of these boards is usually quite toxic and not very understanding that Riot is simply trying to make their game a better experience for players. Most writers on these boards tend to criticise Riot for their shortcomings and never acknowledge the effort and creativity that goes into these skins from Riots developers.\n\nOverall, I feel that while everyone should be entitled to an opinion and Riot should listen to these opinions, more people on these boards should acknowledge Riots efforts in making this game better for all its players.","replies":[]}]}
