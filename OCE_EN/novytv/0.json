Both have really cool particles and models, but Ice Drake is a bit monotonous, and SG colours aren&#039;t very well done imo.\r\nPlease give your opinions and reasons.

Ice Drake is her worst skin IMO and it's just so clunky. Champion ship is the real blue skin to go, but super galaxy is pretty boss.","replies":[{"poster":"noVyTV","date":"2016-05-25T11:28:44.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks.
