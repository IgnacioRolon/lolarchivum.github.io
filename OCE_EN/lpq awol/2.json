It's a gating mechanic to stop people from earning vastly higher numbers of keys than chests to go with them. What this means is that players who play a lot of games (like it sounds like you do) will go very long periods without earning any fragments towards the end of their month. You ought to notice straight away when your month resets, because you'll be seeing them much more often.","replies":[{"poster":"LPQ AWOL","date":"2017-02-23T07:01:18.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty, thought so, but it still dont drop enough to keep up with boxes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-02-23T09:32:20.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's because while you can (theoretically) earn infinite keys, there is a finite number of boxes you can earn in a season, so for most players, early season will see more boxes than keys, but later more keys than boxes.
