Sometimes you get a fun champion who can abuse the cdr and limitless mana (galio, sona, ezreal, brand, hecarim, evelynn, ect...). other times you get champions who are actually slightly weaker in urf due to enemy mobility being on steroids (rammus), shield scalings being halved (shen) and resource-less champions that are generally supposed to try to use that to their advantage but now can't compete (rumble, yasou) with low cdr mana champions that can now spam abilities.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-02-25T02:38:03.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"urf is boring asf after about 4 games\n\narurf should atleast last 8.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-25T02:07:09.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"t. a motherfucker who picks zed every game","replies":[]}]}
