A red glow escaped through some cracks in the walls, a red demon entered through the front.\n\"Hello there Warden! Did you catch anything?\"\nThe demon held a lantern filled with screaming souls. It looked up and nodded, it then threw his hook behind itself and then threw the lantern in front, it slowly hovered over the fire shaking violently. A red glowing ball then flew out, spun around a bit and then went into the fire, a mist then slowly rose up from the blaze and was softly absorbed by the moon, suddenly the moon started to turn to a shade of pink.\n\"One!\"\nthen a light red.\n\"Two!\"\nThen a darker pink.\n\"Three\"\nThen a darker shade of red.\n\"FOUR!\"\nAnd then it was all red. Then a bunch of people wearing the demonic masks came out holding big boards of paper. The blood moon has risen. more and more came and joined. Humans, Spirits and Demons alike, everybody was equal in the eyes of the Blood Moon. Every member had a ghastly red glow to them and a mask that resembled a demon all painted red and white.\n\"More beautiful than ever.\"\nA deep voice whispered,\n\"You're just happy because you got to paint it this year.\"\nsaid another voice.\n\"Ha Ha, Indeed I am, my masterpiece is not done yet.\"\nhe got up flinging his gun around his finger and walked into the night.\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\"I need to fix this, RUN!\"\nThe lantern shattered in the blaze, the fire turned into a giant monster that feeds off the moon's light, Jhin was the only one that could stop it, it was simple, but only a true artist could re design such a disgusting beast.\n\nRight in front of the exit he looked and this beast tore apart the cult. What could he do? Then it came to him, he would give his life for art, this would be his final act, his masterpiece.\n\"Warden!\"\nJhin cried from the back. It floated up wielding the shattered lantern\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Throw me the lantern and ill make beauty.\" \nthe lantern flew across the destruction, Jhin grabbed hold and held as tight as he could. Then he got swooped up in a bubbled directly onto the beast's head, he put a rose on its head, put his gun on the rose and lifted his head up.\n\"My Masterpiece.\"\nHe fired the bullet directly through the blazing monstrosity, vines and roots went everywhere, roses and leaves grew from every branch, and from every root came a new one. Jhin's body was absorbed into his masterpiece, so he would always see his work of art.\n\nAsh flew everywhere staining the grass, the cold of night quickly overwhelmed the dark arena. The only thing left untouched was a card, it had a dark shade of red, around the card in a perfect pattern was burnt grass. As each individual slither of grass turned into ash the card flew out of the ground, it spun around until even more cards generated around it. Then from the cards emerged a man,\n\"Lady luck is smilin'\"\nHe took a step toward where the blaze ended, despite not being there, the screams echoed through his head, he saw a mask on the ground, it looked like it was stabbed in by something, or it could have fallen from a high place. As the man stood there he couldn't help but hear a faint echo, he couldn't make out the words but he heard enough to creep him out.\n\"won, tuh, thri, foh\"\nThen he looked up to see a giant blossom tree covered with roses and fine carvings go up into flames, it was short, and big, and from the blaze fell a burning rose slowly flaming as it fell, as it touched the grass the entire ground turned into roses, one by one a rose formed on the ground, each still burning away, and after the entire ground was covered in roses they lit up. Sending a black and red mist into the air, turning the moon a dark shade of red.\n\nA mess of roots slithered across the concrete floor, the body, face first in memorial, just inches away from his head was a tree, beautiful blossoms, bright pink. It was winter, next to the body a splash of paint, it was a dark red mixed with little blue. He carried to weapons and wore no fancy clothes, he looked as he was wearing rags. He wasn't moving, but he felt the pain through him, a root had gone right through his foot and into his leg. he was in pain, but he managed to keep himself from screaming, Pain is nothing.\nHe was lying there, people thought he was dead, his face was buried in dirt. He was alive but chose to stay hidden. His clothes where damp, the smell of poison and chemicals coated the air. A man walked behind him,\n\"Work could be done.\"\nand dragged the body away. He woke up, being able to see out of both eyes for the first time in ages,\n\"So art requires a certain cruelty does it? Lets see if you have it.\"\nThe figure slapped on a glove and used a laser to saw the man open. When his eyes weren't flooded with blood he managed to get a pretty accurate description, this thing wasn't a human, it was masculine and wore a mask. He had a hand dangling from his shoulder, had a robotic tone to his voice.\n\"You call yourself Khada Jhin, huh?\"\n\"How did you?\"\n\"Hush.\"\nThe thing continued to hack away at the mans body.\nHe woke up with a sense of imagination, a beautiful image intended.\n\"Well Jhin, what do you think?\"\nThe thing propped a mirror in front of him. \nJhin walked down the street holding a beautifully carved gold knife, his gun was lost, never to be found. He had no mask, instead goggles with a distinct green glow and a bandana like cloth that covered his face, underneath the cloth, a pump that kept him breathing and alive. He looked around, a green glow corrupted the streets of Zaun, His aura. He was known as Viktor's Worst other than Jhin. He was the favourite though, because Jhin was made based off art, and in art there are no mistakes, just glorious accidents, so Viktor went all out when re creating Jhin. Viktors words echoed through Jhin's head.\n\"Join the glorious revolution!\"\nHe looked up into the alleyway he was walking into, a red light shun from behind, he slowly made his way behind there being very careful of his actions, he peeked around one corner to check for danger, there sat 7 or 8 robotic figures in a row, they were all de-activated, but hooked up to a sort of crystal. The crystal was beautiful, a light blue. Viktor walked around the other side.\n\"What do you think? Care to join us\"\nHe then sent a burning laser at Jhin, just burning the tip of his boots.\n\"Come with me Gold Demon.\"","replies":[{"poster":"Okami Inari","date":"2017-03-13T00:18:00.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great story but I find this one somewhat similar to the one posted before this one.
