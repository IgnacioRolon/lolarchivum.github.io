I said one thing that was unnecessarily targeted and that was saying \"Why do you garbage gold players insist on playing losses?\". If that is the comment that is too harsh for the community then I don't truly understand but I will accept it. \nGame 2: \nI was pre-maded with my friend and all the stupid comments were just to our amuse, none of them were serious or meant to be harmful. Kayn made a few bad ganks that were causing us to fall behind &amp; I told him off appropriately saying we were BOTH useless &amp; that the ganks were not going to go well. Again, I don't see how any of these comments are punishable by perma-ban but again if they are the cause then I will accept it. Also, I said Vayne was hacking, I knew she wasn't &amp; kept saying stuff about their Vayne, she was popping off &amp; so I was saying stupid stuff playing about.\nGame 3: \nI played garbage again, picked Hecarim top into Darius without ignite and lost close 1v1's constantly, team flamed me and said I was int'ing, which I wasn't. I told them that I was the reason we lost and that I was sorry for it. I did call Yi braindead one time &amp; if that's too much then I can somewhat understand that. I said I was running it down since 3 minutes but I wasn't, I was just dying constantly to the darius who I'd get low and then die too. I felt that I could outplay him each time but I was obviously wrong. You can see the damage dealt that game and if there's a replay it's obvious I played the game out &amp; still did try &amp; win but my early deaths were the reason we lost in the end.\n\nI have been suspended once before on this account a few years ago &amp; back then I was EXTREMELY toxic, I would tell people to 'kys' &amp; constantly swear at teammates every single game &amp; if I was to receive a permanent ban back then I would understand entirely. However I felt I was reformed when I came back season 9 &amp; after watching T1 &amp; other League streamers a lot, all the 'LOOOOL' &amp; 'NOOB' stupid stuff I see them say on their streams and assumed it was fine for me to also make those stupid comments &amp; that it wouldn't be taken so seriously.\n\nTherefore, because I see my comments as not that harmful I assume my ban was for int'ing which is so far from what those games were. I get tilted and do my best to comeback in lane and the only way I see that possible sometimes is to win 1v1's &amp; if I lose it by a fraction then I proceed to go back and try play it better &amp; sometimes it works &amp; sometimes I go 0-10.\n\nHopefully you can see my perspective but if not then it was a great few years playing the game &amp; it'll be sad to quit.\n\nIf you run back those games &amp; watch the chat you should be able to see teams flaming me constantly &amp; that I retaliate with nothing more than LOOOL the vast majority of the time. My match history reflects that yes, I sometimes have bad games but I still play it out even if I'm 0-10. I say stupid stuff like 'keyboard d/c' or 'was laggin' jokingly &amp; assume that is understood. I'm sure there's replays of these games and it should be blatantly obvious that I was not int'ing (assuming the reports were for int'ing bc they were all bad games).\n\nI feel as though what I've said to others has been blown way out of proportion for what it is. I understand that a punishment may/is necessary for what I've said to people but after having been suspended only once before that I can recall &amp; that being 3-4 years ago, I feel a perm is far too harsh. I've been loving league lately, it's all I've been playing &amp; hope that I can get back to it.\n\nI would just make a new account but I've had this account since season 4 or 5 &amp; have invested so much $ into it. Don't wanna give up on it.\n\nOverall I understand that some things may have been taken badly such as calling someone braindead, I was lashing back at someone who was flaming me and that's my fault, should have kept my cool &amp; either muted or just responded with LOL like I usually do :/. I know some games I have played appear badly via scoreboards but again, just bad games &amp; replays show that I play them through to the end. My way of reforming from constantly flaming someone &amp; being aggressive toward other plays was to just act stupid &amp; spam stupid things like LOL or hehehe instead of fighting back whenever they'd flame me. I know I should have just muted people.","replies":[{"poster":"cuhz","date":"2019-04-12T06:45:25.228+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I appreciate your input &amp; advice.

If this is the kind of behaviour you exhibit with any consistency, then that's likely what has caused the punishment system to trigger.\n\nA few things to note; firstly, punishments trigger as a result of *your* behaviour, and what others have done isn't considered in that (just as your behaviour isn't considered in what others have done). You are being judged on what *you* have done, and you should reflect on what *you* have done, and how *you* can change. Secondly, it's often a bad idea to engage in more extreme forms of \"banter\" with a friend in a \"public\" space like team/all chat, as you are still subject to the same rules in those spaces as any other time (even if it is all in \"good fun\"). If you want to have that kiknd of banter with your friends, I'd recommend using some kind of private chat (like whispers), or a VoIP (such as the in-game voice chat, or something like Discord/Teamspeak) as you wont risk any repercussions.\n\nUltimately, the best advice I could give to you would be is to learn not to say anything if it isn't productive. The way you seem to engage with your team in champion select (based on these chat logs) is the kind of thing you *should* be using chat for, to communicate and work as a team. If you're about to say something that *isn't* going to give you team necessary info on the current match, or advice that you honestly think will benefit them, then you're best just not saying anything, and if you are going to say something, try to do so in a positive manner (for example, \"[item] might be a better options against [champion]\" is a lot better than \"why the fuck don't you have [item] against [champion]?\").\n\nSo far as appealing this punishments goes, I'd say you *might* (and I really want to emphasise that \"might\") have a case for a reduction if you're correct in saying your last punishment was 3-4 years ago, depending on how your behaviour has been over that time. In order to appeal, you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and go through the process with them. They'll review the case, and be able to give you more context on the punishment (including any games/logs that weren't explicitly shown in the reform card), and *possibly* be able to reduce the punishment, if they think the perma-ban is unnecessary.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Neekoo Neeko Nee","date":"2019-04-23T14:35:19.322+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"riots system is trash. you didnt say anything derserving of a permaban.","replies":[]}]}
