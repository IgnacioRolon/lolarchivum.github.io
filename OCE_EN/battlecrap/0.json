Base stats are unchangeable with items, and only go up as you level up. Then, you have normal, stacking speed. For an items like Boots, which gives you +20 move-speed, you should see a normal increase of move-speed by 20 units. There would not be a situation where buying an item with flat move-speed would give you anything *less* than what is labelled. Then there is bonus % move-speed, from items such as Trinity Force or abilities that grant move-speed temporarily. Percentages, when stacked, will add to themselves additively. Eg. if you get an 8% move-speed item and then cast an ability on yourself which gives you a bonus 6% move-speed, you'll have a total of 14% move-speed bonus applied to your stat. It's not 8% is applied first, and then 6% multiplied on top of that.\n\nWHICH eventually brings us to our case. When you have an already existing 8% move-speed item and buy a flat move-speed item, then you'll get the 8% bonus applied to that item as well, increasing +20 move-speed to +21 move-speed.\n\nSo, yes, this is a bug.","replies":[]}]}
