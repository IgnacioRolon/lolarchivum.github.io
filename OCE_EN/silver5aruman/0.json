That's why you're so confused, stop treating it like a vBulletin forum.\n\nIt's...Reddit 2.0! Unfortunately Reddit styled discussion doesn't work with a small community. It is painful with a small population. Which is why OCE should never even have Boards to this day. \n\nWhy can't Boards work like the forums you may ask? Because Riot encourages the jerking of circles (which is why they love /r/leagueoflegends). They don't want to look through bad posts, only the circlejerked ones. The forums were so toxic, which is why I liked them. \n\nBoards is Boring, Forums were Fun. But what is more important is that you adjust.","replies":[{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T13:18:26.103+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"rav senpai cleanse me from my pantheon usage","replies":[]},{"poster":"Silver5aruman","date":"2014-12-08T14:26:22.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's not just OCE though.
