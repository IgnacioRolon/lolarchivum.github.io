Yago seared Ryze&rsquo;s flesh with what felt like the power of twenty suns. Ryze countered with a potent series of arcane bursts. After what seemed like hours, the combined power of their attacks breached the walls of the temple, and brought the thick ice dome crumbling down upon them.&quot;\n\n\n>http://i.imgur.com/kU3d5wd.jpg?1\n","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2017-04-30T11:28:11.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Give me a week or so, and I could come up with a passable kit, if you could give me a bit more info on what powers Yago possesses. Is he a traditional shaman, harnessing the power of the elements? If so, does he specialise in any one, or is he more well-rounded? I noticed in the short lore paragraph you gave, you mentioned the power of twenty suns. Does this mean Yago is mostly attuned to fire? Any info would be a great help, and I'd love to see if this could come to fruition!","replies":[]}]}
