I spent a long time thinking about, what would the former Grand General of Noxus look like? So my focus was try to accurately capture the lore history and aesthetics of Boram + the society/culture he comes from.\n\nIf Boram is the sovereign head of an army empire, then he would probably be a decorated war hero himself. Using recent and old examples of Noxian armour I had to chose between designing a really decorative outfit or something more practical with only hints of regal. I finalized a totally unique outfit with a combination of decorative and practical attire.\n\n [Denethor II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePME1xcaR7o) from LotRs was the base of my inspiration for this character.","replies":[]}]}]}
