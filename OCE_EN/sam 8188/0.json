Each time you leave another game it'll go up another 5 up to 20 minutes. You can reduce what your next LPQ penalty will be simply by not leaving games.\n\nIf you're having connection issues please visit the [Connection Troubleshooting Guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues), and if you need assistance with it you can make a post over on the **Help & Support** board. If you want to check your ping manually that can be done as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-07-13T14:28:56.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you wouldn't mind, would you also give your thoughts on his suggestion about the ping during champion select?  I think that's a valid point. I'd love to have that sort of information available in champion select before I committed to a 30-40 minute game.\n\nEDIT: Funny that right after I posted this I started a ranked match only to find that I was immobile the entire game because Windows Updater started downloading an update that is literally impossible to stop.  I mean, it is actually impossible.  I spent the entire game troubleshooting ways to stop the download and it's not possible.  Not only did my team lose the game (despite a strong effort for a 4vs5) I will most likely cop the leaver penalty of five games in lower priority queue, since arguing a leave buster penalty is as effective as talking yourself out of a speed ticket after a camera has caught you.  This is one more reason the feature Sam mentioned should be implemented.","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2016-07-14T08:06:11.480+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make a custom game with only you in it before playing, takes a minute and shows your ping, also makes sure you can load into games and your client doesn't have any bugged textures to fix.","replies":[{"poster":"Le Messenger","date":"2016-07-14T13:05:55.400+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha yes well while the advice has good intentions, it's about as useful as telling someone they should follow all safety precautions while completing their tasks 5 minutes before knocking off work, sitting up straight with a comfortable posture while playing video games or washing your hands before eating while you're eating out.  Yeah I should have checked my ping before starting a game but why is a ping indicator such a bad idea to avoid situations like this anyway?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-14T13:51:46.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Programs like Net balancer have a persistent ping meter (I use it to limit dl speeds on things that otherwise don't let you cause I'm on trash tier ADSL, the ping widget is just a helpful little bonus) though obvs this will only tell you if your internet if fked up, not if your specific connection to League is, but it solves most problems.\n\nOtherwise you can just run cmd and ping google.com which takes all of three seconds and you can do it while you're in queue (though ofc this has the same drawback).\n\nIf your net is otherwise stable then one occurence like an unstoppable win update isn't gonna give you an lpq, but if your net is unstable enough to net you lpqs then getting into the habit of ping checking would be beneficial.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
