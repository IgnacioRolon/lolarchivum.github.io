For most things this works just fine, however I noticed when my friend was playing Vlad that his secondary resource bar is yellow when almost charged, and red when depleting, which makes it very hard for me to play around.\r\n\r\nHere it is when almost fully charged\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/bf04zf\r\n\r\nAnd here it is when depleting\r\nhttp://prntscr.com/bf069o\r\n\r\nI would just like to make it so colourblind people, including me, can tell the difference between Vlad&#039;s two states. Maybe in a neutral blue or a darker red.","replies":[]}
