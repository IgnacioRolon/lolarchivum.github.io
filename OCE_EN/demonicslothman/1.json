So we always know when we are gonna go up a division but why cant we see going down is all I&#039;m wanting to know. \r\n\r\nEspecially now that I&#039;ve played two more games after that thinking I have to win at least the next 4-5 games to get back to silver. obviously I lost both of those games too because that would just be too easy now wouldn&#039;t it. but now i just just have next to no motivation to play ranked mode until seasons end because fuck dropping any further then i already have. \r\n\r\nJust why is it that we can&#039;t see when we are close to losing a rank because getting crushed in a game can get pretty depressing when the snowball wasn&#039;t in your control but to then get to the post game screen and getting a lovely message saying you have been demoted just kills any motivation to even want to try and climb back.\r\n\r\nits just a thought seeming that we are going into pre-season when some changes can happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Tentacle Touch","date":"2015-11-03T20:21:57.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay here's my explanation on why I think there shouldn't be a demotion series.
