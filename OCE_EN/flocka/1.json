The idea around this is to try and get the club some fame in the lower Elo community. Everyone will have the same tag and it would be cool that if when you got in champ select and saw the tag you knew it was a smurf. this would be good for two reasons, it would make the other players more lenient towards the smurf in picking roles as-well as make the team more open to suggestions aswell as bring a fear factor to the enemy team.\r\nif you would be keen please add my smurf (flocka)","replies":[]}
