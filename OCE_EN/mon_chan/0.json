Heh.&quot;\r\n\r\nWe stand in silence waiting for the other to make the first move, with the dry blood stained wind gushing past. He stretches out his arm, grasping his staff. Shifting his stance, he summons a luminous flag in front of me pulling himself towards it. I dash to him. Keeping my arm fairly close to my chest I retract a blade from my waist and attempt to wound his shoulder. He rotates his body with quick haste, causing me to slice nothing but the torrid air. For a man to be so large in stature he has the versatility of a leopard. Landing on my left foot I pivot around to see that he&#039;s already advancing back in my direction, in less than a second he was already a meter away from me, his speed was challenging my own. In a split second, he heaves himself up, while tension forms in the air. He plummets down forcing his staff into the ground, the sand starts to shift and part, erupting giant rock walls to the surface. I try to maneuver myself around his jade staff, consequently pushing myself back into the wall.  All I felt was the ground shaking underneath my feet, then, nothing.  We were trapped now, nowhere to run. \r\n\r\n&quot;Hmph, No turning back.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe takes one step towards me, then another, and another. With each stride he takes, I read his movements, actions, patterns. \r\n\r\n&quot;It begins now,&quot; I whisper underneath my breath.\r\n\r\nAdrenaline rushes through my body as I use the rigid rock wall to launch my body towards him, I slice one wound in his leg as I fly past, then another, then another with each blade I pierce his skin with I feel myself get overwhelmed with fury. I turn to glance at him, with slits all over his body I go in for the final attempt. I spring towards him throwing out a dagger, this is where it starts, I proceed to spin my body, with each rotation several blades are exerted from my hands, I start to feel fatigued and slow down. When I focus on my surroundings I can see the blades sticking out of the walls and sand, then I see \r\nJarvan laying on the ground gasping for air. He extends his arm and motions for me to come to him. I approach cautiously and kneel beside him.\r\n\r\n&quot;We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our goal? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land, and air, with all our might and with all the strength that the Gods can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalog of crime. That is our goal. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.&quot;\r\nWith those last words, he breathed his last breath and succumbed. I arise up on my feet and begin to battle the raging desert winds as I walk.\r\n\r\n&quot;Never question my loyalty. You will never know what I had to endure for it.&quot;\r\n\r\n~END~\r\n{{champion:55}}","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2019-02-18T05:55:26.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You lost me at \"searing sediments\".\n\nLets talk about science before we go on...","replies":[{"poster":"QueenBlackDragon","date":"2019-02-18T13:13:41.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe the water is really hot?

Something using 'barren' or 'arid'? 'Earth' has the drama, but is hard to alliterate.\n\nIn fairness, alliteration can be hard in general when you're trying to find a particular feeling.\n\nSediment is one of those words that can be learned from context rather than strict definition, so I can understand misinterpreting it this way, or that perhaps the environment wasn't described to the extent necessary for such a word to make sense.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2019-02-16T04:02:00.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The fighting scences is just your character doing this, doing that.
