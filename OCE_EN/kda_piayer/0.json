Yes i did rename my rune play to replay.gg and signed up. Replay.gg only record 3 games before I used it which was quite odd because those 3 games that were recorded was before when i started using replay.gg. is there a time period that you have to wait until replays on up? Comment if anything like this has happened to you.","replies":[{"poster":"wot","date":"2016-10-23T04:31:09.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it works fine tbh","replies":[]},{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-11T09:47:46.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI would recommend contacting replay.gg about this, Riot does not own nor are they affiliated with Replay.gg in any way, shape or form.\n\nJust for reference, replay.gg seems to be recording all of my games correctly.","replies":[]}]}
