Riot was unable to help me (no salt not why i&#039;m here), but i&#039;m still interested in having riven on my account. It was the only reason that i played on my secondary account anyways. Do any riot members have any information on the re-release on riven, or if possible a skin transfer from my old account that was stolen to my main account. Macho grande money was spent on it, and i dont wish for it all to go to waste.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has any information, it means a lot. Thanks!","replies":[]}
