It&#039;s been confirmed it starts at 20th May but I&#039;ve waited a whole day. It&#039;s 6.39 pm now and I haven&#039;t heard anything about it so far. Some people said the registrations ended yesterday.","replies":[{"poster":"Koyotee","date":"2018-05-21T02:32:26.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate,\n\nMay 20th is when the tournament registrations opened - so are definitely not closed already. \n\nThe tournament will be kicking off on Friday with first matches at 7pm (AEST).  To ensure your team gets entered into a bracket, every member of your team will need to lock in during the 30 minutes before the first match begins. \n\nSo we have time! What troubles are you having exactly?  Are you trying to create a team from within the client (under 'CLASH')?","replies":[]}]}
