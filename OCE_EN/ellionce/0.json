I do consistently well in lane with Lucian. I'm also alright at vayne, but seem to be more of a crit or miss. \n\nI'm looking for a casual team of like minded players that's just tired of the idiots in solo queue and who will play to win. Not looking for scheduled practice hours or anything like that. I just want to get away from the idiots in solo queues who have never heard of a thing called warding or sweepers vs stealth champs, y know what I'm talking about.\n\nNZ based would be good. \nCan get tea speak or curse or w.e voice com programme you guys use.\nCurrent silver 5 peaked at silver 1. \nWould prefer team in silver range.\n\nMessage \"Ellionce\" in game if interested. \n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"weareu","date":"2014-12-19T15:16:45.154+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same here dude\n\ni main jungle/mid\n\nim good at support hate playing with %%%% adc's\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Ellionce","date":"2014-12-19T19:26:59.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your ign?","replies":[{"poster":"Robin Song Robin","date":"2014-12-21T09:11:42.684+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NotSureIfSrs.mpeg","replies":[]}]}]}]}
