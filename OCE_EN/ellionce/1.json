I started to get lag spikes in-game from around 4pm ish onwards. I'm writing this at 11.40pm and I just tested in a custom game and I still consistently get ping that goes from 60 all the way up to 300+ then back down, then up and down up and down... I don't know how late into the night this goes until because I haven't stayed up this late to test it before. But by the time ranked is back up in the morning at 10am the ping is at a stable 51ms again (until 4pm ish then this repeats). \n\nI am on Spark (Telecom) in Auckland, New Zealand. Anyone else on Spark or from Auckland/NZ get this too? \n\nAnyone know what's going on?\n\nPS.\nI looked at the ping for another game with servers based in Australia on steam, and the ping for that game seems to be fine, at around 50~100ms. So maybe it could be just the League  OCE servers?\nPPS.\nOkay so I just went on to GW2 to see what the ping is like there and it too seems to have quite a high latency. I'm beginning to think it really is my Internet/Spark that's screwing up here. I will give them a call tomorrow. In the mean time, anyone have any clues on what's happening????","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-22T19:49:51.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with Vodaphone and it is all good.\n From what I have heard in my friends in various locations (Auckland, Hamilton, Christchurch, Wellington) Spark's internet is really bad for playing league. It is really unreliable and ping spikes are massive, especially during times of high internet traffic.","replies":[{"poster":"Ellionce","date":"2015-01-24T01:49:37.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So I've done a little more searching and I'm 100% sure this isn't Spark's fault. It's because of the phucks that rent out our place uploading/streaming  chit 24/7 whenever they're in the house... without them using the internet I get constant 51ms.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Khronix","date":"2015-02-09T02:20:15.671+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10 sparks fault.
