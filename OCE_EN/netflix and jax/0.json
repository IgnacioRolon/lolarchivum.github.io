I agree, it does have its positives with not having the same champs picked over and over because they&#039;re overpowered, games are quick and well it&#039;s urf.  I refuse to play it though because if this is supposed to be a &quot;fix&quot; to the original urf it really isn&#039;t.  If you enter a game against a certain team comp it just becomes a really frustrating 10-20 minutes and quite frankly a waste of time.  At least when you could choose your champion, everyone was overpowered... now it only takes one random bit of luck to ruin a game or I guess make a really fun one if you like stomping senselessly.  Rerolls don&#039;t mean anything because you&#039;ll run out of rerolls trying to avoid weaker champions too often.  It&#039;s actually heartbreaking because I love urf.  \r\n\r\nIf a mod&#039;s reading this.  You can&#039;t solve urf with an all random pick.  You just give the game a chance for balance... and a chance for absolute misery for one team.","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-09-23T21:19:03.771+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot could just give the community what they would like with the old URF mode. If some champions are OP, then so be it, if thats what the community wants. Having said that, they possibly wanted to see how the AR version fared. Personally I like both versions. Just think of it as a way to learn new champions without risking your rank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-09-24T15:04:17.372+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lul at this thread.\n\nI for one think its better than regular urf. It gives you the opportunity to play uncommon champions in the urf scenario without guarenteedly getting crushed by the meta game. Legit I'm so glad to not see shaco sona and eve every fuckin game.\n\nCould it be better? Yes. But I think its a step in the right direction.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ohnonotdoom","date":"2016-09-24T05:10:01.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TLDR: Riot forgot what this mode is, fun, nothing else. Random pick has been a flop.\n\nURF was a brilliantly fun mode simply because each team would generally have 5 stupidly broken champions and it became a case of skill in a broken environment, simply because you were playing something as broken as everyone else. In this new random mode anyone who wins the champ select lottery and gets someone like fizz, eve, zed, ect. will have a great time stomping the enemy team who, simply based on probability, will have at least 4 champions nowhere near as strong as that one broken champion.\n\nIn the old mode, everyone was on a similar level in terms of the power of the champion, however, due to the random draft generally everyone has fun at the beginning of the game, but then the one (assuming there's only one) broken champion begins wandering around the map indiscriminately killing everyone to the point where it feels like he could probably 1v1 your fountain laser. \n\nIf I had to sum up this game mode from my experience (12 or so games) 5 people are miserable, being killed any whichway by a broken enemy champion, that player of that champion is having fun but understands they just got lucky and the team of the broken champion feel like they have nothing to contribute to the game.\n\n\nSuggestions for fixes:\nthe old mode\nthe old mode with more bans (maybe 10 or so)\n- Riot you said that the reason behind this mode was to give URF more variance, random has killed the fun so just give us some more bans, or, permaban the champions that you think are the most destructive to the gamemode but let us choose what we find enjoyable\nremove it forever\n- URF is my favourite mode but I would rather not play it than play some  'better' version that is detrimental to enjoyment simply for the sake of making a game mode that was originally designed as an April fools joke into a balanced mode. You decided that randomisation somehow equated to balance?? The playerbase (I feel) enjoyed the ludicrous nature of the mode more than anything else, losing the ability to pick your champion detracts wholly from the enjoyment so I implore you to allow us to pick our champions.\n\nCheers for all your hard work Riot that seems to work 98% of the time","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-09-24T02:19:29.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I enjoy it, mainly because it's never here so I get to play it again this century, and also partly because I know how to play a majority of champions. All not so great, but I can play them. So it's fun trying champs I wouldn't otherwise think to play.\n\nHaving said that, as mentioned the random aspect really does upset the balance imo. Every game I played yesterday, either my team absolutely stomped, or our team got absolutely stomped. Due to either 1 team having all support/tank champs with minimal damage and the other assassins/mages with high damage, or due to most people not even knowing how to play their champ.\n\nAt then end of the day, it's urf. Every champ can be OP in the right hands, seen this many times. All the random part is doing, is forcing imbalance to 1 team at random. Rather than letting players choose the 'imbalance'.\nAtleast with choice, players have a chance at the game playing a champ they know how to use, even against other \"OP champions\" or the \"same boring champs\".\n\nPersonally, every game had a 'broken champ' in normal urf, because it was used well! But all champs have ways to counter too. Just return urf back to normal and be done with it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Warau","date":"2016-09-24T00:06:51.051+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was playing this yesterday only to find i was losing maan and my flash was 2mins cd. wasn't fun at all","replies":[]},{"poster":"FeralBlitz","date":"2016-09-23T16:28:11.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When is this mode going live, riot seems to not like giving actual times to american players...","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-09-23T20:02:39.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RGM are on the same time schedule every week.
