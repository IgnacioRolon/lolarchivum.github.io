I&#039;d rather the old system because I would have gotten top at least 2 out of those five games, not none.  Is there supposed to be some sort of mechanism in place to prevent this from happening because if so, it&#039;s bugged.  If not, what is the point of giving us the option of &#039;primary&#039; and &#039;secondary&#039; position selection seeing as I can&#039;t tell if it makes a difference so far.  I&#039;m also tempted to start selecting top as my secondary and hoping it just procs more.  Just wanted other peoples thoughts on it.","replies":[]}
