Rather than wasting 20+minutes of my life in a doomed ranked game, I opted to dodge a game and cop a 5 minute queue lock out and an LP loss.  Want to know why?  Because I had a rather communicative team in champion select... all but 1 person contributed to working out positions.  Hell, as third pick, I even asked last pick if they preferred adc or top... thought i&#039;d be a nice guy.  Got no response after asking twice so I took top.  2 seconds left in champ selection for 5th pick... obviously adc is left... picks chogath with flash and smite.  Brilliant.  Words can&#039;t describe this feeling ... at least not on the forums as I&#039;m sure my colourful language would sanction a lifetime ban - I am Aussie after all.  Still no response from fifth pick.  The player... csz... name and shame might seem harsh but what else can I do to try and rid the OCE community of another failure when it comes to a positive game/team experience.  I can&#039;t report them because I don&#039;t want to enter a game like this where I know everything&#039;s going to fall apart starting with a non-communicative team member.  So I&#039;ll spend 5 minutes writing this up while I re-wait in queue to hopefully not get a repeat session of this load of garbage.  Hard enough winning games and getting LP legitimately through feeders/trolls ingame let alone losing it before the game has even begun.\r\n\r\nNow that I think of it... it was probably a bot... there&#039;s been a fair few of those around lately...","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-26T08:04:45.193+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">doomed ranked game\n\nFun fact: Pre-game chat doesn't give you the ultimate predicting power of how the other players are going to behave in that game. Even if they say, \"mid or afk\" and they don't get mid, they'll usually still play. Of course they can just be lying, too.\n\n>obviously adc is left\n\nNot every game must stringently follow the out-dated meta.\n\n>at least not on the forums as I'm sure my colourful language would sanction a lifetime ban\n\nIt probably won't. There's filters here. One post won't even get you a warning.\n\n>I am Aussie after all\n\nwtf that's racist\n\n>name and shame might seem harsh but what else can I do to try and rid the OCE community of another failure\n\nWe have protocols. If you need to report someone for something outside of the client for reasons beyond your control, submit a support ticket. Otherwise, you just need to report using the client's report feature. Read the [Universal Rules](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules) before posting, as \"name and shame\" is strictly forbidden. Plus, what can we, other players who visit the boards, do? It's not like we can get them banned or anything. We're just other players.\n\n>Now that I think of it... it was probably a bot... there's been a fair few of those around lately...\n\nYou called them a failure before. Does this mean you'd behave in this manner even if you knew that thing was actually a person?","replies":[]}]}
