I do my best I try my best to help others but they don&#039;t care. I was super nice to everyone no one was even being mad at eachother and toxic? And all of a sudden she blames us for not &quot;Giving her kills&quot;?????\n\nI just don't understand why I should lose LP for doing great in a game when someone else whos obviously only playing to troll can ruin it for everyone.","replies":[{"poster":"KDA Player","date":"2016-05-24T10:20:49.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i cringe so hard when i read shit like this....you were 10-1 and you still lost? im guessing instead of focusing on the game you let your self get dragged into a caits obvious bullshit and you ended up losing the game? if not i doubt i was far off.","replies":[{"poster":"Dracuula","date":"2016-05-24T10:54:18.375+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"What am I meant to do 2v5?
