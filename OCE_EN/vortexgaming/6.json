With the change to the queue system they need to change how the LP and scorecards work and allow a personal scoring system. This season is so much more retarded than the 4 other seasons I have been in it is just a joke now how Riot are treating the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-17T06:15:39.530+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's how it works when you have an MMR system.\nIt's based off the Chess ranking system which also only works on if you win or lose because that determines your skill in Chess.\n\nYou can't have a team based game's ranking rely on individual performance, or else people would go for their individual score and not winning the game. Know what happens when people play for score and not the objectives that are required to win?\nThey lose.\n\nAs for this season being a joke, that's stupid.\nDynamic queue has improved the quality of games in ranked, practically eliminated lobby rage/toxicity.\nYes it doesn't work that well in high elo, but that's being worked on.\nThe two major rebalancing we've had this season with ADCs and mages have been great for champion diversity for the most part.\nThe changes to the jungle put greater importance on Junglers for control of objectives and more control for junglers to influence the outcome of a game.\nOnly problem I've had is the changes to minions, makes last hitting horrible and minion block has killed me more times than I want to count.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-20T09:59:57.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have put together a spreadsheet that shows what LP gain or lose you could get based on how you play, it probably needs fine tuning but works well.\n\nI have seen players try to be heroes and get nothing but a good personal score, but fail on the metrics that are required for team work and actually lose LP in a win, hell, I played a game myself that I tried to get a good personal score without helping my team much, I got a negative score.\n\nIt IS possible, but players seem to think otherwise. Yeh you may get the occasional person get a really good personal score and be the only one on the team to gain something, but from every gasme I have checked, my results go well against this. Most games that have a good team, everyone gets a better score overall because teamwork does in fact get you a better personal score in most cases.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-17T04:26:19.729+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel like anyone with a summoner name like \"<something> Gaming\" is a tryhard\n\nBut that's none of my business\n\nMy business is banter","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2016-06-17T05:58:09.256+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always feel like they are trying to be a youtuber/streamer, but lack any personality or skill to do so, so they name all their accounts with \"gaming\" in it to try and get attention.","replies":[{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-17T06:12:12.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True dat, but I mean, if you're actually a good enough streamer/youtuber/internet gaming personality then you shouldn't need \"gaming\" at the end of your name\n\nfookin children man","replies":[]}]}]}]}
