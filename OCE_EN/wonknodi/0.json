I have brilliantly calculated just what this community needs and this is a must.\r\nIt includes a vote from the team of which the player is in, which will ultimately decides if they get kicked out of the current game. This means that if all the players on the team agree to the vote, then they will be abolished from the game. Although many people believe that they are assisting the enemy team because they are \"having a bad game\"  most of the time they are genuinely that bad at the game. When in a ranked game and this occurs the losing team that has the player who is assisting the enemy team will not lose LP if they win the vote to remove the player and end up losing the game. However, the opposing team will still receive the LP they deserve for the efforts in the game. This is most definitely the best strategy in the game and should be recognised as something to take on board.\r\n                      -Wonknodi       Â©","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-05T08:29:52.388+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nature","date":"2014-12-05T08:05:43.073+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Premade teams would abuse the shiet out of it.
