I'm just curious as to why a lot of LCS players have been changing teams. Don't get me wrong, I love watching new teams and players in a different team blossoming and becoming publicized. I just want to know why they leave the teams they leave. It makes me sad that players from a certain team aren't united any more.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatJaimiKid","date":"2015-01-27T12:04:23.239+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like fnatic :'( So devo about that, and I have no idea why... But I guess it gives me the chance to discover and love new teams with Rekkles being in Elements and my beloved xPeke with Origen.","replies":[{"poster":"Table","date":"2015-01-30T07:25:49.840+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's the main team I was talking about :( I will be excited to see how all the players who have shifted to another team have been going in terms of adaptation.","replies":[]}]}]}
