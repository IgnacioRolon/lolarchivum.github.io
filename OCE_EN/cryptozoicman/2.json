(does my head in but who&#039;s friends don&#039;t haha). But anyway, while doing aram and more often then not having a skin boost. Which is awesome to actually see so many people doing it. But what about players like me who own 90% of the skins? I would say at least 7/10 times someone does a skin boost in aram i receive nothing other than the 100IP everyone gets. I was going to make a suggestion of maybe if you own all skins for the champ you&#039;re playing you get a bonus 100IP and you get 200 bonus IP at the end of the game just like the person who purchased the boost. Just an idea iv had. Or possibly unlocking chroma packs for available champions for that game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-08-13T06:50:23.504+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you feel a 100 IP bonus for doing nothing when Riot never had to add it in in the first place isn't enough?","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-13T07:07:34.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doing nothing?

Given the general attitude of your post, and the lack of depth with your suggestion, you can't blame me for making the assumption.\n\n> Iv spent more on this game then the majority of my entire friends list combined...

It was your choice to spend money on this game, that doesn't entitle you to any special treatment. This game doesn't have any kind of membership status and it's not \"pay to win\" so the amount of money you've spent on the game means nothing. Choosing to spend money on a game isn't a feat, however much you might think it is.\n\n> I simply can't agree with you when you say being \"compensated for nothing\".\n\nSo, someone else spends money on buying the \"skin boost\". You don't actually do anything to achieve that but expect to be compensated because you happen to own all the skins for the champion you got? Sounds like being \"compensated for nothing\" to me. If you want to talk about the person who buys the boost owning all the skins, however, that's really a matter of personal choice. They chose to buy the boost knowing that half of it's purpose wouldn't affect them.\n\nIf anything the person who buys the boost should be compensated, not the person who happens to be in the same champ select and happens to have all the skins for the champion they ended up with.","replies":[{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-13T08:27:23.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"First of all I simply love how you clearly use a smurf to go on the boards. Good to see it requires you to hide even in a forum. Secondly at what point in time was I asking you to come on here and make an assumption?? What you didn't get the gold sticker at school today so you thought you would go on the forums and be a dick?  Obviously it's not pay to win. I never said I was trying to do that. I said I was SUPPORTING them.. In the real world when someone supports you, you generally reward them in some way.  But hey this is all you're opinion and I think you've had a bad day and you're wrong.
