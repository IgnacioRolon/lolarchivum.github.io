The enemy team is too strong to be able to 2v5 and there is nothing to do but push, but I still cannot get far because i will be deleted once they find me pushing even with wards. I cant tell them what to do because all they do is chase and think its the right thing to do telling me to shut up and say that im bad, like &quot;This graves&quot; i just mute them but that blocks all communication. Im so puzzled why i cant carry  because my people on my team are fed but just chase for kills. When im fed i can go for kills but not after they feed 2 or more on the other team. gg ;[ stuck in bronze 1","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-06-16T01:55:12.751+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWelcome to the Ranked climb!\n\nIts great to see you are open to advice in your journey. I'll talk about two things to try and help you on the Ranked Ladder. Your game play and how to improve and your attitude towards the game.\n\nI'm going to start with attitude first because I believe this is one of the most important things to get right before you can improve and climb fast. \n\n**Attitude**\nWhen you are playing Ranked focus on your own gameplay, never look to push blame onto others. Unless you are literally Faker then there are probably things you could have done better to put your team in a position to win. Check out this video from Gbay99 - https://youtu.be/5MTO2a7ZFcc\n\nAlways stay positive, if you don't have something nice to say don't say it. If you are negative in your team chat not only will you add fire to the fuel but you could also potentially start your team on a downward spiral to fighting each other in chat instead of playing the game and trying to win. Remember League of Legends is a team game you have to work together as a team to win. #TeamWorkOP - https://youtu.be/ugXC7g3p0JU\n\n**Gameplay**\nYou've only just started on your ranked journey, there is going to be a lot to learn (hell I've played for 4 years and still have lots to learn). Don't get discouraged by losses and make sure you learn something from every death (why did you die? were you out of position? misjudged damage of opponent? etc) and make sure you always continue to learn about the game. There is a lot more to this game than just csing and fighting champions.\n\nCheck out this sick play list from UNSW LoL Society - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz\n\nIt will teach you a lot about trading in lane, lane control, team fighting, and also how to use a lead.\n\nHope this all helps and good luck on the Rift!\n\ntaken from earlier comment - http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/zVgleF4L-im-loosing-rank-even-more?comment=0000","replies":[{"poster":"IgnyteL","date":"2016-06-16T11:30:34.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thx for this really helped","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-16T02:40:27.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hay man, why you no post my link :(\n\nXD its fine, thought I would be funny.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-06-20T03:33:27.469+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"One thing I see far too often when coaching players is how they act when they are ahead. If you have a lot of kills and are on a champion which can snowball, then usually this indicates you have great mechanical prowess and micro play relative to your level, but your macro-gameplay or general strategy and decision making may be holding you back. \n\nIf you find that you are typically leading in kills or winning your lane but still consistently losing games then you need to focus on improving your teamwork and learning win conditions. Do not continually blame your team on this front, as they may be losing lane but have the skills needed for teamfighting, vision control or some other aspect of the game. Not everyone excels at everything, but you at least need an understanding of all of these aspects to excel.\n\nTry to focus on what you could have done every game as opposed to what your team could have done. Looking specifically at your win conditions. These change every game based on your teams composition, so you'll need to learn generally about the types of champions and roles you should be looking for.\n\nThis is a video I made on shotcalling a couple of years ago which focuses on win-conditions, I highly recommend anyone with the same problem check this out as its an amazing skill to have (and carried a scrub like me to Challenger with the mechanics of a sloth)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFmzrR1exHo","replies":[]},{"poster":"Qilli","date":"2016-06-15T22:08:33.914+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"20/0 constant KDA = freelo :D","replies":[]}]}
