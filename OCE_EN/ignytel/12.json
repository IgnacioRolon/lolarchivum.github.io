This usually results in lame insult fights, duo premade ragequits or duo premade intentional feeding. The most commonplace these 'Buddy' premades are at bot lane, where a self proclaimed 'proficient' player will play an ADC whereas his buddy who is allegedly allowed to feed or do badly is the support. \n____\nThe 'Buddy' Premade #2\nSimilar to 'Buddy' Premade #1, except both are at the same level and both do badly. Also results in insult wars, feeding, trolling and ragequitting. This kind of premades are also more susceptible of trying too hard to make plays and to be gods in the game, and they end up making mistakes and as you guessed, not blaming each other once.\n____\nThe 'Just a Game' Premade\nThis can be either of the two above, and just because theres a friend in the game either lowers their standards and ends up losing the game and stating 'It's just a game man', regardless of how hard they try when they're alone.\n____\nThe Fob Premade\nYou better hope they're on a Skype call or else the foreign languages they'll try to type in game will be incomprehensible to the normal Oceanic player. Either trying to curse you in they're own language, properly trying to give you advice or trying to set up a good play, you won't have the slightest idea of what they're trying to say. Often these fobs are from other regions with a different meta and playstyle and end up doing badly anyway.\n____\nThe 'Position Forcer' Premade\nHave a 5 man premade waiting for the 5th person to enter the party but takes too long? Screw it we'll go as a 4 man, and we'll be matched up with a lone solo player whom we'll force into a role since we're a 4 man premade and we have collective authority. Once you meet these guys there'll always be that one guy who asserts his dominance and authority by saying something cocky like \"sry m8, we're a 4 man premade, now go supp and suck the adc's dick\"\n____\nSo yeah OP I do feel you, there are so many ways premades can go wrong. Unless you actually get a godly premade which _double_-handedly carries the entire team, chances are they're just gonna losing the game.","replies":[]}]}
