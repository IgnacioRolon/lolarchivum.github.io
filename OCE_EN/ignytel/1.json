Just make sure you get an AP or Tank one as well.\n\nYour masteries are a little dodgy though. Although at this point it's useless to change it since everything will be reset in 9 days.

People has lots of different opinions when it comes to ranked / starting ranked. It good that you want to save for champions you like but at the same time in ranked the champions you like might be banned or will not be suitable for the lane you get put in / choose. In ranked many people are toxic and usually flame you for everything wrong you do and people at to very seriously / too seriously at times. So expect alot of flamers :(.  Other then that try cooperate with your team even though sometimes it will be hard and you might have to do things you dont want to (being left with a lane you dont want) and just try your best :). I belive you should start playing ranked as soon as you like since it isnt \"much\" different then a normal game of league, you also can get a taste of what ranked feels like and see if you want to keep playing it or have a break until you get better.\n\nBest of luck","replies":[]}]}
