I had a quick look on the store just in case there was one and couldn&#039;t find anything.\r\nBeing able to receive Push Notifications when someone replies to something you post would also be pretty great and I think it&#039;d get discussion on the boards going a bit more.\r\nWhat do you guys think? Yay or nay? Or has this already been discussed before?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-21T22:57:36.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I use my iPad quite a lot for it so this would be quite helpful.\n\nim stuck tho... i also want irelia nerfed... hmmm decisions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-09-21T15:46:43.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Couldn't hurt.","replies":[]}]}
