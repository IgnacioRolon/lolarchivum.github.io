The mark is removed after 5 seconds or on the fifth basic attack, which detonates Latern&#039;s Call, dealing 100/135/170/205/240 (+0.25 AD, +0.10 AP)\r\n- **Latern&#039;s Flame**\r\n_Mana: 45\r\nCooldown: 10/9.5/9/8.5/8_\r\nJax empowers his next basic attack with the Latern&#039;s Flame, dealing an additional 50/75/100/125/150 magic damage and an additional 25/50/75/100/125 (+0.5 AP) damage over 2 seconds.\r\n- **Ultra Combatant**\r\n_Range: +100/150/200/250/300\r\nMana: 15/30/45/60/75 per strike\r\nCooldown: 0 Seconds\r\nCast Time: 2 Seconds_\r\nJax meditates before releasing his inner form, with this, he is able to dash on all basic attacks, gaining bonus range. Jax can dash to allies dealing no damage and halving the cost.\r\n- **Together as One**\r\n_Mana: 100\r\nCooldown: 60/45/30_\r\nPassive: Jax deals (0.1 AP) as magic damage on hit passively.\r\nActive: Jax becomes one with his Latern, causing his strikes to count as 2 hits (all on-hit effects are proc twice) and causing Together as One&#039;s Passive to do True Damage instead of Magic Damage. Together as One lasts 5 Seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-06T03:48:44.291+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He has a lamp post not a lantern","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlitzForever","date":"2015-12-06T16:27:37.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".......How about we just leave {{champion:24}} as he is","replies":[]}]}
