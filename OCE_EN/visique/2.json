When he does not have sufficient Energy, he will be unable to use Cosmic Fists until he has a sufficient amount.\r\n\r\n_So this may sound a bit weird at first but hear me out. Osmosis uses portals to transport his hands to enemies when he is attacking from ranged distance, and such, as he is still technically punching, it is considered a melee attack. Cosmic Energy replenishes slower than energy used by other characters, such as Akali, so it could be somewhere in the range of Shyvana&#039;s Fury at Rank 2 Ultimate. So technically, if he wanted, he could still walk up to enemies and punch them from melee range instead, to deal the full attack damage and preserve his Energy._\r\n\r\n**Q: Astral Projection**\r\nOsmosis summons a portal, revealing a giant arm of Cosmic Energy, punching in a direction, piercing through enemies, dealing magic damage for each enemy hit. Hitting enemies marked with Astral detonates the mark, dealing additional true damage.\r\n\r\n_Working similarly to Viktor&#039;s laser, this ability uses two casts, first, to summon the portal, and secondly, to pick the direction of travel of the arm. This ability has a shorter delay than Astral Attraction._\r\n\r\n**W: Astral Attraction**\r\nOsmosis summons a portal, revealing a giant arm of Cosmic Energy, which grabs the first enemy champion in its direction, pulling them back to the portal&#039;s location whilst dealing magic damage. Applies a mark of Astral for 1 second.\r\n\r\n_A harder skill to master, this uses a click-and-drag skill shot mechanism, similarly to Viktor. The delay is particularly a point of emphasis, as whilst the ability is strong, it can easily be avoided if done correctly, as the portal must appear before the arm can come out of it. So to make things clear, the first cast picks the portal&#039;s location, whilst the second cast picks the arm&#039;s direction of travel._\r\n\r\n**E: Warp Rend**\r\nOsmosis imbues his next basic attack, dealing additional true damage whilst applying a mark of Warp Rend which persists for 3 seconds. Osmosis&#039; basic attacks and abilities increase the mark by 1. If the mark reaches 4, it explodes, providing Osmosis with a speed boost and additional true damage on-hit to all of his basic attacks for 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n_Not a particularly hard ability to understand, but it can be very useful in both one-vs-one and team fights. The true damage is only minor, with very minute scaling, but it can give Osmosis the boost that he needs to be effective. This ability requires Cosmic Energy to use._\r\n\r\n**R: Distortion Theory**\r\nOsmosis distorts space within an area, trapping units inside or outside of the space, blocking all projectiles and units from passing from one plane into another, whilst restricting all vision and contact between such until the distortion disappears. Osmosis saps his Cosmic Energy for every second the plane is active, increasing over time, and is the only unit able to pass between and interact with both planes simultaneously. All of his basic attacks within the distortion plane sap Cosmic Energy from opponents. Cosmic Energy drain is calculated by the amount of units within the distortion.\r\n\r\n_Distortion Theory is all about abusing positioning, communication and vision. He is the ONLY person able to see within both planes, meaning allies are unable to see so either. To allies and enemies, the other plane becomes visionless and uninterruptible. This means that if someone were to die within the distortion, the only people who would know would be Osmosis and others within the distortion, until the distortion disappears. The same can be said for the inverse, where people within the distortion would only be notified of events outside the distortion after the event occurs. Effects are also restricted, for example, if the Baron was killed while a team mate was in the distortion, he / she / it would not receive the buff. This is different for dragon buffs, which would come into effect after they leave the distortion plane. Note that absolutely anything can be put into the other plane, even the Baron, so if the Baron died inside the distortion, only those inside the distortion would get it. In this sense, it is very, very situational, but has the power to change a fight completely._\r\n\r\n_The actual distortion plane is seen as a circular ring, which stops everything from getting through, whilst the ground turns to a light blue colour. Everything outside the walls are turned black, which is true for those outside the wall trying to look in. No pings or chat work either. Global Ultimates will teleport through, or just not work. In the case of Gangplank, it will restrict the available area the ultimate is allowed to be cast in, whilst Ashe&#039;s arrow will teleport from one side of the wall to the other instantly, ignoring those inside. If you want further clarification on this concept, feel free to ask, with an example that is. Osmosis is the only person devoid of these rules._","replies":[{"poster":"lizardmast3r","date":"2018-01-28T10:06:07.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ultimate seems really strong for taking objectives, because most of the time all five people on the team would be attacking the baron, and depending on the duration of the ultimate, one team would be able to take baron and because it stops the notifications, they would be able to recall before the enemy team even knew they took the baron until they where completely safe","replies":[]}]}
