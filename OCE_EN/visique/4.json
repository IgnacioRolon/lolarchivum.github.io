Instead of provided bonus resistance, it could temporarily increase the Energy Regeneration based on the distance travelled while in Lightning Rush. It could also ignore movement hindering effects as well.\r\n\r\nThe Electrical Surge&#039;s Passive could be changed to a Thundering Shuriken enhancer that increases the projectile speed of the Shuriken and allows it to hit 3 targets, piercing through the others dealing less damage the more targets it goes through, applying a stack to each enemy hit. Similar to Caitlyn&#039;s Piltover Peacemaker but stops at the third target. If the Enhanced Thundering Shuriken kills a target it could refund 30 Energy per kill, or 10 per minion/monster kill.\r\n\r\nHis Slicing Maelstrom could cost 125 Energy but allows all his Thundering Shurikens to apply Electrical Surge&#039;s Passive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s all the suggestions that I have. Please feel free to leave constructive criticism or maybe some suggestions to balancing.","replies":[]}
