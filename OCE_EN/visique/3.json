A higher risk item, that may ultimately provided a better gold incentive.\r\n\r\nBut in its current state, especially with respect to other starting items, it&#039;s essentially become a niche, which is why I think it should get buffed. I&#039;m not talking anything major, that&#039;ll immediately put it on par with other starting items, but rather closer to them. Right now, it stands to provide:\r\n\r\n* 7 AD\r\n* 3 Health on AA\r\n* 180 Gold Benefit at full passive after selling\r\n* 450 Gold Buy, 180 Gold Sell\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Doran&#039;s Blade provides:\r\n\r\n* 8 AD\r\n* 80 Health\r\n* 3% Lifesteal\r\n* 450 Gold Buy, 180 Gold Sell\r\n\r\nThis means that Doran&#039;s Blade has slight scaling, and immensely higher value at early stages in the game, particularly in regards to health and percentage lifesteal as opposed to fixed ones. To help edge cull closer towards these, I&#039;d suggest either one or a multitude of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Increased stats, ie. 10 Health on AA for increased early lane dominance (improves farming ability in turn) or adaptive attack speed / cooldown reduction based on AD / AP\r\n2. Reduced gold cost ie. 350 / 400 for more early potions to allow for faster gold return-on-investment\r\n3. Cull reduces minion kills required by 1 every 8 seconds, lost gold is returned upon completion eg. only got 75 minion kills for completion = 350 + 25 bonus gold\r\n4. Cull also increases enemy kill gold by 25 and contributes to minion kill requirement as 25 minion kills\r\n5. Cull could turn into a proprietary long sword equivalent upon completion, that can be used in building as a substitute, or sold for reduced gold\r\n6. Cull heals the player for an additional 5 health on minion kills\r\n7. Destroying towers contributes 35 minion kills\r\n8. Cull decreases value of gold given to enemy upon death, but also decreases bonus slightly upon completion\r\n9. So on and so forth\r\n\r\nLet me know what you guys think and what ideas you guys have, I want to see more people using this in game. \r\n\r\nPeace.","replies":[{"poster":"SamoanHunter","date":"2018-10-19T13:48:27.544+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it should be buffed, but I do believe it should 'adjust' in some ways.\n\nIt is a high risk item, but I HATE it because I suck at csing (I get to 100 cs at 14 minutes on a good day), that's why I run Doran Shield or Doran Blade.\n\nMaybe it should give a +10 MS, or something that could help an ADC farm.\n\nIncreasing the damage seems stupid, and the on hit HP gain is good to me.\n\nOtherwise this item is pretty good where it's at right now.","replies":[]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2018-10-18T23:37:11.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think a small stat buff could be nice but basically everything here would make it hella busted, it's a tough item to balance perfectly as it essentially gives free gold to marksmen","replies":[{"poster":"ViSiQUE","date":"2018-10-19T11:00:28.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=young icetray,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=XAbjZbjs,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-10-18T23:37:11.211+0000)\n>\n> I think a small stat buff could be nice but basically everything here would make it hella busted, it&#x27;s a tough item to balance perfectly as it essentially gives free gold to marksmen\n\nHmmmm. Whilst it does end up giving a lot more gold, the negative effect it has on the early game can not be understated. Especially in terms of the marksman, where whilst it a may offer more value, it is too risky for its small reward. You potentially give up an entire early game just for what, 450 extra gold? Which may turn out to benefit the enemy team more. I'd have to agree, some of my potential fixes would be busted, but I still think it should at least be less risky to utilize in game, at least to the point where you may occasionally come across it.","replies":[]}]}]}
