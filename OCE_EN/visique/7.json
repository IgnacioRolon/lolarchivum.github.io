You guys probably won't like me trying to rework a champion which doesn't really require one. But in my view, I feel as though Varus represents a champion with a conflicting play style and overall art direction. Varus strikes me as a champion with a visceral kit, who is centered around his signature bow, able to output massive amounts of damage in an instant. But when you play him, it seems sort of underwhelming, more like he specialises in getting a large amount of shots, attack speed over pure, raw damage. An example of this may be realised in his Q, which does not pose the damage threat in comparison to his auto attacks later in the game.\n\nSo, I decided to make my own version of Varus with a drastically altered kit, focused more on abilities, whilst still retaining aspects of his old kit. Feel free to be constructive, especially with numbers, as these are just random values put in to show what is strong, but there is no need to fight or bad mouth over this, this is just my concept.\n\n{{champion:110}} \n\n\n**Stats**\nHealth: 514-to-1934\nHealth Regen: 3.2-to-14.1\nMana: 375-to-1155\nMana Regen: 8.1-to-17.5\nRange: 600\nAttack Damage: 64.2-to-129.1\nAttack Speed: 0.613 (+0-to-46%)\nArmor: 21.1-to-76.9\nMagic Resist: 18.4-to-51.9\nMovespeed: 345\n\n**Passive: Power Struggle**\nVarus' auto attacks do reversed adaptive damage based on his AP and AD bonuses and give him 2% of his max mana back on kills, increasing to 5% for champions, large monsters and minions.\n\n* When Varus builds AP, his auto attacks deal physical damage\n* When Varus builds AD, his auto attacks deal magic damage\n\n**Q: Living Arrow**\nFire an arrow that bounces between enemies, dealing 20/40/60/80/100 (+100% AD +60% AP) adaptive damage, bouncing up to 2 times onto nearby enemies behind the target, increasing the damage by 25% on kills. Holding down the ability allows Varus to increase the arrow's initial range and number of bounces up to 4 after 2 seconds, for a max of  5 hits.\n\n* Bounces similarly to Miss Fortune's Q, only traveling forward from enemy to enemy\n* Damage bonus on kill works similarly to Jhin's Q, increasing up to 200% of regular damage\n* Varus' main source of damage and wave clear, it can be also be used to poke and assassinate out of position teams that are trying to escape\n* 80/85/90/95/100 Mana Consumption + 14/13/12/11/10 Second Cooldown\n\n**W: Blighted Quiver**\nPassive - Abilities apply Corruption lasting 3 seconds. Enemies hit by Varus' abilities whilst this is active expunges the Corruption, rooting them for 1 seconds whilst preventing re-Corruption for 10 seconds.\nActive - Trigger roots on all corrupted enemies within range.\n\n* Proper Ability management makes this a deadly ability\n* Active Range is sizeable, but small\n* 40 Mana Consumption all ranks + 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 Second Cooldown\n\n**E: Reign of Vengeance**\nAfter a 0.5 second delay, unleash a flurry of arrows upon a target location for 3 seconds dealing 10/20/30/40/50 (+40% AD +30% AP) adaptive damage per second whilst applying Grievous Wounds to anyone in the area.\n\n* Deals damage in ticks every 0.25 seconds\n* Can be used to space out enemies\n* Small radius\n* Works well on rooted enemies\n* Can only apply 1 stack of Corruption\n* 70/75/80/85/90 Mana Consumption + 16/15/14/13/12 Second Cooldown\n\n**R: Piercing Retribution**\nFire a piercing arrow after 1.5 seconds of channeling, dealing 50/100/150 (+200% AD +100% AP) adaptive damage. Triggering Corruption on enemies using Piercing Retribution increases the root to 1.5 seconds instead.\n\n* Risky but rewarding play\n* Can be interrupted\n* Deadly in a combo\n* 150/175/200 Mana Consumption + 120/110/100 Second Cooldown\n\n{{champion:110}} \n\n**Conclusion**\nMy version of Varus attempts to gear him towards a more position and ability-heavy play style. This should make him a viable option as an AP burst carry, whilst his adaptive and reverse adaptive damage types help work upon new concepts to switch up opposing enemy play styles and item builds. By removing the slow on his E and forcing subsequent ability hits for roots, Varus loses out on some of his immediate anti-engage and defensive options, but in return, gains more ways to be aggressive when left alone. Risky play is incentivized, as his Q's mechanics should forced more flanked oriented positioning, away from the rest of the team, leaving him open and susceptible to attack, whilst his delayed ultimate gives breathing room for opposing counterplay, whilst a change in kit should move him away from attack speed and critical attacks, and more into pure attack damage and ability power output. With respect to his character, the passive, Power Struggle hopes to encapsulate the resistance and human side of the character in contrast with the Darkin-side, embodied in the abilities.","replies":[]}
