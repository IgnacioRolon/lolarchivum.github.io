The different modes just redistribute stats by 10% which really isn't much, and the passive cooldown reduction would have to be seperate like sona's ult passive if it is to be viable. If his w doesn't do damage by itself he will be bullied heavily in the laning phase as it seems that he requires at least 2 abilities to do anything. Also, seperate cooldown suggests that he works similarly to Jayce, where his abilities in different modes are seperate. However, champions so far released with different mode have mode changing ability on their ult slot, as having 3 extra basic ability is strong enough to compensate for lack of an ultimate. However, your champion not only have 3 modes granting you 6 different basic abilities, and stat redistribution, he also has 3 different ultimate ability that your opponent has to deal with.\n\nFor him to be acceptable, his q will have to be R, and shift his other ability down and tone down his ultimate to a basic ability. Also, it would make it interesting, if the state redistribution was greater gained rather than equally lost and gained. For example. at level 18 changing his mode of offense should give him 25% damage for losing 15% armor and magic resists, or closely alike. as when you compare this with jayce, he recieves flat buffs when switching modes. Overall he is not uninteresting but he will need some more thought and work.","replies":[]}]}
