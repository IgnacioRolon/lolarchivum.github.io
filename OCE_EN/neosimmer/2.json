But then you add the effects the passive gives, you almost get the vibe that he's a solo laner, like mid/top. It's a bit hard to get a picture of what role he would be assigned too because of the variation of the skills. \n\nBut overall the idea of his Q is cool and i think if the W maybe had 2 parts may be better, like the bit where he shoots and then it does damage over time as a passive then have an active which is where he consumes his blunder. The concept of the E and R would be cool too see on some kind of support but i just don't feel that they fit with the rest of his skills, and the passive seems a bit odd too. \n\nTry to think about what role he should take on, base your the kit around that and try to get something that feels smooth and right together just to avoid an identity crisis. \n\n-Yasho {{champion:240}}","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-09-17T02:14:31.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he is a jungler toplaner, someone meant to be going arround the map,  see his water abilities is so he can control the fight,  his abilites are meant for manipulating his oponents but i get where you are coming from, but i see pirates, so they have alot of stuff in common with water, maybe he got enchanted or something, his q and e are meant to work with zone control hje is meant to fit the control jungle play theme while still being a relevant threat in team fights\nand i did try to do that xD","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-18T12:15:18.713+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah so I agree with some of Yasho's points. \n\nThe main thing is you need to think of a cohesive theme. What core fantasy are you trying to deliver?\n\nSo your core thing is you want it to be Bilgewatery/pirate - It would be great for you to be a bit more specific (what kind of pirate? Gritty like GP?, Kinda goofy like Pirates of the carribean?)\n\nThen you need to think about the abilities you put in.\n\nThe passive links - How does this deliver on the fantasy of being a pirate?\nThe Q and W seem alright but very similar to GP Q\n\nE and R suddenly makes this guy a water bender (like Yasho says) how does this sell the fantasy of your kind of pirate? (if this is a good representation does that make Q and W out of place?).\n\nAlso jsut a note the link thing is cool it just doesnt seem to fit. It also looks like E and R hardly have any interaction with the Link system.\n\nI think its important to think about the core fantasy your character fits. Then build from there.\n\nBut yeah I think the Link mechanics are unique and cool, maybe just doesnt really fit a pirate theme.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-17T02:20:51.209+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"There isn't many pirate champions\" That's because we have Piratey McPirate over here, {{champion:41}} .","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-09-17T02:22:11.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao but still bilge water is like a island FILLED with pirates and we only have like 2 ACTUAL pirate champions","replies":[{"poster":"EzeBlood","date":"2016-09-17T02:23:30.947+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's kinda funny, Riot revealed in its online release of \"The Art of LoL - Volume 1\" that pre-rework GP was referred to throughout the Riot office as \"Piratey McPirate\".","replies":[]}]}]}]}
