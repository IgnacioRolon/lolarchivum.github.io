So bad luck there.\n\nI would recommend using FRAPS or OBS.\nOBS is tricky to learn and can get complicated but is Free.\n\nFraps on the other hand (Its what I use. and aside from the black borders on the sides of my vids which hopefully I have fixed now) it records in High def, 1080 P or what ever.\nIt does however chunk up a shit ton of space.\n\n1 league vid for me takes up about 60 gigs, so make sure you have space.\n\nIf you have Adobe After effects, (Once again its what I use)\nYou can create a new composition (Your video) Make sure the resolution is 16:9\nFollow these very quick guides on how to set up a render and such so it looks like 1080 P \nand very good on YouTube.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2iIVOGyTt4&list=PLZRrmLBrBbXFzVyMqsgy_Rtg3BvhwxpFW\n\nThen render then Upload you should be all ok.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding recording, rendering etc I can do my best to help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-22T13:41:00.552+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you can't, lol replay is just too outdated to work with league anymore.
