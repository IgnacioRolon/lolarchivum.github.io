Currently on a bit of a bad streak but always seem to do better when playing with a team (especially with comms). The last two season I have mained ADC but am also very solid on support where I also enjoy shot calling (which I would prefer to main if I could eventually get myself to an elo that I can **always** trust my adc). My best champs are Caitlyn, Jinx and Trist. What I'd like to get from being in a team is having a bit of fun but also improving as a team and slowly all working our way up eventually.

I main Support, but can also play ADC if necessary. I would like teamwork, consistency and people to listen to each other etc from a team (and to grow/learn with) as solo queue isn't quite doing it for me, and I also enjoy playing with a team. My previous ranked team's division last season was Silver I until most of the team stopped playing.\nMy best champions are Janna, Sona, Nami, and Leona - however I can play most supports (will need to work on Morgana and Thresh though).\nPlease contact me ingame if interested.\nThank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-23T09:49:57.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Darth R2\nsliver 2 (g3 last season)\njg or support","replies":[]},{"poster":"rose2424","date":"2016-02-23T09:19:35.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, I main ADC but I also play mid and am practising JG at the moment too.
