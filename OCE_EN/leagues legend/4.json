I understand that I can&#039;t be aggressive all the time, but when I am, I expect my support to do just that, support me. I&#039;m happy to own up to my own mistakes and will usually blame everything that goes wrong on myself, I play a fair bit so an active group/duo would be amazing. \r\n\r\nLooking to get better and play with likeminded people.","replies":[]}
