And different roles require different skills, you can't expect 4 other clones of yourself to play the other lanes as well as you do with yours. The real challenge of ranked is making teams work together and that skill will work better than almost any amount of mechanics.\n\nAlso, Corki had last whisper, trinity and sorc treads... That doesn't look like very much AP, am I missing something? \n\nAnd Lulu (assists are nearly comparable to thresh) + Vlad (first blood + good KDA) look pretty average. I'd say your team isn't the best, but their team simply did really well.\n\nNo one but Lulu and Thresh warded enough. EDIT: Not even they warded enough. Trinkets do NOT count ever.\n\nStatistically speaking, people who play ranked very little are more likely to not like ranked compared to someone who continues playing even after not enjoying it the first 3 times. Try playing and enjoying the game regardless if you win or lose. Focus on seeing plays so well coordinated by the enemy team they leave your mouth hanging in amazement, watch team fights get tense and see what you did well and what everyone else did well, etc.\n\nI don't find bad plays frustrating, I find them funny, so I end up enjoying the game more than half the time even if I don't have above 50% win rate.","replies":[{"poster":"Revelations 13","date":"2015-07-22T09:07:27.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bot got double killed at like 4 minutes, at that point corki began saying ff 20, he also intentionally died a couple of times, like he walked into enemy team and sat there. To address your other point I didn't actually get to my main role playing middle so, my rank depends on what the patch is and right now my viktor is godlike. have a look at my Nasus Pantheon (jungle) and graves win rate.\n\nThe reason Corki is a sht pick when you have double ap is because Corki does more ap damage then phys, that's why he builds sorc shoes...\n\nVlad got first blood, although he then fed tryn and got pushed in and lost multiple towers, he played terribly built terrible and got annihilated. no armour vs a tryn, I lel.\n\nShyvana did the most feeding on our team, despite being quite a pseudo tanky mobile champion with extremely good survivability and dueling potential, aka he played like sht.\n\nWe actually had more wards placed then the enemy which is surprising but wards don't really have as much use when you're cowering behind tower from the 8/0 lucian and free farm tryn.\n\nI'd like to add, I didn't say anything all game, didn't blame anyone, I just played my best for the my one monthly game.\n\nSince I'm being critical of my team I'll try some on myself, I held lane and farm'd really well all game basically, i didn't take any tower dmg until four came mid and dove me, I thought I could hold them off or at least trade 1 for 1 (I was pretty desperate at this point as well, all lanes were losing except me I didn't see us winning by me forfeiting towers), at this point lucian was already 8/0, maybe I coulda backed off there and not died, I don't really think it would have had any effect on game though, that was one of my two deaths, my 3rd death was right at the end as nexus exploding, I was always looking to roam but there just really wasn't a whole lot of room to, I was actually having my lane quite heavily focused by jungler after top and bot were basically basket cases, at 15 minutes bot had already collapsed mid. \n\nIt was actually exploiting Galio's confidence by having his jungler with him that got me a kill on him, long story short he went aggressive with his jungler  in bush on my ward I turned and blew him up.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-07-22T19:07:03.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Lulu went Morello's. They have a lot of Healing however it would be better if she took ignite, or simply just stuck with exhaust and built Ardent Censor, a Mikael's to stop Galio ults etc - It's just a really bad item when there are much better options that benefit your team more; I mean I'd rather be Mikael's'd or have an Ardent Censor Lulu or like Talisman, Spellthief's is better upgraded to Frost Queen's Claim later too (Just get frostfang gold and effect is same you are just generally better off spending gold on another item rather than upgrading it to 50 AP, 10% CDR and an 80% slow - the gold gain and passive on hit dmg and gold gain is same between frostfang and frost queens). Frost Queens is so unnecessary early on lulu and shes generally huge range and boosting other people and its really not useful in that matchup whatsoever, if she had Ardent or something she'd be 10x as useful so like Frostfang and Ardent or something she'd be 10x as useful as if with Frostfang and Morello's.\n\nMikael's'ing someone from a Trynd slow > \"Morellos\". Ardent Censoring your ADC or Shyv when fighting someone like Luc 10x as good as \"Morellos\" or \"Frost Fang\". She could have gone so many other builds and been 10x as useful.\n\nAlso, they have like 0 armor gains except thresh who isn't really a priority and all warwick had was a Glacial, that is basically the entirety of the armor on their team and your Corki went trinity into last whisper.\n\nThey're not like hugely tank so rather than trinity then botrk he could go trinity then IE.\n\nLulu also still had yellow trinket not sweeping lense even though she has a sightstone (who needs that many wards I mean really, clearing > 1 extra long cooldown ward on top of sightstone).\n\nLulu needs like a drill on support Lulu and supports in general (items especially).\n\nVlad shoulda taken flash exhaust or at least considered exhaust since his laner is an ADC and flash coz he only really has one solid dash to engage and can then usually be outranged etc and a 40% reduc to his DPS for 2.5 seconds is basically a useless tryndamere doing 200 damage autos instead of 380 damage autos for the majority of his engage late game which after 2 attacks in the 2.5 second duration (roughly) is like 600 damage instead of 1300 damage which usually means a live carry, rather than a dead one.\n\nCorki needs a lesson on builds too, Last Whisper is like a 30 damage output increase plus the 40 base against the kind of armor they most likely had when for the same gold he coulda had +75 AD along with the scaling, plus he deals a lot of magic dmg and has AD scaling on his Phosphorus bomb, AD scaling on his Gatling Gun, AD Scaling on his Missiles and literally would have increased his DPS more with a Dorans blade and Void staff it is just that useless to take a Last Whisper as a second item. I mean he has Armor shred on his Gatling Gun, AD scaling into magic dmg on his missiles and Phosphorus and he rushes a Last Whisper after Trinity when they have no armor. It is 5 kinds of a bad idea.\n\nLuc is pretty OP right now tho just saying (And Riot are even considering buffing him =/) and Tryndamere stomps solo queue because you need to co-ordinate ganks on him and you really need exhaust against him and people like to take TP top and don't get the concept of taking exhaust to counter their laner in lane and all game at the expense of a TP. I mean what good is TP against trynd and luc in reality, when you could exhaust them (both of them) with top laner with exhaust and support with exhaust. (probably why pros don't take AD Carries top etc because exhaust = gg for them).\n\nAlso Vlad has more sustain than him and shoulda won lane but probably didn't ward (Solo queue) also why sh-t talk your team, rather than educate. I hope you actually pointed this stuff out to them otherwise next time you run into them they'll be just as ill informed and really if you help people, you're helping yourself have more fair games and its kinda slack not to, also youre just leaving them to go on and make the same mistakes again and all so you can sit stalely at plat whilst hating ranked. I hate ranked, but I still play it and I don't b-tch more than 5x a day about people but I keep that to myself, occasionally vent about why people don't get banned for being pricks and usually try to point out what is to the very best of my knowledge a better option itemwise, playstyle wise or champ pick wise etc and don't think its constructive just b-tching about people and ranked in general in such a serious seeming note, whilst probably not being aware just how bad the lulu and corki item choices were and how vlad coulda taken better summoners for the match and it all coulda gone better from level 1 and you coulda won if you pointed this stuff out, or if they knew so whilst it sucks that people fail sometimes (had 3 AD Carries on enemy team few games ago and they had 1 mage and 4 of my team stacked MR items) it doesn't help to complain and point them out especially if not being constructive and pointing out things like>\n\nExhaust Counters AD Carries.\n\nTake it.\n\nLove it.\n\nMorellos is bad on lulu cause you're sacrificing on average 200-300 reduction to heals in an average fight for +heaps of attack speed and on hit damage from an ardent censor or the ability to mikaels someone out of trynd CC engages or a galio ulti.\n\nDon't rush last whisper after Trinity on Corki, you're an AD into magic damage scaler for the most part with an armor shred. Get IE or BT or something, botrk if they have a few tanks.\n\nThey had no armor so like especially don't rush Last Whisper.\n\nDon't b-tch about people, it doesn't make them play better and like Vik is OP as f anyway don't think you're top sh-t because you can play someone who's OP as f and takes a little skill, your whole life is lazering people to death it takes a bit of skill but he's a pretty ridic champ and I welcome the AP item changes that bring some champs up to his level of utility and damage because for someone with no escapes, the benefit he gets utility and damage wise is far greater than a lot of similar champs like Lux and Xerath who strangely enough take even more skill yet get basically no edge over OP as f Viktor for it.\n\nAlso Galio vs AP heavy team, probs shoulda gone like Rushed Void on Vlad coz Galio loves MR, Warwick loves visage and Thresh is obviously going to go Mercs or Locket and vs your teams CC I'm surprised there weren't more Mercs on the team but a rushed void after 1 item was basically 100% going to be warranted for your AP's anyway.\n\nLulu going an AP item just made them love the free MR stacking even more and made her building even less enviable.\n\nSpell pen on Vlad 2 rather than CDR, because of the MR stacking that will 9 times out of ten happen with a WW, Thresh and Galio vs an AP heavy team.\n\nAlso, I hope you rushed Void after Ludens but I'd suggest maybe an abyssal or something so you can deal with thresh, Galio and Warwick coz that's a lot of magic damage and if you or Vlad picked it up, woulda helped your team heaps (even lulu could have gone it) and like maybe you could have gone a few diff builds so those 3 deaths didn't happen (maybe) and I don't think Luden's is as good on Vik as a Deathcap because of his massive AP Gains on hexcore (that scale) and I also think maybe a rushed abyssal then other items would have gone better. (You're doing more fighting than chasing etc or running in reality, their team is heavy engage not poke or sustained dps).\n\nAll 5 of u are magic damage there's just so much you all could have done to better this matchup but once they have an edge and if you haven't or aren't prepared - because they have a mixed damage team you cant really itemize against it and better communication, preparation or being more educated would have made the game possibly even completely turned around since you have poke and sustained damage and if you can deal with their most likely heavy and deep engages you can most likely take a win, rather than suffer defeat.","replies":[{"poster":"Revelations 13","date":"2015-07-25T14:08:48.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"holy fk this comment","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-07-22T11:16:33.771+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have friends IRL you could play and have chat with?
