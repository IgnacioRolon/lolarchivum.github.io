I agree that it's frustrating that you don't have the opportunity to report people like this.\n\nIf you do end up in a game with them, the best way is of course still to report them in post game (and mention in the notes whatever might have happened in pre/post game). Of course, if someone dodges then that isn't a possibility, so that's when you should consider submitting a support ticket.\n\nSupport are very busy however, so if it's something minor I probably wouldn't submit a ticket about it (I wouldn't call the example you gave minor, especially if there is chat to back it up). \n\nIt's also worth noting that you won't get any satisfying response back, because due to privacy reasons Riot can't respond to your ticket with details about if a punishment was handed out or not.","replies":[{"poster":"Pepperede","date":"2016-06-12T04:25:27.169+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly I didn't even think to get a screenshot.

As my colleague mentioned earlier, we can't foresee if a player is going to troll or feed or AFK. There is no such technology for that.\n\nAs for AFK's, our automatic LeaverBuster system is implemented to discourage Summoners from repeatedly leaving matches and/or idling during gameplay. Suspensions and punishments are issued against Summoners that leave or idle in several games over a relatively short period of time. The LeaverBuster system bans chronic leavers and tracks and punishes users who continually leave their Teams.\n\nYou can find more about LeaverBuster in our Knowledge Base:\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714\n\nOn the other hand, can you provide me an evidence that you were matched with Challenger/Gold/Silver players?\n\nLastly, we don't disclose information about a player's sanction due to privacy.\n\nI think that if you aspire to get better, you should try to focus on what aspects of your own game you can improve rather than externalizing blame on the system and on your teammates.If you want to climb, focus on yourself. Tens of thousands of other players can do it and you know you can as well. Recognize that the first step starts with you!\n\nMaggieNoodle\nRiot Games Player Support\nWorst Viktor ever\n\n\nthis is the officical answer from riot, which means they dunt care about the reports and just do random punishments cause they r so \"busy\" ( i guess fking their mums ass), how do u expect riot to improve when the fking company treat players like this? justt troll another game if u feel pissed off any way their team r bul shits","replies":[]}]}
