The game mode is so fun itself I really wanna play it all the time. As a suggestion, I really think Riot should have many more _permanent_ game modes. But I still don&#039;t want to ruin the excitement of temporary game mode events such as **URF** and the new **ARAM** one! A really good idea would be to make a propper **Hide &#039;n&#039; Seek **mode!:) {{summoner:31}}","replies":[]}
