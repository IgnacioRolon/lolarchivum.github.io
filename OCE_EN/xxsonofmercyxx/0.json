However, when the empire was defeated in Episode 6, the cloning facilities were lost to both the empire and the rebellion. First Order storm troopers are taken from their families at birth, and raised to be ruthless soldiers who knew nothing but the First Order and that the Rebellion is the enemy. However, they are still normal humans with free will. This is why there is a discrepancy between the two movies, and why Finn joins the rebellion in Episode 7.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2016-01-11T10:59:23.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I'm concerned the force awakens isn't cannon","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-14T08:20:07.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As far as I am concerned bacon doesn't come from a pig.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-06T00:52:48.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How would his Crushing Blow look though?","replies":[{"poster":"DigitX2","date":"2016-01-16T02:36:23.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he holds in the middle, spins it once and sort of throws it a target","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DigitX2","date":"2016-01-16T02:35:07.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the lore of yi and wukong, this would work well!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-01-14T12:09:13.739+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty cool","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-12T00:19:17.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not going to lie.
