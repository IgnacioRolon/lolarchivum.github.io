However, according to this (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ#h3 ), apparently I&#039;m supposed to be getting a pop-up everytime I queue?  Regardless, my queue times have drastically increased to the point where 15-25 minute queues (for normals notably) are a norm, when a few weeks ago it hovered at 5-10 min queues.  Did the playerbase for OCE suddenly drop dead, or was I put in a low priority queue and my client&#039;s just glitched out?  I&#039;d really just like confirmation please.  Thanks.","replies":[]}
