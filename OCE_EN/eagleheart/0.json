The worst is when you have three (or four) botting players, and you can't even /forfeit to end the match. Over the past few days I've had at least two games where it's been me and 4 bots. I've tried babysitting mid, but I can't prevent them from tower-diving after taking damage from the enemy champ, which means the foe still gets fed no matter what I do.\n\nI report in the post-match screen (rather than honoring them), but it's getting beyond a joke - nowadays I've started asking if all players are humans before picking a champion, purely so I don't end up stuck in yet *another* bot-infested game. :-(","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-11-19T23:18:48.480+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I've actually got a list of them on my comp and am keeping Riot updated when I put new names on.

But with the recent end of season and Worlds, they have been extremely busy working with that. But now with the season over Riot have actually been addressing some of the players that have been questioned. The best way to solve this issue for you personally, is to write a support ticket. Provide names and preferably screen shots as further evidence. \n\nThis said. I am sorry to hear about you having to play with bots. I was IP farming the other day on my main in a bot match when I encountered 2 bots on my team. What was extremely painful for me was the fact that I had a level 11 Garen who was legitimately new to the game. Following the completion of the game I added him so that I could help him and teach him more about the game stating that playing with bots on your own team is a bad way to learn. \n\nGood luck with your endeavours on the Rift! \n\nKind Regards,\nlols","replies":[{"poster":"Floob","date":"2014-11-20T01:45:15.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty good experience for those inevitable tier 5 matches where your team may as well be comprised of bots though :P","replies":[]}]}]}
