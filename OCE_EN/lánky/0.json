The client itself is still the same.\n\nIn saying that however, the rollouts of the new login flow coincide with the regular patches, so it's possible you had a bad patch. This can occur for a variety of reasons, connection instability being the main (but not only) culprit.\n\nDepending on your graphics card, alt-tabbing can be quite unstable in general if you play in true fullscreen, particularly if you do so in loading. As a band-aid fix I'd recommend switching to windowed fullscreen or not alt-tabbing in-game.\n\nMore permanently, the first thing you should try is a client repair (Settings > Initiate Full Repair). Failing that, a clean reinstall will fix just about anything local, you can do this quickly and easily via the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool), but naturally, you'll have to re-download the game.\n\nIf all else fails, ticket Player Support and they'll be able to help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
