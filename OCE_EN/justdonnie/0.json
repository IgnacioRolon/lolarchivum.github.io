But does the punishment actually fit the crime? Riot state &quot;If you&#039;re unable to conform to our ideal of what our players should be like, then we don&#039;t want you playing our game&quot;. Yet in support tickets state &quot;We don&#039;t undo bans under any circumstance that was justified. Feel free to make another account using the lessons you&#039;ve learned&quot;.\n\nNow i don&#039;t know about you, but this seems a more than a tad confusing. If you &quot;don&#039;t want me playing your game&quot;, then WHY encourage me to make another account?. There are only two reasons for this 1) is that every signed up account is another figure to add to the &quot;we have x accounts that play league of legends on a regular basis&quot; and 2) Because new accounts = more time / revenue spent getting skins and champs for the account. In order to truly understand this, we have to first look at whether verbal toxicity is all that big of a deal on the grander scale of things. First off, yes, communication is key in anything that requires a team of people to win. secondly, Riot have given people all the tools they need to avoid this angry toxic person (a mute button). If people choose not to mute, then everything they see AFTER they SHOULD have muted them makes them just as guilty as the offending party. I respect that people probably shouldnt have to put up with people being verbally abusive, but listening to it IS optional. Now we move onto trigger behaviours.\n\n _**Riots inability and lack of identifying trigger behaviours** _\n\nRather than addressing verbal toxicity , Riot should be addressing the reasons WHY people are verbally abusive. Its the same as with people being evil: People arent inherently evil, its their life experiences that determine changes to their ego. I played two games this weekend (I played a few more than two, but these were the most obvious tilting ones), one game had an ap mordekaiser as adc and an ap top shaco (both autofills, same game). I begged people in champ select not to lock the champions they picked as we&#039;d get outscaled (jinx and irelia both outscaled their laners and carried). I ended up going pantheon mid vs morgana and getting camped. Then the morde and shaco pointed out my pretty average score and saying &quot;youre the one feeding&quot;.  When in reality its because we had a support nami, and a jg khazix, so i was the engage for the team. I didnt engage in the last teamfight, and we lost because of it. Now Riot say to me &quot;You can dodge, take -3lp, and a wait timer&quot; which escalates pretty quickly to a 20 min wait timer, and losing ANY lp when youre bad like me means its going to be a bit of a climb getting it back. It doesnt demote you, but it does move you down the ladder further on the way to demotion.  The other game had a lee sin jungle who intentionally fed after i asked him to not go under tower for a kill on my laner again, that it wasnt worth it and he responded with &quot;Do you want me to int? yes or no?&quot;. At which point i told him that i was just pointing out not to go under tower and he responded with &quot;YES OR NO?&quot;. He ended up inting and pointing out to me that he&#039;d done this hundreds of times, and nothing had happened. Now verified cases of intentionally feeding get a two week ban then a permaban. The only way to actually verify theyre intentionally feeding is for them to admit to doing it. And this lee sin was like &quot;sorry, lag :)&quot; in chat. our final team score was 8/32, with enemy team taking the nexus at 17:59. As per Riot i shouldnt be able to lash out at this lee sin, that I just need to keep my mouth shut and report him post game. \n\nThose were very specific examples of &quot;tilting&quot; behaviour, but lets make a more generalized list of &quot;trigger behaviours&quot;\n\n*  Not playing autofill roles, because &quot;Im not getting forced into a role i dont play&quot;. \n* Picking extreme non-meta picks that are never going to work\n* Poor decision making when selecting team comps, and not playing to the teams strengths\n* Not following pings and judgment calls for group objectives, ultimately ending up with objective contested and stolen\n* individual champion skill meaning people consistently lose lane, and dont follow / assist team in getting back on track\n* people afking after 3 minutes, meaning that the team cant remake and leaving team at a severe disadvantage\n* Having to solo carry, and rather than the team try and base their strategies around the guy who clearly knows what hes doing, they dont\n* Jungler not helping a lane thats shoved to their tower (i get they dont have to, but it would be nice to relieve tension)\n* Team telling you to do something youre already doing (farm under tower, and youre under tower last hitting and getting dove)\n* Team not using openings to claim objectives (Someone effectively butchering their k/d/a in order to get the victory)\n\nThere are many other triggers. These (and other) behaviours all tilt people, and a natural human response is to vent about it. Now Riot permanently ban verbally toxic players to &quot;protect&quot; the mainstream player base from them, but how are Riot protecting people prone to toxic outbursts from the above trigger behaviours? The truth is that Riot expect their playerbase to be &quot;respectful of others&quot;. Respect their ability to pick and choose whoever they want, respect that they have their own needs within the game that theyre here to fulfill, respect that different people are at different skill levels. But in the same token, shouldnt people respect what the team needs? respect the team by playing champs they can use, respecting mutually agreed upon judgment calls, or the opinions of those clearly more skilled?. Riot are only partially addressing the trigger behaviours, &quot;we need better detection systems for erroneous behaviours&quot;. But permaban people lashing out due to these behaviours not being fixed. Riot shouldnt even THINK about permabanning until all the trigger behaviours have been removed/ suppressed. Once the behaviours that &quot;tilt&quot; people have been removed, the only people still being negative will be people that you cant make happy, and they should find another outlet. Speaking of outlets, Riot want people to not lash out at their team, to &quot;unburden&quot; their frustration, but arent offering people an alternative outlet. Basically they just want people to completely bottle their emotions, or to vent/ release them in a highly impractical way. \n\nThere have been numerous psychological studies regards suppression of emotion, and how the effects of suppressing emotion can have highly negative and long lasting effects from being incapable of expressing oneself emotionally, to actual physical illness due to mental state affecting the immune system. \n\nRiot seem to be putting more emphasis on new skin lines and ultimate skins, as well as releasing new champions than they have in curbing the above things ive pointed out (which are more likely to keep players playing the game, but less likely to turn an immediate profit). If this isnt true then Riot can feel free to provide me with information/ facts to the contrary and i will be all too happy to admit im wrong.\n\nThe link i showed is League of legends promoting itself as a way for schools to make league of legends part of its curriculum as a way to build teamwork and camaraderie between its students, and for them to experience what its like to work as part of a cohesive unit. Unfortunately Riot havent addressed the issues that i pointed out regards trigger behaviours, so NOW theyre going to be an influential part of students schooling, where their mental states are at the most malleable. Lets assume that a student has a negative experience playing the game? how is this going to affect their schooling?. Riot want too much from their game without fixing the root problems within the game, and they need to work that out first, as he who wants everything ends up with nothing.\n\nI love League of legends, and i respect what they want to do with the game, but I honestly feel that Riot have too much other stuff they have to work on before they go trying to become truly multi faceted, and wearing way too many different hats.\n\nFeel free to offer advice and feedback guys!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-12T23:50:50.209+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":2,"body":"Super long post incoming!!!

In **Lyte**'s [2014 GDC talk](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020389/Enhancing-Sportsmanship-in-Online) he says _\"At Riot our fundamental belief is that players are inherently good, but bad context can create bad behaviours\"._\n\nA lot of what the Player Behaviour team has done recently, was an effort to reduce \"bad context\". The role selection feature was implemented to give people their preferred role more often and reduce fighting for roles. Or [/remake](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/update-play-games-matter/remake) was an effort to get rid of the \"bad context\" coming from playing 4v5 AFK matches right from the start.\n\n__*\n\n> Now Riot say to me \"You can dodge, take -3lp, and a wait timer\" which escalates pretty quickly to a 20 min wait timer, and losing ANY lp when youre bad like me means its going to be a bit of a climb getting it back. It doesnt demote you, but it does move you down the ladder further on the way to demotion.\n\nYou're not thinking of the alternative here. If you don't dodge you'll loose 20 LP and MMR. If you're a bad player, then you should always dodge when you think your odds of winning are really low. Riot is correct that dodging is the best course of action.\n\n_Should there be a better course of action though?_ Absolutely, and it's something I expect to see after the Tribunal. **Lyte**'s hinted at the possibility of a dodging system [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/WV2VqZca-new-champ-select-qa-with-the-dev-team?comment=00350000).\n\n__*\n\n> As per Riot i shouldnt be able to lash out at this (intentionally feeding) lee sin, that I just need to keep my mouth shut and report him post game...\n\n > Riot want people to not lash out at their team, to \"unburden\" their frustration, but arent offering people an alternative outlet. Basically they just want people to completely bottle their emotions, or to vent/ release them in a highly impractical way.\n\n+ Yes, you shouldn't lash out at the Lee Sin. If you do decide to lash out at Lee Sin and say _\"fuck you asshole i hope you die\"_, you have fixed nothing and made the environment even more toxic. \n\n But I do feel really bad for players in this situation though, there's really no way to avoid it once it happens. IMO it's one of the behaviour system's greatest flaws.\n\n\n+ There's plenty of ways for players to \"unburden their frustrations\", we often go over it with reforming players. For example, verbalizing what you want to say instead of typing it works really well for some players, or having a stress ball nearby can help as well. I wouldn't consider these solutions highly impractical either, verbalizing your toxicity can be done instantly. \n\n___*\n\n>  Unfortunately Riot havent addressed the issues that i pointed out regards trigger behaviours, so NOW theyre going to be an influential part of students schooling, where their mental states are at the most malleable.\n\nFirst let's establish something. High school kids are already playing League.\n\nSo there's two options; \n\n1. They can continue to play without guidance and maybe become toxic.\n\n2. They can join one of these groups, and learn how to have good sportsmanship, how to handle themselves in stressful situations, and how to co-operate as a team. All under the guidance of a qualified teacher. \n\n As you can see, the program is very focused on this side of League. They even have a bunch of [\"aspects of sportsmanship\"](http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/high-school-clubs/sportsmanship.html). Also remember these kids are high schoolers, in about 5 years they'll become adults and all jobs will require these skills. \n\nIf this program does attract new players, they'll get to learn through a really great learning environment rather than the infamous solo queue. I can only really see it as a positive thing.\n\nAlso just to clarify, this is NOT intended to be as part of a compulsory curriculum. This is intended to be an optional after school or lunch time club. Hopefully **Riot Maraudaur** (the Rioter in charge of this) can pass by and give you more professional insight. \n\n__*\n\nFeel free to reply with any questions or let me know if I'm not understanding something :D","replies":[{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-13T09:36:11.053+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response Tele, Massive reply incoming!\n\n> Riot doesn't want you playing the game if \"you're unable to conform to our ideal of what our players should be like\".

Remember a perma-ban is just the punishment of loosing your account, it doesn't mean \"you may never play this game again\". Not that Riot can stop you from making a new account anyway though.\n\nNow lets address this. Yes, thats what Riot are saying. And ill reiterate again, because im assuming you missed it. \"What are Riot doing to protect me from aggravating behaviours\"?\n\nI was Irelia into Garen, had a lee sin force garen out of lane, then tower dive at lvl 3, got me killed, to garen, and almost died himself. I said \"Lee, you need to not dive like that again, youve forced him out of lane there was no need to do that\". He then replied with \"Do you want me to int? Yes or no?\". He then proceeded to feed lanes, and then fed garen, who was then killing me under tower with his jungle shyvana. \n\nAnother example at champ select i pointed out to our person who had picked yi jg that yi jungle was a bad into the enemy team comp, he then still went yi jg, proceeded to go 1/11/0.\n\nNow you tell me how im being protected from this stuff? What constructive outlets do i have? stress balls? yelling at the screen? Lets assume im playing on my laptop in a library, or at lunchtime at a school. So now what you're telling me is that my frustration in game has real world consequences. Ive never been one of the guys who have broken keyboards and the like, but i know of more than a few people who have replaced mouses and keyboards, and have new ventilation holes in their plasterboard.   \n\nYou're also not factoring in \"trigger behaviours\". Lets assume that someone intentionally feeds, lets assume that someone locks a champ you tell them its a bad idea to lock, lets assume someone isnt doing suggested ideas to help correct their failing lane. What is being done to protect ME from THAT?\nThe problem here is that if someone is threatening to feed, picks a troll pick, picks a bad pick into a  team. Now you tell me, what is there for ME to do about that? my options are limited. Im getting the same negative stimuli over and over again, yet Riot dont protect me from it. I have no control over what i get paired with, and as such am left feeling powerless within the confines of the game.

Because until the above examples (and others) are resolved, people are going to keep getting frustrated, are going to keep getting angry. The problem is, that if any of the above events occur, then im trapped with a person for 20+ minutes, im helpless, i KNOW theyre just wasting my time, but i have no control over it. The fact that when you have no control over a situation you feel helpess, when you feel helpless you get frustrated, when you get frustrated, you inevitably get angry, and when you get angry you get banned.\n\nDid you ever get taught about \"I\" statements? \n\nWhat Your “I” Statement Isn’t\n\nYour “I” statement is not about being polite.  It’s not to do with ‘soft’ or ‘nice’, nor should it be rude.  It’s about being clear.\n\nIt’s a conversation opener, not the resolution.  It’s the opener to improving rather than deteriorating relationships.\n\nIf you expect it to be the answer and to fix what’s not working straight away – you may have an unrealistic expectation.\n\nIf you expect the other person to respond as you want them to immediately, you may have an unrealistic expectation.\n\nNon-defensive Communication\nPointing the finger and using ‘you’ messages puts blame onto the other person.  When we feel someone is blaming us, we often become defensive.  Once people become defensive or angry communication usually breaks down.\n\nWhen to Use:\nWhen we need to confront others about their behaviour\nWhen we feel others are not treating us right\nWhen we feel defensive or angry\nWhen others are angry with us\n\nNow you tell me how Often you get anywhere saying to someone \"I think that you need to play safer by farming closer to tower\" gets you anywhere. Next thing you know, 0/7.  Problem is that  people either lack the skill or ability to listen and no matter how nicely you ask, they dont have to listen. People can beg, grovel and plead with people, demean themselves so that this guy will listen, give him the lane he wants and then he still does whatever he wants. All that is left then is a seething rage for this person, what gets done about that?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-13T13:27:17.799+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright, I think I get what the objective of the post was now XD It was just a little confusing for me because many things were mentioned (high school clubs, mute button, dodging etc.)\n\n__*\n\nAnyway, here's my answer to your main question:\n\n_What is Riot doing to protect me from gameplay toxicity (e.g. intentional feeding)?_\n\n+ To be completely honest, protection from intentional feeding or a team-mate who ignores everyone else, is almost impossible. I said before it was \"one of the behaviour system's greatest flaws\", and one which really can't be fixed.\n\n Certain behaviours (like intentional feeding) can be punished to try and prevent them from happening again. But little can be done to protect you while the behaviour is actually occurring. \n\nOn the surface the solution seems simple. Let me leave the game. In reality this is actually very hard to implement. \n\nHere's some very common solutions I see thrown around:\n\n+ **Let me leave whenever I want.**\n\n  This is great, but when you leave a match, the game essentially over for everyone else too. The problem is, gameplay toxicity is often subjective and not everyone will agree with you leaving the game, but they'll have to deal with your decision anyway.\n\n There's also big questions with abuse and how something like this works in ranked.\n\n\n+ **Make a system to allow us to leave when it detects intentional feeding in a match.**\n\n Well we do have a system for automatically detecting intentional feeding. Sadly it takes around 15 minutes for it to detect the behaviour. If you have an intentional feeder, most matches will be over by 15 - 20 minutes.\n\n We can't really detect with human driven systems either. A player moderated detection system (like CS:GO's Overwatch system) can take days in many cases. Riot could employ a team specifically for a system like this, but it would be massively costly for a very small benefit. I think me and many other players would rather see those resources used somewhere else (finishing the Tribunal, better reports, cinematics etc.)\n\nAnd that's just the intentional feeding side of things. How can a system detect _\"Team telling you to do something youre already doing\"_?\n\nI know it's not the answer you probably wanted, but it's honestly close to impossible to give players a way remove themselves for a toxic gameplay situation, while not affecting everyone else in the match as well.\n\nThat said, Riot is always working on ways to lessen this impact of  some of the things you considered to be triggers. Like their new [15 minute surrender](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/LOcMZp6Q-riot-werent-you-introducing-some-early-surrender-tech-not-remake?comment=0000) or the currently active /remake system.\n\nThere's also solutions you can do yourself. Playing with friends you know you are not toxic is probably the best way to prevent any bad experiences.\n\n__*\nSince you mentioned it, the reason why I didn't address your \"trigger behaviours\", is because I'm pretty sure most players would disagree with almost all your list (and was running out of time :D). It might be triggering specifically to you and that's fine, but I don't think it's relevant to most other people.\n\nA lot of the things you mentioned aren't even remotely bannable and definitely shouldn't be considered something you need to be \"protected\" from. \n\nHere's a few that stood out:\n\n+ _\"Team not using openings to claim objectives\"_\n\n This is just a bad team, or you're not taking the leading role. This isn't an aggravating behaviour, it's something you need to overcome if you want to rank up.\n\n\n+ _\"Having to solo carry, and rather than the team try and base their strategies around the guy who clearly knows what hes doing, they dont\"_\n\n Again this is pretty much part of League. Some games will be solely up to you to win. A good tip for games like this is to adapt to what you have, don't ask people to adapt to you. \n\n\n+ _\"Poor decision making when selecting team comps, and not playing to the teams strengths\"_\n \n Not everyone has a super deep champion pool. Some '1 trick pony' players only have 1 or 2 champions they can play. They're not trolling, they're trying their best to win. Not something I would ever consider you need protecting for.\n\nI also found some of the others a little bit pedantic IMO, like _\"Team telling you to do something youre already doing\"_. I personally don't really see how this is that annoying/triggering. I think most players find the \"?\" spam far far worse.","replies":[{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-13T22:15:24.526+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid reply there Tele :), Sorry about my first post, was mentally and physically exhausted = subpar post, but im hoping that this one will rectify that.\n\n> Not everyone has a super deep champion pool.

Riot havent sorted this out, yet still decide that banning players for getting tilted/ upset/ lashing out due to no faith in the system is the \"logical\" solution. And you're spot on, it IS one of the behavioural systems greatest flaws. However, you've also nailed it with these:\n\n>  To be completely honest, protection from intentional feeding or a team-mate who ignores everyone else, is almost impossible\n\nand\n\n> little can be done to protect you while the behaviour is actually occurring\n\nYep, everyone knows it. Hence why people have no/ little faith in the system. Yes, some people get verbally abusive, but this is more often than not after they feel theyve exhausted all other avenues available to them. I would really love to sit down and have a talk with Riots behavioural sciences team and see exactly how they feel permabanning players for verbally lashing out is helping. Its so counterintuitive its not even funny.\n\nThe game ITSELF tilts people, upsets people by definition. You play with 4 other people (if playing in a solo) who have varying skill levels, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I have so many games where im the only guy with kills, so i try and translate them to the team, yet people dont follow up pings, dont listen to me telling them to intiate when im ulting behind the enemy as panth, they make it like theyre going to go in, then they think \"oh hey! a minion!\" just as i land, completely out of position, so i get nuked (or better yet they go in after i beat enemy team low, and both die), enemy team in an already fed lane get shutdown gold, and now im thoroughly annoyed. \n\nBy Riots own admission, the guys in this lane have done nothing wrong, as them deciding to hit a few low health minions was a decision they made, and i should respect that. Or when i ping to gank, and come in from behind tribush on bot side, team falls back to tower, i get smashed being \"out of position\" then enemy team send \"???\" in all chat. People like this clearly lack the ability or observational skills to play league at a competitive level, and need to go and practice. Im supposed to be \"okay\" with people making poor decisions repeatedly, even after ive given them alternatives that they jsut dont listen to, then i get frustrated and lash out. Regards a few comments in your previous post\n\n> You're not thinking of the alternative here. If you don't dodge you'll loose 20 LP and MMR. If you're a bad player, then you should always dodge when you think your odds of winning are really low. Riot is correct that dodging is the best course of action.\n\nYep, i agree. HOWEVER, then dont give me 20-30 min wait timers for doing something that Riot SUGGEST i do. I dont even give a shit about -3lp that doesnt affect my mmr, but it WILL eventually get my account looked at for regular dodging. Ill be honest dude, 90% of the games i lose i KNOW im going to hate playing in at champ select, and i know the champ set up we have is going to fail, if I knew i wasnt going to have to wait 20-30 minutes before queuing id dodge more often. This isnt Riot protecting my emotional state from bad team comps, this is Riot FORCING me to play with it, knowing statistically im going to lose. Know what that does to a person? knowing that if their team doesnt win early theyre going to lose late game, then team loses early game, and you know youre ^%$#&^$& at like 8 - 9 minutes. \n\n> This is great, but when you leave a match, the game essentially over for everyone else too. The problem is, gameplay toxicity is often subjective and not everyone will agree with you leaving the game, but they'll have to deal with your decision anyway.\n> \n\nIf Riot want to segregate (which theyre already doing) between the people who can handle shitty situations, and the people that cant, then they're already making the worst possible decision anyway. As you said above \"Theyll just have to deal with your decision anyway\"\n\nLike playing AP shaco top, morde adc and \"duo adc\" bot coz \"I dont play support\" right? Unless youre FORCING me to dodge, in which case \"Ohai wait timer, how ya been?\". The game itself is toxic. Watch N3ac3ys video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UfO7qOHx5M) as to why HE thinks League is Toxic. I agree with everything the guy is saying.\n\nHere's a few that stood out:\n\n\"Team not using openings to claim objectives\"\n\n> This is just a bad team, or you're not taking the leading role. This isn't an aggravating behaviour, it's something you need to overcome if you want to rank up.\n\nTotally agree, it IS just a bad team, so how am i being protected from people like them?\n\n\"Having to solo carry, and rather than the team try and base their strategies around the guy who clearly knows what hes doing, they dont\"\n\n> Again this is pretty much part of League. Some games will be solely up to you to win. A good tip for games like this is to adapt to what you have, don't ask people to adapt to you.\n\nYet again same as above\n\n\"Poor decision making when selecting team comps, and not playing to the teams strengths\"\n\n> Not everyone has a super deep champion pool. Some '1 trick pony' players only have 1 or 2 champions they can play. They're not trolling, they're trying their best to win. Not something I would ever consider you need protecting for.\n\nPeople KNOW autofill exists, they can buy champs accordingly. And FYI when someone says at champ select \"I dont play this role\", first thing i do is jump on [www.lolskill.net](http://www.lolskill.net/) and check their match history and champion history. The guy i played with who played adc morde \"coz i dont play adcs\" had level 3 mastery in caitlyn and lower masteries in numerous other adc champs. This as as high as my second most played champ thats not Irelia. Just saying. \n\nregards\n\n> Since you mentioned it, the reason why I didn't address your \"trigger behaviours\", is because I'm pretty sure most players would disagree with almost all your list (and was running out of time :D). It might be triggering specifically to you and that's fine, but I don't think it's relevant to most other people.\n> \n> A lot of the things you mentioned aren't even remotely bannable and definitely shouldn't be considered something you need to be \"protected\" from.\n> \n\nI just copied and posted my list to friends on facebook that play, they all agree, this is 6 people in my immediate vicinity (out of 6). So yeah, sounds like its incredibly \"personal\" triggers to myself. If its triggering 100% of the people i play with, then its something that DEFINITELY needs looking at. People telling you to do something you are already doing makes you feel like an idiot, and while im sure that this stems from personal issues we all have about feeling undervalued, and like im incapable of observing what needs doing and doing it, then thats ALOT of people that do it.\n\nAnd finally \n\n>  also found some of the others a little bit pedantic IMO, like \"Team telling you to do something youre already doing\". I personally don't really see how this is that annoying/triggering. I think most players find the \"?\" spam far far worse.\n> \n\nYes, its annoying. Yes its pedantic, but thats WHY its annoying. And yes \"?\" is irritating, but so is the fact riot have given people \"champion mastery emotes\" that get spammed when you get killed. This is to show \"yeah, im better than you\". How is this not tilting?! Its LITERALLY an in game device that was designed for BMing.\n\nLooking forward to your reply Tele","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-14T00:48:50.830+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The key issue here is that, you seem to think lashing out because of someone intentionally feeding or trolling you is ok or justified. \n\n+ It pretty much all comes down to the old saying_\"two wrongs don't make a right\"_. \n\n Yeah sure, it would be nice if we had systems to \"protect\" people from intentional feeding. But even when these systems don't exist, you don't just get an automatic free pass on anything you say and do just because someone is feeding. Death threats, racist remarks and other general toxicity are not acceptable in any situation.\n\nDespite this Riot's system actually does [allow for occasional \"bad days\"](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/yFLxpAcV-qa-about-player-behavior-systems-chat-log-reviews-and-feedback?comment=005d0000). But if you consistently show that you can't control your emotions in-game, then Riot can't really continue to justify not punishing you for flaming, while others are getting punished for the same behaviour. \n\n **Everyone is held to the same standard. Riot is against all toxicity period. Not just 'toxicity when someone isn't feeding or trolling'. **\n\nAs a side note; I'm not sure if you've noticed but almost all the most toxic players think they're reacting justifiably. [Old Tyler1](https://youtu.be/MxHgnudnysw?t=30s) was a great example.\n___*\n\n> Watch N3ac3ys video here as to why HE thinks League is Toxic. I agree with everything the guy is saying.\n\nI'm also a big **N3ac3ys**, and his video was pretty accurate. That is absolutely one of the biggest reasons why toxicity is so prominent in League.\n\n+ _So what did Riot do to fix that?_ \n\nWell we talked about how allowing people to leave was a really difficult solution, so instead Riot made Dynamic Queue and allowed you to pick who to play with.\n\nAnd when it was released,  **N3ac3ys** came out in favour for it in [this video](https://youtu.be/-HR_dr8DAk8?t=3m9s). (I recommend watching the whole video, but the time stamp I linked is the main point on toxicity). \n\nObviously, Dynamic Queue had other flaws. But the Flex Queue that it got changed into, is pretty much the ideal team ranked experience for someone who really struggles with Solo Queue toxicity.\n\n__*\n\n> Totally agree, it IS just a bad team, so how am i being protected from people like them?\n\nI hope you're not being protected actually. Learning to excel with players who got counter picked or are tilted is definitely part of the challenges you have to overcome if you want to climb. \n\n> Like playing AP shaco top, morde adc and \"duo adc\" bot coz \"I dont play support\" right? \n\nI'm pretty sure those are legitimate picks aren't they? [Pink Ward](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmSfdtegCsyBe8qCnRu-ijw) got to masters on AP Shaco Top.\n\nI get what you're saying though, [I'm also strongly infavour](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/oxwehRkL-ranked-reporting-system?comment=0000) of some kind of dodge feature too.\n\n> I dont even give a shit about -3lp that doesnt affect my mmr, but it WILL eventually get my account looked at for regular dodging.\n\nWhere did you hear this? I've never heard any Rioter say regular dodging is looked into, and I definitely haven't heard about any extra punishments.

I have been bronze 5 since this game was released. { Yes b5 is trash blah blah and so on } But I feel I should be allowed to add my 2 cents in about things.\n\nSo in saying this. Riot doesn't seem to care about the players.\nHere on OCE You are lucky to get a red reply. \nIf you are on NA.. Like I was when I first started, if I made a post.

You can see what forums / Boards get more help.\n\nBut it isn't just only that also.\n\n\"trigger behaviours\"\n\nThis is a issue we all face. But riot has no idea nor willing to fix. \nSee I sign up to a coaching web site. [Link](https://www.leaguecoaching.gg/index.php) I got a coach to tell me what I have or haven't done.\n\nI asked for help with everything and anything. But yet I am still in B5. I learnt to farm 75 CS by ten mins. I finish the game with the highest CS most the time.\nThen I learnt how to split push. I learnt a heck of a lot from my coach. \nKey point to take away from this is I learnt FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. Riot has nothing in place to help anyone.\n\nI watched some video about riot claiming longer you wait.. The better the match. \nI call lies on this. I waited in queue for 10 mins.. Only to get someone fresh out of normal's on my B4 promos.\nWhich I am to understand this happens to a few people all the time.\n\nBut the system they have in place that matches people with people is broken. I am not being matched with adc's that can do 75 cs on avg per game.\nI am not being matched with people that know I am split pushing. \nSo to me.. I leave the game after a point in time. Because I become to toxic to even play this game. I want to climb the leader. I want to play vsing better people then my self. \n\nBut the system doesn't seem to take this into account. ( Please no Bronze is trash crap and silver is the same as bronze. }\nTo me as a player. Riot doesn't care if you go or down a ladder as long as you just pay cash at the end of the day.\n\nI understand Riot is a company. Blah blah blah. But I am asking for a reason ( which I have asked many times before and just got told I sucked. ) why is the system so wrong.\nYou see. Another company which I wont say made a game. This game had a ranking system. In this game I was placed into Bronze. \nSo I worked my way up the leader board. Became number 1 in that tier.\n\nThe issue is. When I was up for placements to go from Bronze to silver. I would be put with bronze player ranked 50. \nThen I would face silver 40 and silver 30.\nI would lose because of time management from the bronze ranked 40.\n\nNo promo for me.\n\nI went out and got another account. I did my placements and got gold. Once I emailed the company about this. I was told they were working on it and so on.\nAfter 3 seasons this issue would still be there. So I left.\n\nSame thing is happening here. I make it from B5 to B4 then B4 promos... I get someone on my team from B5 0 points. vsing someone B3 60 points.\nOf cause the B5 with 0 points feeds and we lose.\n\nSo what is being done about this. People are just getting put in anywhere and everywhere just to get a game.\nThis to me is the biggest trigger for me.\n\nClimbing to B4 promos. Just to lose endlessly until I hit B5 0 again.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-16T14:19:14.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm, it's a little bit off topic and matchmaking isn't my strong point, but I'll try give you some of my thoughts at least :D\n\n__*\n\n> If you are on NA..

I can't say I've been a fan of the lower amount of active Rioters on OCE boards. \n\nBut I don't agree with your assumption that this difference is because they don't _\"care about the players\"_. There's no reasonable reason why NA Rioters would care more than OCE Rioters.\n\nI think most likely it's for these two reasons:\n\n\n+ NA just has more Rioters per player, since they handle local NA stuff and all the international things (skin development, balance, software engineering etc.).\n\n So obviously, if you have more Rioters per player, there's a better chance that one of them posts on the boards.\n\n\n+ NA also has more experienced Rioters who are qualified to answer more questions. Like [**Riot Tantram**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/NA/Riot%20Tantram), who built many of the player behaviour systems we use now.\n\n I can't really expect **Riot Gehirn** to answer many of the questions that **Riot Tantram** is able to tackle.\n\nThat said more Riot involvement would be nice.

Why I added in my comment's was because of the  \"trigger behaviors \" \n\nWhen ever I point out that players that are not on the same skill level as as other players everyone goes to the good old \" Elo hell \"\n\n\nDo I think I am in elo hell personally. No. \nAs I said I found a coach and he has helped me so much with the understanding of things. Like this one game.\nWe were in our base camped for like 30 mins. All we did was farm and defend our base.\nAs my coach said to me. Most people in lower tiers just go with the flow. You have to be the one that is directing the flow.\n\nSo I did. We farmed. We defended the base. Then we won. \nTo me this was a great game.\n\nBut in saying this. I cannot hep but see a issue with the match making system. People that are fresh out of normal's shouldn't be placed with people that are on promos.\n\nPeople on promos should be placed with people that are on promos too or higher up the tier ladder. E.g Bronze 5 70+ LP.\nThis would help reduce the amount of triggers for players. \nmost players I come across that are toxic.. They have just loss 10+ games in a row. \nOnce again. This shows me a issue with the match making system.\n\nSomeone shouldn't lose 10+ in a row. If riot just took the time to try and make someone lose say 6 times in a row then let them win 3 in a row.\nMaybe then they won't be as triggered as hard.\n\nI am just a player of the game and I am sure by now riot knows the magic number for triggers or not. The basic evidence is there if you follow the reporting of a player vs losing rate of that player.\nDon't get me wrong I know some people are always going to be the rule breaker but even then after 7 seasons the evidence should still be there.\n\n**Flex queue**\n\n\nWhen I first came back to this game after almost 14+ months { Only because I saw my partner playing the game } I saw this flex queue.\nI Thought that riot has finally learnt that people need to play people better to get better. Because you are only as good as the people you face.\n\nThen I saw flex is more of 4 man teams rolfstomping randoms. Why is it always the same thing when it comes to riot. Permades vs randoms.\n\nI would be placed with plats / gold vsing other plats and golds. It was great. { Hell at first. Top TP gank.. Damn I fell for it every time } But once I got placed.. I was vs'ing bronze again.\n\nOnce again riot has nothing in place to help people climb or learn.\nI made a post back in s3 or 4 asking for a gold or silver player to come own me for 1 game a day. \nI found a gold and silver player that was willing to help me.\n\nBecause I wanted to know how to beat silver and gold players. Then I can own harder in my game.\nI went from every game feeding endlessly under tower. To last hitting under tower.\nTo finally get first tower. With a high CS. owning my lane.\n\nWhy doesn't riot have anything like this in place. a queue for lower and higher elo's to play together.\nSomething for people to learn from.\n\nBecause if we think for a second about elo hell.. What are they really saying?\n\nMy team sucks = I have no idea on how to help them.\n\n2. I climb just to fall = I get triggered because I cannot do anything to help them, so I feel as thou Riot is out to get me.\n\n3. I cannot carry = I have no idea on how to end a match.. I just hope we ace them.\n\n4. I got trolls = They kept on feeding that lane. I should have TP'ed down when the jungle ganked. Maybe I should tell middle and jungle to gank bot together and push the tower.\n\nPeople have noway to learn this stuff without someone pointing it out for them. Flex to me at the start was a great way of learning new things.\nBut Riot just doesn't seem to take post like mine seriously because the mind set that has been dominated across the boards is if you are not diamond and above. \n\nYou suck and learn to play.\n\nLike when I said I main support and the matching system is broken for support and made a post showing it and all that. \nI got told the system is fine. I just suck.\nInstead of going \" Maybe there is a issue because this guy won vs gold players with a 5.01 KDA. \" \n\nBut once again. I am only a bronze player. I am only 1 of the 51.33% of people in that tier. \nI understand that B1 is very different from B5. I understand that the learning curve is high.\n\nBut Riot really needs to add in a system that allows lower tiers to learn.\nThis doesn't only work for bronze, But golds vs diamonds.

You would need 9 High elo players for each low elo player, a 9:1 ratio. Considering Silver and Bronze make up over [80% of the population](http://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/rank-distribution) this is unachievable.

What do Riot have in place to enforce people \"training\" themselves?  \n\nSecondly, anythings possible if you actual want to put enough thought, time and effort into it.\n\nFor example, learning queue. Like Worrior697 proposed,  do away with matching system in normals altogether. Make it incentivised, so that people who play \"x\" games in \"learning queue\" , or provide \"xs\" amount of feedback to players or introduce a mentor system, where you get rewards based on divisions your \"student\" goes up. Youd probably need to make it so both accounts had to be online before youd gain mentor points. Have exclusive content for mentors and teachers. Would encourage people to join the queue, plus would allow \"less good\" players to see what theyre up against playing against and with higher elos. \n\n\n> With a change like that, you'll also just reduce the population of players the system can choose from.

And my logic is like doing an apprenticeship. Even when you do an apprenticeship, why do they still have \"hands on\" modules? Because educational institutions everywhere understand that theory is nice, but actual practical hands on experience is just as important. Hence, why having no restrictions on matchmaking would be the best possible scenario. The game post game should then show everyones rankings (obtainable through lolnexus, or lolskill by conscious decision while playing a game). This information would allow you post game to determine where your current skill level is, lets say you get roflstomped by a challenger, so you know youre not challenger, but are currently ranked bronze and beat a gold, that would tell you in optimal conditions your maximum skill level (or team carrying you lol). \n> \n> If you just want to see how a high elo player abuses silver mistakes there's great Unranked to Diamond series for that already.\n\nSee: previous comment.

Not only do you see everything from the Challenger player's perspective, but also the player is doing in-depth explanations about why he's making certain decisions.\n\n [Foxdrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQqpJz0Axi0) even went as far as getting an Eye Tracker so you can see exactly where he's looking.\n\n\n\n+ However, when you're in-game with a high elo player you're a bit more detached IMO (even when you lane against one).

I just dont think Riot have any idea what theyre doing anymore regards curbing player toxicity. \n\nRiot are giving people a certain time frame to change their outlook and be \"better people\". These are people who have probably had certain issues that theyve been unable to sort out for 15-20 years of their lives, and Riot expect them to change them over the period of like a few months. Pretty unreasonable if you ask me. Also the \"forcing\" players to change, on Riots terms. Forcing someone to do anything loses its meaning when compared to doing stuff of their own free will. \n\nI constantly hear from a certain friend of mine \"Once you make a decision to change your outlook, itll mean you have a more fulfilling life, in AND out of game\". \n\nHe's not wrong.\nBut the problem comes with Riots approach to alot of things, theyve made a decision about stuff they want people to change. \"Dont be toxic\" and given no other alternative besides \"Dont be toxic\". Riot arent giving players any options, and arent actually putting much thought into it, but expecting people to change for the better. If it was the case, then noone would ever end up in prison, and anyone who came outta prison would reform and never commit crimes again.\n\nWhich brings us back to the way people learn, i dont know about you, but i find me watching a video, i can see everything sure, but it removes that personal quality to me. For example \"That poor guy, getting camped, i know that feeling\" when watching a video, as opposed to \"FML IM GETTING CAMPED, I F&^%&%^NG HATE THIS GAME!!\". Watching and doing elicit different emotions from players, its a matter of working out what works better for you, something i doubt Riot have put alot of thought into. \n\n> The mentor system and the sandbox mode that we were promised must be prioritised first.\n\nTotally agree, however they also need a complete overhaul of their disciplinary system as that shits broken ( and NOT in the plz nerf kinda broken). Maybe 5-10% of all toxic players are toxic because they want to \"Just watch the world burn\", the other 95-90% of toxic players continue to be toxic due to lack of knowledge on how to change, and a lack of an in game support network for these people. Think about it like an \"alcoholics anonymous meeting\". Do people go to one meeting and all of a sudden theyre cured of being an alcoholic? No, of course not. Its a constant process, sometimes taking years and years.

Alright, lets start off with a bit of fun reading.\n\n> \"**Everyone is held to the same standard. Riot is against all toxicity period. Not just 'toxicity when someone isn't feeding or trolling**'.\n\nInteresting point you make. Lets address this first shall we?. \n\nFirst off  lets look at the definition of \"harm\" from a legal perspective. \n\nThe law describes harm as “**serious emotional distress**”.\"\nSo now we can safely assume that \"toxicity\" is by association, \"anything that causes someone serious emotional distress\".\n\nSo yes, me raging at someone, me being verbally abusive, is most definitely causing \"serious emotional distress\".\n\nKnow what else causes serious emotional distress?\n\nEasy wins that get thrown because teams have no idea how to focus objectives, you plead and beg for them to do baron or elder while enemy team are down to prevent enemy team getting them and using them to push with. Team focusses on pushing waves that are already past mid, enemy team respawn 30 seconds later, take elder and baron and win. The objectives that wouldnt have been there if your team listened. Someone whos getting smashed due to being counterpicked in lane, and not farming under tower and waiting for assistance from the team and continue to push into the enemy and continue feeding him. Someone picking a pick they \"wanted to play\" as opposed to a pick for the greater good for the team (shaco support, an adc support that takes all the cs from the \"actual\" adc. as opposed to playing in a support capacity, among others). These are all things that cause people in those games \"serious emotional distress (harm)\". So in answer to \n> Everyone is held to the same standard. Riot is against all toxicity period\n\nAre you sure about that Tele?.\n\n> I hope you're not being protected actually. Learning to excel with players who got counter picked or are tilted is definitely part of the challenges you have to overcome if you want to climb.\n\n\"Learning to excel with players who are counterpicked or are tilted\". Yep, learning to excel with that would be amazing. However, while youre \"trying to carry\" or \"learning to excel\", this persons frustrated and shitty, probably just due to inexperience. Can you tell me, Tele, how to give this person more experience while im in game with them? Im not saying im the best player in the world, but certain things i can pick up on better than other people. Whether we stand any hope in hell of winning a teamfight, when its better to push or group, sneaking objectives, little things like that. Think i get listened to? let me help you with the answer to that. No.\n\n> I'm pretty sure those are legitimate picks aren't they? Pink Ward got to masters on AP Shaco Top.\n> \n> I get what you're saying though, I'm also strongly infavour of some kind of dodge feature too.\n\nForgot the memo where the people in my silver/ bronze team were \"master tier shacos\" :P. And yes, they ARE legitimate picks, but when its into a jinx + leona and you have a nami + mordekaiser. Suffice to say jinx snowballed. The Mordekaiser who \"I got autofilled into adc and dont know how to adc\" actually had like lvl 3 mastery in caitlyn, draven, ezreal and other adcs. I know this because i checked on lolskill.net. So yes theres a difference between \"legitimate\" and \"have a decent chance of succeeding\".\n\nIm glad we can both agree on the dodge feature though, i was getting the villagers and pitchforks ready lol.\n\n> \"Where did you hear this? I've never heard any Rioter say regular dodging is looked into, and I definitely haven't heard about any extra punishments. .\"\n\nIm pretty confident it would get looked into eventually, as doesnt \"dodging\" fall under the same category as \"failure to accept\" or \"afking\". I could be wrong of course, but regardless, if you have a few trolls in champ select, you now have a 30 min wait timer. Seems a bit unfair.\n\n> As long as you dodge for legitimate reasons each game you'd be fine, even if they did investigate your account\n\nYou dont get to justify the reason you dodged, you just dodge, doesnt come up with anything that allows you to type \"i dodged because of singed support\" or \"fizz adc\" or \"just because this guy was a general asshole in champ select and i could tell he wasnt going to work with the team\". So theres no way for you to \"explain\" how legitimate your dodging was.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RUSTYtheCASTER","date":"2016-12-13T23:39:21.893+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can I just say without interrupting _(too late)_ that this is a beautiful conversation.

I agree with your outlook towards the game, although I do differ a bit on some of the finer points.\n\nHowever, it was after coming to the forums yesterday to post my own player behaviour frustrations, seeing your reply and going through some old support tickets of mine that I'm still left questioning one thing: why haven't they done away with chat altogether?\n\nAs a tiny bit of backstory, 2 years ago when OCE was fresh and I'd made the switch the community was rife with toxicity. The server didn't have a tribunal and was operating under some pretty old behaviour policing methods that, as far as I understand, were completely impotent without that tribunal system. So beyond using end-game reports I started some pretty detailed and long-winded support tickets, detailing specific players, their behaviours and also why this was unacceptable and where the cracks were with the behaviour policing structure as a whole.\n\nWhat came out of it was a couple of replies that were disappointingly stock-standard template bullshit and a couple of decent back and forths, which for a cynic would have read like big promises for future behaviour implementations, but nothing concrete or useful to go on. For a hopeful person would have read like Riot had different ideas in the pipeline. But ultimately what really stood out for me was the focus on chat, just as you pointed out Donnie. That had me asking them the question, why have chat in the first place? Why not implement a smarter more advanced ping system and have some rudimentary chat commands like \"go to dragon\", \"go to baron\", \"defend mid\" etc. which would avoid all this unnecessary in-game typing in the first place? \n\nYou have to keep in mind that these tickets were before they'd even introduced smart pings, but even with the advancements in pings and other communications I think the point is still completely relevant today. If the majority of negative behaviour seems to stem from or revolve around chat (as Riot and their support team lead me to believe), then this is essentially admitting that chat has some serious flaws. As far as I'm concerned it's a matter of reworking chat in such a way that you can still _communicate effectively in game_ for things _relevant to the game_, rather than, for example, pointing out how many times you've raped my mum.","replies":[{"poster":"JustDonnie","date":"2016-12-13T05:20:37.020+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Spot on good sir, lets try this. By Riots standards, Toxic players are bad, and deserve to be banned, not toxic players are good, and dont get banned. Black and white. Lets put it into a real life scenario. Good people dont go to prison, bad people go to prison. So by this logic everyone out of prison is a good person, everyone in prison is a bad person. What about smart criminals? criminals who work the system to stay out of prison at best getting a fine, what about people who kill someone due to that person threatening to kill their family?. What about people who murder people and have a mental illness who escape prison by \"reforming\" in a mental asylum?. Truth is life in general is multifaceted, there are always shades of grey. Riot are trying to categorize gamers into two categories, and there are far more than two categories. In an ideal world games would all be close and we would all come to the wire every game, which would show that we're with people of an equal skill level all the time. How often does it happen that one person (or two people) are directly responsible for a loss, that you win your lane, and they feed a lane so hard theyre unkillable (either intentionally or due to lack of skill). Punishments dont fit the crime. Players found guilty of intentionally feeding get a 2 week ban, then perma'd. But this is assume they say \"im inting\" in chat, otherwise Riot have to attempt to detect it. All it takes is one person to ruin a game for 4 other people. Who then are expected to \"bottle\" their frustration. A little bit of backstory myself good sir. We were in champ select, id lolskill.net'ted my team, and seen that our teammate whod locked yi was excessively bad at him. Then said \"Hey man, dont go yi, its a bad idea into their team comp\". He still goes Yi, then proceeds to go 1/11. Had told yi to farm until 6, that his post 6 ganks were bad. I picked pantheon into nasus to deny him cs, was 4/1 until lb ganked from mid, had killed nasus solo twice, and killed him and xin when xin ganked. Then tried to take my advantage to the rest of the map to help every other lane (and jg) that was losing. By the time i got BACK to my lane, nasus had a 3 level advantage and had stacks on stacks. Suffice to say i got nuked. at 15 minutes i finally finished a yohmuus and had tabi. Now, id asked this person not to select this champ at champ select, and they had picked them. This isnt reportable, as people can go whoever they want, but this doesnt detract from MY pain this person caused. Riot seem to believe that just stopping people being toxic isnt enough, that these people will then move onto other forms of toxicity. Sure, they might, in which case theyd get banned for it. I havent intentionally fed, ive had games where ive done excessively poorly against a counter, or constant harassing in lane.But ive always made the best of it. I could be wrong good sir, but am i right in translating this to mean \"If its a chat related crime, give them a chat related punishment?\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2016-12-18T23:21:14.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't have an specifics really to add but I would like to point out that a lot of the issues your facing are not league and riot specific. Could they be dealing better with them, possibly but most online games have similar problems. They just tend to be exasperated by the fact league is a 5v5 team game and your required to lean heavily on your team mates. \n\nAll online games have some form of toxicity and greifers. It tends to get worse in free to play format games where it costs nothing to create accounts. A lot of these have less problems than league but that's because of the circumstances in that game. \n\nI'll give you an example. Take world of warships (this could happen in any of the world of games or warthunder) say I'm sailing along in my nice shiny battleship and one of my team mates torpedoes and kills me (happens more often than you'd think. Turns out trusting most people with torpedoes is a bad idea). Now depending on the circumstances I'm anywhere beyond annoyed and full on swearing at my computer tilted. However now that I'm dead I can leave that game and start a new one. Sure I'm still annoyed but a couple of games later you usually forget about it. \n\nNow obviously you can't get directly team killed in league but the example still stands. The main difference is the amount of time you have to spend with the person who is trolling/toxic. The minimum time you spend in a normal game is 20 mins assuming one party surrenders. \n\nSo just remember it's no just league that has these problems. \n\nAs an aside, while I agree riot needs to take steps to help reduce some of those behaviours, it's not all on them.

THE ISSUE IS WITH MMR AND ELO.\nPeople that think this game doesn't have elo anymore are just kidding themselves.\nElo is still there and when you match someone say 5 elo with the closest elo they can get which is 0. \nPeople are always going to rage after a set amount of time.\n\nBut Riot plays the [adam west game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgHUGtlvwrY) they wont say anything about the MMR SYSTEM.\nBecause of the simple fact.\n\nWhen they did this round table crap...
