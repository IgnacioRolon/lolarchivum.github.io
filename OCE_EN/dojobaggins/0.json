Hate speech? Not so much.&quot; which is what i thought it was.\r\nso throughout the game i said report the camille and explained why... and yet i get chat restricted and go from honor 3 to honor 1. i dont really think i deserved a chat game restriction for this, ill include an explanation for some context\r\nGame 1\r\nDojoBaggins: well if you want have a chance to win the game (camille said she wont leashe)\r\nDojoBaggins: youll leashe(me saying she should leashe)\r\nDojoBaggins: just dont be a shit %%%%(our mid lane said jokingly ff15 i believe, so jokingly said this to him he was a nice person, he didnt say it in a toxic i give up way)\r\nDojoBaggins: dont know him(ryze asked if me and camille were premade)\r\nDojoBaggins: just toxic (i dont know him (camille) just toxic)\r\nDojoBaggins: yeah man jsut report camille and ff15 XD (didnt leashe)\r\nDojoBaggins: also can you report camille, toxic af (all chat)\r\nDojoBaggins: so camille just runs away when i go to gank (all chat)\r\nDojoBaggins: shes so toxic cause iw ent jhin jgl (someone asked why shes toxic, my reply)\r\nDojoBaggins: now camille is trolling (all chat) \r\nDojoBaggins: and inting (she just inted)\r\nDojoBaggins: shes jsut trolling dude calm down XD (someone on my team was like wtf camille etc)\r\nDojoBaggins: can you poke?

Eesh, behavior like that definitely isn't okay, I'm really sorry you had to deal with that. I'll take a look at this for you and make sure they're dealt with. I won't be able to share any info about what happens due to our stance on privacy, but I really do appreciate you taking the time to write in to us and report the behavior.\n\nAs for your penalty though I am seeing a bit of negativity here, a lot of your chat here is unnecessary and not constructive to the game. It only takes a single report for the system to flag a game, so calling for reports can be seen as a bit of harassment, I'd really just recommend ignoring or possibly muting the player and reporting them after the game. If they're being negative, they'll be penalized, there isn't much point in engaging with them. Continuing to just go on and on just really isn't necessary here. A 10-Game chat restriction is our lightest penalty and just meant to warn a summoner that they exhibited negativity in a recent game, so I know the behavior may not seem severe but we're just trying to nudge you in the right direction.\n\nIf you have any other questions I can help you out with please let me know, thank you.\n\n*************\nRiot Games Player Support","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-05-30T07:23:19.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"season ends in November (if its anything like previous seasons)\n\nso you have 5 months to get 6 checkpoints, based on your 1-2 months, i severely doubt you'll get back to honor 3 by then","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-05-29T23:50:22.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good luck climbing back to honor 3 before season end, honor takes way too long to grind up now","replies":[{"poster":"DojoBaggins","date":"2018-05-29T23:58:28.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i had a look at my honor, ive got 3 checkpoints to level 2. then 3 more checkpoints to get to level 3. it takes me like 1-2 months to get 1 checkpoint XD","replies":[]}]}]}
