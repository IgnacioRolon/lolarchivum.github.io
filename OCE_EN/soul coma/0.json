A fun thing to do is create a long list of bots (30+ names) and send it along as a support ticket to Riot. As there isn't really a category for this, you could probably just file it under \"general enquiry\"._ Only do it if you have a substantial list of names otherwise it just gets spammy. _\n\nI know from experience that bots are worse in pre-30 arams, as well as intermediate bot games. You can play a custom game vs intermediate bots or stick to beginner bots if it is annoying you too much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-02-12T22:53:28.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Report them.","replies":[]}]}
