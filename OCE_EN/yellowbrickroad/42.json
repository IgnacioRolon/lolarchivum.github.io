It's almost as if flex queue allows you to decide your teammates in a ranked situation! You can hand pick the people you want in your team, people that won't troll/dc/be toxin. \n\n_______\n**THE CHOICE IS IN YOUR HANDS**\n_______\nEither you can use this, learn to play as a _team_ and end up climbing, because you will no longer be \"anchored by your boosted trash teammates\"\n\n_or_  you can continue on your solo path, ignoring this quick and easy solution, complaining about players who are having bad games / trying to improve themselves in a competitive environment (even though they should have practiced in norms more).","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-16T02:12:43.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You assume i know anyone who isnt trash.\n\ni have maybe 1 to 2 people on my friendslist that i added because i thought they were good, the rest either added me because they thought i was good or are irl friends which all happen to be high silver low gold, and considering my stance on smurfs and mates boosting mates im not adding my irl friends to a game anytime soon.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about being in an elo where people cant tie their own shoes let alone carry their own weight, its once in a bloody blue moon that you meet someone worth actually queuing with.\n\nLike shit half the reason ive even managed to get this close to a 50% overall winrate this season all ready is since akali got gutted ive gone back to playing singed, so every game i just mute everyone settle in for a #feedtowin tower pushing session, and if my team has more than 2 brain cells they know that when ive got the entire enemy team chasing me around with the benny hills theme playing on my youtube, they push the fucking bot tower, we win, if they are dumb as nails and sit under their tower while their lanes empty, we lose.\n\nmy winrate goes up, when i dont cooperate.\n\nThats how bad this elo is, cooperating with them, lowers your winrate becuase their good ideas and common sense, are non existant, the number of fucking times i have seen this elo call baron while the entire enemy team is alive and we arent even in a position to push with baron is so large it feels like it happens every second game, and ofc anyone that goes to help that call dies, despite me telling them not to fucking go there.\n\nAnd you want to know why? its because this elo cares more about their kda, than strategy, they wouldnt know how to push an objective, if the objective was weak as shit and presenting itself to them with a giant sign saying \"push me\"\n\nWhich brings me back to the player i mentioned in op.\n\nThey werent bad mechanically, i mean they were bad mechanically but i dont give a shit if you are bad mechanically, this isnt a mechanical game, mechanics are just a means to an end.\n\nThis is a macro game a a strategy game, a game where if you dont have the common sense to say \"im 0/11/1 the enemy jungle isnt warded and i just saw singed draw the two most fed people on their team to one central location, i better not go near that area\" then you shouldnt be playing ranked, further more if you are dumb enough to not only go to that area that i drew their biggest and badest to so they ARENT near you, and blind ult 3 miles away from where they actually are? this shows that they lack the cognitive function to predict player movements, which ironically is not fucking hard, timing it? sure, but just knowing which direction they were going the last time you saw them? thats like something you get tested for at 2 years for the iq test.\n\nThats spatial awareness.\n\nFor this reason i cant fucking wait for 3v3, because that means i can go back to playing mechanical champs, instead of idiot proof champs like singed.\n\nidiot proof, because even if i get idiots for teammates i still have a chance of winning, not a large chance, but a chance.\n\nBut recap no the choice is not in my hands.\n\nThe choice is in other peoples hands.\n\ni dont choose to have a 5man premade and magically 4 other equally skilled players poof out of nowhere into my queue, i wish it worked like that, because if my experience in season 5 is proof of anything back when the game was solo i had an 80% winrate, i mean i was still held back by a team because it wasnt 1v1, but 80%\n\nAnd itd be alot higher too if i had a better skill base to draw on for players in this elo.\n\nInfact if you introduced wood 5 and let the worst of the worse sink even fucking lower so i dont have to play with them anymore maybe MAYBE id meet someone worth queueing with that doesnt live in the middle of fucking no where, or is constantly stoned or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-16T11:28:20.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> i have maybe 1 to 2 people on my friendslist that i added because i thought they were good, the rest either added me because they thought i was good or are irl friends which all happen to be high silver low gold, and considering my stance on smurfs and mates boosting mates im not adding my irl friends to a game anytime soon.\n\nCreate an appeal in the [team recruitment section](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/team-recruitment). You could even hold trials to make sure you get people that play consistently. You will never be short of low bronze players that want to improve and are actually good enough to do so. \n\nI climbed out of low bronze myself, but that was S4 and it was way different back then. Even more emphasis is placed on objectives, as well as the fact that it is harder for 1 person to snowball out of control and carry (still possible, but requires more team effort than it did). Getting a consistent team together will be one of the best things you can do to help yourself. You can then pick the best one to carry over to duo queue when it is released. \n\n\n> This is a macro game a a strategy game, a game where if you dont have the common sense to say \"im 0/11/1 the enemy jungle isnt warded and i just saw singed draw the two most fed people on their team to one central location, i better not go near that area\" ...  thats like something you get tested for at 2 years for the iq test.\n\nThat kind of stuff happens at every single rank. It happens when people aren't on the same page. It happens when people miscalculate risk/reward.\n\n A couple of weeks ago I was in a ranked game where we were completely stomping the enemy team. Eventually, we starting derping and fell behind. In a desperate attempt to get back into it, our jungle made a baron call no less than 3 times, and on each occasion, we ended up aced. Even though myself and my dup partner new baron was too risky, we still did it anyway. We lost that game because we didn't learn from our mistakes. This was high plat/ low-mid diamond.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-18T00:08:56.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im aware that kind of stuff happens at every rank.\n\nBut its the frequency of it happening that is the issue.\n\nin diamond id assume you get a situation like that once every 10 maybe 20 games.\n\nThats every second game for me.\n\nDo you see the difference there 1000% more of my games have some dimwitted idiot in it.\n\nAnd when its on the enemy team it doesnt even matter, because my teams still the same elo, so i can guarantee you, unless i am personally laning against the enemy dimwit no one will take advantage of him/her.\n\nLike i know elo hell gets thrown around alot, but when my teams fuck up so often that i actually expect and have to plan for all 4 of my team feeding and not pushing lanes, and the sheer idea of even one person holding their and carrying their own weight is nigh crazy talk.\n\nSomethings fucking wrong.\n\nLike the players down here are so fucking bad that winning is actually a coin toss.\n\nIts not even skill its a fucking coin toss, do i get bad team mates or not? toss a coin.\n\nok i got \"good\" teammates, toss another coin to see if they are lagging.\n\nOk they arent lagging toss another coin to see if they are unreasonable and tilt\n\nalright they arent like that toss another coin to see if the reason they are bronze is because while they are mechanically \"good\" they have literally no idea that this isnt call of duty and only care about having a good kda\n\nWelp we lose because 90% of this elo thinks kda is important (or atleast more important than lane pressure) and im not fucking good enough to 1v9\n\ngive me two people who are average at best, 1 afk and 1 mild feeder\n\nI will carry that game.\n\nBut to do it i need those 2 mildly average people who will just do what they are fucking told (aka push their fucking lanes) and wont randomly try to tower dive someone with a 3 kill advantage on them.\n\nbasically to win games i dont need good players, i just need to not have bad players. which is a subtle difference, but an important one.\n\nLike shit take season 5 where on my main account i was messing around in customs with some mates.\n\nour team comp consisted of me top as singed vs a challenger a hecarim\n\nour mid was gold vs a diamond\n\nthe rest of our team was silver and they had a plat and one bronze\n\nNot only did i beat the challenger (though to be fair itd been awhile since he had vs'd a singed and at the time i had the 3rd 4th and 5th most played singed games on lolskill.net on my alt accounts) we won the game.\n\nGranted challenger was clearly fucking around, but hes still challenger, logic dictates a challenger player fucking around should still beat a bronze 5 player tryharding, yet i still won, do i think im challenger worthy because of that? nah i only won because i abused a singed mechanic that he wasnt aware of (e can be precast so even if you cc as long as the cast animation starts it will finish) to forcibly disengage him every time he e'd or ulted onto me then just ignored him and farmed,  do i think im supposed to be in an elo where the players are so bad i literally get headaches from trying to play with them (literally i pop pain killers just to play this game they are that bad) fuck no.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-16T22:13:33.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're funny :D\n\nI know you don't mean it to be taken that way, and I don't mean to offend you, but when I read what you wrote I was imagining you on youtube, like one of those comedians ranting about something serious but in such a way it had you pissing your pants with laughter because it's dead set truth and resonates lol especially that last paragraph >.< preaching to the choir mate!!\nI wish they had a Hi5 sticker, but here, have a peace-out from Jinx instead haha\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-17T09:46:15.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey stop picking on low elo players for playing bad.\n\nYes we suck, but if you have low elo players in your games, that's an issue with flex queue or someone being on tilt or your elo being low enough to match you with them.\n\nYou can't really blame someone for being inherently bad, because I, as many others have tried to improve but to no avail.
