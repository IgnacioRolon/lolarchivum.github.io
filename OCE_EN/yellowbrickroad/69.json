Most of the time a Malphite sits quite neutrally, just in front of his team, but quite often when he thinks he can hit an ultimate, he will move forward in a straight line towards his target.\n\nThe best way to learn how he ults is to **play** him!

He does a lot of magic damage from his Ultimate, Q and E. Having some magic resist in your build,  for example a {{item:3211}} Spectre's Cowl will mean he shouldn't be able to poke you due to the health regen gained, along with not being able to get bursted from full due to bonus MR and HP. Communicate to your jungler how easy it could be to bait him in and then turn it with a 2v1 after he engages. Malphite has no escapes without his ultimate, so try to communicate this with your team and ask for help!\n\nI've also just noticed that you're picking very squishy ranged AD top's and also not building any defensive items in any of your builds on champs such as Cho'Gath. Try to avoid picking an Attack damage based carry against Malphite, as these specifically are who his kit is built to counter. (Hexdrinker would work better on these champs than Spectre's Cowl, but if you CAN avoid picking these champs into Malphite I'd recommend it.)\n\nLastly, if you're frustrated when playing against Malphite with your champion pool for ranked, ask for a ban on him nicely.

The price of 2 spectres cowls. \nNow even missing 30% of those cs would bring you to the 1734 gold mark.\nSpectres Cowl + Boots + 2 pots = 1500 gold\n\nPersonally I wouldnt necessarily say Spectre's is _the most_ ideal item against him. On bruisers like Poppy you can go for a {{item:3751}} which can help your trading and keeping his shield off without needing to use a spell or auto him. \n\nIf you say you are struggling against the Dorans start Malphite, consider the fact he will have less sustain than most tops, and can only use his q as poke. If you buy {{item:1054}}  or {{item:2033}} you will have more HP sustain. If you are able to trade effectively early and bully him off CS it will drain his sustain (which recently got Nerfed in 6.4) and grow your lead this way. Remember Malph has no escape pre-6, so putting him in a vulnerable position to cs with poke can lead to big leads and early kills to snowball on him. \n\nAs for dodging ultimates, Rusty mentioned they read very differently when looking to ultimate. You mention it isnt' obvious due to them always being over extended, but remember his passive cannot refresh when he gains minion aggro, which takes a while to drop if forward in lane. This is a way you can win trades on him.\n\nI hope some of these tips help in your games.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-03-04T08:01:47.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Real problem is even if you position your self for his ult, he will just up one person and end up killing that one person with his combo or with help and that then makes it 4v5.
