I didn't carry as hard in my last three games as I usually do, but that's because I've been working on other stuff. I've been ganking a lot, and as a result, even if my laners didn't get ahead, the enemy was so tilted it didn't matter. I also counter-jungled hard, making their jungler useless, and causing their team to flame them in All Chat. \n\nAnd then, of course, I focused a lot more on objectives than kills. \n\nSo basically I've been winning games, not as a 1v9 carry like I usually am, but by applying pressure in the right places and focusing objectives.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T05:29:22.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"It's almost like playing smart can have a positive impact on your teams gameplay.

Your mmr is trash because of the way you are winning and losing. It doesn't matter if you have an 80% winrate in the last three months of the season, if you spent the rest of the season playing game after game of trash. The more games you play at a given level of play without improving, the more you convince the system that that is where you belong, and you have played A LOT of games telling the system you are where you should be.\n\nHaving an 80% winrate is irrelevant if it isn't consistent. If you swing from an 80% winrate back to a 40% one then you probably just had a solid winstreak early in the season. The larger the sample size the more accurate the reading, so the more games you play the closer you are getting to your true winrate (you know like the whole flip a coin 6 times vs flip a coin 100 times point made in that other thread).\n\nSo frankly, \"I had an 80% winrate at one point\" don't mean jack shit when after almost **700** games of ranked your winrate is sitting at a solid 49% aka \"you belong here\"%.\n\nI was in Bronze S3 and S4. In S5 I was placed there. I was never hard stuck. In S3 i tried, but my skill was Bronze so I stayed in Bronze funnily enough. In S4 I played my placements, got placed even lower in Bronze because of my previous season mmr, played a few games and decided I didn't want to improve enough to bother with ranked. \n\nS5 was when I really tried, and funnily enough over two years of playing I'd improved a lot just by playing normals. By experiencing the game rather than convincing myself that any loss ever was my teammates fault and that I was some perfect human being that didn't make significant mistakes. I was out of B3 and into S5 in *under 20 games*.\n\nI trashed my mmr from previous seasons, dragged it down far lower than my real skill, but when I actually bothered to get my shit together and play it properly it wasn't a hindrance. That's the whole point of slowing mmr gains when you have a high winrate, it's to stop you from climbing out on luck alone, because if you truly deserve higher the winrate will stay fairly consistent and the LP gap won't mean anything significant.\n\nBut I guess that success story isn't really dramatic enough to make an impression on you is it. Like I said to your other post. Improve your attitude, then maybe you'll have a chance at improving your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-26T17:22:16.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No it isnt, because like i said, the only people who arent bronze were either hardstuck or were never bronze in the first place.\n\nYou admitted yourself that when you were bronze you were lower than you were meant to be.\n\nAnother thing you didnt quite understand is this little fact.\n\n100 games played 80% winrate, at an elo 4 tiers above my current elo mmr wise.\n\nversus 49% winrate at my current elo.\n\nif you didnt notice it that time ill spell it out for you.\n\nlower elo\n\nlower winrate.\n\nThis is evident in my last 20 games winrates too.\n\nlower in elo i go, the lower that winrate gets.\n\nThe higher in elo i get, the higher that winrate gets.\n\nThat trend does not support your argument at all.\n\nthat trend straight up shows one thing and one thing only.\n\nThat i play better in higher elos.\n\nThe higher i go in elo, the better i perform.\n\nSo now we have to figure out why that is, because thats not wild speculation thats fact.\n\nmy theory is its because the worse the players around me are the more tilted i get, notice i said around me, not my team, im including enemy team in that, it disgusts me when i see players worse than bronze level play.\n\nWhats your theory on why my winrate behaves that way, id love to hear it.\n\nBecause as soon as we figure out why my performance goes down when my elo goes down we figure out how to get me out of bronze.\n\nAnd i am deadset about that, i have played every playstyle i can think of, hyper farming split pushing where i push damn near 500 cs a game and take heaps of turrets, winrate didnt go up.\n\nI can very easily just dominate my lane then roam to every single lane on the map destroying everyone with hyper aggressive play. winrate doesnt go up.\n\ni can do a hybrid of the two. still winrate doesnt go up.\n\nWin 20 games in a row and go up a tier without changing my playstyle whatsoever, and oh hey, my winrate goes up and stays around that level until my next losing streak.\n\nlose 20 games in a row and go down a tier without changing my playstyle whatsoever and oh hey my winrate goes down, and stays around that level until my next win streak.\n\nAnother thing going back to the 80% winrate thing, you completely missed my point with my original statement of that.\n\n100 games of 80% winrate means i won 8 out of every 10 games.\n\nso why wasnt i climbing.\n\nWhy when im winning 8 games then losing 2, did i not even get past 10lp b1.\n\neven if my mmr was so bad that i was only getting 10lp a win, thats still 800 lp not counting promos games, which is where the problem lies.\n\nmost of those losses were infact promos games, i would go into those promos super pumped to win to get out of this fresh hell, then immediately shot down by my team, then would go into the second game tilted as fuck and lose the whole series, it was to the point i literally did my promos 3-4 times a day, A DAY, and thats how i ended up here, a few months of that bullshit is all it took to break me mentally and cause me to go on a 40 games losing streak.\n\nI havnt recovered since because i am in a neverending tilt spiral where i queue up a game, try to forget what elo im in, spend about a minute in game, and someone somewhere does something stupid enough to tilt me.\n\nmeanwhile if someone is diamond 5 and has a 51% winrate they will be diamond 3 in like a day or two.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T18:49:05.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're being carried is what you are saying? Your winrate goes up when you play with better people, and goes down when playing with worse? And even when your winrate is high you still can't climb on your own? That says to me you're being carried. If you can't climb even when wins are handed to you by higher than average teammates, then how can you expect to climb when you are playing with people or around your skill level? The answer is you can't, and won't.\n\nA D5 with a 51% winrate can be D3 in a day or two? Ofc they can that's how win's work they just have to win those few games, but if they aren't consistent, if they aren't actually D3 level of skill then that's going to show very quickly, they will start losing again and will get demoted back. That's the whole point of the ranked system. Climbing isn't about getting to x rank once and then saying you belong there. You prove you belong in that rank by staying there, and so far the only rank you have proved that in is the one you are currently in with *700 games played*.\n\nWhen I was in Bronze I DID deserve it. I was Bronze skill. The only reason I still got placed in Bronze was because I hadn't played ranked pretty much at all in Season 4, and the increase in my skill between late S3 when I started playing and S5 when I actually gave ranked a proper go was astronomical. When I played ranked in season 4 even I doubt I was a solid silver player, maybe just barely cause it was early season. I was in Bronze because I belonged there, and when I no longer did, I climbed out in a couple of days, and I'm a goddamned support main, the role that the vast majority of the community agree is hardest to climb with since you are so reliant on your team.\n\nMaybe you do belong higher when you are playing at your best, but you are very much the kind of person to tilt at the smallest thing. If you are perpetually tilted then your accurate rank is whatever your skill level is when you are tilted, and the skill you have when you are playing at your best is irrelevant because the one game you play at your best to the 10 you play when tilted is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nIf your tilt is costing you so much and it bothers you this much then why are you playing when you are tilted? It's like running headfirst into a brick wall, when there is a sledgehammer just over there, but getting the sledgehammer would mean not trying to break that wall for a whole 5 minutes so you decide instead to just keep bashing your head against it in the hopes you can break it anyway.\n\nNot to mention you built this wall brick by brick, each brick being a game you threw cause you were trolling, or destroyed your team because you flamed them, or played when you were tilted and made dumb mistakes left, right and centre, or blamed your team for collective or personal mistakes or arbitrary things that really have no real impact. And sure a couple of those bricks are contributed by the afk or the feeder, but a brick here and there a wall does not make.\n\nSo you could choose to take the time and dismantle the wall, take off the tilt bricks, take off the flame bricks, take off the troll bricks and then just step over the damn thing. Or you could take a break, play some normals and improve your play and your attitude and take the sledgehammer to the wall. Or I suppose you could just sit there and keep beating your head against it with little to no success. Ultimately, that's your choice to make.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T09:47:09.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"so youre being carried\"\n\nha... ha..... hahahahaha.\n\nDo you even math?\n\nOk at 80% winrate, what are the chances, the statistical chances.\n\nThat for 80 of those 100 games.\n\nI got atleast one person good enough to carry me along with the other 3 players on the team.\n\nHmmm?\n\nBecause how low your iq must be, if you think i got carried.\n\nBtw the chances of that happening, are so insanely low if your iq were those chances, youd be dead.\n\n\nAlso you ask why i play when im tilted? i dont have a fucking choice, first of the game, already tilted.\n\nits either play tilted, or dont play at all.\n\nOr cross my fingers and pray to god that for once my team isnt absolute monkeys, because then im in a good enough mood to carry the next 2-3 games, even if i got carried that one game, it puts me in a good enough mood to carry the next 2-3 myself.\n\nOr that for once the enemy team is good enough to actually challenge me, because im not even kidding when i said this, i have met maybe 4 people who can actually beat me, the rest of them \"beat me\" by getting their ass kicked and then bringing all their friends with them the next time they fight.\n\nIrl we would call that being a coward who doesnt know how to fight.\n\nIn league we call that \"teamwork\"\n\nI call that using your team as a crutch to hold you up, which weakens your team hence why 9/10 when they send their entire team mid to deal with me, they lose, because for every fight they need their team to beat me in, their other lanes get pushed a little bit more.\n\nIts fine to use teamwork to bolster your skills.\n\nits not fine to use teamwork to give you skills in the first place, because while you can fake it till you make it early game that way, you will bring your team down in mid to late by being the weak link.\n\nAnd all that facing an opponent that resorts to such tactics does to me, is make me annoyed because my sense of competition is now destroyed, and thats all i play ranked for.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T09:42:05.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"so youre being carried\"\n\nha... ha..... hahahahaha.\n\nDo you even math?\n\nOk at 80% winrate, what are the chances, the statistical chances.\n\nThat for 80 of those 100 games.\n\nI got atleast one person good enough to carry me along with the other 3 players on the team.\n\nHmmm?\n\nBecause thats how low your iq must be, if you think i got carried.\n\nBtw the chances of that happening, are so insanely low if your iq were those chances, youd be dead.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-26T11:20:41.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you just described a 1v9.\n\nYou won your laners lanes for them with your ganks.\n\nYou split pushed for your top laner because he wasnt doing it or wasnt capable of doing it.\n\nYou counter jungled to shut down their own jungler.\n\nbasically you 1v9 carried that team.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-28T23:19:29.427+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well maybe you should have no played the games if you expected to lose.
