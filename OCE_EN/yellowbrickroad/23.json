While a vote kick system might remove that player from your queue all it does is move the problem down the line. I agree its not cool when people lock in a taken role and hold champ select hostage, but the root cause isn't entirely that players fault. The root cause for this is because people are fighting over the same roles. We hope to fix this issue with out new champ select which will be coming in season 2016. You can read more about it here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/new-champ-select.html\n\nBut the TL:DR is - \"With new champ select, everyone is on the same page before the draft even begins. Each player chooses two positions (or fill!) before queueing up to find a team.\" \n\nOnce this feature is ready players will be paired with players that want to fill different roles, rather than sometimes have 2 players fight over the same role like it is now.","replies":[{"poster":"Cardew","date":"2015-11-16T06:16:18.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Maraudaur, \n\nI was wondering if this will come out to the Normal Queue as well, or if it will just be on Ranked Queue's. \n\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-16T06:20:34.581+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nMutley below asked a similar question\n\n> **Mutley**: When does the new champ select take in effect?\n> \n> Also will this be added to blind draft as well?(expect without bans or does this take over blind draft?)\n> \n> \n> **Maraudaur**: as soon as its ready =)\n> \n> I believe it will be replacing all champion select eventually.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-11-15T22:32:46.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What about at least implementing some way to report someone more easily if a champion select is dodged (I assume you can screenshot and send a support ticket or something, but thats probably too much effort and I doubt anyone really does that). Too often I see people who are extremely toxic in champ select, not just over roles but over the champs their teammates pick or stuff that didn't get banned, or sometimes for no real reason at all. As it is at the moment they get off completely free as long as they're toxic enough to make someone dodge, and on occasion I've actually refrained from dodging and played out a near certain loss solely so that I know they'll get reported after the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-15T23:43:31.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nGive this a read it Riot Lyte is on the team that works directly on these features so his insight is usually much more useful. - http://ask.fm/RiotLyte/answer/130888520642\n\nI've bolded the last paragraph as I think that is the most important part to read. Hopefully the whole piece helps provide more insight for you. Happy to discuss anything about this if you want.\n\n**How would you argue against a feature that leaves champ select if 4 out of 5 players vote to dodge? Would it not have the same value as a 20 minute surrender vote in-game? **\n\nWe played around with a few \"Vote Kick\" designs before, and the results were surprising. First, let's assume the design is a simple: players in Champion Select can vote to kick a player, and you need 4 out of 5 votes to proceed.\nImmediately, we saw the behaviors change in Champion Select. One, players began using the \"Vote Kick\" feature when they didn't like a particular team comp, when they felt like the Captain didn't ban the appropriate champions, when players played off-meta champions, and sometimes when they felt the opposing team comp was better than theirs. This dramatically increases the amount of time it takes to get through a Champion Select and into the game as many Champion Selects fail out and you have to start over, and then players will complain about it taking 15-20 minutes to actually get through a Champion Select and load into a match. Now to play one game, you need anywhere from 1 hour to 1.5 hours of free time, which was way too high of a time commitment. Secondly, some scenarios with Duo Queues became even more frustrating, because if a Duo Queue group was being negative in Champion Select you still had nothing you could do to resolve it, and the situations felt even worse than before.\nSome additional designs would be to give every player only 1 \"Vote Kick\" per day, but just giving 1 vote to every player increased failed Champion Selects by ~20%, which means that you're now going through multiple Champion Selects just to get into a game. We also reduced the penalty for queue dodging before, which would make it \"less painful\" for players to queue dodge if they absolutely had to, but this increased failed Champion Selects by about ~30%, and again players started complaining about failed Champion Selects and taking too long to get into a game.\n**We think that Team Builder Draft will ultimately solve Champion Select issues better than most other features or systems, so we decided to work on that system first because it also solves a bunch of other problem spaces such as better retention and onboarding for low level players and giving players more control over their Champion Select experience. If Team Builder Draft does not improve Champion Select enough, we have some ideas ready to go such as allowing players to report when someone doesn't play the position they specified, or allowing players to give us a reason (and specify a player) if they choose to queue dodge.**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-15T10:42:56.999+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"When does the new champ select take in effect?\n\nAlso will this be added to blind draft as well?(expect without bans or does this take over blind draft?)","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-15T11:39:13.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as soon as its ready =)\n\nI believe it will be replacing all champion select eventually.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-11-17T15:16:33.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That actually looks like a really good system.\n\nFrom the opinion of someone that usually screams out \"really rito\" youve done good this time guys.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-11-15T09:54:07.600+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So teambuilder yet with extremely long times for people playing anything other then support","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2015-11-17T00:11:11.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teambuilder already had extremely long times...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-11-15T10:38:40.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unless you don't mind Filling.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-15T17:40:54.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Filling basically means support.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-11-15T11:40:13.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main difference with this new champion select over the old team builder is that every player picks two roles instead of one.
