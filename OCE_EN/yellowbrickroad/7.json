What the fuck riot.","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":5,"down_votes":4,"body":"Cooldowns are up, damage is down, healing has been nerfed, and the biggest most overlooked thing? new passive doesnt hit towers like old passive.\r\n\r\nIm literally 400 games invested into akali across 3 accounts.\r\n\r\nAnd im quitting as of today, ive played one game of the new rework, and thats one game too many.\r\n\r\nYou took a champion, who is supposed to be played around her sustain capacity, and removed her sustain.\r\n\r\nYou made her into a burst based assassin.\r\n\r\nBut nerfed her damage which is retarded because unlike other burst assassins her scalings were already low as fuck and her base damage isnt enough to burst.\r\n\r\nThe only thing you kept from her kit, is her mobility, and even thats down because one dash on her w every 20 seconds does not make up for for the  fucking ult cd nerf, 2 seconds flat as opposed to 1 second at level 3, thats a 100% increase in cd. and the e received a 200% cooldown increase.\r\n\r\nWith the current kit i honestly would not be surprised if a full ad akali that does nothing but auto attack and stick to you would be infinitely more viable than ap akali right now, because like i said her kit is fucking useless after the nerfs.\r\n\r\nAnd in her current state, find me one example where i would play akali, instead of diana.\r\n\r\nBecause diana does literally everything akali does right now, only better.\r\n\r\n2 second ult cooldown? diana has a 0 second ult cooldown after the first ult assuming you land a q, or a 3.3 second ult cooldown to chain infinite ults, which means she can ult more than akali.\r\n\r\nRanged poke? dianas q not only hits more targets it also does more damage and has a higher range.\r\n\r\nUtility w? i dunno about you but a shield that helps me last longer than 0.5 seconds when i go to engage is much better than dodging like what 2 auto attacks and delaying a targeted ability by half a second while im in stealth from the w.\r\n\r\ne reverse knockback? vs 3 second cooldown ability that does less damage than the 2 second cooldown ult, and only has the purpose of doing damage.\r\n\r\nult? both a dash, both instant cast, diana has slight better range, diana has nearly twice akalis scaling.\r\n\r\nPassives? first auto of akali is a 60% bonus ad 30% ap heal so assuming around 500 ap its a 150 hp heal second hit is a 50% bonus 50% ap damage ability so 250 magic damage\r\n\r\nDianas passive is a 80% ap scaling auto attack every 3 autos.\r\n\r\nAt base attack speed on both champs (akali 0.695 diana 0.725) akali would get off both hits of her passive before diana can get her passive off specficially 0.1 seconds before akali can pop her passive, in the time it takes diana to do 160% of her ap from two procs of her passive akali can get off 2 of her passives, on the third proc of dianas passive however akali will only be halfway through the 6 second cooldown of her own passive, further more we are talking 240% ap vs 150% ap and a total time auto attacking each other of 12.4 seconds so not a pretty viable comparison but also one that shows diana not only has more burst than akali, but also more sustain.\r\n\r\nUp until now diana has always been &quot;akali but better, minus the spellvamp&quot;\r\n\r\nnow she is just &quot;akali but better&quot;\r\n\r\nNow i understand why best akali FL quit.\r\n\r\nAnd if i didnt play other champions? id quit too with these changes.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-11T22:52:59.253+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":3,"body":"Good riddens then stupid akali one shotting people and healing half her health back I hope shes gutted","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-12T00:00:08.755+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"She was a 1% pick rate champion last season.\n\nShe was picked so rarely because as a champion she was actually bad.\n\nLike i said diana was akali but better and look at dianas pick rates.\n\nWhy did i and other akali mains play her? it was because of that heal, because she was an assassin that could make sick 1v3 plays from low health, instead of just getting one shot the second she steps out of that bush.\n\nRight now one of two things is gonna happen, everyones gonna move to kat or kass or some other assassin that doesnt instantly die in a fight like i did, and you are gonna have an even worse time, because akali mains that have the skill to make a shitty champion blow you up are now playing an even stronger champion.\n\nor you will see alot of akali tanks.\n\nThis is bad for both of us, akali mains, and squishy adcs who bitch about assassins alike.","replies":[{"poster":"Just A Pigeon","date":"2016-11-12T00:43:28.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"bad\" after she got 1 item she would murder everyone and she still does","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-12T02:01:25.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I just vs'd an akali and trashed her.\n\nNot only did i trash her as an akali main i pointed out in real time like 10 different occasions where if it were old akali she wouldve survived the fight instead of dying.\n\nThat and she has a 40% winrate over on na and a 47.8% winrate over here in oce as of today.\n\nBalanced champs sit around 50% strong champs go over 50%\n\nWeak champs sit under 50%\n\nAkali is weak right now, period.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-11-12T04:32:16.708+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your just another \"X champion main that complains when there champion gets nerfed\", remember tank akali top?

The only reason that low elo players couldnt handle akali is they didnt know what a fucking red trinket or pink ward was (high elo players didnt even use w because aside from the speed boost its useless when the enemy team can just use a 50 gold item to counter it or drop a red trinket and have a morgana q you or something) and had literally no idea how to cc.\n\nAkali mains played akali out of the love for the champion, not because she was strong, because she wasnt.\n\n","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"labiamajora","date":"2016-11-12T02:51:43.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wrong.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-11-11T21:41:21.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Settle down mate, there are buffs for akali on the pbe","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-11T21:48:13.039+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Unless those buffs include reverting the passive a few number changes wont do much.\n\nThe passive was the only thing keeping her viable, she needs to either have the passive reworked or get a full rework (which is still on the books)\n\nBasically this isnt an issue of how much damage she does or how quickly she does it.\n\nThis is an issue of the new passive being contradictory with the rest of her kit, and the old passive being what actually made her old kit work in the first place.\n\nThe reason her base damage and scaling is so low is because her old passive allowed her to survive longer than 0.1 of a second because she would heal off the damage she dealt, im sure you wouldve noticed if you ever tried to 1v1 an akali and she gets away with a slither of health from your full combo even though she only has like 1.2k health? that was her passive in action.\n\nThe new passive now only heals for at best 150 hp, compared to 50% spell vamp which was insanely easy to achieve on akali with only 2 ad items and a gunblade, which wouldve healed for somewhere in the range of 1500 hp during an extended fight, now lets say akali gets her passive off on cooldown during that same 1500hp fight she would heal for 300 hp now.\n\nThats a 500% nerf to her self healing.\n\nOr to put it another way, she now heals for 20% of the healing she did pre rework.\n\nWith no compensation for all that healing loss in her kit meaning sure you can buff her damage, but she isnt going to survive long enough to kill you with that damage.\n\ninfact all this nerf does is provide a reason to never play akali as an assassin anymore unless you go tank.\n\nbecause yes diana literally does akalis job better than her in a kit for kit comparison unless akali goes tank, and then akali isnt even an assassin anymore if she goes tank.\n\nFurther more Best Akali FL a challenger akali main and over on the akali mains reddit regarded as THE akali main, is gone, he quit league, because of this rework.\n\nthats how bad riot shat the bed on this one.","replies":[{"poster":"labiamajora","date":"2016-11-11T23:32:43.875+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"They cut off one of her arms and gave her slightly longer legs and told us it was an upgrade.
