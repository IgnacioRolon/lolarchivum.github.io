Trust me dude it will be mostly YOU who is the factor for winning or losing if you're as good as you're claiming to be. P2 is not high elo by any means but when I play on my friends acc (Silver 5) it is really easy to stomp on my laner and snowball so hard that we win than what it is in gold-plat-diamond elo. Of course, not every game will be carryable but if you have a good strategy and that strategy gives you a wr of over 50% then that means that strategy is working and the losses you'll have will be from the dreaded'' my teammates fed'' style of games.\n\nThere is a youtuber named Brickyorchid8 that made a video called something like ''How I got to diamond'' it is rather entertaining but the important part is, is how he explains what kind of strategy is the BEST way to climb.

I did it when I was b4 and it helped me get to B2 where I climbed by myself. \n\nAlso like I said previously, maybe you should start to onetrick a champion entirely. It is just so easy to climb because you know exactly what to do against all of your opponents and you know how to transition your lead better if you play just a handful or one champion. \nI would not advise someone in Bronze playing Cassiopeia, but you seem to find her the most enjoyable and do rather decent with her. I would advise you to build a bit better. \n\n*Mejais is simply a bad item. It is meant for shield champions that need large amounts of ap to make their shields bigger (ivern, janna). It is just flat AP and nothing else, it is not worth getting, ever. Dark seal could be a good early game item but you shouldn't upgrade it. Buy a deathcap instead. It suits her far better and gives you more AP than what Mejais does with it's unique passive(and that AP doesn't get removed if you die,unlike mejais)\n\n*I would remove the Spirit visage for either a Banshees or a Zhonyas. Spirit visage is an okay item but the options are still better. Banshees gives you both offense & defense and same with Zhonyas. All Visage gives you, is defense. Besides, you seem to build ROA & Rylais, you have enough health anyway. \n\nTrust me, if you do that, you'll notice that your DPS will be far better and it'll be worth. \n\nAnd please stop trolling on some of your games. Just don't. You're lucky you're not banned at this point. If you dont feel like going to a game just dodge. Better to lose 3 lp than 18+.\n\nEdit; forgot mentioning; You need better runes and summoner spells. Cass is not that great with ignite, it's only laning phase. It's better for you to take something more defensive like ghost, barrier, exhaust (depending on matchup) instead of ignite. Poke champs usually dont take ignite anyway.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T09:39:34.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mostly use mejais as a cheaper deathcap so i can hit 6 items faster.\n\nOnce i lose stacks from my damage falling off i swap it out for a deathcap or another defensive item depending on my needs for that game because i usually have a few thousand gold banked up at that point.\n\nIgnite i use for my laning phase, i almost always do a level 2 all in where i ding 2 take my q wait for my opposing laner to walk just a little bit forward so he walks into my q as its casting then immediately spam e on them down the lane.\n\nIgnite usually picks them off when they run under tower giving me a quick and easy 400g at the 4-5 minute mark.\n\nThis is also why my early game lane phase generally consists of me last hitting with e from under tower so i have the maximum amount of room to chase people down before they hit their tower, once i can 2-3 hit people is when i start moving the lane forward so i can kill the laner, crash it into their tower, then do a sneaky roam bot or something like that.\n\nAs for the visage im mostly taking that for the tanky stats, healing increase which works on both catalyst and empowered e to end up around 100 or so health per cast or a couple hundred health per second, and the cdr.\n\nAgainst ad comps though i tend to not take it, have been tossing up what to fill in that slot with against ad comps because i personally dislike zhonyas, i understand its value but i tend to find that all zhonyas does is gives the team thats already wailing on my ass an easier time repositioning to kill me faster when i come out of it, it works better in higher elo's where you can rely somewhat on your team coming to your assistance, or on say kat where you continue doing damage from inside the zhonyas.\n\ntbh hell with the amount of health im getting in this build i could swap visage for a zz'rot against ad comps and improve lane pressure that way.\n\nI will agree on the runes, thats just a generic page i put together for champions that benefit from mpen and cdr, so i can buy one less cdr item.\n\nKeep in mind i was playing the \"recommended\" build when i first started playing her, randomly built the visage when i had to go against a vlad top one time thinking \"hey it gives mr and cdr what could go wrong\" then i remembered catalyst had mana to health conversion and next minute im 28/0, so this build is fully a work in progress thing that ive developed over trial and error trying different items and comparing results.\n\n\nBut yeah im \"kind of\" a one trick.\n\nI have a few champions i can play just as well as cass, including shaco, kalista, katarina, akali, veigar, some would argue not but singed (i can triple proxy), ezreal\n\nbut the reason i perform so well on all those champs is because each and everyone of them i one tricked at some point in time.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T12:39:37.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just tried substituting mejais for zz'rot, damage was still fine, but i could tank so much more damage so my overall damage output went up, along with my split pushing power going through the roof.","replies":[{"poster":"VeryCoolNinja2","date":"2017-05-27T13:50:06.777+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe you should play a splitpush bruiser then?

As Cass, your goal is to rush a tear anyway. You don't need to worry about early kills in the laning and as I previously mentioned; Cass is a *Poke* champion. It is better to pick something more defensive considering cass has no escape nor self buff in her kit. It is better for you to farm safely and/or bait a kill with either barrier, exhaust or ghost.\n\nVisage is still not really that great. As I mentioned; it is okay. But it doesn't give you offense stats, the healing doesn't make that big of a difference. It is better to buy a Banshees if you want MR (the item is stupid op anyway lol)\n\nZhonyas is excellent on Cass and you said it yourself. If you have Zhonyas in a teamfight and they all want to focus you then you can pop it when you're low and let your teammates finish off their carries. 2.5 seconds is not a joke. If you still lost that fight, well that sucks. Nothing to do there. You NEED to trust your teammates inorder to win. Communicate. Don't flame, just communicate and tell them where to improve. If someone is tilting, mute them.\n\nBut you don't really benefit from tank stats as cass :S. You're not playing a bruiser nor a tank that benefit from visage & zz'rot greatly, but a DPS burst mage. You NEED dmg items.  \n\nYou still have Rylais. Besides, isn't Morello more beneficial on cass?\n\nYou still need to improve on your overall CS. You're playing a champion that needs dmg items ASAP. That is why for example: My CS is garbage because I play a champion that only really needs 1 dmg item and I can give the rest to it to the carries.

Here's a simple solution: if you have a shit day, maybe you shouldn't be playing this game if you know you play like shit when you aren't having a good day and then enjoy playing when you're having a good day instead. \n\nFor example, you wrote in your \"analysis\" of game 8 that Ryze was mad because you flamed him in the game before that one. Feeding isn't acceptable, but it is easier to not tilt people when you don't flame them in the first place and then wonder why they get mad at you when you play with them again.\n\nAlso, looking at your match history, I'm assuming the reason you buy the coin item is because your CPM is really low which I'm guessing is a side-effect of you not being strong at that particular aspect of the game. If you're killing your opponent that many times in lane, you should be averaging way more than ~3 cs per minute. \n\nMaybe focus on fixing that up because just running over someone in kills while they're still getting gold on you from racking up the same or, in same cases, more CS than you is going to get you destroyed in the long run.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some people that make this game incredibly hard to win, anyone will tell you that. But looking at your match history, there are streaks of games where you set yourself back through deliberately sabotaging yourself and your teammates when those could easily be wins pushing you up the ranks. \n\nIf you're looking for an answer as to what you could've done in those games you lost, here's the TL:DR:\n\nFor game 8, don't flame people and they probably won't int feed when you get them again in another game.\n\nFor game 9 and 11, you'll get afks and people who play poorly, you'll have to accept that sometimes.\n\nHere's the bonus round: Don't troll when you get autofilled, don't int feed or afk games and don't do stuff like AP Ashe when you're tilted to help solve any other games you'll have and you should be good to go.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-25T16:26:52.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Ignoring the rest of it because ive heard it all before and only addressing the coin.\n\nmy cpm is so low in those coin games because i am actively not taking cs in order to upgrade the passive as fast as possible.\n\nAs the real reason i go nomads is to abuse the 30 gold per kill bonus with my high kpm to snowball uncontrollably.\n\n30 gold doesnt sound like much but thats 10% more gold per kill.\n\nat 10 kills thats 1 whole extra kill in gold value.\n\nAnd i hit 10 kills as a bare minimum pretty much, so that item pays for itself very very quickly, ontop of giving my cdr at level 1 for harass and some life regen, from there i only really cs when im pushing a wave in since im always traveling to another lane to kill someone, like nonstop pick making until the enemy team wisens up that i am quite literally roaming around the map stomping them.\n\ncompare this to say when i would play something retarded like kalista top and average around 9cs per minute.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-05-27T09:40:11.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So i've read most of what has been said, i didn't read every last word, but i know what point you're trying to make.\n\nI would like you to attempt to heed my advice and constructive criticism, and not ignore the entire post because you've heard parts of it.\n\nLeague of legends, and ranked, is based upon a simple construct, 1 team HAS to lose. Always remember this, This also means lanes lose, regardless of what you want to do.\n\nMorale and determination play a BIG part in strategy games and games like league, especially in the lower Elo's, when everyone says \"dont flame\" they mean it, if you literally stop flaming, you'll see yourself winning more games. i don't care how many times you've been told this, its better to just shut up.\n\nDo not give advice during league games, you should understand this the most, why? Because everyone here is trying their best to help you and let you understand what you're doing wrong, and instead you're attacking them like they're imbeciles.  Giving advice to low-elo players, demoralises them, makes them think you're flaming, and bam, you have someone afk or inting.\n\n1 person does not win a game. otherwise you would not still be bronze 5. Every time you flame, and make someone give up, you lose the game. Why? because you can't 1v5, stop trying, let other people win.\n\nDon't take all the kills, YES, real advice right now, Right here, Do not take all the kills, 1 person with 50 kills, is not the same as a team with 50 kills, you get Cc'd in a fight, your team with 0 kills losses the game.. allow yourself to be ks'd/give kills away, trust me you'll win more often. it also boosts self-confidence and morale of your team. (DO NOT TAKE THIS ADVICE LIGHTLY, If you ignore me entirely, i couldn't give a shit, but if you ignore this advice, and say im not trying to help, then you aren't trying to get better)\n\nRealize that, yes, you will lose games, yes, people on your team will lose lanes, and yes you will lose lanes. Also realize 1 last thing.\n\nEveryone is auto-filled. Everyone. If you give up, during ur auto-fill games, because \"it's just autofill, who cares\" you're making your team lose. Think of your own experience, where the supports have been stupid and not cared, or when the junglers do whatever they want. there is a legitimate reason to try when you are supporting. i don't care how much you hate it, just suck it up, it will make you win more games.\n\ntl;dr: doesn't matter how many times you've heard it, fix your attitude, morale is a real thing that exists, deal with it.\n\np.s. if you respond to this with any bit of aggression, like you have with the rest of the posts, i will not reply, i will not even bother ever opening this thread again, however, if you decide to respond normally, with some dignity, i will give you more tips on how you can win games and get out of elo-hell.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T10:09:07.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tbh i do give kills away most of the time, its why i tend to have double digit assists.\n\nBut there are also plenty of times where i have to take the kill either because it is a solo 1v2 in mid lane or something, or they are about to get away so i throw one more cheeky ability to secure it.\n\nI also understand the flaming thing, trust me i do, but i act irrationally when im angry, if i could disable chat alltogether i would, i already play better when i ping mute and chat mute everyone so i dont have to read their bullshit tactical decisions, but that doesnt stop me typing in chat that the fact they are doing baron when the enemy \"fed to the tits carry\" is still alive is suicide.\n\nAnd i know im blaming it on my anger, but i get away with this personality irl by simply not getting angry, the very very few times i do get angry all logic goes out the window and i lose my cool calculating mentality and go straight to rage mode.\n\nLeague teams just have more things that tick me off than anything else in the world so i have more outbursts playing league.\n\nBasically i have anger issues, but its an anger issue that only certain competitive video games can trigger, and thus going and seeking help for it is damn near useless as a therapist is just going to say \"well stop playing that game\"\n\nYou are also correct that i cant 1v5, this is why i get so bloody angry when my team feeds, because they just dont care that they making the game damn near impossible to win, do they not have any competitive sense what so ever? do they not enjoy winning through the process of overcoming a stronger opponent.\n\nI mean hell i know why half of bronze feeds, i could teach a master class that goes for 5 minutes that would solve feeding altogether for the majority of bronze players. itd just be a flow chart that says.\n\n                                                                                                        Did you die\n                                        yes but i can i can still beat him                                                      \n                                                     but did you die                                                 \n                                                            yes...\n                                              then play safer mate\n                                               but i cant play safer\nyes you can just last hit your lane to freeze it infront of your tower class dismissed\n\n\n\nno?\n\nthen keep playing how you were","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-05-27T10:56:13.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your main issue is anger, there are a lot of things you can do to help, as someone in the last semester of psych, who literally just finished an anger treatment paper, i can tell you. 1.

It isn't always your teams fault, as i said earlier, it's a 5v5 game, and 1 side HAS to lose, each lane has to have a losing side (regardless of how well you do), so understand this, and find ways to make it better.\n\nyou can read advice all day long, if you don't understand that sometimes it's inevitable to lose, you'll realize it's not the end of the world.\n\ndont flame, don't troll, don't int. get better slowly, and with time you'll get out of bronze. \n\nThe reason i think you're not playing up to scratch, you ask?\n\nsimple: You said it yourself, you're in bronze5, and everyone is feeding or int'ing.. thats equally true for the enemy team. if you are honestly silver/gold level, you can easily climb out of that, play your lane well, help other lanes, understand the structure of the game.\n\nunderstand when to take a turret, and when to go down and help your botlane.\n\nunderstand champion roles, and how to take advantage of them, a tanks main priority should be to take damage, and stop their carries from taking damage.\n\nunderstand when to go for dragon, rift herald, and baron.\n\nunderstand what disengaging a teamfight means, and how to do it. \n\nunderstand that denying farm is equally as important as farming well. i was recently in a game, where i was 0-1-0 in lane, however i had 50 farm on my enemy, we both entered a team fight and i got a quadra kill... there's a reason. \n\nlast tip: Do not give up. \n\npeople concede and lose morale at different points, if your team is 0-10 at 5 minutes, sure it's easy to give up, however comebacks happen 24/7, and ARE possible in lower ranks, understand that. Until the enemy team is bashing your nexus and kills it. there's always a way to win, you just have to figure it out.\n\neven if comebacks are rare, coming back from 1/10 games, is still decreasing your loss rate by 10%, which is a huge deal.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"JokerZZZ","date":"2017-05-26T11:20:02.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i also got demoted from S3 to S5 thanks to those OCE kids who rage and went afk, lag, inten feed from my previous 7 loses.
