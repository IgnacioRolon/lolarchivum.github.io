Riot staff work very hard reviewing reports, however this takes time so don't expect people to be banned instantly for breaking the rules.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-24T10:37:51.326+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It was just a leaver buster punishment, unfortunately ive already knocked out a majority of my low prio queue games so appealing it would not be worth the time.\n\nAs for when i say people dont get banned im referring to reports, im aware you guys moved to an automatic report system recently that handles all minor offences and from what im seeing it isnt catching alot of the reports and falsely recognizing them as false reports.\n\nThis is not the fault of the riot staff perse but rather whoever is working on the algorithm used to check said reports.\n\nIn that regard i am aware of many people who repeatedly troll every game they play without fail and have been doing so undetected for many many months despite being reported en masse.\n\nFrankly id find that making the algorithm more diligent while increasing the number of wrongly banned people would infact catch these outliers who consistently slip past the system, and those that get wrongly banned can still appeal the ban if they truly believe they didnt deserve the report that resulted in it.\n\nThat or the obvious solution of bringing back the tribunal system which was very effective, but as we havnt had that system for many years now during the \"revamps\" riot has either given up on improving that system or has some other reason as to why the revamps never got finished.\n\nEdit: As for making sure my client works properly it does, this is a very rare issue that may happen once out of every hundred games i play, infact i havnt failed to load in in about a year now till today.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-25T01:59:19.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">It was just a leaver buster punishment, unfortunately ive already knocked out a majority of my low prio queue games so appealing it would not be worth the time.\n\nAs stated above, Leaverbuster punishments cannot be reversed therefore there is no point in appealing them.\n\n>As for when i say people dont get banned im referring to reports, im aware you guys moved to an automatic report system recently that handles all minor offences and from what im seeing it isnt catching alot of the reports and falsely recognizing them as false reports.\n\n>This is not the fault of the riot staff perse but rather whoever is working on the algorithm used to check said reports.\n\n>In that regard i am aware of many people who repeatedly troll every game they play without fail and have been doing so undetected for many many months despite being reported en masse.\n\n>Frankly id find that making the algorithm more diligent while increasing the number of wrongly banned people would infact catch these outliers who consistently slip past the system, and those that get wrongly banned can still appeal the ban if they truly believe they didnt deserve the report that resulted in it.\n\nCould you elaborate on players \"trolling\"? judging from your post history the people you call trolls just happen to be unskilled players.\n\nIf you feel the automated system isn't working sufficiently and you wish to report a summoner out of game please [submit a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support with the players summoner name, what rules were broken and any other information you can provide.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-25T05:15:56.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would give you a specific example but that would be name and shaming.\n\nAlso its interesting to find out you can report separately? is it possible to provide evidence supporting that report through things like video and such? if so i could probably clean up most of the community in about a day with the number of games i play (over-exaggerating but still i seem to encounter an abnormal number of genuine trolls for some reason)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
