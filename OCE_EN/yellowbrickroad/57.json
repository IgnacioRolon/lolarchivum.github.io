Sure, everyone wants to win but people don't focus on improving yourself. You mentioned you split push, if you split push you'd obviously be heavily farmed and in turn have items. Do you use this to your advantage by helping other lanes? Or simply sit top and push, because that could also be your downfall by essentially making it a 4v5. Unless you can get an inhib, splitpushing is never that beneficial apart from gold, especially in a lane like top.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-10-21T12:16:11.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I always get inhibs.\n\nIts bronze the second you just afk push top they freak the fuck out and dont know how to counter it.\n\nThe issue is my teams tend to also freak the fuck out 9/10\n\nThe other 1 time is a golden moment when my team realises they have free objectives literally right infront of them.\n\nGranted my last game is an example of how i am visibly more skilled than my teams.\n\n48 minutes in and 425 cs later i killed literally every turret and inhib on the enemy team while also being the sole member of my team fed enough to defend against the 5 fed monstrosities knocking down our door (22/2 ezreal as an example, 12/1 darius, etc etc)\n\nI somehow managed to make a game that shouldve ended at 20 minutes (when they reached our nexus) last an extra 28 minutes and somehow found the time to simultaneously defend and push at the same time.\n\nHonestly had my team been slightly more skilled and able to fight without me i mightve actually won that game.\n\nJust barely though, granted then again if they were more skilled the team wouldnt have gotten fed in the first place.\n\nEdit: Just want to note when i say visibly more skilled i mean in reference with the rest of my elo.\n\nContrary to popular belief there is a niche skill level where you can get stuck in an elo.\n\nThe only way to describe this niche is when you are visibly performing better than those around you but are not quite good enough to climb to the next tier.\n\nA dwarf among gnomes if you will, when to climb you need to be a giant, to quote foxdrop. This niche is of course what i call elo hell, i respect that there is trolls in every elo and thats why i dont class elo hell as where all the trolls are, i class it as the elo where you are better but not quite good enough, granted the trick with this niche is that artificially increasing your elo by boosting or duoing also increases your winrate, as you get past the elo plateau and into an elo where you are playing equally with those around you rather than better.\n\nAnother way to put it is this, you have carried yourself to a point where you can no longer 1v5 for a penta, but at the same time both your opponents and your team are still not on your level, at this point your winrate will drop until you are equaled out with your opponents and team.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-10-21T15:51:43.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dislike the first thing you say. \"Its bronze the second you just afk push top they freak the fuck out and dont know how to counter it.\".

This means my enemy teams are getting fed less from me, which would mean they would have a harder time fighting split pushers, right?\n\nWrong. It all depends on your champ. But, even with a specifically dedicated split pusher (tryndamere and Trundle come to mind), if two people split off to deal with you, heck, if one person splits off and just dicks around the tower poking you when you try to push it and clearing the minions when they get to the tower. You're now useless, as split pushers work well when you can get towers down.\n\nSplit pushing is not instant win in bronze. I've tried and it fails. Everybody knows how to deal with it in bronze, it's not hard.\n\nBasically everything you've said is countered by the fact that your scores alone on your latest games attest otherwise. You don't get kills, you die a lot, this leads me to believe you don't counter your counter-pushers and in reality you split push, get picked off from your team and die.\n\nBronze should focus on teaming up past 20 minutes, looking to force fights around towers/dragon/baron, and to pick off carries once engagement begins. The problem with bronze is people focus tanks/scary looking champs like darius, and don't focus the tristana that's getting free attacks into your team. They also don't group, they split-push, get picked off and die.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-10-22T03:06:33.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem is that because you die so much (yes I'm going back to deaths, and yes you die A LOT) you are feeding the enemy team so hard that they can successfully defend 3v4","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-10-29T11:08:31.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"then use the yellow bricks to build yourself back up","replies":[]},{"poster":"GentlemanReptile","date":"2015-10-26T14:35:08.092+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bloodborne is easily the most unrelentingly difficult game I've ever played, and I've played through it three times now all without getting one tenth as pissed off as I've gotten in a single League game.\n\nFuck this game off, Riot doesn't care about its playerbase anyway.

Being able to identify what these are in any given game and adapt accordingly is real game knowledge.\n\nAnd a big problem is that you're playing tryndamere. Sure, the enemy team won't know how to deal with a split push in bronze, but your teammates won't know how to play appropriately either. Getting an inhib isn't worth it if your team is going to die and give the enemies 4 kills AND an inhib. Saying \"just play safe\" etc. will not work in bronze, and if you've given a bunch of kills to the enemy team (which clearly you do because most of your scores suck), your teammates might not be able to defend even if they do know what they're doing, and probably won't get anything if you get gangbanged 3v1.
