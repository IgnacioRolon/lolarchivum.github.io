While going through Bronze I learnt there are two sort of competing methods of thought.\nOne is \"the 1v9, I must super carry 30/0/0 every game\" or similar method of thinking. This kind of thinking is VERY tempting, and unless you are super good mechanically and perform significantly better than everyone _consistently_, will not work for most people in winning games. In fact, I personally found it detrimental to my own play as I would make more mistakes, play too aggressive, and die waaaaaaay too much. You may have this problem a bit, at an average of 10.5 deaths your last 20 ranked games.\n\nThe other method of thought, can be harder to get to. It's kind of like \"I will do my best to do my job for the team, so that the enemy's base is destroyed\". This means you \"carry\" but not in the traditional sense, you still carry by doing your role's \"job\" as best you can to give your team the best chance of taking down the enemy's base.\nIt's hard to explain, but you can do this a lot more consistently than aiming to go 10+/0 every game because most games that won't happen.\n\nI was in the same situation too. When in B4 B5 I thought, I should at least be around S5 skill level? Sure I might have been in some areas, but overall I still had so much to learn. I \"learnt\" the rank system, in that winning games =/= super carrying every game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"idc","date":"2016-09-04T02:23:29.164+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you kidding me?

Just want you to understand that, there's quite a bit of a jump from tier to tier, that's why they exist in the fashion that they do. If you're supposed to be in silver 3, then you're far out of your rating in bronze 5. I don't care how you cut it, yes, golds in bronze are probably better, but you're still (if you're being honest) not supposed to be playing at that rank either apparently.\n\nTo your point about my ability to climb, I started this season in bronze 4, in no season since I started playing ranked in season 3 have I ever been anything other than bronze, and I have the icons to prove it. I'm in silver 5 now and peaked at silver 3 and somewhere in silver is probably my correct ranking. The system is designed to work itself out over time, you have 750+ games this season alone, it's got a pretty good idea of where you belong at the moment.\n\nAbout teamwork, you're completely wrong, if your team has a weak member, you have to at least offer them some help, you can't just hope they'll do something useful while you race off to be a hero. Teamwork is figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of your team and maximising strengths while minimising weaknesses, not just pushing your strength while letting your weakness stay exposed. \n\nFor example, I'll use your hypothetical (Sorry in advance for the tonne of numbers):\n\nYou, as a 14/8/3 Akali, dive in and pick off the 0/4/5 support, the 3/6/3 adc and the 2/3/1 jungler before being killed. This fight is probably going in your favour, huh? It's a 4v2 after all. \n\nExcept your 4 are a 2/5/3 adc, a 1/4/1 top laner, a 3/7/2 jungler and a 0/6/1 support vs a 14/3/9 mid and an 11/2/10 top laner. When their two carries tear through the rest of your team and come out alive, you probably immediately go \"How did my team fuck up a 4v2? GG Can't carry these nubs\". You, as your team's primary carry, don't want to end up dead. Even if the tradeoff isn't 1 for 1, you sometimes need to understand that your 1 isn't equal to the 1, 2 or 3 you take out. This comes down to valuing your importance to the team vs the champion you're taking out on their team and I don't think you're doing this yet which is why you're struggling to carry as hard as you want to.\n\nDon't believe me? Look at your stats across your entire account. You average almost 9 deaths a game, if you're the hyper carry for your team, you being dead is a really, really bad thing. Clown Fiesta games may feel like fun and provide some insane moments but you can't risk being dead for that long, especially with the changes to death timers which can really fuck you up. \n\nI'm not saying you don't ever deserve to climb, but I think you overvalue the importance of kill numbers rather than the significance of those kills to the state of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-09-05T09:32:44.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jesus you lack critical thinking ill spell it out for you.\n\nA silver smurf =/= A gold smurf.\n\nTwo different levels of skill.\n\nTwo different gaps in skill between the rest of the players and you.\n\nIf i take a piece of glass and try to cut it with another piece of glass (bronze v bronze) it will take a long time to cut.\n\nif i take a piece of metal and try to cut the piece of glass (silver against bronze) its a bit easier to cut but still takes a very long time.\n\nIf i take a diamond blade and try to cut the piece of glass (gold versus bronze) it will cut through like butter.\n\nThat is my one fucking problem with the league community.\n\nThey act like if you are even 1 mmr point below your true mmr that you should be able to 1v9 carry your games even though you are only 0.00000001% better than the other players in the game.\n\nin reality to be able to solo carry yourself to your true elo you need to be better than your true elo.\n\nI explained this in another comment, but just because you play like a silver 5 doesnt mean you will be silver 5.\n\nYou will likely be somewhere around bronze 3 or so for a very very long time until you grind your way to your true elo over a long period of time.\n\nThose of you still going up entire leagues in under 100 games are nowhere close to your true elo so your experience doesnt apply.\n\nFor instance if you are gold and say \"yeah well i escaped from bronze\"\n\nAll im going to say is \"how is your climb to plat going\"\n\nSame for every other rank, if you are still climbing you dont belong in your elo, but if its taking a very long time you also arent good enough to solo carry.\n\nperiod.\n\nAm i better than other bronze players? lets put it this way, i have only met i think 20 people that come to mind that can actually equal me in a 1v1 fight on equal ground and make me worried about losing lane, and an even smaller number of those people i cannot beat ever, its like 2.\n\nLiterally im not even overestimating in the last 2 weeks ive met one person who didnt need to have his entire team come to his lane to stop me from killing him under tower, and before you say \"but its a team game\" yes its a teamgame, and a team is only as strong as its weakest link, teamwork is not propping up the weakest character so that he doesnt have to be good to win, teamwork is boosting the strengths of your strongest characters so that they can hard carry you, do you peel the guy who keeps getting caught out, or do you peel your carry, js, in otherwords teamwork isnt being terrible alone and mildly decent together, teamwork is being good alone and amazing together.\n\nWhy the fuck do you think i main snowball champs lately, im a singed main and top lane main, my favorite play style is manipulating the game indirectly by proxying and shit since it makes me laugh, but i also understand that mechanically i am better than bronze and ive been taking advantage of that fact.\n\nDoes that mean im capable of 1v5ing? fuck no, but give me 4 kills a gunblade and vision of the enemy and ill get the team a triple kill 9 times out of 10, and ill do it solo.\n\nBut thats not enough to carry games, all that does is give me the power to roam around the map making it easier on my team, but as the saying goes you can lead a horse to water but you cant make them drink, aka i cant MAKE my team push their lanes after i kill their lane opponents AND the jungler so they cant be ganked, i cant MAKE my team come to dragon after i just flashed the wall and killed their smite etc etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2016-09-03T12:41:02.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's still an issue with you.

not that big a gap.\n\nSo if i belong in s5 and not b5, i need to be not only good enough to close that gap, i also have to be BETTER than s5, to create a wider gap so as to carry.\n\nWhich again is shown in the higher elo, if 3 multi season challenger players cant carry a diamond 1 game and win all the time, keyword all the time, because by the boards logic if i belong in a higher elo i will win period (thats just not true btw) Then its not too far fetched that one single silver player might have a hard time winning 100% of the time in bronze.\n\nDo i win more than the average bronze player? yes actually, the average bronze player has an overall winrate of between 43-45% mines currrently even after the 10 lose streak, still at 48% and before that streak it was at 48.5% and rising, its going up not down, not staying where it is, steadily rising at a rate of about half a percent per week, depending on if i have a lose streak that week or not.\n\nWill i get out of bronze? yes eventually im damn sure thats pretty clear to anyone with half a brain by now considering i can and do win games.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho The ADC","date":"2016-09-03T06:25:20.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Im angry that despite having a 62% winrate over what is it 102 games now on akali?
