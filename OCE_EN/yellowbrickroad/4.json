So you make that button, and you use a function call tied to that button like say Home() and when you call Home it loads the front page, ezpz.\r\n\r\nProgress bar? Ezpz just download a file list, calculate a percentage based on that list, for every file that completes bump the percentage up a touch by the calculated value, badda bing badda boom progress bar.\r\n\r\nRegion switcher? also easy its just more buttons, which in turn change a variable.\r\n\r\nWhat is that variable? that variable is the region variable that is used by other functions to determine which files to load.\r\n\r\nNext please.\r\n\r\nHelp? more buttons again, repair button just does a verification of the files to a downloaded md5 checksum and if it finds any anomalies it redownloads them.\r\n\r\nPlayer support? just load the player support website inside the client, like the patch notes, thats actually an improvement on the current method of just opening it in your browser btw.\r\n\r\nlogs is simple, just push log files out and start a new log when pressed.\r\n\r\nAbout standard practice here doesn&#039;t even need explaining.\r\n\r\nOptions are simple again.\r\n\r\nI think we get the point, a 5 year old could&#039;ve coded the current league client.\r\n\r\nNot one feature of it actually requires some super advanced coding knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo how could i do it better? simple, im not a dumb shit who just went &quot;lets put everything in the one client because that couldnt possibly fuck up&quot;\r\n\r\nFor instance, i would personally separate the repair client from the patcher, the patcher could still be used to launch the repair client as it is now by just calling the repair.exe file, but it would save complete fuck ups where the patcher breaks, as currently the only solution to that is a complete reinstall, as riot doesn&#039;t include the repair function in the installer leaving your only repair button inside the patcher.\r\n\r\nAnd trust me, the patcher breaks, alot.\r\n\r\nSomething else i would do is apply the aforementioned network check to allow for automatic resumption of patching.\r\n\r\nAnd id also allow for selection of the download folder as in this day and age most of us run a 120gb ssd for the os and frankly having to download the league install files to that drive tends to not work out (i have to perform hdd management magic every time i want to reinstall league, despite league fitting on the drive before the reinstall (because again fucking logic right))\r\n\r\nId also add a button to completely migrate league installs so users dont have to go trawling through their regedits looking for any related registry files (though i have a feeling there arent any because in this day and age id sure hope people have learnt to fucking code a dynamic directory using the parent directory of the .exe)","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-05-16T05:58:42.722+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I hate to be the one, but it looks like you need better Internet.
