They focus on FARMING and PUSHING LANES, not kills. NO CHASING EVER!\n2. They DON'T focus on dragons at all, unless the enemies are dead and no lanes can be pushed/other objectives taken. Don't bother with it, it's a dumb objective in season 6. And no, I don't care if you think you are closer to 5 dragons, pushing lane is BETTER.\n3. They don't blame lag, their brothers/sisters, or any other BS for their mistakes leading to their death. Can't stand whiners.\n4. They pay attention to the map, as well as health/mana bars (especially important for the jungler).\n5. They don't talk like retarded yank valley girls, with \"your mom\" jokes and the such. We are from Oceania, not retardedville.\n\nIf you find players that do these things, feel free to add me.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-18T04:33:01.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The first dragon gives 6% AP and ad\nThe second gives +180 damage to attacks on turrets\nThe third gives 5% movement speed\nThe fourth gives 20% damage reduction from turrets\nThe fifth doubles all of these and gives true damage.\n\nTell me again how dragon is dumb","replies":[{"poster":"NoVe1tY","date":"2016-02-18T07:12:44.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fattyhotdogs,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=nTXeRglE,comment-id=00010001,timestamp=2016-02-18T04:33:01.512+0000)\n>\n> The first dragon gives 6% AP and ad\n> The second gives +180 damage to attacks on turrets\n> The third gives 5% movement speed\n> The fourth gives 20% damage reduction from turrets\n> The fifth doubles all of these and gives true damage.\n> \n> Tell me again how dragon is dumb\n\nI think what they mean is that if you want to win, there are priorities in league, and dragon is at the bottom of the barrel atm in season 6. Take it when no higher priorities are on the table, such as pushing a lane or taking a tower.\n\nI agree with the points though. In general bronze can't think ahead 10 seconds. They see a player, they chase a player. Despite a 30cs minion wave in the top lane about to crash into their tower. The get the kill, woo, but they just lost 2 kills and map pressure in terms of gold. Perhaps the enemies also took a tower on the other side of the map. Worth? Only to bronze who don't think about the **TEAM**'s plight, only their own gold.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-07T13:48:47.407+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like my kinda guy tbh.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Button Smash","date":"2016-02-18T02:10:40.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im on most weekdays and i would love some help to get out of bronze \nPref sup but can jungle and top","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlesschocxD","date":"2016-02-17T08:32:31.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"im in, i can play adc better than other roles but im open to pretty much anything, i can play to the style you wish and my only ask is that we have some form of vocal communication so we can synergize well, cheers add me on lol if interested","replies":[]},{"poster":"FrostysFire","date":"2016-02-10T09:45:46.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me Im stuck in bronze 1 i was silver 3 in preseason and im comfortable playing sup,jg,top respectively","replies":[]},{"poster":"PorkForest","date":"2016-02-09T05:36:23.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is 6 enough?
