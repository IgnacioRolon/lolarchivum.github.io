Your point os valid. As i was not in your game i cannot comment to all of the factors that allowed the opposing team to get 3 infernals. I can however make some points that may be relevant. \n\n1. Dragon control is 100% on the entire team not just the jungler. If your teams laners are continually being pushed in they offer 0 support to contest nutural objectives. This can cause the dragons to go uncontested to the oposing team. \n\n2. Top lane. My personal favorite is to pressure the hell out of top lane and get some deep wards in their top side jungle. As soon as our team realises that their jungler has come top to help their laner out my team jumps on dragon or another play on bot side. \n\n3. Team mates asking for ganks. You would have had some experiance of \"an over needy laner\" continually demanding ganks... this can disrupt the jumglers ability to form vision / control over the nuteral objectives. \n\n4. Strong early junglers / weak early junglers. There are some jungle champs that can take dragons early solo. There are many champs that are not able to do so. The early game junglers tend to be agressive. Getting deep wards in the enemy jungle so they know whe  they can safely sneak an early solo dragon.\n\n\nHopefully some of that was relevant to your game / games.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-01-28T13:15:38.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nope none of it was, we were ahead by like 12 kills before that first dragon.\n\ni was happily roaming around doing the junglers ganking for him (he ganked like once that game and afk farmed)\n\nAnd we lost the first drag to him taking blue buff instead of coming to drag like we pinged.\n\nAnd he lost the second drag because he initiated the drag by smiting.\n\nHe single handedly threw the game by basically being deadweight for the team.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-30T11:18:53.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=I55tQ5xP,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-28T13:15:38.810+0000)\n>\n> He single handedly threw the game by basically being deadweight for the team.\n\nAnd this is the fallacy of bronze thinking. You have to adapt if you want to win. Shitters are everywhere in bronze. Some may be good at strategy but bad at mechanics, or vice versa. In the early stages of a game you can pretty much work out what level your teammates are on. And then it's time to adapt. \n\n[Take the following game for example](http://imgur.com/a/stopj). The mid laner went spaz throughout the whole game. They didn't adapt to a different situation, and as such, they played the worst on our team. The game was a clown fiesta, but the ones that adapted won the game. In most cases games are not decided by one missed skillshot, or how many dragons a team got. Sometimes a game can be decided by a late game teamfight, but the majority of games are decided by mindset and thinking. For another example of this is the game 2 of the Chiefs vs Tainted Minds played last Sunday. Chiefs were winning, but Tainted Minds were making a comeback until their top laner got lazy and greedy and wasn't thinking, got caught stealing a buff, which lead to a lost baron and teamfight, and losing the game. They didn't lose because Chiefs had more dragons though.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-01-30T16:25:48.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok it seems i have to explain further.\n\nThe game was lost by a late game teamfight you are correct.\n\nThe late game teamfight was lost because they had 124% gold efficiency for their damage items and were roughly equal with us in gold (mostly because the dragon gold efficiency made them equal with us when they were behind which meant we stopped stomping them into the ground every time we fought, instead they started picking up kills here and there in fights instead of getting aced which let them catch up), which means they had 24% more gold than us, effectively, give or take a few percent for hybrid items and tank items.\n\nThat means that those dragons alone in a 5v5 scenario made them stronger than us.\n\nThose dragons were lost because at every point in the game where we were able to take a dragon and we signaled amumu to come he just afk farmed, which would promptly be followed by the enemy team arriving at dragon because someone on their team had the same exact thought.\n\nBasically amumu did throw the game.\n\nHe didnt throw the game by missing a skill shot or anything like that.\n\nHe threw the game, by making a mistake multiple times, that led to a series of events that enabled an end game teamfight to be lost purely from gold efficiency.\n\nThey didnt have some god like cc on their team.\n\nThey werent especially good, like i said we started the game by just absolutely stomping them into the ground like, i was 7/1 by 10 minutes level of stomping them into the ground.\n\nThey were just plain stronger than us with the dragons.\n\nIs it typical bronze fallacy to recoginse the direct cause for a loss, and instead of blaming that working backwards through the series of events that led to that direct cause to find the true cause of the problem?\n\nBecause thats what i did, thats what i do everytime i blame someone.\n\nFor instance if my adc dies 10 times to the fed to the balls warwick while under his tower am i going to blame that adc? No, a typical bronzie might.\n\nBut my first thought is \"who initially fed warwick, before he had any kills\" because the adc has an excuse, namely that warwick was already able to one shot him by the time he reached his lane, so who didnt have an excuse, who died when warwick was weak, who made the mistake.\n\nThats who i blame, not the adc.\n\nJust like how i blame amumu for allowing the enemy team to recoup their strength, rather than my team for fucking up the teamfight.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-31T02:08:08.924+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's still never one mans fault in a bronze/silver games. 3 infernals isn't a game decider. 4-5 tower advantage generally is. if you can't get drakes, just work on rotating and getting towers, if you can open an inhibitor before 20min whilst still having your middle tier towers in every lane, the game is generally over, bar some major screw up.
