Most recently around 50% of the games I've played, we lost considerably bad early and the comebacks have been real and sudden. So from that aspect I will give credit to riot that maybe they did better than i originally thought.\nThough I will still express my disappointment at the statement so widely and consistently used by riot to describe the new changes as \"balanced\" . Now the game is at a point where it's fun for the op assassins and heavy damage dealers but for those with more utility or support champs it is extremely frustrating and under-appreciated. The original concept of the game where you could pick any number of champs and skill would win against different kits is over. These days op champs get picked and you have to set a whole team to specifically counter pick. We all know who the op champs are, you only have to look at the majority of ranked games ban list to see who needs to be nerfed. I really cant understand why it's taking so long for riot to see that, but hey I'm just like the majority of us wanting to enjoy a fun game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Krebitz","date":"2015-12-08T03:25:25.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"losing lane does not equal losing game regardless unless you like get rekt hard enough in lane that the enemy carry ends up beng 8/0 with a 70cs and 2 tower lead with an early rift herald or something ridiculous like that which snowballs the game out of control.\n\nFact is, the pre-season changes were designed to make early game more important and that's why games end faster.

Bronze/silver games are different because people don't know what to do once they are ahead or behind. They may not group or pressure objectives giving the enemy team a chance to catch up. In high plat it is different. Once a snowballing team is ahead they will pressure objectives. If you don't group with the team and farm passively in a lane you will just lose towers/drags/etc. Throws can happen but it's less likely since that team would have to make a big mistake. Also there are champions which snowball and scaling better than others which does mean some champions aren't balanced. If an irelia or a jax get 2 kills top you won't be able to come near the minions to farm unless you are under tower. There are more champions which are unbalance but we can't ban them all in champ select.You really need to take in skill level when you post something like this. Bronze/Silver elo are people who are still learning the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-06T09:59:49.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarmwsuR9sDRObyU/giphy.gif","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-12-06T10:29:32.698+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=iy4F5uK0,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-06T09:59:49.421+0000)\n>\n> https://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarmwsuR9sDRObyU/giphy.gif\n\nhttp://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw81sv8jEu1qbvovho1_500.gif","replies":[]}]}]}
