fuck yes, if i get one particularly retarded %%%% of a human being i will feed for 4-6 games in a row easily while it try to fucking calm down from wanting to piledrive the %%%% through his keyboard.\n\nWill it clean up ranked because there wont be as many salty mother fuckers? yes.\n\nWhy arent we doing it? \"hur durr thatd be unfur for the bad players\" good, it should be, they should be in bots, or norms, fucking practicing.\n\nIf they want to play ranked you have to go in with a \"i am here to win mentality\" if you cant fucking win a lane by yourself, without spamming chat for help, you dont belong in ranked, because that forces the jg to camp your lane, which makes the other 2 lanes suffer from lack of counter ganks, then any enemy jg with half a brain cell will notice this and camp those 2 lanes and win the game that way.\n\nAnd unfortunately as fucking stupid as bronze players are they still have half a brain cell, so they can do that.\n\nAlso your definition of carry is way askewed by smurfs and shit.\n\nWhat i call a carry is literally the most fed person on the team, regardless of kda.\n\n0/15/30 thresh winning all your teamfights for you? hes the fucking carry.\n\n2/10/5 tryndamere just destroyed literally all the enemies turrets, including all the t1's? sorry 10/5 graves, but trynds the carry.\n\nAnyone that provides some form of meaningful contribution to the team that goes above and beyond getting kills, which is easy as fuck in bronze, is the real carry.\n\nIf you want to judge a players worth based on how many kills they got, go play csgo, go play cod, go play anything that has a win condition based on kills.\n\nBut dont play league, league doesnt have a ticker, there isnt some secret win condition where if you get 500 kills you win the game instantly.\n\nKills only serve the purpose of gold income, and later on getting them on the death timer for mad pushes. literally the only reason they exist.\n\nleague is so much about the pushing that you could make players invincible and buff minions, itd still be playable.\n\nYoud just lose 90% of the fucking anime wannabee %%%gots that all want to be gosu or faker.\n\nWhich ironically would make bronze more bearable.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-16T08:46:16.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what was the point of this post?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-16T09:27:27.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Vent anger.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-16T10:15:55.514+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good job, Boards hates you.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-02-16T08:54:41.872+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol I'm not gonna look up your history in fear of getting AIDS, but tell me you're not learning a champ in ranked.
