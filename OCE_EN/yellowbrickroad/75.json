It would be extremely easy to implement, if the person wasn't autofilled and they dodge the penalty remains as it is. If the person was autofilled and they dodge they get a much more severe penalty.\n\nAnd the second thing they need to do is queue dodges should never count towards your 2 games auto fill protection. As you can see in my thread I've now had 4 days in a row without a single game where I wasn't autofilled. Because when I get my lane the autofilled person dodges, then I get my lane again and again the autofilled person dodges. Then the game removes autofill protection because it counts those 2 dodged queues as my autofill protected games. Then next game I get autofilled. I played 5 games today, all 5 were autofilled. This has happened to me repeatedly for 4 days straight","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-11-15T15:24:42.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Donâ€™t Necro","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-16T23:29:09.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A reward for it may be a good idea.

Like in its current iteration all autofill manages to do is slow down peoples climbs because on average every 10 games you will be autofilled twice.\n\nSo 2 of your 10 games you will have a much lower chance of winning.\n\nWhich makes it so that if you have an average winrate below 63% the odds are stacked against you\n\nI say 63% because if you win 63% of the 8 games that werent autofilled you will have won 5 games and lost 3.\n\nAt that point if you win both your autofilled games you will have a 70% winrate, if you lose both your autofill games you will have a 50% winrate.\n\nIn otherwords autofill makes it so you have to win 13% more games on average just to maintain a 50% winrate assuming you always lose your autofilled games due to your autofilled roles being played to a much lower level than your main roles.\n\nYet there are no systems in place to mitigate that inherent LP decline in the design.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Examqle","date":"2017-02-17T00:44:56.025+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AXfNb12y,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-02-16T23:29:09.730+0000)\n>\n> A reward for it may be a good idea.
