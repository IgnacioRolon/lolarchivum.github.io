We investigated your intents and found that this account, the one you're posting on, has been getting logged in to from all over the world.\n\nSo we locked it in order to protect it. If you want to ensure it is secure, please lodge a ticket to recover the account as at this point multiple people have access and the original owner needs to be proven so we can unlock it and ensure only they have access.\n\nRegarding your intent to ruin other peoples' games, please don't.
