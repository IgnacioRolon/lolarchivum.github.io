The way they name their runes and/or masteries (the \"main\" no longer has mastery pages besides 1 left-over due to inactivity before seasonal wipe) do correlate in some manner. The pages are either named with proper acronyms and/or letter-casing, or they'd be casual naming/acronyms/letter-casing combined with dry humour. The catch seems to be that those 2 type of naming behaviour are almost completely independent from each other making it a distinct characteristic, and both of the 2 accounts seem to share that.\n* The 2 seem to both favour Tahm and Riven to a certain extent, at least enough for 1 acc to play them somewhat often and for the \"main\" acc to have rune pages dedicated to them (though the \"main\" acc only played Riven once and Tahm none in their last 20 matches recorded in their profile).\n\nArgument against:\n\n* That \"main\" acc has been inactive for a little more than a full year, the last game in that acc was played in Oct 2015. I am not saying it's impossible, but the chances is rather low for someone to just leave their main behind for more than a year and play on their smurf only. Unless they got perm'ed or something otherwise I wouldn't bet too much money on that.\n* The \"main\" acc have rune pages (since masteries are wiped with only 1 remain) dedicated to Diana, Riven, Tahm, jg Vi specifically, Cho'gath, Gangplank, a joke page supposedly for AP Malphite, and many shall we say, \"generic\" pages designed to cover some position without addressing specific champions (\"fill\" pages essentially); and the last mastery page remained was dedicated to Viktor. Meanwhile that 1 acc in question has all rune pages to be \"generic\", and the mastery pages are dedicated to Riven, Rammus, Mundo, Alistar, Olaf, and otherwise un-named or incomplete mastery pages. These 2 behaviours and preferences don't seem to be relate-able in this instance.\n\nYou could think this through the present them to the Rioter if needed. However, don't be too asserting, because you never know whether or not that guy was just bulls'ing after he'd dug up a seemingly abandoned account or that he was the legitimate owner of that supposed \"main\" who for whatever reason is now doing god knows what in low rank exclusively.\n\nWhile technically smurfing isn't against the game's law (or is it now?), but if they're legit only dk'ing around as a smurf and occasionally behaving to avoid being banned by the system, I'm sure there are also ways around to deal with them, and if there isn't, at least this shall serve as a case study backing say the return of Tribunal, hopefully.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-18T16:03:19.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"How exactly are you so sure they are the same person?
