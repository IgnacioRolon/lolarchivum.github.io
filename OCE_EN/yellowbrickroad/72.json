Looks like they feed on everyone, but are just learning how to play Lux, who they haven't fed **as much** on.\n\nAs for the Ahri, thats just a normal bronzer/troller who has no clue what the support role means.\n\nI think for promos, Riot gives you shitters on your team, so that you have to demonstrate that you can carry yourself up a division. Happens to me often also (which is not great for a support main).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-12-26T00:33:12.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hahaha probably a troll losing on purpose to get to bronze 5 high elo players do it all the time on smurfs","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-26T05:22:22.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-12-26T01:56:01.053+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"damn dude u deserve challenger :////// unlucky","replies":[]}]}
