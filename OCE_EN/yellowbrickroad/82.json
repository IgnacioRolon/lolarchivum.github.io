And here they are, banning a Challenger player as a symbol of \"we will not tolerate toxicity no matter who you are\", but that's apparently just because he's popular.\n\nYou also do realise \"I got falsely banned\" is also a thing right (I mean we have one of those threads created just a couple hours before this one, it's far more noticeable if you frequent NA board)?\n\nSo which is it, does Riot ban people accordingly or that they don't?\n\nYou can't just go setting the goalpost to wherever you want it to be, you know.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-31T08:53:20.098+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually that perfectly fits his pitch.\n\nriot doesnt care about low elo players, in turn doesnt help that elo improve by banning said toxic players.\n\nRiot cares about challenger players, so removed a particularly toxic challenger player from the game to improve the QOL of the remaining challenger players.\n\nbecause ill make this very clear.\n\nThe two players i am talking about in the op, name removed and name removed.\n\nAre not players.\n\nThey are smurfs made purposefully to troll low elo and ONLY troll low elo.\n\nThey do not play rotating game modes, they do not play norms.\n\nThey just queue ranked games at late night oce to troll lower elo players, they prey at late night because they are more likely to get the same victim more than once due to the smaller playerbase.\n\nThose two are sadistic fucking trolls who get their kicks off of angering and downright ruining the games of people that are lower ranks than them.\n\nAND RIOT DOES NOTHING.\n\nWant more proof that riot does nothing? check this comment in a couple of hours.\n\nOne of their staff will have removed the names from this post or even delete it.\n\nBut they wont be banned.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-27T13:26:22.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"pretty much accurate yeah.","replies":[]}]}]}
