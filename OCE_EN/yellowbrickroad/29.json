My experience has been  that getting out of low bronze has been harder and more frustrating than climbing from b1 to s4. B5 is a river you are stuck in. B4 are rocks where you can see hand holds but the rocks are slippery and brittle - you know what YOU have to do but environmental factors make the climb very difficult.  B2 is when you are clear of the slippery rocks, b1 is when the rocks dont snap off, and from s1 it is up to you to climb based on your awareness of the best path.\n\nBut i strongly feel that a version of elo hell does exist - not impossible to climb out of but very very difficult when your team mates are potatoes.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-01-18T22:51:10.465+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"^ literally what im saying, i KNOW that i can get out of bronze, its the time factor that pisses me off, at the current rate that my winrate is creeping up (my elo is so low that 90% of the playerbase are either school kids, have shit net, or are trolls and smurfs, im not kidding probably 10% of the playerbase are over the age of 18 and actually give a damn and yes i can attribute school kids in my rant because my winrate goes down during school holidays and goes up when kids are at school so weather they are tilting me or just bringing me down they do affect me in some way) I probably wont see silver until s7 or late s6 at the earliest.\n\nLike sometimes i wish id never found out that league uses an mmr system, so i could be blissfully ignorant and just keep basing my worth on lp because then i could actually feel good when i shoot from b5 to b1 instead of thinking \"great now im gonna get like 5lp per win because my mmr is still trash\"","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-01-19T06:37:03.733+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still die SOOO much bro.
