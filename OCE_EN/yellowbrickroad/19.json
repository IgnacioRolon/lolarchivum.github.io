But I could just play some normal champion and probably be gold or plat in the same number of games. You dont have to play meta stuff, but playing something so heavily outclassed like AD soraka support is just setting you up to fail. You might as well just be playing a normal ADC champ as a support in that case, at least then you have some scaling to work with. If you're managing to get half decent scores with stuff that bad, you're mechanics clearly aren't the problem.\n\nLike, you're gunna be playing against someone and asking 'how could I have played that better', and half the time the only answer they will be able to give is \"your champion/build is so easy to exploit, theres nothing you could do there\". you're not gunna learn anything from that.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-03-27T00:24:30.387+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Implying im getting half decent scores in the first place haha.\n\nBut yeah i get what you mean, what im getting at is if i play against people who are able to punish my mistakes i will be forced to adapt and correct myself.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-03-27T08:56:14.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://i.imgur.com/7OnpDwf.png\n\nWhy the hell you building {{item:3303}} \n\nWhy the hell you playing AP Warwick?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-03-28T04:12:10.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bronze.
