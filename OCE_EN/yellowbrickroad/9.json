I also remember the time before we had a tribunal, and riot had to do reports manually.\n\nLet me tell you right now, you want a tribunal, and you want it now not 3 more years from now.\n\nBecause trust me riot isnt fucking working on it, they may say they are, but they also said they were taking the tribunal off for a short \"maintenance\" back in 2014.\n\nTell me, does maintenance take 2 years for literally a system that just presented report cases to a stand of players and asked them if the offendee is guilty? (you know like how a real unbiased tribunal works)\n\nLike who the fuck is riot fooling, they didnt take 2 years to fucking code a backend for that, they took 2 years to make the automatic systems that are failing so fucking hard and used the whole \"tribunal is coming\" shit to deflect any argumentative backlash about said systems and are waiting for us to all forget about the tribunal existing.\n\nAnd why? Because one of the things that they think made the tribunal work was it rewarded players for cases, and riot hates free shit.\n\nRealllllly good fucking reason for scrapping your most successful system that cleaned up the game and actually made it fucking fun riot.\n\n\nAs for the 20 games a day, i have insomnia, no job (and can multitask so i tend to apply for jobs while i play) and frankly never really got into sports or excercise in general, so how else am i going to spend my 15-18 hours a day that im awake.\n\nTheres only so many things i could do.\n\nBut its also why im dead convinced that the report systems dont work and the toxicity in the community is super downplayed, because never in my history of playing league have i seen it get this bad before, and im not playing one or two games and getting a bad one and saying \"half my games are bad\" im playing like twenty games, and getting two or three games with good players that dont rage.","replies":[{"poster":"PROJECT Cosco","date":"2016-04-26T08:17:37.598+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying we dont need a tribunal, am I? :)\n\nI'm saying the way you're goin for it is quite immature and very very useless.
