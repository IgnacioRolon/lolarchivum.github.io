You have such a black and white view on everything. \nA) LP gains or losses also take into account the skill level of your oponents. How are you gonna sit there and tell us you know the Mmr of your oponents as well? Just fucking accept your Mmr for whatever it is. Win more games. Like, seriously... You still have  47% win rate. Why the fuck would your elo climb with 47 fucking percent win rate. \nB) fucking teamwork is skill. I've watched some of your games over this year. You literally play like you speak. One man Rambo. And it's God awful to watch. Talk up your 1v1 game all you want BUT IT'S NOT A 1V1 FUCKING GAME.  Go learn how to be part of a team. Go join the military or something. Fuck. \nC) I keep repeating this to you.

The system works for a lot of people. The only factor in every single one of your games, is you. \n\nHonestly, I REALLY think that you should take some time to consider your idea of team play. It's not just jumping into a fight when your team mate gets caught out.\n\nAnd again. Stop dying so much.
