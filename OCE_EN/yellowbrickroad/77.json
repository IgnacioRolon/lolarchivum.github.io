I like being able to play with supports that compliment the team pick (especially ap damage supports for when my team is all ad, tank supports for when we don't have a tank or engage supports for when I feel bored) though I'm getting rusty with alistair so I might need to revisit him and finish off his m6.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-09-02T00:31:03.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rule no.1 of mage supports, is if your damage isn't bigger than the sum of the adc and midlaner (despite you only having assist gold, remember you have base damage, stack cdr and mana and harass in lane constantly so your damage should be massive) you are a disappointment to the role.\n\nRule no.1 of tank supports, if you don't have at least 5x as many assists as deaths and you aren't tanking all the enemy big cds and damage without dying, you should be trying harder and picking better engages.\n\nRule no.1 of supports in general, but a sightstone and make sure that you know where the enemies are at all times and that you clear all the important routes of wards.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-09-01T10:07:07.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guaranteed pick stuff is great.
