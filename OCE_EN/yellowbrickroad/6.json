You say youre tilted, yet when i went to check your match history, i found you were live in game. If you want to climb, dont play tilted. There are many videos and ways to attempt to untilt yourself.\n2. If you tilt easily, thats a personal problem not one for anyone to fix or tolerate but you.\n3. You should really look up a guide for the most optimal way to play this game. If you want to win at the game, you play it the best way possible. Taking teleport flash with warlords bloodlust and rushing runaans and bloodthirster is not optimal on any champion that im aware of.\n\nLastly if you do not perform consistently you WILL NOT climb. period.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-21T13:22:53.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"see the problem is im basically perpetually tilted.\n\nLike shit first game of the day i was tilted within the first 3 minutes.\n\nAnd its mostly because this game is fucking piss easy to play.\n\nLike i can understand if you have bad mechanics or something, i do too.\n\nBut if you cant use more than two brain cells and say \"well the last 5 times i went this deep i died, maybe i should just farm under turret\" then yes, i will get pissed at you.\n\nNot because i lost the game, because with my history it could take 1 game or it could take a whole week, i will eventually repair the damage you did to my mmr.\n\nThe reason im pissed is because you came into a game, knowing full well that you literally suck at league.\n\nAnd didnt think for 2 fucking seconds \"am i actually ready to play ranked?\"\n\nkeeping in mind when i refer to you i dont mean you specifically but the person who tilts me.\n\nLike shit im a huge proprietor for the whole \"you have to meet X performance metric before you unlock the ranked queue\"\n\nWill people get pissy because they cant play ranked? sure, but those same people shouldn't be playing ranked anyway.\n\nIt worked in world of warcraft with the silver medal proving grounds tests before you can queue for heroic dungeons in WoD.\n\nThey were piss easy to do, like shit i did the healer medal and tank medal with my DPS death knight by simply killing things faster than they can cause me to fail because im a raider so it wasn't hard to press buttons in the right order, and target the right things.\n\nBut the magic thing that happened? heroics stopped being cancer, you didnt have tanks that aggroed entire dungeons and wiped the group because the healer couldnt keep up.\n\nYou didn't have dps doing wet paper bag damage.\n\nAnd you didn't have healers spamming heals on themselves and ignoring the tank.\n\nBecause my god, its almost like all the trash players were locked out of more difficult content that they couldn't cope with at that point.\n\nAnd you know what, they all eventually got to play that content anyway because they got better.\n\nBy doing the tests over and over until they got their entry requirements they learned fundamental mechanics.\n\nIf they implemented that same system into league would i be able to play ranked? probably not, my cs is trash and I still lack a few core mechanics.\n\nBut id be fine with that knowing full well that if i work hard and EARN my way into ranked id be able to play a ranked that doesn't consist of literal retards.\n\nAs it currently stands im super demotivated to improve not because i dont think i can, but simply because any improvement will be for naught while im still in an elo that the only people ive seen solo carry in have been diamond players.\n\nLike shit i queue with a gold smurf everynow and then, he cant fucking solo carry.\n\nhes fucking gold 2.\n\nHow am i meant to carry when at best i might be silver if not b1 or b2.\n\nNot to mention in the current elo that i play i have no room to improve on myself as it is.\n\nThese players, play worse than fucking intermediate bots.\n\nAnd even intermediate bots i can easily carry and win a game, so theres literally no fucking queue that i can join to play against people at or above my skill level so i atleast have a venue to stretch myself thin and force myself to adapt.\n\nThe closest i had was when i was 1v1ing a gold player daily and you know what we discovered from that? that im actually half decent and my best skill comes in the form of positional plays, so things like poppy e's where you do some weird snowball flash e to knock them into your own turret.\n\nThe %%%% couldnt even figure out why i was bronze aside from my cs.\n\nAnd even then my csing isnt too terrible because when im having a good day and im happy i will consistently hit atleast 6cs per minute up to 7 cs per minute, which isnt perfect but also isnt a far cry from the far reaching goal of 10 per minute.\n\nLike what am i supposed to do, suddenly magically turn into faker over night so i can turbo my way to a higher elo and practice there instead?","replies":[{"poster":"Dub","date":"2016-05-21T13:43:21.077+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well from the perspective of someone who has climbed out of bronze five before, Im not going to tell you youre wrong. Im getting the point that if you spend your time and energy blaming everyone else how will you improve? \n\nI took a step back and changed my attitude. I educated myself about this game.\n\nNow i agree solo carrying is extremely difficult BUT you said you have a friend who cant solo carry you out? that tells me youre apart of the problem, throughout this entire post all you have proved is that you cant see the problems with you and your play before you see your teammates mistakes.\n\nAnd you getting 'pissed' doesn't improve their play at all.
