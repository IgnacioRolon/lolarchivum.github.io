The MMR system will eventually place them where they belong and they will climb once their personal mechanics have improved, but until Riot designs a better ranking system we all just have to accept the fact that there are players out there who are worse than us.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-11-04T23:25:44.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The point of the test is not to create a skill barrier but to point out which skills are lacking.\n\nAs i mentioned in the my original post most of the people in bronze, myself included are not in bronze because we are incapable of learning.\n\nBut rather because we had no idea where we were shit in the first place.\n\nAs an example the reason my map awareness is so bloody good is ive spent the last 6 months focusing on that and pretty much nothing else.\n\nAs i was convinced thats where i was lacking.\n\nTurns out this was the complete opposite as map awareness is my strongest skill apparently.\n\nHad i known this months ago from some form of skill test i wouldve moved on to practicing more beneficial skills like csing.\n\nAs was stated in the link i posted you can spend one day going from a 0 level skill to a 40 or 50\n\nOr you could spend a week going from a 50 to a 60\n\nWhich is better to spend your time on? knocking out all the 0 level skills, or perfecting the ones you already have for less benefit and overall slower progress.\n\nTo put it another way, if i was putting the same effort i put into my map awareness, in the skills i actually needed to work on? who knows i couldve been diamond by now, but i had no idea.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-11-04T23:30:18.110+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Another way to look at this is, bronze players most crucial skill we are lacking.\n\nIs the ability to drop our egos, and asses our own skills to find our weaknesses, this is something you cannot attain through natural practice as to be able to asses yourself skillwise you must first have the skills you are assessing, or the age old adage, practicing doesnt make perfect, practicing perfection makes perfect, or in otherwords in order to get better at a skill you must know what that skill is how it works, why you cant do it, how to do it etc etc, sure you can use critical analysis to breakdown a skill, but we see time and time again that this is subpar to being told how the skill works, then taking that information and applying it practically so you can get firsthand understanding.\n\nBut that doesn't stop you from taking on constructive criticism (the ego part does but the inability for self assessment doesn't)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Candy Kayn","date":"2015-11-02T09:32:33.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upvote for name","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-11-01T23:12:35.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ummmmm, not sure about that test thing.
