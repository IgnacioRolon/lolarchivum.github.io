Therefore you allow the other team to group up, take you down, which then leads you to lose what lead you had over time, and potentially making you tilt and lose the game.\n\nI highly recommend checking out these videos. They teach you how to take your lead and spread it to other lanes, leading to a win.\n- [Leaguecraft 101 Episode 6 How To Roam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bp932bJRXA&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz&index=6)\n- [Leaguecraft 101 Episode 8 How To Carry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQr0dgCYKhw&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz&index=8)\n- [Leaguecraft 101 Episode 18 Mid Game and Rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_Rbj_71s08&list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz&index=18)","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-25T11:29:05.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tbh none of that is news to me, but i appreciate the attempt","replies":[{"poster":"littlemisscheeky","date":"2017-05-25T23:43:45.450+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"If none of this is news to you, your fate is in your hands.

My ping was so bad that I just played Annie Support and called for my Jungler ONCE for ONE all-in and just got my team to rotate well enough that we could consolidate a lead and close out the game methodically. Double kill bot. Take Dragon. Back. Take mid. Back. Spend and close out game with huge gold lead.","replies":[]}]}
