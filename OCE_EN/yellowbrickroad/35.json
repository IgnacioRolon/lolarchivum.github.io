Haha\n\nBut in saying that if you know how to play her properly, whether they know how to counter you or not, if you can play her properly you would destroy your enemies with the right opportunities you can do almost anything really, buy that's true of any champ I just think with Illaoi it's extra crucial, so ganking can secure you kills either because they ganked or you had help (or for those skilled enough who were the jungler).\nMost of the time that's when I get my most opportunistic kills because my opponents underestimated me and tried for a 2 v 1 and maybe tower dived thinking that they had the drop on me, even though I usually wait for that to actually have something interesting happen up top instead of just happily farming away and harrassing with my tentacles XD","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-24T06:20:40.259+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah its fervor kayle with guinsoo whats you on about","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-24T06:45:49.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nah willis she can proc thunderlords in one auto if you q first and have e on (if e isnt always on wtf you playing kayle for)\n\nGet a ludens and a bitch ton of ap and you can one shot a %%%%%%.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-24T09:04:57.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so 1 shot and then die, or 1v5 and come out unscathed and with a penta? pretty sure the latter is better","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-24T11:06:36.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 shot adc, then 2 shot tank, then pop ult because that assasin is getting cocky, one shot him too.\n\nOh your low? good thing you have heaps of AP and can heal yourself.\n\nGranted ive been playing her AD Crit today, so much better with thunderlords and 100% crit chance.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-24T11:32:44.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thats not what you were saying, you were saying go full ap so they die after a aa, but ou would have super low aa speed and q would be on a 4.5 sec cd (max cdr), you then proceed to die useless","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-24T12:53:36.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude nashors.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Brucey","date":"2016-05-24T05:26:46.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever someone picks {{champion:420}} i laugh and instalock {{champion:75}} She can't do anything vs him free stacks for him every tentacle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"og1764","date":"2015-12-03T03:09:10.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Counter new champions?\n{{champion:10}} can do it","replies":[]}]}
