I assume you mean the Club system that's currently on PBE.\n\nI'm not sure if you've seen it already but **Surrender at 20** has a really informative post about this, that might answer some of your questions. I recommend you check it out [here](http://www.surrenderat20.net/p/current-pbe-balance-changes.html#unreleased).\n\nIf it's not on there, it's probably not a feature. **Moobeat** is really good at picking up on the small things usually.\n\nKeep in mind though it is the PBE, so anything can change at any time. What we see there now might be very different to what goes on to live, if anything at all.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-14T11:02:49.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep ive seen it, it answers none of my questions.\n\nEdit: Oh and when did you become an emissary, grats dude.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-02-14T23:53:31.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's not on there it's likely not a yet feature then.\n\nI did notice that when **Moobeat** invited people you could see their tag next to their name. \nAs you can see here:\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wd96meO_owg/VqqhzdazMoI/AAAAAAAA3bU/Ilq2wSmDKwM/s1600/inlobby.jpg\n\nThat might be useful for seeing who's in your clan when inviting, but looks like there wont be a \"sort by clan\" feature, like you were looking for just yet.\n\nI'd love to speculate a bit with you, but I'm actually discouraged on giving out too much speculation. Since people might view it as \"official\" in some way because of my emmisary status :(","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-02-15T01:41:27.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bummer can only hope, from my experience if riot wants to get sub-communities going and they want it to be more than just a gimmick they need to give mods adequate tools for the job.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
