b5, vi being b4.\n\nMy team? the really crappy one?\n\nMe b5, azir b5, xin b4, Sona b3.\n\nAnd the real kicker, vayne b1.\n\nLiterally the only person who got close to keeping up with me and still fell short was vayne.\n\nThe fact that a player practically an entire tier above me played worse, should speak volumes.\n\nAnd it also speaks volumes for the ahri.\n\nBut mostly it speaks volumes for the mmr system, and how fucking inaccurate it is, especially since dynamic queue came in.\n\nLike frankly when i think bronze 5, i think tank ashe jg mains, teemo building tiamat, runaans huricane xin zhaos (ive actually seen that before, he built two of them, i wanted to neck myself), \"you cant hit me because i used ghost so you cant see me\"\n\nI dont think players that know literally every ability in the game bar one or two.\n\nI dont think players that can play off meta bullshit that should never work and still do fairly decent (manahoy gangplank never forghetti)\n\nI dont think players that are lacking in maybe one or two skills\n\nAnd most importantly, i dont think of low silver high bronze players who are unfortunate enough to not have 4 other friends that play consistently to queue with.\n\nAnd before the skeptics jump in on me with a \"but yellow you probably just had a good game\" no, what you are looking at, is a game where i was a little tilted just a smidge but not enough to actually affect my play, that game was neither me in a motivated take on the world attitude where i go 20/0 fueled by good vibes, nor was it a \"i just had 5 teams in a row with shit teams\" tilt game, it was just normal yellow.\n\nAnd thats how i play when im not tilted as fuck.\n\nUnfortunately i dont have a replay to prove this since the timeline cant show this, but that trynd had the vi in his lane half the time to try and stop me destroying him, i still did it, so you cant even blame the trynd either since i practically 1v2'd my laning phase.\n\nBUT if you watch the timeline you will notice something strange, after my first death to ahri i start to play more sloppily, im not getting as many kills, my deaths gradually get closer and closer together etc etc.\n\nThat is literally tilt, you can physically watch me get tilted during that game by reading the timeline.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-08T04:41:16.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea u lost cause u bought 2 life line items gg","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-06-08T19:50:57.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"shitson didnt even notice steraks was a lifeline passive.\n\nIve been buying steraks and maw for like a year now.\n\nrip me.\n\nGranted if id known steraks was lifeline (which is my bad) id have bought wits end for mr instead of maw.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-08T23:38:36.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i would of skipped steraks and just bought maw and get omens or lifesteal","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-06-09T11:44:03.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its irelia, the 25% bonus base ad scales super well with the triforce (its base ad not bonus ad so it does infact boost sheen proc damage) and since tri is core on her it makes sense. also gives her much needed tank.","replies":[{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-06-14T02:47:19.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea no.
