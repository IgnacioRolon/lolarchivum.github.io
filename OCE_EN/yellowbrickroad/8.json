I also took my other account from Silver V to gold V with 133 games. \n\nthat is about 5 times LESS games than you took to remain stuck in bronze V ... so, either get off your \"I am awesome\" high horse and heed other people's advice in this and previous topics and **get better OR stay where you currently belong and quit nagging about your teammates** ...","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-24T08:51:05.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not gonna address the other shit because you are just turning into a more thought out fattyhotdogs.\n\nBut i would like to point out a contradiction.\n\nis it a team game or not?\n\nBecause its awfully convenient to say everything that goes wrong is my fault, and then turn around and say that i should prop my team up.\n\nSo really which is it, either its a teamgame and the fact that my team as a whole makes stupid calls is a problem that i cant fix personally and forces me to play snowball or split pushing champions.\n\nOr its a not a team game and i cant blame my team, but that also exempts me from needing to help my team.\n\nBut actually no you will dodge that question because you cant fucking spin it to make me look bad.\n\nActually you can you are probably gonna say something like \"well thats a shitty attitude to have\" its not shitty its realistic.\n\nLike if i see that There is an open bottom inhib tower and the enemy team is currently pushing top t2 tower who is correct here.\n\nMe for wanting to go take that tower while the enemy team takes a less important tower.\n\nor my team, for wanting to go teamfight to save the t2.\n\nBecause yes, thats what fucking happens in bronze.\n\nI could give less shits if my team is made up of nothing but faker, or if mechanically they are all potatos.\n\nbut if they treat the fucking game like a ticket match where kills make some invisible counter go down to the win.\n\nThen im gonna fucking blame them for the loss, because it is their fucking fault.\n\nits their fucking fault for not pushing towers.\n\nits their fucking fault for deciding risking their lives for a few kills was worth  it.\n\nits their fucking fault for calling baron and ignoring my pleas to not fucking baron with 4 of the enemy team up and all our lanes pushing towards us.\n\nIf that sounds general to you, good, because what i think when i think of bronze, thats my general experience, 9/10 if i boot up a game, atleast ONE of those things will happen, if not more.\n\nAnd unless im some fucking psychic god thats remotely controlling these shits stains pc's with my mind, none of that can be pinned on me.\n\nInfact the only way that could be blamed on me, is that im not a good enough retard wrangler to whip these tards into line.\n\nNow dont fucking reply unless you have something worthwhile to say that i havnt heard 50 times already.","replies":[{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-10-25T17:31:02.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=YellowBrickRoad,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nuH3QEr0,comment-id=000500010001000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-24T08:51:05.220+0000)\n>\n> Im not gonna address the other shit because you are just turning into a more thought out fattyhotdogs.\n\nyou seem to be missing a very important point here ... people giving you their time to HELP YOU are not doing it so that you can trash talk them as a \"reward\" ...

As a silver player who should be bronze they might be right sometimes but honestly it seems a little weird to claim those things about players in worlds. They justify it with well they  play with a team and aren't very good solo but I still feel they must be pro for a reason and mechanics is still quite an important part of this game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-21T05:25:30.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=fattyhotdogs,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nuH3QEr0,comment-id=00050001000000000000,timestamp=2016-10-21T04:50:49.723+0000)\n>\n> If you literally don&#x27;t make any mistakes, then stop dying and losing.

How did you get in the situation where Zed was zoning you hard? Surely you could have played things differently as to avoid at least some of the 5 deaths to Zed under tower, as you say. What could you have done better? What did the enemy Zed do right? Perhaps you can learn from what your enemy did that was effective and apply it to your future games.\n> \n> Sure, it may be partially the jungler&#x27;s fault that they didn&#x27;t help your lane and you lost. But ultimately your laning phase is your responsibility. Accept that you lost and sucked and need to improve.\n\n.. But i highly agree with Jonius too always assess the situation and see how you can improve, and learn for next time .. everyone starts out bronze just need to differentiate yourself to the true bronze","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-21T08:58:34.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is one big thing recommended for you to greatly improve yourself:\nSpectate your own replay game.\n\nTake note of your own mistakes, learn from it.\nTake note of any better things that you can do, learn from it.\nEventually you will improve.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-10-18T03:12:32.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a playlist that might help you.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCEt27AsZuvNu0RQiCwgV2j3tR4foqvI\n\nI also recommend nightblue3 video streaming for general tips and tricks.\nIn case you have not heard of nightblue3, he is currently top 50 players in NA.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Nightblue3","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-10-20T03:58:05.037+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i watch nb3's montages a fair bit, been watching him for a couple years now actually.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-10-18T10:22:11.210+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The rule is never gank a losing line as the enemy could kill both if already fed.

More often than not, my jungler will just make a bad gank and end up feeding them more. Learning how to play defensive and stall out laning phase is an important skill too.\nThat said even as a farm jungler like shyvanna, that was probably a bad choice from her to leave the lane snowballing against you. \n\nEven though I main support, when I'm jungler I'm pretty confident I can gank a lane so long as they aren't 0-4 but I generally won't go to a lane unless it's almost even or pushed to my laners side. Towerdives are generally not worth it in lower elo unless you can get the tower or another objective for the time it could take and the risk.\n\nInteresting note is that if your support seems confident and is doing okay in botlane, alot of us support mains wouldn't mind roaming mid inbetween adc backs, if you can coordinate to make use of us and you tell us you want a support roam. Not to mention I find support roams tilt midlaners harder than jungler roams by 500%. A cheeky exhaust+cc+little bit of damage goes a long way to winning the midlaner 1v1.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-17T23:12:09.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Inconsistent play imagine that.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2016-10-20T09:20:16.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Roguestoney,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=nuH3QEr0,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-10-17T23:12:09.072+0000)\n>\n> Inconsistent play imagine that.\n\nCombined with your rank, wow, that sounds like a complaint from every bronze/silver ever lmao","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jahseh Onfroy","date":"2016-10-17T19:54:39.193+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You're in bronze, everything is your fault, use that as your tool to get better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-10-27T05:13:19.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"are you still going .. dude please stop play talon mid before his rework and youll climb if you fail that then gg","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-10-27T00:22:37.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I leave League for 3 months, I come back to check and good ol bronze 5 YellowBrickRoad is still at it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-10-18T02:59:21.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Lol","replies":[]}]}
