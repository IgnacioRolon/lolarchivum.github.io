If he was calling you names or abusing you then sure, I would remove his posts just as I did yours, which were doing just that. \n\nAs for incidents in the past, if I see it and it breaks the rules I will delete or edit it, so if there's something you feel breaks the rules then do feel free to report it to ensure we see it.\n\nI'm not Riot staff, and I'm pretty sure you know that. I'm a volunteer. I don't speak for Riot, but I do help police the boards when the rules are broken. I had a similar job in my (very large since you seem to think it matters) guilds from back in the day, and I tell you they wouldn't have tolerated posts like yours that I removed either. \n\nI think maybe you are misunderstanding the point of the boards rules, namely to maintain a healthy and positive community without neutering discussion, something which you seem keen on in words (\"Never in all of my fucking days have i seen a community as bad as league of legends\") yet not so much with your actions (you know, breaking the rules for no reason other than you don't like a person).\n\nIf you feel there are posts or comments we are missing, then as I said, you are welcome to report them. I try to read every post but as an actual human being with a job and a life sometimes I have to skim through comment threads, and I can't always catch everything, the same goes for the rest of us. That said, I'm hardly in the habit of leaving negative things on boards if they don't have a valid discussion around them, so I'm rather curious as to where you get this idea from.\n\nJust as it isn't a defence in game \"he started it\" isn't one here either. If you break the rules you will face the consequences, just as they will if they have.\n\nYou don't have to respect me as a person or as a moderator, I hardly expect such a thing, but if you won't respect the rules then you will have that content removed, it's as simple as that.\n\n___\n\nTo clear up your significant misconceptions about player support, first of all, with very few exceptions, player support for English servers is all in NA and they are a small team. That small team handles all the tickets from NA ,and OCE (and I believe some EU english tickets). \n\nSecond, the player support team is COMPLETELY separate from boards, so I'm very unsure how they are going to moderate them if they are not moderators.\n\nYou also seem to be confusing two completely different environments. Moderation In thousands of game instances at once takes a lot more resources than community management on a forum or central point of reference, and relies a lot more on people actually bothering to report.\n___\ntl;dr I don't want your respect, but if you break the rules your content will be removed, same as anyone else.
