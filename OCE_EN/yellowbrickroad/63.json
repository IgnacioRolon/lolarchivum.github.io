Fuck yes.\r\n\r\nFun? Fuck yes.\r\n\r\nI could easily see myself sinking time into the game just trying different shit out like i dunno, master yi passive, with shyvana q on q and skarners q on w or something\r\n\r\nProceed to run around as ponycopter 2.o as you hit q proc  your passive instantly and reduce the cooldown of both q and w at the same time to repeat the process\r\n\r\nHell make it so you can only use champs you own as the selection pool and boom more incentive than ever to buy champs even if you wouldnt play them.\r\n\r\nJust all around pure mindless fun.\r\n\r\nMake your own creations and pit them against each other while cracking a cold one and swearing that you will give your mate cancer for picking that op combo of abilities.\r\n\r\nwant 4 ultimates as your kit? well dunno why you would want all of your kit to have a cooldown of 60 seconds plus but go for it.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2015-12-06T22:20:43.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That'd be pretty great actually.
