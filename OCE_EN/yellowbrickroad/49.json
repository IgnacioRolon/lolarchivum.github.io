Surely you're not telling you have 4 wards out at any given time in a 40 minute game whilst averaging 10.5 wards.\n\nAlso, if your team starts feeding a butt ton, there are inevitably some unavoidable deaths, sure. But sometimes it's gonna be much better to avoid that team fight that your stupid team starts in the jungle, and opt instead to stay back to defend the coming tower siege that cakes afterward. If you know that your team is very far behind, is stupid, looks for fights that they can not win, then what's the point in joining an already lost fight just to add another kill to the enemy team (and a couple of towers that they secure after the ace)\n\n\nHeck I'm only bronze myself though, so you can just call me out on that and call me a baddie and continue blaming your team mates","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-19T06:13:36.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Regardless of his skill, shifting blame won't get him anywhere, with only the context of this post and maybe some match histories if you looked only OP will know if he's shifting blame or not. I'm gold and main supp and I won't pretend I don't get caught up in things and forget to ward at times, its knowing and understanding those mistakes that help you get better. Remember to play AROUND your team, never IN SPITE OF them. If you know your team will lose a fight, look for an opportunity to snag a turret or shove a pushing wave back to give you some room. If they tell you you should have been there and you know they were gonna lose regardless just ignore them. Noone will be right 100% of the time, including you. The only way to get better is to realise your mistakes, accept them, and try to remember them for next time. You can't make someone else play better, but you can avoid their pitfalls and mistakes and get better yourself.\n\nIf you're playing smart then even if your team is feeding you shouldn't be dying as much as they are unless it's a REALLY bad game or your opponents are all tryhard snowball champs like tryn/yas/yi etc. Even if they are, know their range and know what you 100% need to avoid (slow/tornado/alpha strike etc).","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-10-19T23:59:19.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most of the people in this elo either troll pick or tryhard pick, you dont really have inbetweens down here.\n\nLIke i see a xin zhao jungle with something like a vayne + leona bot, fizz mid and i dunno lets chuck a malphite top.\n\nInfact ive been seeing kassadin mid as a popular pick lately with the new oce skin, so kassa may end up being perma ban again soon (yay now i have literally 1 ban left after factoring in that no one knows how to dodge a bloody blitz hook in this elo)\n\n\nBasically what im dealing with here is pretty simple to sum up.\n\nI have been playing league for alot longer than the people in my elo, i have alot more game knowledge than them and am aware of more strats than them, i however do not have the mechanical prowess to just go 1v5 carry a game.\n\nThis means that while in theory if i had more skill i could easily carry the game of my knowledge alone i am still reliant on using the other 4 players as pawns in various plans.\n\nThis has its faults when said 4 players can be either half decent and just do things properly, or could also be stubburn little kids that will constantly ram headfirst into the 17/2 lee sin no matter how much you tell them to play safe.\n\nAs an example a strat ive been using to carry games lately because frankly im sick of relying on my team, is to just split push top with tryndamere, you know that one douchebag that literally never stops pushing top so you have to send someone top all game, yeah thats me now. Its boring as fuck, doesnt let me practice anything mechanical to so that i can actually get better in my weak points, but it gets results which is why i do it.\n\nThis is my complaint about the ranked system in a nut shell.\n\nBecause when i play at a higher elo i actually can rely on my team to not snowball the enemy team, which means i can pick that akali mid or that kindred top (been really getting into kindred lately) and i can rely on them to be able to hold their own even if im the weak link of the team, which in turn allows me to actually learn from that game instead of raging.\n\nIf a ranked system is so broken that it forces people to use strategies that are just mind numbingly boring and can be done while watching a youtube video to grind out mmr till they feel that their team isnt bringing them down, then its broken, very broken.\n\nIt defeats the point of the game.\n\nLike im not saying if we had individual mmr that id be master tier. far from it.\n\nBut i definitely wouldnt be bronze.\n\nLike what makes up  bronze elo is basically people who dont know what a minimap is, build retarded items that make no sense (remember back when tiamat teemo was a joke? i wouldnt be surprised if someone built it in this elo, its that bad), the only strat they know is snowball so if they fuck that up its gg, and honestly act like if they get enough kills the nexus will explode (aka they will frag farm instead of pushing the nexus when the nexus has 500 health and no turrets defending it) and yes this goes for both teams, but still just because the 5 people you are up against frag farm aswell doesnt mean they arent going to kill you when you are the singular person pushing that nexus.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-20T00:36:30.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now I must apologise as I was not intending to be hostile, I got caught up in the others' discussion. Now as much as I can see you have a few flaws in your argument, you're general point still stands. The attitude in ranked is trash. Biggest misconception I'd shoot down, that attitude doesn't get better. If you're in B5 it's certainly worse from what I hear, but having travelled from B3 to Gold, it doesn't get much better or much less frequent. You get the same tryhards, the same people who don't know how to play in their elo, the same people who pick champions for the first time in ranked (explain that one to me). There's toxics everywhere, it's worse in the bottom of Bronze because that's where a lot of them get stuck. So yes, there is a massive attitude problem in ranked, and it's not just in Bronze.\n\nBut if you let yourself tilt, especially if you're doing the best on the team, things are gonna go downhill from there. I despise solo Q, wouldn't touch it with a 100ft pole. My advice, find a duo if you can who takes things exactly as seriously as you are and who is unlikely to get baited into toxicity, then just don't worry about rank and worry about getting better at the game itself.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-10-20T01:37:52.488+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i understand what you mean i really do.\n\nBut like its hard not to tilt here, ill give an example, if you check last game youl find a game where yes i died alot but theres a solid reason for that.\n\nI was split pushing ridiculously hard.\n\nAt one point i just tp'd into enemy base took an inhib turret and all 3 inhibs in about 20 seconds.\n\nWhich is fucking good as youd probably agree, thats like taking 3 barons at once. considering inhib > baron.\n\nMy team however did not agree.\n\nInstead they decided that kills were far more important, and raged that i was not grouping,\n\nThey then decided to go teamfight, so i thought \"ok ive finished the inhibs ill join them\" got myself a double kill and survived but i noticed something.\n\nAnd very quickly realised WHY we were losing despite my insane push attempts.\n\nOur adc was 3/12, our adc? stood infront of the tanks in every teamfight, and most importantly, our adc was stubburn and blaming everyone else.\n\nNow this is one person we could still win.\n\nInfact we were all i had to do was make one more push, buuuut then disaster struck, my team decided to follow me into my push, pulling with them 4 fed team members, meanwhile while im getting anal stomped by the 4 fatties (they were all fed) nasus who by this point has 600 stacks because its 45 minutes into game was just casually pushing bot lane into our nexus.\n\nThis is a mistake i could not avoid, because its not a mistake i was in control of.\n\nHad they teamfought somewhere else atleast i couldve backed and delt with the nasus.\n\nOr even just pushed faster and got nexus before nasus, plenty of options, but the ill timed fight fucked me.\n\nGranted raging about it here in this board is stopping me going on tilt, but still this is what im working with here.\n\nAnd frankly all my mates are low silvers/high golds who wouldnt ever duo with me because they have already carried themselves out and are waiting for me to do it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-10-19T23:40:07.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you go an look at the death locations in most of my games i dont actually die in teamfights most of the time.\n\nIm very proficient when it comes to teamfights mostly from years of playing nothing but aram (thats just teamfights 24/7)\n\nThe skills im lacking in is things like dueling or cs'ing. or ward placements in weird areas you dont normally ward (like i know how to ward red side blue buff jungle, or the little spot at baron that cant be hexteched, but say warding  i dunno red side bot lane for a split push? too many variables need to figure that one out for myself)\n\nBut anyway i average about 20-25 wards a game on a support, closer to 15 if i dont buy a sightstone (sometimes the team comp really just needs more damage) and on anyone else i ward on cooldown with trinket but will admit i only really buy wards the first few backs until i feel safe enough to be able to duel my way out of a gank, and my ward averages go down when you consider my pink wards tend to last upwards of 10 minutes due to good placement.\n\nBut as i was saying about death locations, areas im likely to die are in my own base, enemy inhibs or nexus turrets, and the areas underneath my own teams turrets.\n\nIn a game where i die 5 times there might be maybe 2 deaths not in those specific locations.\n\nAnd in games where ive died 10 times there might be i dunno 3 deaths in jungle and the rest in those areas.\n\nThe thing is i play a very push centric game, hence why my mains are all very split push centric champions, like singed, or tryndamere.\n\nHell the only champion i play that is more focused on fighting is shaco and i play him full ap, so im really playing him as an assassin more than anything.\n\nBut like i said, there is more variables to consider than just \"how many wards per game\" or \"k/d/a\"","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
