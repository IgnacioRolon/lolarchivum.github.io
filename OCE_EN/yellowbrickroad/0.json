No in actual fact you're in bronze because you are bronze, you play like a bronze and you act like a bronze, and until you improve you will stay bronze, blame your team, blame your connection but the only person to blame is yourself.","replies":[{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-11-26T12:54:15.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean if we are being honest, Season 6 doesn't mean anything.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-27T12:53:48.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was bronze in season 5 aswell, the difference is i was high lp bronze 1 on the cusp of silver.\n\nSeason 6 i was bronze 5.\n\nSeasons 1-4 i didnt play ranked only bots and normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-27T03:11:20.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. LoL hasn't really been as fun for me since the end of Season 4. Players seem to be far more unskilled at simple war strategy games, probably because the popularity of LoL has increased leading to more kiddies taking up the game. This, combined with Riot's multiple balls-ups in Season 6 meant the fun factor was at an all time low.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
