We all know how it feels to have a game ruined by an unsportsmanlike player (whether thats intentional afk, troll, feeding or flaming). It sucks when you just want a good game of League of Legends, win or loss through skill and gameplay but a player lacks the mental resilience to stay focused on the game. \n\nWe are committed to improving sportsmanship within the League of Legends community. There is no silver bullet that solves negative behavior in online games. Players are a diverse bunch, and each player has different motivations and responds differently to different consequences. We will continue to improve our systems and introduce new initiatives to help steer our community in the right direction. But we can't do this alone, we need as many players as possible to also do their part and contribute to the kind of sportsmanlike community we aspire to have. Whether it's just turning up playing a game of League and contributing to the team, saying gg wp at the end of the game or actively helping a team stick together and recover from tilt, ultimately its every action that we take as players that determine what kind of community we are.\n\nThe systems we have in place aren't perfect. We will continue to work and improve in this area. The difficulty of course comes in creating systems or technology that is capable of fairly identifying and actioning ALL cases. It's quite difficult to get a computer to tell the difference between intentional trolling and just having a bad game (hell even we as humans have a lot of trouble judging actions vs intent). We use machines because it's probably one of the best ways to handle this scenario when there are 100 million players playing monthly. We just couldn't hire enough people to manually review everything, they would slowly fall further and further behind to a point where they are dealing with cases years in the past.\n\nWith all that said, the next big update to our systems involves an overhaul to honor you can see a little bit of info here - https://youtu.be/pFwrySPCff8?t=1m10s - with more info to come.\n\nI also wanted to take a quick moment to just bring up your specific player in question. While our systems aren't perfect it does look like they only just came back from a 2 week ban. Since then they have shown signs of reform and haven't had a game like that rammus one. (You were even in his 8-1 irelia game). It would be great to see them continue this behaviour, but if they revert and have more games like that rammus one I am sure that our intentional feeding system will pick it up.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/DsSYb7Q.png\n\nLeague can be an amazing game full of thrill, belonging and achievement. League can also be filled with frustration, anger and tilt =P . I consistently see both sides through my 6 years of LoL. If we as players can work towards creating more of the fun and positive side of League everyone will be better off. We all just need to play with friends where possible, be sportsmanlike with strangers and focus on our own game.\n\nI know I don't always respond to your posts, but I am always lurking and listening =D I hope over time to see you start having and talking about more positive experiences in League through a combination of our efforts and yours.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-23T02:53:58.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want a quick and easy fix to trolling just give players the option of verifying their account and opting to play with only other verified accounts.\n\nBe it Id or mobile phone verification it deters trolls and cheaters from playing as it adds an extra layer of difficulty beyond just making a new account.\n\nIt's proven to work in dota and csgo.\n\nIt removes that anonymity that causes most of the toxicity and by keeping it a purely optional thing you avoid the whole \"rito is stealing our infos\"\n\nQueue times could be arguably affected but In reality the only people affect would be those who actively choose to use the safer queue.\n\n\nI mean personally I'd rather a half hour queue where I know that all the players in my match both my team and the enemy team are committed to winning the game and are very likely more mature.\n\nThan a 5 minute queue where either my team or the other could have a troll which regardless of who gets the troll or flamed is still infuriating as it ruins the fun of the competition.","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-05-25T06:43:34.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a very good suggestion, which happens in China and Korea.
