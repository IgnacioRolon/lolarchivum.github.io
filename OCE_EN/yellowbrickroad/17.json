I stopped thinking the way you are thinking now.\n\nYour bronze 5, you belong in there.

no skill champs? everyone fucking hates them, find me a diamond player that doesnt groan when they see an annie.\n\nnext.\n\nTeammates? im in fucking bronze, i dont have teammates, i have 4 other people who just so happen to be in the same game and are all off doing their own thing, next.\n\nBronze 5 eh? hmmm i had what, 2, 3 accounts in b1? and this one ended in b2? pretty sure ive proven im not b5 by that point, but you know lets keep assuming i am because it makes arguing against me easier as you can dismiss my points as \"pffft typical bronze 5\"\n\nFinally you admit you dont know the full story, too bad you are too thick to realise that directly correlates with all your points becoming invalidated as a result.\n\nYou think i like being immensely pissed off? fuck no, but if jimjam69roflcopter over here wants to be a fuckwit, yeah im gonna be fucking pissed.\n\nCool i used to be bronze 5 and know shit too, only i knew so much that i carried myself to b1 4 fucking times with shithouse mechanics, still do have shithouse mechanics, but my game knowledge is as up to date as ever.\n\nNext plox.\n\nHmmm bronze 5 again, ill point to the afforementioned bronze 1 accounts, lets carry on hopefully ive drilled into your head that i have already Proved i am not b5.\n\nI dont itemize right? ok so what is this magical set in stone way to itemize that works in every scenario? oh right you dont have one because you are too thick to fucking think for yourself, want to know why i build kennen the way i do, which im guessing is the build your complaining about, because ad gives him far more sustained dps and sustain through lifesteal, which combined with an attack speed of 2 or higher and a runaans allows me to get a stun off exactly once every 2 seconds, which is enough stuns from autos to perma stun someone with well timed abilities. *Gasp* a non meta build that makes sense but you were too thick to fucking figure it out.\n\nAnd as ive already mentioned every game i play, either the highest, or second highest ward count. and all my wards are placed in decent bushes every time, because i actually have the lcs ward map right here on my monitor, just to double check that my wards are right before i write this sentence.\n\nOfc i fucking fuck up im human, but i dont fuck up EVERYTHING i do like the people i complain about. moving on.\n\nQuite the contrary, the only reason you think i think this is because you came into this argument with your bigoted ignorant and heavily biased opinion that all bronzies can do no harm and blah blah blah, when i fuck i fucking own up to it, which is one of the reason bronze players piss me the fuck off.... they dont fucking own up to it.\n\nWhere is this 80% games feeding. the last 6 games i played? the ones i played with less than 2 hours sleep heavily tilted from retards losing my promos? yeah, those are perfect indicators of my average game, do me a favor, and you know actually look at my real fucking match history, and not just the last 20 games, all of it. youl find a pattern eventually, and youl be fucking surprised by it, oh and until you do do that, every time you mention score, every time you mention X game. im gonna chew you out on it. carrying on.\n\nOn the contrary its drilled into me to ward the buff bushes while splitting, i used to play alot of distortion boots trynd, the one from that guide where you /ignore everyone and rush tier 2 yellow trinket, but please make more assumptions.\n\n\nAh this ones my favourite, you are correct that i dont help my team, because everytime i try to help my team they use me as a distraction to get away and leave me to die, i stopped helping a long time ago, im not gonna start again till im in an elo where people actually understand what teamwork is.\n\n\nIm aware they are in every game for everyone, you do understand im not saying \"hur durr im gold\" im saying im not bronze 5 im bronze 1. now heres the problem there, in what fucking universe can a bronze 1 player carry an entire team, which is a trick question because they cant, the skill disparity between bronze 1 and 5 while noticeable is not huge, its only really enough for a bronze 1 player in a b5 game to play better than average, but if they pull off a mad 20/0 destroyed every turret game where they get 2 pentas? ill eat my fucking shoes.\n\n\nAnd pressure is why i split push, because in bronze people chase kills instead of pressuring objectives, what are you not getting about that.\n\nGood i want them to feel pressure, if they suck they deserve to tilt for causing me to tilt, karma.\n\nLast point finally is on the fucking mark.\n\nIf you really wanted to have a single valid point, youd play a game with me, and youd be singing a very fucking different tune i can tell you that right now.\n\nEnd of discussion thats every point youve made destroyed, its also the points everyone else is making.\n\nSo unless someone has some new material that isnt just copy pasted from every other bronze qq thread, dont bother replying.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-02-16T10:01:50.061+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diamond players still know how to play against \"No skill champs\".\nyou do have team mates, you are letting them down as much as they are letting you down.\nYour \"Multiple\" accounts dont exist to me.\nIts the same as someone saying \"Im a challenger smurf\"\nand if you have so many accounts in bronze, maybe something is up with you and your play style.\nIf you cannot get even 1 into silver.\n\nMe saying I dont know the full story means I dont know how you play or act in game.\nBut judging form your text and your history (Once again)\nit speaks for it self.\n\nAlso I played AD kennan too, use to do it in the marksman role.\nWhen I ment not itemizing right you do not build towards your team needs and what you need to help counter the enemy.\n(In every game not just all those kennan games)\nAD kennan can work, but if your still feeding in those games somethings up.\n\nAnd I didnt come into this ignorant or \"Bigoted\" at all.\nI saw someone complaining that they are in bronze and boo hoo team mates suck.\nI even tried to help in which you completely ignored it because \"I am 100% right, its all my teams fault I didnt do anything\"\nAnd even when I was nice to you, you got up in my ass about it.\nAnd of course your team doesnt own up to there mistakes, Every human being doesnt.\nGBAY99 makes a good point about this topic in particular.\nAnd it alos seems that you are also just making up excuses and avoided where you have fucked up.\n\nYou were sleep deprived and tilted?
