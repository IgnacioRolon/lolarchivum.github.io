Haveing a duo partner helps to fix this problem abit.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-06T06:34:14.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally speaking it's better to one trick pony to climb, and then learn the rest when your higher.\n\nThe key is actually learning the other roles once your higher up.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-12-06T09:50:39.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can actually kinda understand where you are coming from here.\n\nIts much easier to learn from your mistakes than your successes.\n\nIve played with gold elo players before (nothing fancy i know) and i learned so much more from being trashed and trying to adapt and recover from that than i ever did from snowballing in bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-06T10:36:09.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah basically the thing is, your going to make hundreds of mistakes in a game as a bronzie, but no one in your games is going to punish you for these mistakes, get into a Plat Elo game, and you will start being punished for most of your mistakes no matter where you play.\n\nThis enables you to actually see what your mistakes are, rather then not see them because you never get punished.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-05T14:51:15.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go for it man! Kayle is a super strong Solo q pick! Good for just about any comp and good against almost any comp. Can win most matchups, has a strong laning phase and just brings so much to a team.

You need to play better to achieve the same winrate as someone more flexible.\n-If your champ gets nerfed, or buffed to much and becomes high priority pick/ban, you will be heavily affected, especially if you rely on champion specific skills or cheese strats to get advantages.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-12-05T13:16:13.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I do have some backup champs like akali, trynda, singed, lucian, ashe, shyvana etc but kayle is just my best all around for pure stats, kda winrate cs per minute etc etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-12-05T10:59:33.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's low elo and not a champs that's banned most every game, I say go for it. It's not like you'd come across many games where you wouldn't be able to use your preferred champ. Just make you you can use them in 2-3 positions and you should be fine until you reach high gold or plat, it's around that point you'd want to start using more than the one champ. I mean sure there's people who've reached diamond+ with just one champ but it's no good to rely on a single champ at that high an MMR, people are a lot less forgiving about that in high elo.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-12-05T11:40:32.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"says the quinn filthy main","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-05T12:55:52.286+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur filthy! quinn is a beast.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2015-12-05T12:35:11.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can play kayle in all 5 positions :3\n\nWon a game where i went adc a couple games ago, got pretty fed. that and i mostly play her top because she shits on all these juggernauts.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alfawarrior3","date":"2015-12-05T10:13:04.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"there's nothing really wrong with them. like unless the player plans on going pro, they don't really have a need to thoroughly learn more than 1 champion.\nalso, for most champs, knowledge about how to play the game and not the champ itself should be more than enough to not feed with them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-12-05T09:52:24.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"learn at least 2. if 1 gets banned u are screwed","replies":[]}]}
