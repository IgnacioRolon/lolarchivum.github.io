literally trash tier atm","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-04-02T02:30:36.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"None of those kindred games are jungle.\n\nThe lower elo i go the more restrictions i put on myself as to what lane and champ i play.\n\nIf i played nothing but meta champs in low elo id be even more pissed when i lose.\n\nHell take the zed mid games, im playing zed mid not because hes meta, but because i have like 5 games played with him.\n\na 5 games played zed, that is consistently going like 7/1 during lane phase, and he \"belongs in this elo\"\n\nA kalista mid player with a 60% winrate over over 100 games in the mid lane.\n\nAn ap shaco player who can go 25/7 in the mid lane, with 6 of those deaths being an udyr running him down stunning into xin three talon strike, after being fed by vayne because our malz afk'd. i was 14/1 at some point in that game.\n\nMechanically i am a better player, hell even my macro is better in most parts, i fully understand that if there is 3 top i should 100% go an take that bot tower, that alone puts my macro play ahead of my elo, because i dont have to be told, they do.\n\nNo the reason why i lose, is i may be better in most areas, but i am not better to such a degree where i can consistently 1v3/5 because thats what happens in every game i play, i absolutely DUMPSTER my laner, go some insane score like 9/1 then get the entire enemy team sitting on my ass, and my team is never good enough to take advantage of the fact that their team is now ignoring them as i am the only threat, as such i consistently end up in 3v1 ambushes and shit because its either i sit in our own jungle because thats where my team is, or i get killed trying to be productive and actually take objectives.\n\nAnd theres more evidence to point to that, namely my winrate at b1 was 70%\n\nMy winrate at b5, has just dropped below 50%\n\nHow can i consistently carry games, at an elo 4 tiers above where i am right now, but cant even carry this shitty elo.\n\nThink about that for a second before you reply, because my case, completely defies the usual player logic of \"well if your teams bad so is the enemy team\"\n\nbecause ill repeat, i win more games, against higher elo players, that doesnt make any sense when you apply the general consensus of how elo works.\n\nI mean fuck i even know how to fucking play from behind, the number of games ive gone like 1/5 in lane from being gank spammed then come out the end of the game 15/7 because i just farmed and played safe, is through the fucking roof.\n\nBut none of those skills help me 1v9, they make it easier, but they dont enable it.\n\nAt the same time, in higher elo's playing with players more around my level, those skills are invaluable, you need to know how to ward, you need to know how to abuse lane pressure, you need to know how to play safe, because if you dont, you lose, because the enemy team isnt made up of absolute spastics and will take advantage of that, and thats why i win in that elo, because i dont make those mistakes.\n\nIn bronze 5, it doesnt matter how good your macro play is, bronze 5, is 100% a hard carry elo, you HAVE to 1v9, you cant rely on anyone to know what the fuck they are doing, and you can expect the enemy team to be greedy and kill focused, so they will run you down if they see you.\n\nYour own team will expect you to fight by yourself because of how fed you are.\n\nBasically, in b5, unless you know how to 1v9, getting fed, is like sealing your own coffin.\n\nEdit:\n\nAnd just to reiterate when i say i dont make those mistakes, im not saying im perfect, of course i make mistakes, but i dont make those particular ones, because those are the skills i have focused on, because why try to learn how to play at chaos 5, when i can learn how to play at every elo aside from chaos 5.\n\nWhy is it chaos 5 and not bronze 5? simple, its pure chaos, i have literally won games playing full ap warwick pre rework, in the bot lane, as the adc role. there is no structure, everyone down here is shit, and the meta goes out the window, no one itemizes correctly, and being a better player doesnt inherently mean you can win, this is the league of throws after all, all it takes is me being the only good player on the team and getting 1v5'd once to lose the game, because my team wont be able to do jack shit against them since if they can 1v5 me they fed in the first place.\n\nAsk any smurf whos played in b5 coming from plat and up, the first thing they will tell you is that all strategy goes out the window, its either you 1v9 or you go down with the sinking ship, you cant expect even the slightly shred of teamwork.\n\nThe most teamwork you will get is if you have someone on their team low enough to kill and you are low, someone else will come in to get kill credit, thats it.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2017-04-02T12:38:23.021+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"stop thinking you are better than you are. disco heat plays random picks and builds all
