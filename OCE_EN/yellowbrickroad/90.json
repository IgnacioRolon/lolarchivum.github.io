Separate the friendsbar and chat box into a seperate slightly transparent social window that can be dragged around irrespective of the official client, Assuming you are coding the client in an OOP based language this is really as simple as making another GUI and calling that from within the same program when you click the friends button, alot of indie developers can do it easily so theres no reason you cant.\r\n\r\n2. bog standard solution put a minimize button on the friends bar and or make the chat box shorter (height is the main thing really)\r\n\r\n3. Slightly more difficult and unlikely to happen due to the issues it presents is to just simply make the client resizeable, and for those of you that stumble into this thread that arent actively coding the client that are like &quot;wait why would that be difficult&quot; To do a realizable client well when your client is made up of pre rendered chunks you need adequate scaling, in other words riot would have to remake every asset into a super resolution texture like 8k or something, then scale it down to the resolution the screen is currently at, A famous example of not having very good scaling is flash games, fullscreen that fucker and you are left with giant black spaces all around the game and the window in the middle didnt get much bigger.\r\n\r\n4. Use the friend bar instead of the list of names on the side of the chatbox, i know that may be a bit clunky because the idea is to show everyone youve talked to but due to the chat restrictions in the client you cant talk to someone who isnt on your friends list anyway, doing this would almost halve the client space required by the chat box creating the illusion of a more spacious client.\r\n\r\nIm sure your design department knows exactly what I am talking about when i say a comfortable client should be one that doesn&#039;t invoke feelings of claustrophobia but also doesn&#039;t feel like you are standing in a void of nothing, its a fine line to walk on but you are pretty much there, those two things are my only gripes and the client looks great, it just doesn&#039;t feel like it does due to the clutter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Suggestion.\r\n\r\nTo save you from a double post I thought id just through this in here because its an INSANE design flaw in the live client that has made its way into this client too.\r\n\r\nFor the love of god seperate the repair client from the patcher.\r\n\r\nWith the live client 6 times out of 10 if my client broke it was because the patcher had stopped working or wouldnt patch, not because the actual client itself broke.\r\n\r\nAnd as a result ive had to reinstall league a few times because i physically could not get access to the repair button as the patcher was broken.\r\n\r\nOr at least put a repair option in your MSI file so I can use the installer to do that.\r\n\r\nOne reason i say this is apart from good design principals (never gate a required feature behind a less required feature, for instance in emergency break glass with the hammer behind the glass) im going to be actively trying to break the client so having a repair button i can access at all times in an emergency is rather important due to the size and the scope of the alpha client.\r\n\r\nThats my 2 cents for now, im sure i will run into more things when i get some more intensive testing done.\r\n\r\nHopefully i dont because apart from those things the clients very beautiful.","replies":[]}
