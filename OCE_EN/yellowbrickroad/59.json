As mentioned above, Riot probably has HEAPS of other summoners they need to deal with.\n\nThe best thing is to start flaming and fueling a team argument or even across game argument where you flame in all chat. \n\nKeep positive and ignore them and focus on your own gameplay and just use that report button!\n\nJustice will be served _(PLZ RITO)_","replies":[]}]}
