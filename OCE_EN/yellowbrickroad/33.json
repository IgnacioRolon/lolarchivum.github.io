You sir have a massive ego. If you tilt like crazy and bounce up in down in bronze that means you're a player who is _TILTING_ in bronze. Bronze league is the easiest to level of play. Next it seems you main Katarina. You do chalk up big kill scores, but that's what your champion is meant to do. You transition kills into more kills. Where as if you want to win you need to transition kills into objectives i.e. turret, inhib, baron, dragon. Therefore play another champion that does this more effectively, not Katarina. Realistically Silver 5 is the average rank of the player base know that. Secondly elo boosting exists because quote on quote good players that reside diamond and above can easily climb through low ranks bronze through to gold. Therefore if you were actually really good you can always climb. So basically recognise there is tonnes of skills you're bad at or don't understand. Blame yourself and no one else because only you have the power to improve your rank.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-09-13T16:41:12.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main akali actually, ive been playing kat because in my eyes and experience she is literally the easiest champion in the game, on no other champions have i managed to get a quadra kill by pressing two buttons, and frankly ive been getting nowhere in bronze by playing mechanically challenging champs, so it was a breath of fresh air to be able to literally faceroll my keyboard and still get a quadra.\n\nIve had plenty of near pentas on akali but i did that through careful management of my energy and picking the order of my targets really well and disengaging mid kill on a target when a higher priority came up only to come back to them.\n\nYour second point that i need to get objectives, shows that you did not read. at all.\n\nI do do that, MOST TOWERS, MOST OBJECTIVES.\n\nThose two points are where your entire argument fails.\n\nLike fuck even on my main akali, there is a reason i build exactly 2 ad items every game regardless of my build, and one of them is always hydra, and its not because that increases my burst damage somehow, its because it gives me 50% spell vamp so i can duel with up to 3 people depending on my lead and hit towers for 1k an auto basically turning me into an extremely mobile nasus.\n\nYour next point which is to play another champion that does things effectively, i have 2 mastery 7's and 5 mastery 6's and god knows how many more champs that id be mastery 6 or 7 on if i could be fucked to get them to mast 5 first, my champ pool is not one champion, its not even 3, its closer to 15? give or take, atleast 4-5 champs per role because alot of them can play multiple roles, trust me i have champions that can do these things, ive just been picking the champions that i consistently win on, rather than champions that require my team to do alot of the work in teamfights, because frankly, i dont trust my teams, they have proven time and time again that unless i get lucky in the game of team roulette i have to do everything for them.\n\nThirdly your point of \"elo boosting exists\" elo boosters are not silver players boosting people out of bronze, or i dunno diamond players boosting people to diamond.\n\nThey tend to be challenger players, or master tier, looking to make an extra buck of their skill since they have proven they can win in every league below their own.\n\nBecause thats the thing people like you dont understand \"well im gold and i 1v9'd out of bronze why cant you\" um, im not gold? im not meant to be gold. im nowhere near gold.\n\nSilver maybe, but not gold lol.\n\nThat entire argument you made regarding that is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnd finally just to push your argument into the dirt even more, if i can climb to a certain elo that means i belong there right?\n\nSo why arent i bronze 1, seeing i climbed there solo last season, and fucking stayed there.\n\nInfact i almost escaped bronze, so ill leave you with that one question, either i somehow got worse, despite the fact that if you look at my performance averages this season compared to last im actually playing better, or bronze tilting me to b5.\n\nUnless of course an influx of new players greatly affecting the mmr system couldve made it harder to climb, but thats bullshit right, like i mean solo players dont have trouble playing against 5 man premades right?\n\nThats not a thing.\n\nOh and yes, im a solo player, i reach b3 SOLO, then tilt to b5 SOLO.\n\nWhen i am in a premade, seeing as i play consistently, and my teammates are consistent, guess what happens.\n\nYou wont believe this, but we win more than we lose, because it doesnt matter how tilted i am, the one thought in the back of my head is \"Thank god im not playing solo atm because this team would be trash if i was\"","replies":[]},{"poster":"Max Range","date":"2016-09-13T03:39:56.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I'm Annie, I'm a P5 adc main looking for a high elo to learn from through spectating, can I add you ingame? :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-09-12T19:54:30.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Set up your own custom team and just play ranked teams if you don't trust Lady Luck with your ques o.- or adapt faster?
