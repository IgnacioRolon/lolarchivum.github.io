Not to say there aren't any, there are those that drop to test themselves (report them), whose who drop to troll there (again, report them, they'll get banned hella fast) and those that are smurfs of Bronze players trying to reset their mmr/get a better idea of where they should be (at which point the smurfiness is irrelevant).\n\nSkill in Bronze is inconsistent, so scores tend to be pretty polarising and games tend to be pretty one sided one way or the other. This is a part of being in Bronze, not because it's filled with smurfs.\n\nJust because someone is doing really well, doesn't mean they're a smurf, even if they say they are, more than likely they're taking every opportunity they can to boost their ego. If you **know** for whatever that they're a smurf then **report them for it**. If they purposefully dropped into Bronze to troll/stomp then that is no bueno and you should 100% report them (and explain why in the comment).\n\nPast that I'd recommend considering how you are giving advice. Look at what you're saying as if it was a complete stranger (you have no idea of their skill/consistency/strengths/weaknesses etc, and you have a different perspective/understanding of the game) and see if you'd think it was valid advice or if you'd be offended that they think they can tell you what to do. \n\nYou want to suggest, not demand, or all you're doing is convincing them you aren't worth listening to. You have to leave the door open, not open it, yell something at the person on the other side then slam it in their face.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-08-17T23:44:43.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't play much ranked, but I haven't encountered a smurf this whole season yet xD.\n\nI think your really unlucky bro, but something I can relate to is bronze players being totally ignorant like their opinion or way about things is better than there teams.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-18T00:38:01.144+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, like i have no problem with that attitude if they are clearly better than their team, im no hypocrit.\n\nBut its the ones who are clearly failing at whatever they are trying to do and refuse to listen to reason that get me.\n\nLike as an example take a few days ago i had a riven top that fed the crap out of a trynd.\n\nFair enough normal business in bronze the feeding isnt what pissed me off.\n\nThe part that pissed me off is i told her after her second death to take it easy and stop pushing so hard into her lane she was clearly outmatched by this trynd and cannot fight him 1v1, the proper action wouldve been to ease up farm up and roam for a pick or two then take that gold and roll it into a defensive item (so in rivens case lots of ad for her shield) then once she was strong enough to fight trynd then go back to 1v1ing him.\n\nInstead she took her already behind ass and kept engaging until she was 2/10 and claimed my advice was wrong because \"if you knew that shit you wouldnt be bronze\"","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-08-18T22:50:46.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how many more of these will there be?","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-08-18T06:07:51.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You just admitted to a smurf carrying their team in Bronze.
