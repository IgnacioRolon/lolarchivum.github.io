With Tier 2 runes at 1IP now and the levelling exp halved it's not that hard to lvl a smurf and effectively reset your mmr to Silver 3~\n\n> Because atleast in low silver to high gold Players have some sense of skill,\n\nScores in low elo are always going to be polarising, because player skill is unreliable and inconsistent. They might be a good Lucian one game, but don't know how to consistently be a good Lucian.\n\nAnd it's been mentioned but I'll say it again, if you yourself are a good player (i.e belong in a higher elo) then the enemy team has a higher chance (5/5 players) of having more bad players on their team then your team (4/5 players) does. \n\n> Actually recently since they added autofill im more likely than ever to quit league.\n\nTop and Mid are highly sought roles, if you're queuing with two popular roles then you can expect to get autofilled into something else every now and again, it's usually good practice to learn and then assign your second role as something less popular (jng/supp) to guarantee your chances of getting a role you can play well. That is simply the climate of the game at present.\n\n> that doesnt mean i enjoy playing adc with a rando as my sup\n\nIf you're so keen on satisfying competition why not find someone of your approximate skill and motivation and queue with them? YOu can only help your chances.\n\n> and you still end up with 20 minute queue times.\n\nSame deal with the roles, it's having trouble finding open top/mid lanes, and autofill had to be implemented carefully so as not to have people who pick only popular roles bitching about how they never get said roles for the sake of 5 min queue times.\n\nI've played B3 - G5 with Supp/Mid assigned and never had a queue longer than 5 minutes. \n\nYou'd be surprised the impact you can make as supports like Nami/Lulu/Karma/Zyra, maybe it;s time to switch up your roles and take the time to master something different.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-07-14T14:03:08.261+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh trust me im pretty confident in every role except jungle (and jungle is mostly because my champion pool for junglers is very limited, yes im bronze so my champion pool is quite vast but a jack of all trades, thats why im saying champions im confident i can carry with, so kayle (extremely high winrate compared to the rest of my pool hence why im mastery 7), mordekaiser, etc)\n\nif i get support im actually a quite good sona (100% winrate with her so far but its only early days with her so who knows when ill get that first loss) but again im not confident i can carry with her because bot lane is a 2 part situation, when i play with my mate elem who i know is a decent adc and synergises well with me ill happily lock in support and go to town.\n\nBut unfortunately i cant always play with friends which is why i try to focus on my solo lane performance over my duo lane performance, because in a solo lane i can be far more consistent as my performance is the only factor.\n\ninfact top lane has my highest winrate out of every lane not because im some amazing top laner far from it, but because its isolated from the rest of the lanes, so im the least likely to get ganked (and if i do get ganked im usually not over extended so i usually survive) and im less likely to get roamed from mid, this allows me to get quite fed from farming or simply outskilling my opponent and then use that power to boost other lanes.\n\ninfact in the games where i rage when im playing top lane its usually from lets say the mid laner feeding, their fed mid laner realises i am a threat brewing and decides to repeatedly roam top putting pressure on my lane.\n\nNow assuming my mid laner is smart enough to recognize this and pushes their lane out its all fine and dandy ill be a bit pissy about getting camped but hey it worked out, if they dont do that thats when i get tilted.\n\n\n\nAs for why i dont play the 1v1 moba, its some Chinese mobile moba knock off thing with a heavy pay to win format, great for a few minutes of fun, but definitely not my daily driver moba.\n\nFinally as for the i only have 4 bad players and they have 5, yes thats why i get fed from my own lane, but its also the reason the game is very rng based, i go into these games expecting atleast one lane to feed and its just a guessing game of which lane feeds and whos team it is.\n\nAnd unfortunately it doesnt matter how many bad players are on each team because all it takes is one bot laner collectively dying 10 times to have a monstrous adc banging down your door that you cant outskill because they have 8k gold on you.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-07-14T14:06:01.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh forgot to address the alt situation, I would but ive vested a bit of currency into this alt to the point its basically my main now, and i have a few things i cant just buy on the other alt should i do decently (project lucian with border, mastery tokens etc, along with some high value skins ive gotten through hextech like dj sona)\n\nWhen i made this account the only valuable thing my main had was the perfect ascension icon so it was worth tossing aside.\n\nNow if support would allow me to transfer my stuff over thats a different story but i doubt riot has the time nor would want to (more alts means more money right so why transfer skins over)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-15T01:24:32.965+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well as far as alts are concerned, if you really don't want to play normals, it might be a good way to reset your rank, improve some in your new rank, then take that improvement back to your main.
