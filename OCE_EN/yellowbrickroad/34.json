I know how you feel though, I started season 6 in Bronze 2 after I had a break for like all of S4 and S5 - I'm Gold 5 now but what you have to have is the mentality to win. Every game you get into, you're the best player, no one is better than you are. In champ select, study the enemy team and figure out what you need to do to win, whether it's counter jungle, pressure a side lane or sit on an enemy champion so they don't pop off. But stop blaming your teams for everything, there's a 50% chance of winning every game. If you take bot tower first, that increases your chances of winning from 50% to 70%, if you lose it first, your chance of winning drops from 50% to 30%, catch my drift?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-26T02:22:30.464+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except right now im playing on flex queue and have a 52% overall winrate and an 80% winrate in the midlane playing ap shaco atm.\n\nmy flex queue mmr is higher than my solo queue mmr, which is currently at a 0% winrate after preseason despite having played 10 games since preseason.\n\nDoes that not ring alarm bells to you, that i can achieve a positive winrate at a higher mmr but cant win one single game at a lower mmr?\n\nWanna know why that is?\n\nits because i cant fucking carry retards.\n\n I can carry semi decent players, or even just slightly bad.\n\nBut throw a couple potatos on my team that have a 90% chance of having brain damage.\n\nAnd its lights out mmr you getting tanked by the potato patrol.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-26T05:24:52.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel you don't have any issue with confidence. Maybe what you want to do, is play a champion that can more easily solo carry that ap shaco mid (since whilst it's not too hard to go positive with this in bronze, you're not really going to be able to carry or force enemy towers even in the depths of bronze). You're very very confident and I'd argue that if you're in bronze, even if you're much better than bronze, if you feel that the reason you lost is 100% your teammates, you're probably wrong. \n\nBack when I was learning the game about a year ago now, I think I was around lvl24 at the time and didn't have runes yet, I once saw a very good fizz manage to beat us, when he had a 4man predmade all disconnect at around 10min. In a 1v5, he managed to wreck 5 of us. He got 7 pentakills that game and managed to stall us out to the point where deathtimers were a minute long and eventually he pushed and killed us and we lost, he killed the nexus and he won. Now I know this was against 4 bronze or unranked players and a lvl24, and he was probably high ranked and this was normals but point stand that he did still did it. \n\nMoral of the story: If you're good enough and the enemy team is bad enough, it won't matter if your teammates are decent or disconnected, you can still win and then have the pride to spam your emote when you kill the enemy nexus.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-26T02:25:43.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah a lot of bronze initiate surrender votes just because their champion can no longer kill the enemy tank 1 on 1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"He Meant Mine","date":"2016-11-24T16:36:54.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you want help? lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Nova","date":"2016-11-24T14:22:00.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude everyone in bronze elo even B1 are full retard\nit only gets better once u like hit silver 3.\n\nive been silver 2 for a while then flex put me in b3 holy shit i forgot just how bad bronze players are even if i do well theres no carrying a full feeding team no matter what you play\n\nSide note: i never surrender a game unless its 100% lost, ive done some major comebacks from 100 hp nexus lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-24T12:14:02.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just reviewing my games.\n\nSo apparently i carried a plat 3 caitlyn while playing ap shaco support.\n\n90% sure i caught a boosted account.","replies":[]}]}
