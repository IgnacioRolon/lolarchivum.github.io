There may be alot of talented children in league but my god if you arent over atleast 16 and are below diamond you tend to be the most cancerous fucks ever.\n\nlike i mean we are talking over a 6 month experiment regarding my lp gain and loss on a pair of alt accounts with identical runes and masteries the account that plays during school hours has been on a steady climb and the account that plays after school hours is on a steady decline.\n\nAnd it makes sense too, its a team game, throwing a bunch of young kids that dont know how to work together are quick to anger and immature as fuck into a team is a recipe for a failure.\n\nHell id pay fucking money to get them out of my queues, id provide id and pay $15 a month to only get other adults.\n\nAnd god knows the only people willing to drop $15 a month and lock their ranked games to one account because of id arent gonna troll and are gonna take the game super seriously, which would be a refreshing change.","replies":[{"poster":"kaboomblah","date":"2016-11-16T09:17:22.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You were never a stupid, insufferable kid?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-16T09:38:56.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"sure, i also used to shit myself in a diaper, doesnt mean i do that now.\n\nSame shit with kids just because i used to be one doesnt mean i have to put up with it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-17T09:56:59.902+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No support from me.\n\n\"Adult\" and \"Cancerous f/*cks\" (as you so... \"eloquently\" put it) are not mutually exclusive and, dare I say, adults are probably more of a problem in that respect.\n\n> And god knows the only people willing to drop $15 a month and lock their ranked games to one account because of id arent gonna troll and are gonna take the game super seriously\n\nYou don't understand what these trolls are willing to do to ruin the experience, do you? Some of them buy level 30 accounts for 10s, if not 100s, of dollars *just* to continue their trolling. Then when those accounts get banned, they spend *more* money to keep going. I would've thought that would be common knowledge.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-11-16T12:54:27.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think this is a good idea, but I don't know if Riot will do it.\nBut perhaps you could. Organise a ladder competition where you have a bunch of adults that are organised into random ranked 5 teams for Flex Queue. Teams battle each other (maybe have a best of 3 each week) and results are noted. Have prizes for the best player with wins or kda or whatever you like. Because each week's team is random, it will come down to teamwork skills of adults. Get players to pay a small fee to cover any prizes + administration /website costs. Also each week you could have a deadline for players willing to play on a certain day so that people wouldn't need to be playing every week. Just have the right number of people and you can pair them into random team games.\n\nCould be a nice way to play league in 2017, because you know that the tank meta is just around the corner and we will be reverting back to season 5 where the game became boring as hell with far more unskilled and toxic players entering the scene.\n\nWhat do you think?","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-17T00:26:54.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like a good idea, cant say id run it myself been awhile since i set up a (decent) website but still good to keep in mind.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-11-16T11:48:33.582+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you know who else plays after school hours?\npeople that have a 9-5 job or people that work part time in the morning.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-11-17T00:25:55.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, and this would benefit them greatly, because they dont have the same luxury i do of completely avoiding school children by not queuing when they queue.\n\nThat and trust me when i say this, children outnumber adults in this game, you are far more likely to run into a snotnosed brat than a well adjusted adult.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-11-16T12:32:22.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I understand that playing against young adults and teenagers might not be the most satisfying experience, I don't think this could work considering the sheer size of the population and internet anonymity.","replies":[{"poster":"Somebody not you","date":"2016-11-16T21:03:54.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually, for that very reason, it could work.
