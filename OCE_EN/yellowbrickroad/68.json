Well the evidence is right in front of you, there is a myriad of systems designed to stop you from climbing, Clamping, The lp system in general, LP Decay etc etc.\r\n\r\nHow many systems exist to help you climb? one, and that system assumes you are capable of beating all the other systems to reach your promos, and thats promos helper.\r\n\r\nSo why would riot do this? Simple.\r\n\r\nCarrot and a stick.\r\n\r\nIf every player who truly deserved a higher elo could just win  their way their off pure skill then people would stop playing.\r\n\r\nThere would be no motivation to keep grinding out those games to get those precious few lp.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to my next point, the LP system is a very shitty system, its only purpose for existing is to again create a carrot on a stick scenario, in this case by hiding your mmr so instead of getting a clear definer of &quot;You are here&quot; you get a &quot;you are somewhere around here who knows spin the wheel&quot; this causes you to go &quot;well i feel like i shouldnt be here lets keep grinding&quot;\r\n\r\nBasically what im saying here is, dont think the lp system is fair, its not designed to be, and itd be bad for business if it was.","replies":[{"poster":"Soulless Reaper","date":"2016-07-15T02:05:02.920+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"League has never been good with ranked system.
