Not listening to what _they_ want, only expecting them to listen to what _you_ want, because you assume that you are better than them.\nAlso 1v3ing as Kalista is a terrible idea. _(infact ever being ALONE as Kalista is a terrible idea)_\nYou have **really** good farm, but not very good kill participation, which leads me to think that you might have been away from the team, farming for the majority of the time while the team were involved in fights, which you absolutely cannot do in a 4v5 situation, as it essentially turns a 4v5 into a 3v5 and a 1v5.\n\n> hey presto they go from feeding bronzelords to actually being useful funny that.\n\nFrom looking at your match history, In all of your recent Kalista games there has been at least one _(often more)_ teammates that have a better score than you, not to mention you are almost always negative in score. And seeming you are Bronze as well, calling someone a 'feeding bronzelord' is a touch hypocritical.\n\n> \"ive already proven that my advice is solid they will definitely listen to this one piece of advice that if they dont follow we will isntantly lose\"\n\nIm not sure what advice you gave them _(it might have been really good)_, but people as a general rule, are unlikely to take advice from a 5/9 Kalista, over advice from an 8/8 Elise or a 2/6/13 Leona _(Leona is probably the best score in your team)_. So it is my guess that they were looking towards Leona or Elise for a leadership role rather than yourself.\n\nNot to mention that it looks like _(unless Lucian with heal is the culprit)_ you went Kalista in either Top or Mid, when you already had an ADC (Lucian) and were in serious need of some Ap/Burst to even out your team comp. _(and it looks like you did so again in your next game, even though you had no tanks.)_ And one Kalista player to another, need I point out the obvious disadvantage you put yourself and your team in when you take **Kalista** in a solo lane? It is irresponsible.\n\nFrom those decisions alone, it is easy to see why your team might not have rushed to follow your advice.\n\n__________\n\nI know that might sound a tad harsh, but the truth is, you don't move up the ranks by blaming everyone else. You have to look inwards before you can start looking at others.\n\nno one likes to be Bronze, but when you are _(and that goes for almost all of us at one point of another)_ you have to go about it with a mindset that helps in that situation. _\"Im good, but everyone is holding me back.\"_ is NEVER going to help you climb. Even if you actually _are_ better than them, you have to put that out of your mind and think _\"It doesn't matter about where Im **supposed** to be, what matters most right now, is how to move forward from where I **currently** am.\"_ \n\nLearn to play _with_ people at a bronze level, rather than blaming them for playing at the level that they are at.\n\nRather than telling your team to do it your way, go with them and do it their way. If you are indeed better than them, then you being there with them will highly increase their chances of winning, even if they aren't doing it the best way.\n\nA huge part of this game is champion select, so many games are won or lost in champ select. At higher elo, you can expect people to pick around you, to accomodate your champion into the team comp. In lower elo, this doesn't really happen that well, everyone just locks in their favourite champions without strategising. So if you want to climb, YOU have to be the one that strengthens the team.\nIf you are top and your team is lacking tanks, don't pick a squishy ADC top, pick a tank! If you are Mid lane, and your team is all AD, don't pick Yasuo, pick an AP champion.\n\nYou might be better at Kalista than Singed, but if your team lacks tanks, you are more likely to win if you pick singed. It is virtually impossible to 1v5, which means that you have to trust your team at some point. So in champion select, don't pick for yourself, don't think \"I can carry this sorry game as Kat!\" because with that mindset you have already abandoned your team and are thinking only about yourself. Instead, think \"How can I best give my team the chance to shine!\"\n\nIll use an example of my own: Kindred is my favourite and best jungler, I love that champion! But I'm pretty sure that i have never played her in ranked. In my elo (Bronze/silver) not many people pick tanks, everyone just priorities damage, so we are always lacking in tanks. So if I happen to get jungle, It would be irresponsible of me to pick Kindred, she brings nothing to the table that we don't already have, and she robs us of survivability and peel. If I want our Vayne to succeed, it's more helpful if I pick Nautilus and take a bullet for her, than if I'm constantly robing her of kills as Kindred.\n\nIt really is the best way to climb, to use your team as a tool, if they give you a nail, become a hammer! if they give you a hammer, become the nail. You wouldn't try to hammer a nail in with another nail? So don't try to be a carry, when you already have an ADC. \nWork with them :)\n\n_______\n\nI wish you the best of luck in you future games!","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-10T11:06:14.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While much of your advice makes sense on paper there are some points id like to address.\n\nFor instance you mentioned my kalista games, i assume you mean the 12 loss losing streak? that was me slowly going insane from loss after loss after loss caused by shitty teams which culminated at the end with the two singed proxy games and the nocturne mid game, all 3 of which i didnt even play the game, i just ran around spamming memes in chat and generally trying to make everyone feel like they wasted their time so they felt like i felt at that time.\n\naka 12 games where i was tilted.\n\nif you go further back to when i was playing with slightly less moronic teammates and remove those games and the last few weeks of games at that (since this isnt a one off occurance) it suddenly goes from 51% winrate to 80% winrate (still all mid no adc), and 1.5kda, to 2.6, my averages are marred by the games I fucked up by playing tilted.\n\nBut moving on now that weve addressed that glaring issue,  you mentioned strategy in bronze, id like to counter rebuttle with the fact that the one commonly known factor of bronze, that is present in every game no matter how good or bad the players are, is chaos, pure absolute unrefined chaos.\n\nno one trusts anyone, no one listens to anyone, someone could have 100% the correct play for that given moment, and someone will argue against it and divide the team.\n\ninfact the chaos is so innate that it is almost just like order \"you will expect to not expect this\"\n\ntake for instance my recent nomads medallion shaco mid games, why am i playing a build that absolutely cripples my early game?\n\nSimple, BECAUSE i am better i can get kills in mid game without items, coupled with the medallions kill gold allows me to snowball much harder and much faster than normal, sometimes giving me as much as 2k or 3k extra gold from the item by the end of a game far outweighing the cs lost by attempting to activate the passive as fast as possible.\n\nWould this work in a higher elo game? shit no, it could work if you cs'd as normal and just used the passive gold gain but the game would be over by then, and if you purposely let cs die to proc coins you would get stomped by players abusing that mistake, but in bronze? well its bloody deadly, as you can see, the only games ive lost with this setup have had teams that all go 2/8 or some shit like that, even the game where i went 19/12 was a losing game where i suddenly picked up 19 kills almost won the game, then team happened. because thats how bronze is played\n\nyou dont have to 1v5 so to speak, but you definitely can not rely on your team in this elo.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-10T12:30:14.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh and a final point, there is a difference between a bronze player and a bronzelord.\n\ni occasionally meet other players as good as me, sometimes we duo and end up getting 20+ wins in a row and go up a few divisions sometimes they carry me, sometimes i carry them, but no matter what if one of us is losing lane the other is covering our ass by winning it.\n\nbut thats rare, very rare.\n\nThe rest of the players, are bronzetards, bronzelords, the riff raff, whatever you want to call them.\n\nThey are the horde of sub 40% winrate bronze 5-3 players that plague this elo.\n\nThe players so bad they make you go \"how in the actual fuck do you have a 25% winrate in bronze, like with that winrate if wood exists youd actually be in it\" THOSE are bronzelords, and its quite literally 90% of the playerbase.\n\ni look everyone up before every game.\n\natmost i find 1 other player with a winrate above 50% in each game. and the median average is 30% which is statistically impossible unless there are players in that elo that arent advancing but are good enough to lower everyone elses winrates, and more importantly there has to be a large percentage of that playerbase but not large enough to increase the winrates of the teams they play with. (namely any gain in elo they get from those players should be lost in the next game etc etc)\n\neither that or the mmr system is wrong, but nah thats probably not it.\n\nBut still this whole anomaly of literally the majority of this elo having sub 40% winrate is something that should be looked into, because like i said, thats not statistically possible, that would imply an elo that is literally dragging every player around it down with it and players that are worse than the players they are supposedly equal with.\n\nboth of which the league playerbase would vehemently deny as both imply the existence of elo hell.\n\nFor instance lets use this game im in right now.\n\ni have a first time kassadin mid laner with 50% winrate, and a 50% tristana, all right already better than my average team.\n\ni also have a 37% winrate support and a 46% winrate jungler.\n\nThe enemy team has two 29% winrate players a 37% winrate player a 42% winrate player and one 50% winrate player.\n\nAnd let me tell you this right now, im not even sure if we will win this game, because its literally a coin toss in bronze, all it takes is one shitty player getting 10 free kills off an even shittier player and suddenly that shitty player can just outbuild the need for mechanics.\n\nEdit: we lost that game, kass was the only useful player, the other 3 just ran it down mid over and over repeatedly dying till zed had 30 kills and begging us to come help them while we took tower after tower and eventually an inhib and kept telling them to stop being so trash and push a lane, proof of what im talking about, winrates wise, we shouldve won, we were the \"better\" players, but in reality 3 out of 5 of our team was retarded.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Dark Warrior","date":"2017-05-07T07:45:34.440+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats why they are #bronzeforever Lmao","replies":[{"poster":"SirGrugglesworth","date":"2017-05-07T13:29:52.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"OP is also bronze 5... for 3 seasons now with well over 1000 ranked games so it's hard to tell who has the correct idea on how to play the game lol.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-05-10T11:30:22.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Theres a reason op.gg offers month to month ranking overviews, because looking at a player at the current moment at the current time doesnt provide an accurate representation of where they belong.\n\nit just shows where they are at that moment.\n\nFor example lets say good ole dyrone suddenly tanks to diamond 2 from challenger are you going to say that dyrus belongs in diamond 2 simply because thats the rank hes at?

This is even more prominent in late-game scenarios.\n\nSo whether or not they'd stayed under tower, even with the strength of duo nexus towers, a lot of times, don't do much at that stage of the game. People will just die and towers will fall when Baron buff is present. The question is how long you can stall it, and how successful you can intimidate/dare them not to all-in. Sure your team could've survived, or at least for longer, if they didn't rush head first into the enemy team, but you kinda have to accept the fact that some of your buildings would just fall if they were already at your very last line while sporting Baron buffs, especially when your team was already behind then them. And even if you did survive this wave, they would just keep it coming and coming under you guys were whittled down and destroyed, given the advantage/gold margin as described.\n\nThe only exception is either when the team has literally 0 coordination and gets picked off one by one in scattered skirmishes, or that they're so dumb they can not manage a teamfight with a massive advantage on their side; but you can't be betting too much on miracles.\n\nOr unless your team had some very capable and elusive splitpushers, otherwise I personally couldn't see much chances in your winning that match even if you'd successfully repelled the push talked about in the OP.\n\n**IMO, you lot losing that match was more to do with an inevitability rather than a misplay.**","replies":[]}]}
