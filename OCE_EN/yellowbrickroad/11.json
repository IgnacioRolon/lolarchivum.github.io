If I'm bronze it is still possible to beat golds, it's plat where it's \"annoying\".\n\nI agree that smurfs are too common but it's because high elo is hard to go anywhere with especially with queue times. Personally I think smurfs are a good thing because I can observe what they do and learn from them without having to pay for a boost or get dynamic boosted or something.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-15T18:20:26.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tbh i would enjoy learning from them too but its not like \"oh they are beating me from X mistake i just wont do that next time\"\n\nits more like \"oh fuck i cant get near my cs because their mechanical skill is far beyond mine and their smurfing lee sin is camping me because they are duoed so ill stay under tower and wait, oh fuck they are freezing lane, oh fuck the lee sin just insec'd me\"\n\nYou dont learn from that, all you learn is that when you have high mechanical skill and team work that shit like that works.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-15T23:26:37.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can learn their mechanical skill by watching stuff they do.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-15T23:32:21.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Thats not how you learn mechanics.\n\nYou learn mechanics by practicing the combos and improving reflexes.\n\nI know this because im a mastery 7 akali main who constantly has to improve my combo times.\n\nIm at the point atm that in about 0.5 seconds i can q ult auto e ignite and gunblade you.\n\nYou dont learn to do that shit by watching someone do it.\n\nYou might be able to learn the combos used, but you can just google that shit and its usually common knowledge.\n\nlike in my case akali everyone knows that in the early game the combo is to q wait for 1s left on cd then ult auto q again auto again e, its just common knowledge, and you certainly wouldnt learn to do that by watching another akali player because you cant see their cooldowns","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-16T00:09:42.621+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a known fact that playing (anything) with people who are better than you, makes you better yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-16T10:14:06.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do learn mechanics that way. I can make up combos or practice speed and improve myself too. I never said it is the ONLY way to get better, but watching better people or playing AGAINST better people makes you a better player if you choose to observe, don't try to argue against that.\n\nI said you can learn from smurfs, by observing their decisions and mechanics. Sure you can practice Akali and even innovate, but you can also play against or spectate even better Akalis to learn.\n\nI was exaggerating a bit when I said smurfs are a good thing, I think I meant that smurfs CAN be beneficial to the enemy, even if overall it is a negative thing.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-08-16T19:00:24.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok rengo ill give you a scenario.\n\nlets say a ryze walks into your team and uses a combo like qeqwqeq\n\naka the machine gun combo.\n\nThat you while actively focusing on your own play are going to have the time to process what his inputs were even though he just casted 7 skills in the span of one second, not counting any summoners or items used.\n\nAnd learn to use that combo?\n\nI can agree with watching another play AFTER The fact, like say watching better players on youtube.\n\nBut you cant just watch and learn combos like that inside your game as you only have incomplete information.\n\nIll agree that you can learn things like how to proxy by watching a singed.\n\nBut that isnt mechanics, thats tactics.\n\nMechanics is just that, mechanics, its information you cant learn by watching because its basically muscle memory.\n\nFor instance you dont learn to last hit by watching another player last hit.\n\nYou learn to last hit by practicing last hitting.\n\nYou can learn to freeze a lane by watching another player freeze a lane but thats not mechanical skill thats game knowledge.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-16T23:59:08.273+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fair point, that's Ryze. But you act as if I didn't say decisions / game knowledge in my original point. I quote \"I can observe what they do and learn from them\". This includes maybe Ryze ulting in for a different use, pushing a different lane than you would think, performing more complex strategies which you don't find out until after the fact.\n\nAnd if they were an innovator, they would make up a new combo that you find out about.\n\nHowever, as the guy below said not all smurfs are going to tryhard their way back to high elo. Some might \"troll\" as in still win but not really put in 100% which they don't need to.\n\nSo that makes that kind of smurf really bad but I do believe you can learn from a try hard smurf because you can. Doesn't make it good, people have problems in high elo which causes them to smurf such as boring game play, in-passable divisions, long queue times and more.\n\nAs I said, if you observe what they do you will learn. If you play against better players you naturally get better, but if you actually observe what they do then yes you will learn specific things. No incomplete information.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-16T12:19:37.370+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's assuming it's a competitive game which if you play against smurfs enough you will understand their is a reason why they are higher elo and the games aren't competitive. I agree with Yellowbrickroad and I have had smurfs a lot lately too. The last one I played we were very very lucky enough to win even though the adc was 3 hitting us at 2 items. So from that aspect, yes sometimes if you stay positive and all the planets happen to align you can get up and win but unlikely in my experience.\nFurthermore, if you're on you're smurf, the whole reason you're doing it in the first place is to troll and stomp some kids much lower than you, get you're confidence up and get a free win. That's not rocket science and they can be as arrogant and rude as they want because the chances they will get punished is very low.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-14T23:47:47.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Half the problem is that RIOT perma-bans people so easily and often without warning, so when a high elo player gates banned, they work themselves back up again through our elo on a new account.\n\n\nAnd seriously...
