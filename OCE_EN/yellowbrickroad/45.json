However instead of ditching them and looking at them funny, a better approach is to simply go with and work around them instead of trying to forward your ideas and theirs be damned.\n\nI think that's a far better approach and also gives the higher chance to win. But yeah, it's purely theoretical.\n\nStill, the rank system absolutely has the element of grinding in-built into it, where many of the matches could be outright unwinnable and you're forced to even the field even though it's not technically your mistake or your own fault a lot of times. And similarly, one can also be given victories they didn't work for. So yeah, it depends on what you're looking for and what you can take really. For someone who's just out to have some general fun, they may not be too intrigued in the aspect of climbing ranked. So up to you.\n\nAnd if you've decided to climb, then you will come to accept** the fact that you win some and you also lose some**. Just try your best playing with your team as the situation demands and hope for the best, is really the best way to go about it.\n\nOR..........\n\nYou can 1 trick snowballers and solo win the game. But tbh, I don't recommend this kind of approach. You see, one of the biggest reason why the low elo is as chaotic as it is, is precisely due to this point, where everyone and their mother are trying to singlehandedly win the match. So yeah, don't do this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-04-30T02:08:26.174+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you don't force them to listen. that's your fucking problem. you're trying to force them to do something.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2017-04-30T11:10:19.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im trying to force them to not play like fuckwits.\n\nIm not saying \"if you dont take dragon right now im afking\"\n\nim saying \"if you dont stop fucking throwing your lifeless corpse at that enemy ill afk\"","replies":[]}]}]}
