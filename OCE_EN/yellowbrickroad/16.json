Teemo support doesn't really make sense. He doesn't have much in the way of support. His 'poke' is too short range(will get counter-poked) and his ult comes too late to be of use. If I were to go against a teemo support in bot lane, I would play SO aggressive with deep wards.\n\nAs I said, off-meta is great. I love me some fiddlesticks jungle. Just make sure there's a logic behind what you play. Don't pick something like a zed support or varus top, because there's no reason for them to be in those lanes. They don't serve any purpose.","replies":[{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-03-28T04:14:51.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Id just like to point out that jungle is fiddlesticks meta position.\n\nJust because he isnt top tier atm doesnt mean hes suddenly not meta.\n\nIm talking more shit like hecarim support, taric top lane.\n\nAd soraka, draven top lane etc etc etc.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-03-27T15:12:02.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think this fear is exclusive to bronze.
