There will be the occasional human on my team, and we&#039;ll have a whinge over the fact that our team is made up of bots, but most of the time it&#039;s me and 4 bots vs. 5 bots.\n\nWhile this makes the game only slightly more difficult (which usually I would enjoy), it makes me wonder how people learning to play the game view it. I remember when I was first learning to play League, I played bots exclusively until I was about level 25. Someone learning the game would find it extremely difficult to learn new builds and strategies while being blown up by the 17-1 Brand bot or ulted across the map when at 30% health by the 21-4 Karthus bot. While it&#039;s hilariously funny to watch my girlfriend get murdered by Intermediate bots when I get her to try out League of Legends, she&#039;s said a few times &quot;this game is just too hard&quot; and given up. **SHE SAID THAT ABOUT INTERMEDIATE BOTS**. This obviously isn&#039;t a great attitude for new players to have about League of Legends/\n\nBefore the toxic side of our community jumps in (which is overwhelming these days, apparently) with all the &quot;bots aren&#039;t even hard, hurr durr&quot; comments  - I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s difficult FOR ME to win the games, I&#039;m saying that new players (who use bots as their training wheels into normal games) will be severely handicapped because there&#039;s nothing to be learned there. I used to have players suggesting builds and skill paths, talking me through how to leash/jungle, letting me know what the importance of baron/dragon is - but new players aren&#039;t going to have this. They&#039;ll have no guidance from experienced players, and will be left to Google methods of doing things and simply stop playing because they don&#039;t understand it.\n\nI&#039;d love to know what other people think about this, and how often they encounter it (I generally play bots only in the 7:00 - 8:30am timeslot).\n\nThanks!\n\nSer Killington I\n\nEdit: To clarify, this post is about people who use bots to get level 30 accounts and then sell them online.","replies":[{"poster":"Much Thug","date":"2016-01-15T08:44:34.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im only new to the game and i found myself teamed up with bots pretty much every game.

They seem to always take Ghost and heal, if I'm not mistaken, and just run to the enemies and autoattack, nothing else.\n\nFunny enough, I have a friend who lost to bots because of this problem. The bots were doing pretty much nothing, except following my friend everywhere he went, so he couldn't do anything properly, and the enemy bots got too fed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ser Killington I","date":"2016-01-15T07:43:49.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As much as I hate to admit it, I've lost the occasional bots game.
