I was thinking...what if we perform really well individually in a game but end up losing the match and **do not get honored for our effort**. Do you think we should at least gain a little progress on our honor system? Well i think so. Apparently the reason why there is no progress bar for the honor system is because it spans over the duration of a whole season, thus making it hard to see a ever so **slooooooooow grind towards higher honor levels**. Anyways let me know what ya&#039;ll think.\r\n{{champion:99}} \r\n{{summoner:4}} \r\n{{summoner:21}}","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-01T01:57:41.172+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The thing with the Honour system is that it's designed around *attitude*, not *skill*. To say that players who do better at the game should progress more than players who have a positive attitude is counter-intuitive to the system. The reward for doing better than other players varies, including progressing Champion Mastery, progressing Ranked (in ranked), earning more IP (and XP if the account isn't level 30) etc. There's no need to make Honour based on skill, when the purpose of the system is rewarding consistent positive behaviour, and when there's plenty of systems rewarding skill already.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teynor","date":"2017-08-05T05:24:14.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeaahhhh... no. The honour system is about how you are as a person, and how you behave, not how many kills and assists you get. If you remain really positive, and support players who aren't doing too well, you will get honoured eventually, even if you don't get honoured the first time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-31T16:05:17.297+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you did well and carried, odds are you'll get plenty of honour, your suggestion benefits toxic kda warriors.

This is actually a really good thing to do, it puts a lot of pressure on the game, and potentially wins you the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-01T00:56:14.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm currently lvl 3 honour.\nI can carry games and get no respect.\nFrivolous things are just that.\n\nIgnore everything and be cool, honour will come.","replies":[]}]}
