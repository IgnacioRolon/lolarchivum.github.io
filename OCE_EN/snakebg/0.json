Many of my friends have recommended both Ekko and Kindred and I would really like to play both of them, but I can only get 1. I already own junglers such as; Elise, Mundo, Lee Sin, Rengar, Rek&#039;sai and a few other junglers that don&#039;t fit into S6 as much.\n\nWhich champion would you recommend to someone starting out with jungle?\n\nP.S I really enjoy Rengar and Elise if that helps with the recommendation.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-01-05T06:19:11.579+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have more fun playing Ekko than Kindred. I find Kindred quite hard to play effectively. That's not to say she's in a bad spot, she's not but if you fall behind I find it quite hard to catch up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"King Crow","date":"2016-01-01T12:37:52.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It all depends on what positions you are most comfortable playing. Kindred is a lot harder to master and if you aren't an adept jungler i suggest you go for Ekko. However in terms of effectiveness in an all round team composition Kindred would be better since she works well with many champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2016-01-01T00:00:31.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly would not pick either champ if I was starting in the jungle. I have played Kindred, not Ekko, but have been told he can be difficult to master.\n\nKindred is definitely hard to master. You'll have to counter jungle frequently to get your marks, and until you do, you are extremely vulnerable. Any strong counter jungler like Shaco or Xin or Lee absolutely wrecks you. You only start to get snowballish mid to late game, unless you're pretty good at her, and you will find yourself dying a lot if you're not careful.\n\nI've actually found tanky junglers like Naut and Poppy to be more successful at the moment. So if it were just a choice between the two, I'd probably go for Ekko, as you can build him tankish.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Caress of Venus","date":"2015-12-31T17:20:54.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Totally not biased,\n\nYou should try and learn Kindred. Her Ult is awesome, and she has really good snowball potential.\n\nit will take some time to learn her kit and the way of jungling with her, but she is really good and a lot of fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-31T16:52:41.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ekko is a tank jungler (for the love of god don't play him as an AP jungle), Kindred is a marksman that scales in the jungle.\n\nIt's really your pick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-31T16:50:01.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kindred is a bit better then ekko I think but I'm not really sure tbh.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CLG Jackmithie","date":"2016-02-18T03:38:16.048+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"{{item:1410}}","replies":[]}]}
