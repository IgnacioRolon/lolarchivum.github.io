Now you can not even stay in your rank if you have a 50% win rate.\n\nYou can still climb. I started off this season with a 10% win rate ending up in bronze 1, managing to get up to gold 5 now with a win rate of 55%. For the majority of my climb through silver I was hovering 49% and still climbing. \n\n>One of my mates told me if RIOT wants to keep him in bronze then he will stay in bronze and troll all his games. How is this making a positive community.This guy was gold 2 in season 3 then had computer problems so missed a lot of games now he was bronze.\n\nA lot has changed since season 3. Those who were high elo then aren't necessarily going to be good this season. Things have changed to become a lot more objective and team orientated rather than focusing on individual mechanical skills (although they definitely do help). If your friend has the mindset of \"its Riot's fault I'm bronze and I'm just gonna troll\", he isn't going anywhere.\n\n>I played with him in a couple of games and we rekt our lane, but when it came to team fights the team would do something stupid so we could not carry.\nLike try and start a blind baron with the other team all mia and minions pushing against us. Our the zed trying to 5 v 1 before the team even got into position.\n\nCases like this are tricky to play through, but your biggest ally is communication. Use your pings. Use your words. Type to your team telling them not to do baron, to keep vision up so the enemy team can't make picks, and to fight when your minions are pushing in your favour. It's hard af, but it happens in every elo and is still possible to carry. \n\n>But to punish people in bronze and silver for not being a Plat smurf is a bit rich don't you think.\n\nI'm not a plat smurf. In fact, I am an average support one trick. Put me in my secondary role and I will lose lane 100% of the time. My mechanical skills are super average, but I make up for that in my game knowledge and shot calling. I'm also super encouraging in all of my games, keeping morale high and pulling out wins even when the game looks lost. \n\n**If my super average supporting can get me out of bronze and into gold, you can get there too. You just gotta find what works for you (hint: it isn't blaming the system or your teams). **","replies":[{"poster":"Unknown101","date":"2016-05-08T10:54:23.210+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the the TIPS. Believe it or not but reading this post made me feel a little more positive.\nBut I still have games where I get frustrated because people will not listen to you because you are the support they just expect you follow the team and ward whe whole jungle with 3 wards.\nThe thing that really ticks me off is when you expect someone to do something (like {{champion:429}}  to ulti or {{champion:33}} to tank and he flashes out as soon as he is at half hp.) and they don't. And the thing that made me deal with this was the fact that I knew I was not going to lose more LP than the LP I won last game. At the moment I lose 24LP and only win 14LP.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fuzzycuzzy","date":"2016-05-03T11:42:01.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am currently running at a 70% win rate.
