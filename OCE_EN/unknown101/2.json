As I just vs a yi and I was unable to solo him as rammus and I had {{item:1401}}  and {{item:3075}}  and he melted me with 3 items {{item:1415}}  {{item:3153}}  {{item:3047}}.\r\nAnd how is it fair that the Devourer build is so cheap. Or is it just makes it easier to kill and farm.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-24T10:09:09.401+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Devourer junglers aren't so much about building to counter them, as to delay their sated for as long as possible. \n\nTo do this, there are a few of things you could do (especially in ranked where you can see their pick).\n\n*  Counter jungle the ♥♥♥♥ out of them. They need their stacks in order to become stated and incredibly strong. If you are continuously counter jungling them and keeping control of objectives, they can't do this. Keep wards deep in their jungle (**trackers knife** is perfect for this) and get your  friendly laners to help you. \n*  If the jungler you are playing isn't going to be the best at counter jungling, focus on fast pacing the game and snowballing your lanes. Apply that map pressure, get your laners fed. Progress the game to a stage where the enemy jungler either needs to match your map pressure (taking them away from their precious farming), or loses control of their jungle due to your superior vision.\n* If you have failed the above options and they have managed to become sated (or very close to), you must work hard to counter their strengths. Devourer junglers rely heavily on their attack speed. What are you going to do? Buy **randuins** and **frozen heart**.  Both these items lower attack speed and  come with some A+ armour which will also go a long way in fighting them.\n\nA lot of devourer junglers are currently building **guinsoos**, so keep this in mind while fighting them: You must play around the stacks they have. Kite them for a lil while so the stacks can fall off, then go in for a _balls-to-the-wall engage_ (keeping in mind that you have a short timeframe before you have to back off due to them regaining stacks). **Frozen heart** is also a pretty good counter to **guinsoos** as well. \nAnother way of dealing with this item (works best in ranked where you can see champs and guess build paths) is to pick an annoying tank with strong AR and MR, who wont be shredded by the damage easily (think: malphite, mundo).\n\nIf all else fails {{champion:20}} ♥\n\nAlso try not to solo them, you must defeat the evil as a team.","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-24T10:57:24.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"so you admit that sated needs to be removed lol","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-03-24T11:41:15.309+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Where in that post does it say Sated needs to be removed?","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-24T11:59:28.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Also try not to solo them\nthere lol I believe if no champ can solo yi wen he at full build that's overpowered","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-24T12:20:15.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not so much that,  just that you need teammates to chain cc him and provide continuous damage.
