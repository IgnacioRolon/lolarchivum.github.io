However, if Jim starts losing his MMR will drop past his current rank. If he were to lose 10 games in a row his MMR might go all the way down to Silver I MMR, which means after enough losses he would demote. Then, when he is in silver 1 his MMR will be low due to all the losses and he will start getting 10-15 LP per win instead of the 20-30 he would have been getting if he kept winning.\n\nIt just means that you will need to win a decent amount of games before your MMR gets back up and your gains/losses even out.","replies":[{"poster":"Unknown101","date":"2016-06-02T09:41:12.564+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So riot is punishing me for playing while tilted ?\nThe way it is at the moment I have to get at least 70 - 80% win rate.\nWhat is the benefit of doing this it just make it impossible for you to climb after having 10 bad games or even 10 good games you lost.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-06-02T13:40:00.971+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The system's been this way since the start. If you're doing well it rewards you with higher gain and lower losses, likewise doing poorly means lower gains and higher losses. The aim is to figure out which rank you belong. If you know you aren't playing to your rank and you keep losing the system thinks you shouldn't be there and makes it harder to get back. I know it sucks, and people hate to hear it, but it's easiest if you just take a step back and come back when you've got a fresh mind. It's as I always say (even though I don't always listen to myself on this) - you only punish yourself if you keep playing while tilted.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-06-02T13:14:31.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-01T20:20:22.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im afraid i don't know what the problem is or what tanked means.
