We were unable to kill her even when I taunted her as rammus. She would just cleanse it and we would all die. In the end we had to 4 v 1 her to kill her and she still killed 3 of us.\r\nAnd then you give her a massive amount of true damage had over 4k hp and she was doing 2.2k true damage like wtf is up with that.\r\nHow are you meant to counter her when she has a spell shield and then can buy mercurial and  merc treads.\r\n\r\nSo you have these  champs that that rely on their cc because they are close range champs like fiddle and rammus. Which you would think is op but then you give everyone items to make their cc pointless and makes that champ irellevant.\r\nAnd has rammus and fiddle been nurf because I remember when fiddle could out drain most 1 v 1 damage. And rammus could tank a full team for longer than 2 seconds.","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2016-06-28T12:12:27.958+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing in the game should have un-itemizable damage sources, should either be magic, physical or mixed. not %hp true. thats my main gripe with her and vayne.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-06-28T07:49:48.378+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing compared to the old fiora","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-28T10:55:18.705+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The old Fiora was garbage lol. Q was her only good spell, and yeah it was a bit op. W = Meh, didn't do much except for not getting you CCed. E = generic attack speed buff, I guess it was decent. R =  Go invincible and hit up to 5 people? Didn't do that much damage, she was only good at dueling. And I will admit that in 1v1s, 2v2s, and 3v3s or even at a disadvantage she was massively strong, but the new one just does that better.\n\nThe new Fiora is much stronger imo.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2016-06-29T06:12:02.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If fiora is doing well in team fight  , its either shes extremely ahead in gold or ur teammates didnt do a good job during fight.
