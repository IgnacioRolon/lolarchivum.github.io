My goal here is to give you guys more visibility into the process and let you know our progress to date. \n\nThe process we are going through:\n \n1. Identify the cause we want to contribute towards (done)\n2. Identify potential organisations to partner with (done)\n3. Vet organisations and identify potential projects the donation could go towards (in progress)\n4. Work with the organisation to select where the donation makes the most sense (in progress)\n5. Check up on progress/additional follow-up at needed (not started)\n\nWhat we have done:\n \nWhen looking at charity organisations we had couple of goals we wanted to achieve, some more important than others:\n\n** MUST HAVE: **\n\n*      The organisation needed to be in the field of &ldquo;Medical&rdquo; as this was chosen by the community\n*      We wanted to organisation to impact both Australia and New Zealand\n*      We wanted to organisation to be reputable and with track record of bringing results in their field\n\n##SHOULD HAVE:##\n\n*      The topic / subject of the charity relevant to &ldquo;us&rdquo; Oceanic players\n*      We wanted the outcome of the organisation to be trackable\n\n**NICE TO HAVE:**\n\n*      We would rather work with a small organisation because they would not have many admin costs therefore the impact would be bigger\n*      We would prefer not to split the money between Australia and New Zealand, again to increase the impact\n\nFinding a charity which fulfilled all these goals was pretty hard (there are not many organisation that have impact in both Australia and New Zealand therefore we decided to split the money between the 2 regions). \n\nThe charities that fulfilled the remaining goals were doing such great work that we didn&rsquo;t want to eliminate them. We were able to narrow down the specific cause that we really wanted to contribute to, which enabled us to identify a few key organisations to vet. \n\n** Where we are at: **\n\nWe are actually working on step 3 and 4 concurrently at the moment. So we&rsquo;re in discussions with organisations in New Zealand and Australia that are focused on Skin Cancer. Given the time of year and the importance of this cause in Oceania, we think it fits well and could really help a lot of people.\n\nOnce we&rsquo;ve looked at the projects we can contribute to, we&rsquo;re going to be splitting up our donation between two different organisations - one in New Zealand, and one in Australia. Our current plan is to split these up based on where the purchase of Cosmic Reaver Kassadin came from. \n\nWe know this is taking a while and really wish that it could have all been completed by now, but our number one goal is to ensure that we do it right. Once we&rsquo;ve gotten to a point with these organisations where we&rsquo;ve identified what projects we&rsquo;re going to contribute to, we&rsquo;ll update this thread and sure you are all kept in the loop.","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-16T07:49:30.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":10,"body":"Lets hope this doesn't take as long as the Nautilus Reef.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-12-16T12:06:03.595+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":3,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Telecasterdude,realm=OCE,application-id=3fteLeTW,discussion-id=BL2VyFqU,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-12-16T07:49:30.997+0000)\n>\n> Lets hope this doesn't take as long as the Nautilus Reef.\n\nLet's impose a 5% P.A. interest on this, to make things interesting.....\n\nYou know, for the kids.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-12-18T11:49:46.064+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why is this downvoted?\n\nThis sounds like a great idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-12-20T06:47:43.011+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:134}}  \"People fear what they cannot understand\" {{champion:134}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-16T07:50:00.060+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good work guys! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aegis","date":"2015-12-16T11:00:25.619+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the update.\n\nHonestly it's better to have some talk about it (even if it's taking long) rather than nothing at all.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-12-26T13:21:40.925+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"_I would love to know about the videogame that funded my operation_, kek","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-16T14:04:59.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would the RSPCA be a possible donation target?","replies":[{"poster":"Loote","date":"2015-12-16T23:57:56.167+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For this particular donation our focus is on the medical field - we did a vote here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/yHhIOYjO-letos-talk-about-the-server-skin and that was what the community wanted. \n\nAnimal welfare is also very important, and I'd love to do something in that area at some point.

The lining of your uterus is called the endometrium.\n\nEndometriosis occurs when the endometrium grows on your ovaries, bowel, and tissues lining your pelvis. It’s unusual for endometrial tissue to spread beyond your pelvic region, but it’s not impossible. Endometrial tissue growing outside of your uterus is known as an endometrial implant.\n\nThe hormonal changes of your menstrual cycle affect the misplaced endometrial tissue. This means the tissue will grow, thicken, and break down. Over time, the tissue that has broken down has nowhere to go and becomes trapped in your pelvis.\n\nThis tissue trapped in your pelvis can cause:\n\nirritation\nscar formation\nadhesions, in which tissue binds your pelvic organs together\nsevere pain during your periods\nfertility problems\nEndometriosis is a common gynecological condition. You’re not alone if you suffer from this disorder.\n\n\nFor those who want it simplified, its common to simplify it as; imagine the most painful period you've been around your partner for....\nMultiply it by 100, instead of it being 3-5days a month, these pains can often last 2-3weeks at a time, it can affect appetite, self esteem, cause hormonal imbalances. \n\nIt's time to look at the silent sufferers in our countries, as our governments barely recognize them as medical conditions. They aren't supported properly in hospitals through public systems, and people whom have had it are sick of the constant medication processes (codeine, endone shots, etc) often they are treating like drug abusers, made to wait hours on end before even being offered some Panadeine Forte. \n\nThese women are our Mothers, Sisters, Partners, Daughters.... They suffer internally, and they do it being as strong as they can as to not impact the people around them, they're tired of being the reasons why the people they care for don't go out, get held back etc.\n\nIt often leads to anxiety, eating disorders, depression, weight fluctuations and depression (which can lead to suicide in some cases)\n\nJust my 2cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saphixia","date":"2016-04-22T02:42:10.990+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot if you want something that imapcts us oceanian's then you should pick a Skin Cancer charity, there is so much of it in Australia/Oceania that it woudl be perfect!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-28T00:28:54.218+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"5 months still nothing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2016-03-08T18:22:31.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think there are any joint medical organisations between NZ and AU.
