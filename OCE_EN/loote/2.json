I spend most of my time thinking about how to get things done and work with our teams here to make it happen! \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been at Riot since early 2010. I&#039;m an American living in Sydney, and I&#039;ve been here for around 2 years now. Before joining Riot I did payroll and employment taxes in the states. I&#039;m very excited that I don&#039;t do that anymore. \r\n\r\nI really enjoy a nice beer or a Hendrick&#039;s gin &amp; tonic. I spend a lot of my time playing MMO&#039;s or League of Legends, or doing Karaoke with friends. I watch a LOT of TV shows, and read a ton of books. I really enjoy fantasy as a genre, my favourite series is actually Harry Potter (I have a Dark Mark tattoo on my forearm). \r\n\r\nMy favourite champion varies a lot, right now I&#039;m learning Gnar. Feel free to ask me anything - I&#039;m not shy. \r\n\r\np.s. I have a glorious beard.

I help to coordinate a lot of our projects that we're working on - OPL, Finals, etc. A lot of time this is helping people to understand what they are trying to accomplish, how best to get there, and putting them in touch with the right people to ensure that they can be successful. I did help a bit on Ocean Week, but that was a team effort, I just helped a bit here and there. \n\n2. We definitely have plans and this is something we think a lot about. A great example of what we're looking to accomplish is actually with our OPL Finals at Luna - it'll be a very unique event, and should be quite fun. A lot of what is going on will bring quite a bit of attention, which is a great step along the way of creating a more competitive scene. \n\n3. It's pretty tough - we're very particular about who we hire. The reality is that when choosing a place to work it's very important to evaluate the company you're working for, just like its important for us to evaluate who we want to hire. If you want to learn more about working at Riot, I highly suggest our website: www.riotgames.com - if you have more specific questions about what your area of study is, etc. I'm happy to chat about that as well. \n\n4. Well, we are called Riot Game(s). We do have an r&d team, but nothing I really know much about. http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20141012/1549/putting-s-riot-games has a little info. \n\n5. This is a great idea - I'll bring it up and see what we can come up with. I think there is a big opportunity for things like this!","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-07-22T09:36:12.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying!
