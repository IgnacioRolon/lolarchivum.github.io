He's a little like a superhero. \n\nI hope theres at least a picture of him at the centres (or wherever), tbh if i was a kid suffering from cancer, id kinda like to see the face of my superhero. That stuff means a lot to kids. (and probably adults too) \n\nWell done RIOT, well done.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedPandaFox","date":"2016-05-03T07:27:24.109+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hi.\n\nI think this is something amazing, Proud too be a part of the League community.\nIt just goes too show that Company's like Riot are not in it for the money, They actually want positive outcomes!\nGood Stuff Guys!\n\n-RedPandaFox","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-03T07:03:20.174+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"So any actual details on say, the donation amount for each one?","replies":[{"poster":"Loote","date":"2016-05-03T09:15:32.297+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"Hey! We knew this question would come up, but we can’t talk about specific numbers for charitable donations. I know that sucks, but it’s our policy to keep these confidential.
