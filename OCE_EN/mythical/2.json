At the moment there are a lot of pro players playing on OCE to practice in preparation for the international wildcard.\r\n\r\nThese players are obviously given Riot accounts to practice on but it seems that these accounts don&#039;t climb elo at all. Earlier today I was matched against HolyPhoenix (HWA Gaming&#039;s ADC) \r\nand Crystal (Dark Passage&#039;s jungler).\r\n\r\nThese two are duoing on the Riot accounts which seem to be only in the plat 3-1 range. I vsed them when their accounts only had 1 win and they were in \r\nour elo and fast forward to tonight where they&#039;re 8 wins 1 loss, we vs them again. When asked why they aren&#039;t vsing challengers yet, they simply responded with &quot;riot handed us low elo accounts\r\nthat don&#039;t move&quot;. \r\n\r\nThese guys are pro players in Turkey with accounts that aren&#039;t moving out of plat 3-1 no matter how much they win. Should these accounts not be placed in diamond 1 or challenger so they can actually play vs people\r\nat their level? I&#039;m not sure what they have to gain by constantly just stomping people in plat and their mmr never going up and the people they&#039;re stomping don&#039;t exactly deserve to be losing LP to this. \r\n\r\nTheir accounts: \r\n\r\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=lWC%20HolyPhoenix\r\nhttp://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=iwc+crystal","replies":[]}
