Unless you haven't played on that account for *ages*. Also, there was the IP boost reward for participating in the OCE region event, the one with that statue. It's possible you participated without knowing (you just had to play a certain champion in a game and win, no notification) and stopped playing before you got the reward.\n\nAlso you aren't using the same account you used to create this discussion.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
