Everytime i get into the lobby of champions selection, I get stuck in it....its like the time for pick/bans runs out and just doesnt move from there. Which means im losing way too many LPs, waiting 30min all the time to TRY to play again because it happens over and over again.\r\n I ve already tried to Repair the game with the repair tool, unnistal the game and install again, desativate Anti-virus and also firewall, Nothing happens at all.\r\n\r\nIf you have any knowledge about those crashes please feel free to share it here, i appreciate all the help, expecialy from Riot that knows what happening with their servers.\r\n\r\nWaiting for answer,\r\nThank you all,\r\nInsane Kazuya","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-06-22T23:11:06.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nCould you try running through the [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) support article for me, let me know if anything helps.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Insane Kazuya","date":"2016-06-22T10:11:43.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot? nothing?","replies":[]}]}
