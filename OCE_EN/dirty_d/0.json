Why should the top laner that had 50 CS and and went 1 /15/1 gain the same amount as the mid laner who went 15-4-8 and had 200 CS and took 2 tower and an inhib? It could work something like 15 LP base for a win and that +/- depending on The other factors. Did you have a positive kDA? Did you help secure dragon? Did you place wards? All these things could increase or decrease the LP gained depending on how you rated. Yes meaning of you win and played horrible you could gain no LP or on the other hand if you post but still played an experimental game you could lose no LP. I think this would help create better experiences during games as people will try to do their very best. Unless they are purely trolling.

Supports and possibly jungle would have to have different weights in ways they gain bonus LP.\n\nYour correct about the Leblanc. But, that can happen now and the result will still be the same. (It will still be a loss). In most cases a troll will troll from the start and not half way through the game. I've found most trolls have a large losing streak and just want to ruin it for other people so basically they suck and wouldn't have a kDA like that to begin with. Even if this did happen. After all the work they put in they are hurting themselves the most by denying them selves of bonus LP or at lest neutralising it from playing well.","replies":[{"poster":"Orange Caramel","date":"2015-12-14T03:55:14.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, but there's also the case where a person intentionally feeds, and the others are trying their best to win, and because of that, they keep dying to the fed enemies, losing more LP than they should simply because they're unable to do anything.\n\nAlso, what about people that have such a good team, that they get fed and kill everyone, making the enemy surrender while you're still 1/0/0 or whatever?","replies":[{"poster":"Dirty D","date":"2015-12-14T08:19:14.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Quick games could also be a factor for bonus LP. I mean if you are 1-0-0 you are still positive, didn't feed. Chances are you help your team gain objectives (towers/inhibs/drag/baron. I don't think it's a bad thing that there other 1-2 people on your team gain a bit more LP than you do. I mean they have help you get a win such a quick game. which otherwise may have been a loss. We have all been in this position (doing really well and just doing ok and gained wins) not see about you but I would want to get better do better so that I gained more LP. Playing bad comes at a cost win or lose and playing well would come with its advantages. It would force people to learn more from there mistakes.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-12-13T15:31:50.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"good idea. that is another great reason for people to buy a sight stone and ward base.

Kill participation/passive gold should weigh heavier for supports anyway. Since it's something you can't fake on the stats. I'm sure riot could create dead areas particularly close to base that doesn't count towards LP contribution. It appears that it would somewhat help negate afker's since it would drastically increase there LP loss from no contributions but the players left would be able to try salvage a low LP loss. It would push the idiots that like to troll people's games for enjoyment out of range of anyone who actually cares about playing competitively.","replies":[]}]}
