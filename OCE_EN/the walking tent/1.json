I haven&#039;t done anything to these people I don&#039;t know them so I decided fuck it im gonna play teemo I was afk in lane for the first few minutes grabbing a drink got back still in lane and it gave me the option to cast a remake vote but everyone was moving including me. I casted the voted happy to get out of the game with the idiots that don&#039;t communicate but instead just ban someones main, get out of game to have the message Leave (Remake) -18 LP can someone explain to me how this would be my fault? I was lvl 2 and just started to play. im pretty pissed I want my LP back this is just retarded...","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-08-25T01:22:53.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Banning a champ is bad but could have been accidental, esp with yas because he is pretty much permabanned . \n\nBeing a dick about it was your choice. There are 138 champs to play. \n\nMy advice - dont be a dick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-08-24T23:27:44.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The other guys are right. The only people who lose lp in a remake are those that caused it.

This can be cancelled by just moving the camera so it doesnt effect anyone who isnt afk.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2017-08-23T09:12:47.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You probably lost LP because you were the one who was marked as AFK, even if you did join the game just a few minutes late. That's my guess. It doesn't really matter if joined late. You were inactive for a few minutes - long enough to trigger the remake option/have someone cast the vote. \n\nI doubt you'll get your LP back if that's the case, unfortunately.","replies":[]}]}
