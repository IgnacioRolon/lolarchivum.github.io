I know there is nothing this company can do but why am I getting punished for my top lane feeding a bronze 1 (booster).  Pointless having a MMR system if its not in use properly.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-04-06T11:48:55.513+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your MMR will continue to tank unless you improve your play!","replies":[]},{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-04-06T10:58:40.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"git gud","replies":[{"poster":"The Walking Tent","date":"2017-04-06T11:18:23.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ur bronze I don't get why u would even bother commenting","replies":[{"poster":"WoadKethunt","date":"2017-04-09T02:08:20.892+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your just salty you lost to some bronzies","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2017-04-08T04:33:09.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't Git mad GIT GUD SON :)\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-06T10:58:20.264+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Youre mmr is just shit full stop, its not about shown mmr, its about hidden, and your hidden is crap.
