Extending from what TheDemonEmperor stated, it is true that you cannot hard carry at your elo. He's not saying you can't carry ANY of your games, he saying you can't carry enough to climb out of your elo. This means that though you can gain an early lead (as you say), whether it be from winning your lane, or having a good few ganks, it means that out of a majority of games, you do not know how to extend that lead to victory, at least consistently.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Eimer Troll","date":"2017-03-13T07:01:03.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Forget about other members of your team and solely focus on your own play, you don't want to let others tilt you.

I started playing league about 1.75years ago and climbed from silver to diamond since then.\n\nWe all understand your struggle. If you are truly hard-carrying most of your games, you will naturally climb over a large sample of matches. Even a 55-60% winrate is a decent climb for a short period, so accept that you will never be able to hard-carry in all of your games (which is fine). If you do belong in gold, you'll get out of silver 100%. Intentional feeders exist on both your side and the enemy's. Over a long period of time, these games will even out unless you have a personality that \"encourages\" teammates to feed, like flaming. You probably just got unlucky if it happens a few times in a row. You will have games where people don't want to get carried but you'll have more where people do enough that you can.\n\nIf you want try try different styles to climb, try playing a champ where you can split push to nexus after winning your lane (or out-jungling the enemy). Most teams in silver solo q will not be able to communicate properly to react to your split pushing if done correctly. People do it to get to masters so you can easily do it to get out of silver if you take the time to learn.  \n\nI looked you up on op.gg, try aiming for less deaths unless you're playing a split push champ (try for no more than 6).  It's good that you're playing hard-carry champs, but don't forget that you have to be highly consistent with those as you climb. \n\nFeel free to ask me anything. I'm more than willing to help and give you detailed answers/ideas.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
