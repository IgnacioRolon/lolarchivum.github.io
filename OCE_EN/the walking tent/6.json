I understand that yes the other team should get LP but the team that happens to get the 12 year old kid that dc&#039;s after 3 mins to troll his team shouldn&#039;t lose their LP or mmr they didn&#039;t do anything wrong. I get that people could just leave last second safing their mate some LP its just something that will have to  be looked into by mr riot employees.\r\n{{champion:427}}","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-16T00:42:49.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This old inferior idea...","replies":[{"poster":"The Walking Tent","date":"2017-01-16T01:16:42.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what? you mean?","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-01-16T02:41:00.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Too easy to take advantage of.
