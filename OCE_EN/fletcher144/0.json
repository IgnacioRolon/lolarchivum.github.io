I got banned for much less, without any swearing or any foul language.\n\nAlso, Junglers aren't \"required\" to gank. Technically speaking, you aren't even required to have the lanes the way they are. It's just how the mentalities of the community and Riot have developed over time. I've had games with duo Mid, or ADC/Support in both Bot and Top, or even two Junglers. Heck, if you really want to, you could just ARAM it.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have just used */mute all*.\n\nOn the bright side, because I'm Bronze V, it's not like I'm going to miss out on rewards anyway.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"pieceofpecanpie","date":"2017-10-27T17:47:20.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nothing really to talk about.
