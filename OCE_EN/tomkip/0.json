Throughout this game a certain player decides to troll and feed cause they think its funny, they then proceed to feed every lane, you would think it would stop there, nope. They then start grief, and telling the enemy team where you are, initially helping the enemy. Your other teammates are annoyed with this ask this player to stop. So as any annoyed player would i begin to typed back asking why they do this, there response cause its funny. I became very annoyed with this player and began ask why they would do this, ask the other team to report them, things you would normally do. \r\n\r\nThen riot decides to perma ban me, thanks riot staff, you ban a player just wanting to enjoy the game and play but keeps those that troll, feed, and annoy other players. What a great company, they should change the way they advertise their game, since obviously people trolling is what this company wants.","replies":[{"poster":"i sIept with dad","date":"2018-05-25T09:58:38.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"post your chat logs, i bet u said alot more than \"why would u do this?\" idc if ur annoyed bahahahahah{{champion:20}}","replies":[]}]}
