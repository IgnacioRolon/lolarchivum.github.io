I've recently started to play Skarner in part because he struck me as the most obscure champion in the current state of the game, he's so rare a pick, but above all I've been surprised by him being quite strong regardless. I got an S almost immediately and his clear is so good that getting no leash to start doesn't seem to bother him at all. Yet, I still expect he's on the dev radar for a full rework, since they have shown a pattern of picking the most underplayed champs for reworks just to get them back in the fray.","replies":[{"poster":"Doron","date":"2017-07-30T07:51:17.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, there's a lot to say about Skarner, particularly in regards to him being reworked.\nHe's received numerous reworks throughout League's history, the most recent being the Juggernaut rework in the third quarter of Season 5.\nThe rework was effectively a straight buff. He received a handful of nerfs and he was made slightly more difficult to play, but also received obscenely large buffs to compensate (and became the highest winrate champion in LoL's history because of it). \nWhat followed was a chain of severe nerfs to bring him into line, leaving him at around a 54% winrate that has steadily been declining to this day. \n\nHe's still very, very strong, but people don't play him to his strengths. The result is that his performance isn't indicative of either what the champ CAN do, nor what he SHOULD do. He's commonly viewed as a tank, even Riot themselves identifying him as a Vanguard, when in reality he's a... he's sort of his own thing, really. He's a durable-immobile-melee-AD-sustained-burst champ that also has a strong movement speed steroid and insane single target crowd control. \n\nThe problem is that his damage, which is the strongest of any of the juggernauts, is completely ignored in favour of his survivability and CC. The playerbase views him as a tank, Riot views him the way the playerbase views him, and since he'll likely end up receiving yet another rework he'll probably go the way of Sejuani and have his claws removed.\nI'd like to stop that from happening, but I have no idea who I need to talk to.","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-30T08:43:14.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As someone who's rather new to him I've tended towards the recommended items list to guide me, and the itemization they suggest does point to the idea of a durable fighter rather than a tank; Stuff like {{item:3078}} , {{item:3071}}  , and {{item:3742}} .\nSo he's one of the most underplayed champions in the game due to.. a misunderstanding? Or maybe he just looks uncompelling  and boring compared to most other champs. His art is looking quite dated, and I'm still not sure I'm sold on the 'capture the crystals' passive. It just seems like he's not in a great spot these days.","replies":[{"poster":"Doron","date":"2017-07-30T09:25:53.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah, he's underplayed because being an immobile melee champion doesn't do you many favours. He also rarely sees play at high Master/Challenger so there's not as much appeal to him as, say, Elise or Gragas. His play rate is comparable to champs like Trundle, Udyr, Volibear and Shyvana. \n\nI actually think that his passive is pretty well done, but it's not obvious enough to his team mates what the passive is actually doing.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
