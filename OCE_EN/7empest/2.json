The new client takes a very long time to authenticate (sometimes up to 5 minutes) and load but when I switch to the legacy client it doesn&#039;t take much time at all. So I thought maybe its not a problem with my internet and maybe the server or the client itself?  This has been happening since the latest patch. If anyone could give me any information on how to resolve this issue it would be much appreciated!\n\nGLHF :)","replies":[{"poster":"Thegrumpyotter","date":"2017-06-25T00:29:08.109+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"seriously it's still happening it's still annoying","replies":[]},{"poster":"BlackGuyRohan","date":"2017-06-19T21:19:23.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"mine has been logging in for the past hour","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reiddos","date":"2017-06-08T06:12:06.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes it takes about a minute once ive typed my username in compared to like 5 seconds in the old legacy client it is a massive drawback","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lelendarian","date":"2017-10-08T23:33:25.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same problem here.
