Wouldn&#039;t full AD items be the better choice for more efficiency and effectiveness?\r\n\r\nAlso, for champs like graves I&#039;ve read in a guide that if you build Cleaver don&#039;t go Lethality items and when you go Lethality items buy all three and don&#039;t build Cleaver. What is the reasoning behind this? Especially against tanky teams isnt it good to go full armour pen/shred items?\r\n\r\nIm just a little confused as to what builds are best against squishy teams and what builds are best against tanky teams?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! Any reply is appreciated :) Help a Silver 4 scrub out!","replies":[{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-06-09T22:55:24.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with the current state of graves i would always recommend the warrior/cleaver/phantom build\n\ngenerally, there are just \"optimal\" builds for most ad carrys at the moment, remember that cleaver can shred 24% which will generally be roughly equivalent to a lethality item once stacked, which is why its good on e.g. lucian. the only real switch-up on ad carry with regards to tanky teams would probably be whether or not you take a last whisper.\n\nhope this helps buddy","replies":[{"poster":"7empest","date":"2017-06-10T01:42:29.891+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay so from what I understand, Cleaver is better on champs that can stack it easily (like Graves and Lucian) and it's max shred is pretty much equivalent to a Lethality item, and on top of that with all the extra stats it gives compared to say ghostblade which is only 100g cheaper than cleaver, it's alot more efficient to buy cleaver instead. Furthermore a Lethality items have to scale till level 18 for the full effect, so it's just generally better to buy cleaver for champs that can stack it easily.\n\nThanks for the reply! Was very helpful :) Will try it out and do more research!","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-06-10T04:30:28.236+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because blackcleaver is equal to lethality against squishy champs, it has greater effect againt tanks while retaining the lethality effect. Though lethality is weak against tanks while quite powerful against squishy champions. So black cleaver is a valid item in all scenarios, while lethality is more of a window of opportunity.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
