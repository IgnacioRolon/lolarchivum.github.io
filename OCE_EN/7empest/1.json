Everything works in the client from logging in/chat to champ select works smoothly, but once I get to the loading screen, I don&#039;t even get to see the champions with the percentages and stuff. It&#039;s just a black screen until a message appears saying &quot;You have disconnected. Check your internet connection&quot;. I am able to ping the oce server 104.160.156.1 and I&#039;m getting the usual ping (49-75 ish).

But basically, the client worked fine 100%. But, whenever you actually tried loading into a game, the screen would be black for a very long time. Finally player banners, names, summoners etc. all showed up but the backround and character images were still black. When this happened, in the bottom right hand corner in the ping would read 0 and the loading circle would be frozen. Occasionally I could join the game about 13+ minutes after it had started, but that was only twice (I guess the other times they all remade?) and I ended up getting leaver ban while trying to fix the issue.\n\nI figure it was a connection to the server issue, but like I said, I tried literally everything. From firewall access to running hextech repair tool, reinstalling the patch, deleting files then performing a repair. My PC is fairly new and I had no 3rd party software installed at the time to my knowledge. But nothing worked at all. And yeah 2 weeks later with patch 8.16 it was just all fixed somehow and I haven't had the issue since.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"K√ºrama","date":"2018-08-05T05:59:55.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"üñêüèΩ Hi there!\n\nThis is due to the anti-cheat update in the patch, it's incompatible with a number of CPUs/GPUs, particularly AMD. There isn't a solution for this currently but Riot is aware and I've heard they're working on a fix.","replies":[]}]}
