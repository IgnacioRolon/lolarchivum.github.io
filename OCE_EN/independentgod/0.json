Surely some others of you agree. I would like to play PvP but I would first like to improve my style first and it would be great if Riot of LoL could make a difficulty higher than intermediate. I am not talking like a Lux ulting in every direction or something, just bots having higher intelligence or strategy than they already have.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-12-04T10:55:59.603+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel your pain, I often want to practice my skills or new strats or item builds before I take it to normal where I just know people are gonna rage at me for playing some non meta pick and not getting perfect CS or whatever ... but the bots really are too easy for that, I can pretty much pick anyone play them anywhere and build whatever and I still come  out on top.. even in like a 3v1... sometimes I do make dumb yolo mistakes and tower dive 4 of them and they all just run away and I die to turret but f course I would never do that against real people.... but it would really be nice to go and practice getting CS in a lane that harassed properly and actually made it hard for you.. I understand that bots are kind of just for beginners and after that .. maybe just a first win of they day if you had no luck in normals/ranked ... but it really would be nice to be able to practice some things at a higher level  without the weight of playing against other people..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-12-04T18:26:48.359+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Or you could just play normals.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fallowfield","date":"2015-12-12T23:02:13.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Games vs AI are difficult enough with the amount of bots you end up having as team-mates. I'm still learning and like the low stress/pressure levels of games vs AI - but playing 2v5 because you have 3 feeding bot players is just too much. I may just be unlucky but the games where all 5 players are human are very, very rare. \n\nThis game makes me sad sometimes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spinne44","date":"2015-12-05T01:30:39.527+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just try normals {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[{"poster":"independentgod","date":"2015-12-05T07:29:26.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Spinne44,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=T5WhK8HH,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-12-05T01:30:39.527+0000)\n>\n> Just try normals {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}\n\nPeople like me want to practice and improve before playing PvP as I think I've specified earlier","replies":[]}]}]}
