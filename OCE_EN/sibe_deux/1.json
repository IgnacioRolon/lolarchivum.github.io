But I get this weird disconnect thing where I am still in game but my character just runs around and I can&#039;t do anything (basically auto attacks). Then even though my internet is 100% okay it doesn&#039;t reconnect. The easiest way to reconnect is to put the PC on standby and log back into my PC. Another way is to kill LoL through the Task Manager, but that takes FAR longer.\r\nTried to reinstall LoL to no avail, anyone else have similar odd issue?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-09T05:16:07.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nHow long have you been having the problem for?

If it does happen, as I recall, it usually happens early in the game (lane phase), and it will happen only once a game and no more (I believe).\nOne forum commenter noted it might have something to do with [IE/Edge](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support/YR8kxJsX-trying-to-reconnect), but I haven't tried that yet.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-09-10T01:02:15.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is an interesting idea, although I'm not sure how it would work.\n\nThat said, I'm not super familiar with Win10, but I'd also suggest going over the steps in [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) as a starting point.
