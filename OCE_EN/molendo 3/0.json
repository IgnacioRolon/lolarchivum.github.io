It really does suck.   What stupid logic dictates that the first game is so important?  Lots of great players are going to lose their first game through no fault of their own, and lots of rubbish players will win their first game through having 4 awesome team mates.  It just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe whole concept is ridiculous.  Why even do a reset unless its a hard reset that gives everyone a chance to regrade properly?  If Riots goal is to keep everyone roughly where they were, but have everyone drop slightly (which is what they've said) then why no just soft reset by dropping everyone 3 divisions?  \n\nIf the assumption is that people are roughly where they should be then why build a system that regrades based on only 10 games?  The previous season was based on hundreds of games.  Surely that counts for more.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-22T10:08:28.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It also depends on the order of wins and losses.\n\nThe first game counts for the most, and then less as you go on in your placements, so if you lost your first 2/3 it can really damage the MMR you have even if you managed to turn it even.","replies":[{"poster":"Florence Welch","date":"2015-01-22T10:41:36.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then mine makes even less sense . . . won 8 out of 10 . . . won the first 5 in a row.
