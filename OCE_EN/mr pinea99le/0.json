Plus i did have some honor to jax saying gj to him. That explains my chat logs and i was in promos to bronze 3 so i really wanted to win, you can imagine when you get camped bot by the enemy jg and when your support doesn&#039;t ward you get a bit pissed off, so can i get unbanned i&#039;m pretty sure i wont but its worth a try. One more thing this account has gotten banned before like 4 times but that&#039;s because i was inting i know now that inting was a really douche thing to do so i have stopped inting now for the past week.","replies":[{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2017-11-13T10:41:26.982+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmm how about no u fucked up and now u get to deal with the consequences.
