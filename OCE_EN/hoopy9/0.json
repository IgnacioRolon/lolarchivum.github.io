That will initiate the account recovery process, where the support agent will ask a series of questions related to the account to verify you are the original user (you shouldn't need to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt, also any other info you can provide that can't be found through Riot or 3rd party services may help), and hopefully they'll be able to identify the compromise and reverse any punishments that had resulted from that.\n\n***Important note:*** If you have ever engaged in account sharing of any kind, you may not receive as much help, because the nature of such sharing makes it significantly harder for the support agents/Rioters to identify a legitimate compromise.\n\nNext, I'd highly recommend that you run anti-virus scans on any personal computers you've used recently, as well as suggest the same for anyone who's computer you've used to play/access LoL recently (personally, I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for manual scans, as it tends to pick up things that other anti-virus programs miss in my experience, but up to you). It may turn up nothing, but it's best just to make sure your computer isn't compromised, otherwise this could happen again.\n\nAfter that, you'll want to change your accounts password (you'll do this as part of the account recovery process, but if the scans pick something up it would still be best to change at that point, just in case), as well as check the security of any important accounts you have (for example, email, bank etc), and I'd recommend you check out https://haveibeenpwned.com/ as it is a great resource to help track down compromises on accounts you use.","replies":[]}]}
