This is to ensure that the people developing/using their tools are not aware of when or what was detected.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Buzz Bacon","date":"2017-09-23T07:38:06.833+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Noticed that the bots in ARAM regularly take cleanse + snowball and they don't have a mastery.
