Once you climb up some more you'll start seeing everyone ward more frequently; no feature is going to make the lowest elo players drop wards if they don't want to anyway.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2016-06-18T06:30:27.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you sound like a 5 yr old who lacks social skills to convince your allies you've warded","replies":[]},{"poster":"tempbanned2ndAct","date":"2016-06-18T06:18:22.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]}]}
