It wouldn't do that if everything was fine.\n\nIf you can't afford to redownload the entirety of League again, what you can do is get a local copy and paste it directly into your game folders. To do that, get a computer that has the latest version of League on it, copy (almost) everything from the projects folder and put it on your computer.\n\nThese are the precise steps you need to take:\n1. On the computer with League on it, open Riot Games/League of Legends/RADS/projects/\n2. Copy the folders \"lol_air_client\", \"lol_air_client_config_oc1\", \"lol_game_client\", \"lol_game_client_en_au\", \"lol_launcher\" and \"lol_patcher\" onto removable media you can put into your other computer. This is for if you want the OCE version of League, you don't need the rest unless you want other regions too.\n3. On your computer, back up the following files: All files in \"\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\0.0.1.XXX\\deploy\\preferences\" (where XXX is the lastest version number), and everything in \\Config\\\n4. Paste League from the removable media into the appropriate folders on your computer.\n5. Restore all the files you backed up in step 3 in order to restore your preferences. Overwrite the existing files and merge folders if asked.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]}]}
