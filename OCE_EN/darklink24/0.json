As a jungler, life gets sooo much harder if I have to give my blue to the midlaner and my red to the adc; and you still take my kruggs and chickens.","replies":[{"poster":"EPIC REAPER","date":"2016-10-09T05:03:13.848+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"when i play ivern supp i take the enemy jungler buffs instead","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-08T10:14:09.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but can you plant a grove on baron or dragon?","replies":[{"poster":"EPIC REAPER","date":"2016-10-09T05:01:54.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Korossal","date":"2016-10-08T08:35:38.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ivern = Riven :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-10-09T03:38:33.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha kiandymundi","replies":[]}]}]}
