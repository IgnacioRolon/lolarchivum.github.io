Im not coming here to appeal because I know it will never be lifted, but I am wondering if there is any way that I will get my skins or maybe even just the champions refunded to a new account I make? I sent a support ticket a few days ago and have not got an answer so yeah maybe a riot employee will see this and give me an answer","replies":[]}
