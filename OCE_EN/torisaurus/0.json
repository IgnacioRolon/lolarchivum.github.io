It would be a quality of life improvement for both the players and the game community. Very rarely will a person say something of a constructive nature, from the early 'GG's' to the constant flaming? Further, if one response to this negative behaviour, they can be punished equally, or in some cases, more severely than the person who is ultimately responsible. \r\n\r\n Why not implement an option that can prevent this toxicity, without having to mute every person? Additionally, why can't one mute champ select, or better yet, permanently disable chat in all its forms.","replies":[{"poster":"Bigpoo","date":"2017-10-14T10:19:54.550+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sad this topic got derailed because of some poor use of analogies. Lets use two different arguments instead.\n\n1. My child loves this game but frequently comes to me and notes how terrible the comments that are said to him/her are. I would like the option of allowing him/her to play without exposing them to something that can only be retroactively punished/diminished.\n\n2. I've played thousands of games, watched hundreds of hours of streamers playing, and generally understand the meta through watching the professional scene. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that something in the neighborhood of .5% of typed messages are beneficial to the team or the game. It's almost always memes, insults, or someones bored rambling about things that have nothing to do with the game.\n\nIt is extremely hard to understand that given the rate of combative, unhelpful, and abusive behavior that occurs in typed chat that this game could even possible be rated 13+ if it doesn't have a chat opt out function.\n\n If one can go in before the game starts and mute each individual player reliably every game all the time and not be punished for it, then why deny people the option to do so in a single click? All I've seen from the green colored named person is \"personal responsibility\". I think that's what this thread is asking for. \n\nAllow me to be personally responsible AND efficient by clicking one time for good instead of 9 times per game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-09-06T08:15:46.189+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"before being banned. ive asked to have my chat restricted by choice and not allow me to use this function. the answer i got was it wont show if ive improved if the chat is not there to distinguish whether ive improved or not.  however they never try to help me improve just constant punishments but that is another story.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T08:29:11.958+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"Banning your chat permanently doesn't solve the problem, it only pushes your outlet to somewhere else that is likely also harmful to other players (trolling, griefing, afking etc).\n\nYou *yourself* need to find a healthy outlet for your frustration, rather than abusing random internet strangers and saying \"I can't help it and noone will help me\". It's your behaviour, and therefore your responsibility. Outsiders can only help you if you are *really* willing to be helped.\n\nTry yelling at your screen instead of typing, isn't practical in all situations but it might work for you. If that doesn't work try moving your chat off screen, or if you have a keyboard you can rebind (razer or some such) then unbind your enter key while you are in game.\n\nIf you can't do either of those then maybe try to look a bit deeper into why you get frustrated and get some perspective. Is it because someone isn't doing what you tell them? Do you do what random strangers tell you when it doesn't make sense to you or is something they could do themselves just as easily? Probably not. \n\nIs it because your score is better than everyone else's but they won't follow you? KDA isn't everything and they know that, so if you want them to follow your lead, you have to give them a better reason than \"I have a good score\".\n\nIs it because you're having a bad game and you know you should be better but it feels like you can't catch a break? Take a break from the game (after you finish it of course), since clearly you aren't in the best space to be playing League. As for in the game itself, take a deep breath, back up and play it real safe until you can either catch up or help your team to pull something off. You don't have to carry to win, ideally you just have to not feed.\n\nIs it because someone on your team is toxic? What do you think being toxic back accomplishes? You might think it's closure or revenge, but really it's just fuel for their fire and stopping to their level. You don't stop toxicity by becoming part of the problem. Take a breath, and mute them. If you report them after game then they'll get their punishment in the form of a ban, which is far more effective than anything a random stranger (you) can yell at them. It's just not worth it.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-09-06T09:07:02.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great points\nWhat about if the player has played for years, never been punished but never uses chat or sees the point to it, all it does is interver could they get it removed?  \nIf chat is removed permantly I think less people would be banned because toxicity In Chat is punished more then trolling.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T09:11:26.802+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"They wouldn't be able to see things like summoner spell pings or the like.

Nothing gives you a free pass to say shit like that, especially in a *13+* rated game.\n\nYou earned that chat restriction same as they earned those 5 bans and are earning their 6th. Just because you didn't get a notification doesn't mean they weren't banned, the notifications are notoriously dodgy, and it might even be because you waited that you didn't get one.

If some is trolling it's annoying as shit but it doesn't give the right to abuse them. Christ half the time that's what they want. Not to mention but if someone is having a bad game the easiest way to get them to start trolling is flame them. \n\nRiot needs to get better st dealing with Trolls and greiferrs but there is not a simple soloution. The line betweeen someone having a couple of bad games and someone inteionslly feeding can be very slim just looking st the stats.

Stop putting words in my posts that aren't there. I never said beat the rapist to death. I specifically said otherwise.\n\n2. There is a simple solution, actually, or at least here is my opinion of what could be done if Riot gave enough of a shit;\n\na; All troll/griefer reports are watched by a human being.\nb; If a false report in an attempt to get someone banned, you get maybe a 3 stage warning before getting the same punishments that are handed out at current (2 week suspension, then if offends again, perm ban).\nc; If legitimate; griefer/troller is soft banned, first offense, no negotiation. May be appealed with a proper apology, after which a probation period is set and if such behaviour is witnessed again, permanent ban without exception.\n\nIf this system were put in place. Guess what would happen? The no-bullshit punishments would mean trolls and griefers would either slowly disappear through reports, or they would just stop as they fear the consequences, as most kids only do what they are allowed to within their set boundaries.

It's like you're deliberately clinging on to an awkward analogy in order to obfuscate his point.\n\nSo let's try a nice simple one:\n\n* A person has a needle, a little sharp needle and they intend to poke you with it. So away they go, _poke poke poke_\n\n* \"OUCH!\" you say. \"That hurts stop that please.\" But they don't stop, they keep poking you, _poke poke poke_, on and on. It hurts. The needle is sharp. But you can't get up and leave. And it keeps on hurting.\n\n* Until you can't take any more, you lash out, grab their hand with the needle and twist it with enough force that they drop the needle.\n\nBAM! Under Riot's interpretation you are now both equally ripe for punishment.\n\nWhat Gloric is trying to get across is that this seems both unreasonable and unfair. It doesn't gel with the norms of society and it's the flaws within Riot's reporting and behaviour detection system that allow this egregious form of punishment to continue.\n\nFor the most part I agree with Gloric, at least in the sense that the system right now has some pretty serious flaws. I also agree with the OP's sentiment that chat is rife with abuse and should be addressed by Riot in the near future so they can look to make some positive changes.\n\nThese changes can be accomplished in various ways:\n\n1. The reporting/punishment system could be refined\ni. more human reviews\nii. clearer definition between aggressors (ie. trolls) and other people deemed abusive by using different punishment forms (warning, chat restrict, suspension) and singling out the harshest penalties for the most aggressive and abusive players\niii. ?\n\n1. The chat system could be refined\ni. allow for an opt out (OP's idea) or better yet have chat disabled with an opt in approach\nii. use word filters for common abusive, harassing terms\niii. make chat limited to predetermined statements (eg. \"lets go top/mid/bot/baron/drag\")\niv. ?\n\n1. The smart pings system could be refined\n\n1. Some other form of communication could be introduced (eg. in game comms)\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gloric","date":"2017-09-08T05:19:30.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And they would instantly be banned for doing so, wasting almost no time whatsoever.

I freely admit there are instances where someone could react like that and not get charged. Battered spouse laws for example but those are the exceptions rather than the rule. \n\nNone of that has anything to do with league though. Your not being attacked.

Right from the get go chat is there, like it's somehow a useful feature for gameplay to happen. This normalises something that at best is an addon and at worst is completely redundant. It's not essential to teamplay, taking obectives, winning games etc. Just like all chat is opt in, chat in general should be an optional feature, that way it's not normalised and considered an ingrained aspect of the game.\n\nYou should learn to use pings effectively and even - if Riot were to listen to suggestions by myself and countless others over the years - have a basic communication system introduced allowing you to say things like _\"shove [top/mid/bot]\"_, _\"go [dragon/baron/inhib]\"_ etc. Communication that directly impacts the game on a tactical level should be the norm, along with learning mechanics, basic strategies and teamplay.
