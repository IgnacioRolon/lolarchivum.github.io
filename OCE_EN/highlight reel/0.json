This, for me, came at a cost of currently getting my main account perma banned which i played since season 1 on it. Its rough, but i have decided to quit due to  extreme levels of toxicity and i would like to formally apologize to ANYONE i mistreated throughout the 5 years of playing this game.\r\n\r\nJust a message out to the &quot;toxic players&quot; which i once was ; look at yourself, evaluate what you are, and what is the purpose behind calling someone &quot;autistic&quot; or wishing cancer upon someone.  Just because  Warwick missed smite at baron pit 25 mins into the game does not give you free regin on abusing him, maybe he has already gone through an extensive amount of abuse throughout the years, why does he need yours?\r\n\r\nAnd a quick message to the Players who are supportive and Anti-toxic the &quot;norms&quot; ; Keep doing you, you&#039;re strong enough to overcome the temptation of calling someone out, you&#039;re wise and intelligent, I believe people like you deserve greater rewards, and I wish you well for all your journeys ahead! :)  \r\n\r\nMuch love,\r\n\r\nHGdubz, Call Me &quot;Friend&quot; , Highlight Reel","replies":[{"poster":"CandyVanisClosed","date":"2015-11-27T21:51:58.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"So your account got perm banned hey..\nVery hard to believe tbh...\nThey let players run rampant,letting them do what they want...\nHow many times you been suspended?","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-11-27T22:28:09.299+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Highlight Reel","date":"2015-11-28T04:32:22.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont hate riot, I think their system is OK.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-28T08:56:17.824+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"He was responding to the other guy in a very toxic manner.

Just as there is a difference between 'bad language' and abuse. I couldn't give a crap about someone swearing their head off, but abusing someone because you're mad or too petty to admit your own faults is a whole other thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-12-04T07:10:24.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-12-04T07:14:56.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe what you want m8, doesn't matter to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Manyula","date":"2015-12-05T00:34:44.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"stay gold ^.> nah ur rite ur there cos u want to be there ^.^{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} ","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-11-30T20:30:14.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Danklight Vayne,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=ZIyWlXz0,comment-id=00010000000000000000,timestamp=2015-11-30T08:36:21.800+0000)\n>\n> & that's why you were gold this season my friend.
