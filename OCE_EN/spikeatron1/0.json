I only just found out that unless I play ziggs {{champion:115}}  on another map of which i dont like either of them i am never going to advance past a mastery level 5 ranking. So my question is why cant we also advance like anyone else is it something that is going to be changed or am i doomed to stay as a low level 5th for the rest of my days ?\r\n\r\nAnd here is a poll for my fellow players is there a champ that you have gotten really good with but have been let down in a similar way to me by these contradictory terms that have been placed on things like champ mastery or grading for games played at all ?","replies":[{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2018-06-05T21:17:41.289+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mastery level doesn't mean everything, i'd be more scared of a 430k mastery level 5 yasuo than i would be of a 60k mastery level 7 yasuo.\nIts not given out on aram because the matchups guarantee your win more often than your skill does, so it'd be silly giving out mastery tokens on an RNG map.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spikeatron1","date":"2018-06-05T22:05:35.605+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can understand that but you also get special interactions with your character for being that mastery level as well which is what i want but cant because of this","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spikeatron1","date":"2018-06-05T13:56:15.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please feel free to let me know how so in the comments or any thoughts you also have on this issue thanks again.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}
