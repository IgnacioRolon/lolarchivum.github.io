I dont know if that makes any sence but i hope it does XD Anyways hope Riot reads this and understands what i mean!

Neither of these two feel quite, but if their were changes to the current system, there should be a way to award positive players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-25T23:06:22.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If the skins were achievable then there would be no need to buy rp..","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-25T22:50:55.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/s4EeVVRE-project-zac I still like my idea better.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-03-26T01:35:12.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"Good idea, let's rip off SMITE some more, we already stole their champion mastery system, let's steal the skin system also.","replies":[{"poster":"PsychoticDemon","date":"2015-03-31T20:55:33.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rip off SMITE? man there are more games then just smite that do this.
