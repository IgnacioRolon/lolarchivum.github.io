If you&#039;ve got common sense and communication you make the cut lol. I main support, adc and I can mid fairly well. I will usually play champs: Janna, Leona, Sona, Lulu, Thresh, Caitlyn, Jinx, Lux, Ahri, Xerath.  If anyone&#039;s interested give me your summoner name and rank or just add Axivia. Cheers!","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2015-09-20T23:51:38.132+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi mate, I sent you a friend request, I too am in the same boat.
