By this i mean if im playing yasuo and i want to bait her stun out, i essentially cant because if you block annies q with stun proc it wont burn her stun.. therefore allowing her to just walk around and q again! Just wondering if this is a bug or should be changed in some way. Makes it incredible difficult to lane against her.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-27T12:57:07.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I hope this answers your question but when I play annie there is this trick with the stun where I q at my third stack and then hit e before it strikes to proc the stun, surprising the opponent.\n\nBasically, because q wasn't built to be able to miss it doesn't count as firing it if it doesn't hit","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-01-27T12:58:10.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like the stun stack only counted with my q when it hit","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-01-27T19:51:07.107+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's be honest.\n\nEveryone knows that trick.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-27T22:33:52.373+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the point is to highlight that the Qs stack of stun or using the stun doesnt come into effect till it lands, if it doesnt land, it doesnt consume the stun.\n\na perfect explanation for the question really.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
