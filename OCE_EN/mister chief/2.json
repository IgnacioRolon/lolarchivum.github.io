The enemy support was a Lux, and, as I hit her with a Q, she snared me. My Q hit her and pulled her half-way to me, but she stopped moving when her snare hit me. \n\nA similar thing occurs if I pull a Malzahar while infected with Space Aids\n\nI assume this is a bug, but am not sure if it is a bot-game-only bug, or if it can happen in any game.","replies":[]}
