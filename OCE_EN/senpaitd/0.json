Add them all together and multiply them by roughly 25 minutes, or 0.5 hours. Take this number and add it to the time on WoL, and you'll have a decent estimate!\n\n- And Twisted Treeline, if applicable","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-09-24T01:31:59.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have spent ~110 hours in League, just for ranked games. \n\nThere is a site called \"[wasted on LoL](https://wol.gg/stats/oce/senpaitd/)\" that tells you this kind of info.
