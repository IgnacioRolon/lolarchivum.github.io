When I play ranked, I play against gold or high silver players. Makes sense. But when I play normal games, I am usually matched up, both, with and against players around silver IV, silver V, Bronze I and Bronze II. I just want to know why.\r\n\r\nI  would also like to mention, sometimes when I play normal games, I will play with friends around the low silver and high bronze elo or friends who play mostly ARAM. Maybe that might have something to do with it. I don&#039;t know, but please let me know what you think or how you feel. XD\r\n\r\n~Peace~","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-11T02:04:42.891+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Isnt it a great opportunity to farm the hexchest?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-10T23:34:27.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked MMR and normal MMR are pretty different. \n\n>Players have a separate MMR for each queue, each of which evolves independently from the others.
