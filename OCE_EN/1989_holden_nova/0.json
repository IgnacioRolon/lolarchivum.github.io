So i&#039;m sitting over here in southern Australia were the internet for a lot of people isn&#039;t fantastic. i often find myself loosing connection when playing one if not my favorite video game League Of Legends. now one of the most frustrating parts about league is when it punish&#039;s you for dc&#039;ing even if it wasn&#039;t intentional. I&#039;m always getting Que timers purely because i lagged out and whilst yes i see why the timers are there i feel like its unfair on people who legit lag out and cant help it at all. i feel like riot need to do something about this asap, what i had in mind is in the client or whatever have a ping meter or something like that. and say if it hits over 500 then no timers will be given out or less timers or something. its something so simple that can improve alot of peoples day when they lag out. please riot look into this.{{summoner:4}}","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-07-29T11:59:37.069+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThe leaverbuster system is designed in such a way that it will forgive a dc every now and then, however repeated disconnects will result in punishment (Ranked is considered more serious and thus will take less disconnections(leaves) to hand out punishment)\n\nRemember, it is YOUR responsibility to ensure your connection is stable and that you have enough time to play a full game BEFORE you join a queue, play a bot game first, even a custom.","replies":[]}]}
