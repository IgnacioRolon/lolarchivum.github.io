Yesterday I played a game as {{champion:421}} and went 17/2/14 in top lane. I got an S- and was pretty proud of myself however I&#039;m currently Rank 6 with {{champion:421}} so I was a bit frustrated that I only got S- (because I need S or above). Today though, I went top lane again with {{champion:421}} and went 9/2/8 and got an S. If I went better in my previous game, how come I wasn&#039;t ranked as high as the game today? If anyone knows anything, some explanation would be great.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-24T07:30:49.850+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This article by Telecasterdude is pretty informative about Champion Mastery.

Furthermore, a series of performance metrics are used to compare a player's performance to others, on that same champion and role. Only performances in the top percentage of players, for each champion in a specific role, are awarded S class grades_. This doesn't seem to make sense though considering I went better in my previous game and received a lower rank compared to today's game. Is there something I'm missing?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-06-24T08:10:21.879+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So essentially, it takes the averages of the champion in that role. It seems that Rek'Sai players perform better in the jungle, so the score needed there to get a good grade needs to be higher. Fewer people play Rek'Sai top and don't perform as well, so the score needed there is lower. \n\nHope that answers your question!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-24T08:55:02.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hypothetically, if you played Zed/Fizz/Katarina etc as a support, would virtually any score get an S then? as almost no one would be playing Zed etc as a support?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-24T09:03:58.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's graded on a bell curve, so it wouldn't be virtually any score, but hypothetically any decent score would net you an S since they are rarely played/played well. \n\nI think you'll find Zed might be the exception to that though. It's embarrassing how badly I've had my lane destroyed by a Zed \"support\" because my ADC and I lack mobility. He's a very cheese support, if you're a good Zed and can get that successful jungle gank early against a low mobility lane it's near impossible to lose the lane.\n\nOf course I've seen the really bad Zed supports as well, but he's one of those \"supports\" that pretty much go one way or the other, they do really well or really really badly. Which unfortunately means the top percent scores are pretty high.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-24T09:34:34.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically in my books, you need an ability that can actually 'Support' before you qualify as a support. as far as I'm aware, All Zeds abilities help himself and no one else (admittedly he does have a minor slow, but find me a champ that doesn't.)\n\nit hardly seems fair though, Zed mains who are too shit to get an S mid lane end up polluting bot lane just to get an easy one","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-06-24T13:39:43.912+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I won't get into how much I hate champs like Zed and Yasuo :P that's a slippery slope. But I generally agree with your definition of what can be classified as support. \n\nI enjoy playing off supports, and I would even consider champions like Vel'Koz/Zyra 'real' supports (as in I'd play them in ranked) but it depends how you are building them. Obvs if you're building Rab's/Luden's first you aren't being a good support. Sightstone > Spookies > Rylai's would ususally be my direction with them.\n\nChamps like Liss/Sejuani/Anivia/Teemo can technically support they just aren't all that effective unless you're god tier with them :P\n\nChamps like Lee Sin/Xin Zhao/Zed/Yasuo/Kat etc do not in my mind count as supports by any stretch of the definition, even if most of them do have some form of hard cc.","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-06-24T23:50:53.988+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like zed.....{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}}","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-25T01:29:08.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Zed is cancer, go see a doctor!","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-06-26T00:31:19.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No he's not.

Im pretty sure an ADC's main counterplay for Zed was buying QSS, but guess what riot changed that item with the sole intent of buffing Zed.\n\nTheres a reason he has a 50%+ ban rate (which is more than all other champs except 1), and its not because 'riot ruined him'","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-24T22:58:37.526+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm with you about Zed and Yas (i used to be a has main until azir came out, and now even i cant stand the sight of him)\n\nI agree that off meta supports can be fun, often it is dependant on the ADC too, I've had a fair bit of success playing Anivia supp with Ashe ADC, because the permastun/permaslow is broken, but i wouldn't play it in ranked, and i doubt it would be as effective with any other ADC. \n\n\nBut yea, I've had my fair share of Katarina and Xin supports, not fun.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-06-24T23:50:13.656+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had to play Rengar \"support\" the other day because this guy didn't understand role-calling in normals (he thought if 2 people called a role, they both get it, in my case it was jungle).
