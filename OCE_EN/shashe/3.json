Similar to Nidalee&#039;s W (cougar form), when you press Q to dash, it goes toward the cursor instead of where you last clicked. It can feel a bit clunky sometimes using the current Q causing me to dash the wrong way sometimes. This is just my opinion, what does everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-04-30T08:40:07.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"simple, get it through ur head u rightclick then q lol","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-05-01T22:14:05.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I know, I just think it will be a bit smoother.","replies":[{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2016-05-03T07:24:38.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no it really wont, this abilite is strong the way it works now was actually a nerf a long time ago lol","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-05-04T05:41:59.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not saying you're wrong, it's just my opinion and preference.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2016-04-30T06:00:53.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you just need to git gud the skill is fine as it is","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-05-01T22:15:15.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe haha, I sometimes go the wrong way on the first dash, I'm probably pressing Q before I click or something.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"uLAW","date":"2016-04-30T10:40:58.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She will Q to cursor when it hovers over target.\n\nGg.\n\nRiP","replies":[]}]}
