I understand you have made the system match players so it can be fair, but a low population server like OCE is sure to get unfair 5 man premades vs 5 Solos or majority solo. This already happens to things like Normal Blind Pick and Twisted Treeline where 5 man premades are matched verse 2 duos and a solo player or a duo and 3 solo players. I have a feeling this is going to happen a lot, I'd rather wait in queue for an hour to get a fair balanced match making system even if that game lasts for 15 minutes than have short queues with a bad experience.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-01-16T03:43:44.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are doing a lot of testing on NA and TR right now.
