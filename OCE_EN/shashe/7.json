The way I would have it is with the [original rules](http://www.ultimate-bravery.com/rules.php) but also with some other features to remove cheating/unfair play such as:\r\n\r\n- Having a randomly assigned champion (just like ARAM)\r\n - Maybe a banning phase although it is random so it&#039;s not necessary\r\n- Having random summoner spells\r\n- Having a forced item set (like recommended items) with random items\r\n - Each item must be complete before the next item is available for purchase\r\n - No sell button\r\n - Keep the undo button in case a different build path is preferred for that specific item (no undo once the item is complete)\r\n- Being forced to max certain abilities in a specific order (like Azir&#039;s W at the beginning of a match but until it is leveled all the way)\r\n- Assigning random masteries if possible otherwise remove this rule \r\n\r\nIf anyone has anymore suggestions, please leave them in the comments below, thanks.\r\n- Shashe","replies":[{"poster":"Cardew","date":"2016-03-24T07:01:41.547+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would actually lead to very interesting and fun games.
