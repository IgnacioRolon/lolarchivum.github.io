Does anyone else like this idea? Feedback appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-29T09:20:45.086+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"they should make a special skin that you get for champion mastery, that you can only get with champion mastery","replies":[{"poster":"Rav","date":"2015-04-30T05:13:22.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Those \"skins\" will be chromas.
