So you will earn key fragments much faster in your earlier wins than you will in your later wins. Or said another way, each incremental key fragment drop is harder than the last (on average... there is variance). This resets on a monthly basis for each player individually. \nThe goal is to create a nice ebb and flow. \nGrade does NOT impact key drop chance. \n**Premades DO increase drop chance. **\nHope that helps clarify \"\n[(source)](http://www.surrenderat20.net/2016/03/red-post-collection-hextech-crafting-on.html#6)","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-04-13T04:10:57.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for clarifying everything Yaia.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThePlanBman","date":"2016-04-14T03:07:14.288+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As my friend Toomuchrage said, It is extremely rare when we get a key fragment.

If you ask me the non-linear key fragment drop system just adds to frustration and isn't really intuitive. \n\nSo on 4 champions a month we may earn a chest each from the pool of 130 champions. \n\nIt'll take several years to unlock a chest for each champion.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-13T09:18:57.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure its 1 per week and 4 per month...","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-13T14:10:27.999+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My bad then, but that only proves my point even more.\n\nI thought the chest slot was to regenerate a week from its use, not 1 per week ;~;\n\nEh, I'll correct it now","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2016-04-14T02:58:25.988+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Me and my duo have been playing for the last 20 games aswell and we have not gotten A SINGLE key fragement.

The drop rate for the fragments decreases slightly after each gain, similarly assuming the cap hasn't be reached and that you haven't been getting any key fragments it's said that the chances would rise in your favour instead. The drop rate reset roughly every month, it says that on Riot's official site \"roughly every thirty days after you earn your first key fragment\", I am not exactly sure how it all works out in detail since this is a bit vague and that whether or not forward creep is also present, but hey.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Argetal","date":"2016-05-12T22:20:32.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my oppinion it was nice from RIOT to say if you play good you have the chance of either getting a champ or a skin for free.
