So instead of delaying URF until they could fix it, **Riot** decided to just release URF without the custom game option this time. Check out the full explanation [here](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/VpQIYfVz-arurf-custom-games-disabled-due-to-bug?show=nested).\n\nI'm too sure about ARAM being disabled though.

It's most likely a bug as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Shashe","date":"2016-09-26T11:37:57.872+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response.","replies":[]}]}]}
