Dropping into my hand and making that beautiful metallic noise as it hits with the other gold pieces already residing in my palm. _That_, was a beautiful noise, the noise of profit, of being paid, of a job done! Oh how I longed to hear that noise now. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the more satisfactory noise of the slice my crossblade made as it worked it&#039;s way through the foes that would stand in my way, to see the bright glare of the Shurima sun shine on it&#039;s sharp and well cleaned edges. When it returns to my hand, to watch as each enemy drops as their lifeblood drains from their bodies and they are no more. But I wasn&#039;t hearing that sound right now, although the wish to hear it was growing. \r\n\r\nEven the noise of my own footsteps on the unexplored floors of tombs and caves would be better than what I was hearing right now, or the sound of Taliyah talking or laughing would possibly be tolerable. But no, now, all I could hear was silence. Silence, not even the sound of a creature nearby, no water, no people, no anything. Just.. Silence. \r\n\r\nI opened my blue eyes to look around me, desert, as far as the eye could see, but nothing else, no plants, creatures or water could be seen for a long way. I could see the rippling waves that the heat so often formed above the boiling sand, but I had been in this heat so often that it hardly bothered me now. Taking a deep breath inward, all I could taste was sand, and old air, there was no wind, it was as if time itself had stopped. It was unnerving and I didn&#039;t wish to stay here long, although I couldn&#039;t see anything, I knew where I was, and I would soon be out of the hot sun and on my way to retrieve my gold. \r\n\r\nAs I turned around, I knelt, brushing away the sand which I had just kicked onto my only escape from the sun, the door which I had found moments before. After uncovering it I traced it with my finger, it had strange markings on it, I knew what they were, it was the story of Nasus, Renekton and Xerath, one I knew all to well. I traced the carvings more, I knew these old tomb doors often had special unlocking mechanisms, and I had gotten pretty good at opening them. Sure enough my fingers found the odd feeling shape, and I pressed down, and felt it satisfactorily click into place. Strangely enough, it didn&#039;t make a noise as it opened, it was old, but was made so well that it made no noise. I felt a shiver go down my back as I waited, listening yet again to the inside of this tomb.. Nothing. \r\n\r\nSo down I went, travelling deep down into this unknown tomb, the only sound being made was my breath and my hands and feet on the ladder rungs. Finally reaching the bottom, after minutes of climbing down, I looked around, only seeing darkness. I had known that it would be dark, so I had already made a torch, and all I needed now was a flame to light it with. Taking my crossblade, as it was sharper than my knife, I hit it on the wall beside me, creating a spark and a loud ringing noise. I only needed that one spark to catch onto my torch and light up the area I was in, and as I reattached the crossblade to my back I looked around the tomb. \r\n\r\nIt was your average tomb, large, dark, full of dusty ornaments and occasional creepy looking statues or bones, I had found many old fashioned, ritualistic bowls filled with oil, which I could light to light up the room which I would be in. As I walked through the place, my footsteps and the crackling of my torch were the only things I could hear, but that wasn&#039;t for long, after a  quarter hour of  walking through, I heard the unmistakeable hiss of a snake. I quickly stopped, listening again, straining my ears to hear far into the distant parts of the tomb. Finally it came again, that hiss, I clenched my jaw as I started towards this hissing noise, placing my torch down on something that resembled a table, and getting the crossblade ready in my hand. Snakes always reminded me of Cassiopeia, the being who had quite literally taken my life from me. I didn&#039;t like remembering those moments, especially the part afterwards where Azir restored me, although I was grateful for having not died, the information given to me was a bit much and I did not want to think about it too much. I just wanted my gold and my life the way it was, after I had kiled Cassiopeia, though that had not happened any time afterwards. \r\n\r\nAs I made my way to the sound of this hissing, I found myself entering into a dimly lit room, in the middle lay the sarcophagus of a great general, the one who owned the artefact I had come to retrieve. Now all I had to do was make sure Cassiopeia wouldn&#039;t get her hands on it. I made my way towards the coffin, staying near the edges in the shadows, the room was dimly lit, not from fire or anything of that sort, but there was a small hole allowing light to come in from the sun, while walking towards here, I had noticed that the ground had been tilting upwards, but I hadn&#039;t realised just how close we must have been by now, time was easily lost in a place like this. \r\n\r\n_Hissss_. The sound took me out of my thoughts and back into what was happening, I looked around, trying to see any sign of Cassiopeia anywhere, but alas, to my comfort and dismay, the only thing my eyes caught sight of was a desert snake sitting on top of the sarcophagus. I chuckled to myself, I was getting too jumpy, and so easing off a little from the shadows I came into the open, and before the snake could realise, I chopped it&#039;s head clean off with my knife, and watched as it bounced off the sarcophagus and onto the ground. Smirking I pushed the body of it off the sarcophagus, and placed the knife back into it&#039;s spot, before finding the opening of the sarcophagus. \r\n\r\nAlthough I was not a fan of uncovering dead bodies, with the artefacts that I was asked to get, they were always kept in the sarcophagus of the person who owned them. Finally I found the right spot, and placing both my hands on the side and pushing my shoulders into the stone coffin, I pushed. The noise was dreadful, stone being pushed against stone made the sound of a nightmare go screeching through the tomb, and I knew that if anyone was in here like me, they would&#039;ve heard it. Luckily though I had gotten the top off, and although the sight to see wasn&#039;t good, noticing the artefact was untouched, was. \r\n\r\nI quickly grabbed the artefact, which happened to be a beautifully, yet amazingly heavy, carved shield, and began my way back. I knew for a fact that there would be other openings to this tomb, it was too big to not have more entrances, and so instead of going back the way I came, I decided to find a different exit, by going the opposite direction. I had to hold the shield on my arm the whole time as it was too heavy to be strapped to my back the whole time, I didn&#039;t mind so much about the weight, but I already had my crossblade attached to my back and had gotten used to the weight better. \r\n\r\nAs I travelled through this tomb, I always expected someone to come out of the dark, be it Cassiopeia, or even a creature like Xer&#039;Sai, or Kmiros. But nothing happened, just silence the whole way through, to be honest by the time I reached the exit I was dying to have something turn up, something I could fight. But nothing, just silence, and emptiness. \r\n\r\nAs I exited the tomb, feeling the sun on my face and the desert smell reaching my nose, I could hear again. The wind whistled past my air carrying sand with it, the sound of an Eka&#039;Sul herd travelling through, even the tomb door seemed to slam as I closed it. I found it strange, of all the things that happened, the silence had unnerved me the most. Shaking off that thought I quickly turned my way towards where I was to go, to give the shield to my benefactor, and to retrieve my gold. Soon I would forget the sound of silence as the world I lived in was a world of a mercenary.\r\n\r\n_Sivir_","replies":[{"poster":"Malygos","date":"2016-07-01T12:15:38.952+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy shit, this is so deep.\n\nI really like how you cast Sivir as a drug addicted miscreant. Describing the desert and the sand as her drug addiction was brilliant.\n\nShe entered the tomb, her only safety from the horrible drug filled cycle her life had become. She sought safety; a shield! Absolutely genius. She was looking for escapism and she found it... but disaster! She went back out into the DESERT (her drugs) and GAVE AWAY THE SHIELD TO HER BENEFACTOR: HER DRUG DEALER!!!\n\nYou can see her worry as she envisioned her closest friend (Cassiopeia) as her enemy, this anxiety brought about by her drug fuelled existence. \n\nI was nearly in tears at the end, the part about the silence; how nobody came to help her. She even imagined Cassiopeia there with her, it was heartbreaking. She was seeking help from one who did not have the strength to see Sivir through her addiction.\n\nGold was just a gateway drug to the sand. \n\nThis is my favourite entry thus far, bravo.","replies":[{"poster":"WhovianLove","date":"2016-07-01T14:13:58.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks so much!

Gradually it became more and more clear that it was actually Sivir, and the reveal was surprising. But it's all very nicely done and believable. There wasn't ever a moment of 'wait, what?'
