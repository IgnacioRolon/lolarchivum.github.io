good base damage poke from a safe range early (will fall off heavily late game if you do not build at least one decent damage item)\nW - good AOE displacement/escape that can even send you over walls if your flash is down or push the enemy back under the tower after a poorly executed dive\nE - good AOE slow to help you and your ADC chase down your target even on pesky Yordle legs\nR - good long range kill *secure* that can regularly pinch dragons and barons if you have excellent timing\nHe has many downsides as well, principally that unless you do your runes masteries and build carefully you will be squishy as heck for the whole game.\nI tend to get around this by going full AP runes and 8/22/0 masteries and I upgrade to my ruby sightstone pretty early and I like to get seekers when the enemy ADC power spikes but continue building my other items before finishing zhonyas due to lack of support gold.\n\nSejuani is an excellent support for Kalista;\nsynergies with the Kalista ult into sej Q into sej ult into Kalista execute with E.\nneed to be sure to build tanky and take magic pen runes.\ngreat chasing potential if you get ahead and excellent lockup abilities if you fall behind and get dove.\nunfortunately she doesn't really synergise well with any other ADC in my experience except maybe ashe or varus with good coordination.\n\nZyra is far and away my favourite non-meta support;\nshe is unfortunately VERY vulnerable in certain matchups, but outside this she can output lots of damage from a safe distance over and over again. all the while sticking seeds in the brush to stop that annoying enemy support from sitting next to your ADC's CS.\nAs the game goes longer Zyra scales very well build damage if your ahead like void rabadons morellos or hybrid items if your not like zhonyas abyssal rylais liandris.\nFor the love of life don't get caught deep warding by yourself... always ask someone to come with you otherwise you will die over and over and over again, but other than that she is great.\n\nElise is rubbish in the jungle in the recent patches, but if played very carefully in the early game she has good utility to offer as a support;\nQ - execute and gap closer in spider form\nW - Sustain in spider form and free brush check and zone control in human form\nE - gap closer and free dodge in spider form with great re-engage if you dodge something big and a long range stun in human form\ndon't know about builds but in the jungle I prefer 1 damage item then all tank, suppose the same should apply.\n\nNunu was originally intended as a support and if you play your cards right it can work ok in certain matchups.\nQ - consume with your relic shield\nW - blood boil your adc whenever your passive is up\nE - snowball for chasing obviously\nR - if then enemy is disengaging and your jungler is coming in this is great to slow them down and in team fights later.\n\nShen\nTaunt\nfree tp\nnot much else but considering how bad he is at the moment on his own, always being with an ally who can actually deal damage shen can actually setup some good kills. would require a lot of practise if your not familiar with him though.\n\nTwisted Fate can pretty much play anywhere.\nstun cards for days, mana sustain and long range poke that pinches CS (yay).\n\nOriana might not be a killer support and her damage can be item reliant vs tanks but it doesn't take much time to learn to appreciate the good trades with her shield and the slows and zoning from he ball. the right ultimate can still be game changing.\n\nVeigar\nstuns\nenough said\nthough you want to play super safe when its on cooldown.\n\nXerath\nlong range poke\nlong range AOE slow\nlong range stun that's getting buffed\nlong range kill *secure*\nwhat's not to like?\ndon't ward alone, you will die a lot.\n\nLissandra\ngo tank, listen to the cries after your engage lolz.\n\nnasus with spell thief dagger maxing W and going full tank can be a fun troll support if you get early kills in your lane. but don't play it in ranked and don't expect to get stacks unless your carry roams... its troll for a reason.\n\ncheers,\nmugsy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-14T02:59:57.671+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support: {{champion:22}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:61}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:54}} \nJungle: {{champion:236}}  (especially with {{item:3710}} {{item:3508}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3153}} {{item:3143}}) and also {{champion:63}} , but I don't know if he works in the new jungle.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-15T02:18:26.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play Karma jungle with 18/9/3 masteries.\nIts legit.\nDon't question me.\nI did better than that super bad Udyr.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Urfquakex","date":"2014-12-14T06:31:35.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't see a few champions very often in the support role. Like, Taric, Zyra, Teemo, Nunu, Nami (she's more popular than some others though), Lulu (same as Nami, I suppose), Kayle (I've never played her, but I've seen her bot lane, and her heal and ult would be cool), Nautilus (I think is a support?) and Fiddlesticks. Fiddlesticks makes me hate life when I'm versing him due to the silence :( \n\nEDIT: I have very little knowledge on junglers, but I think you could play any jungler except Warwick (who has gained popularity, but I think he was or is being nerfed?), Vi, Pantheon (due to that level 2 dragon, which will probably be nerfed too), Lee Sin, Master Yi, and Kha'Zix and you'd be fine. Maybe you should try Nautilus, Amumu, Wukong, Mundo, Hecarim, J4, Jax, Malphite, Rammus, Tryndamere(?), Zac, and Volibear. \n\nI have seen Lux jungle though, so I suppose you could play anybody you wanted.
