I've waited 3 days for my RP, I've tried to stay patient but now it's starting to annoy me. Your only responses are \"contact support\", they tell me to wait. Which I have. For three days. You said you rolled the update back and refunded people who's codes didn't work, yet me (and many others on the forums) clearly haven't received their RP. It's not the wait that annoys me so much, it's the fact that I'm scared I won't get my RP at all.\n\nOn a side note; is there anyone who has actually received their RP at all? Because I see plenty who are still waiting, but none who've said they got their's refunded.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-23T08:54:20.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYou should've received the RP owed, however there have been a few exceptions.
