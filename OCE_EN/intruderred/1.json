Bought Veigar, a champ I&#039;d never played before, excited to play him, first time was terrible, however, second game with him was fantastic, I did the best on the team and in the game. I was excited, thinking that this for sure would get me my first S rank under the new Hextech Crafting system, excited for a box and key, I awaited the &#039;S&#039; to pop up on the post game chat. Nope. People who did worse than me got an &#039;S&#039;. I didn&#039;t. Of course they contributed to the team, and did fantastic! I was just surprised that I too, did a fantastic job, but yet got an &#039;A&#039;. Before the Hextech Crafting system, I wouldn&#039;t really care about my post game grade, however, now that we are rewarded for doing good, I think the someone at Riot should take a look at the system/how it works. Like seriously, just look at the picture, how was my score not deserving of an &#039;S&#039;? I&#039;m not 100% sure on how the system works. Was it because it was only my second time playing Veigar? Do you need a consistent match history with a champion to be applicable for a &#039;S&#039; rank? Anyway, rant over, and thank you. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-28T12:33:09.092+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There was a pretty decent discussion [OVER IN THIS THREAD](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/6WbpJ9nE-why?comment=0000) which hopefully answers any questions you have about the rankings.","replies":[{"poster":"IntruderRed","date":"2016-03-28T12:45:51.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-03-28T12:26:32.456+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Long story short, the grade is not based on KDA alone. It is calculated from a variety of factors, such as CS, warding, objectives, damage etc. also. You are graded against other players on the same champion in the same role only (a Support Lulu won't have to get as much CS as a Mid Lulu, for example).\n\nYou'll just have to improve your performance overall to get better scores. As for receiving Hextech chests, if anyone in your premade receives an S you'll all be granted the chest for your champion (if you haven't already received one). If you want a chest for a particular champion but can't get a high enough grade, I'd suggest grouping with some other players.","replies":[{"poster":"IntruderRed","date":"2016-03-28T12:46:14.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. :)","replies":[]}]}]}
