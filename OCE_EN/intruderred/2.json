Please take a look! :)","subforum":"Clubs","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} {{champion:85}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:238}} \r\n\r\nAre you a fan of the ninjas of Runeterra? I am. As an Akali main, I saw a perfect opportunity with the recent addition of clubs to LoL. I made a club based off of the lore of League of Legends, specifically, Shen and Zed&#039;s lore, and the Kinkou Clan. I am certainly not amazing at League, but that&#039;s fine! Because this isn&#039;t meant to be a competitive club, this club is meant to be a lore friendly, social environment where you can meet new people with similar tastes. Once again, this\r\nclub is just for fun, and not competitive. Not a Shen, Akali, Kennen or Zed main? That&#039;s cool! Come chill and hang out anyway, this club is intended for fans of the lore and the ninjas, but anyone is allowed! :) So come join, have some fun, and shhh, you&#039;re a ninja. :)\r\n\r\nAdd IntruderRed and message me, asking about the clan for an invite. :)","replies":[{"poster":"minelaayer","date":"2016-04-20T01:38:44.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_**{{champion:17}} **_","replies":[]}]}
