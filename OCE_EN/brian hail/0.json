I do not however have this issue with Malzahar's Nether Grasp (R) where I have found it stops the Ultimate entirely.  Is this Normal?  Or is it a bug that has developed?","replies":[{"poster":"Brian Hail","date":"2015-01-11T00:10:47.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the responses guys.  I thought it was odd since Malzahar's Ultimate was similar that it didn't act in the same way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-08T22:55:03.693+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah his ult isn't a continuous damage its just burst over time (i.e. a teemo shroom) unlike malzahar which is damage on hit i think it says something like that on ww's ultimate description","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-08T20:53:18.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ww's ult applies on hit as part of the ability, the suppression is there on top to make it look good. You can QSS the suppression but his ability will still do its damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-01-08T15:13:11.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't answer specifically if it's a bug or not, but it's been a thing for a long while, it occurs more because Warwick has to be on top of you, but only something that stops him stops the damage cause of other forms of moving whomever is ulted (like a thresh flay)","replies":[]}]}
