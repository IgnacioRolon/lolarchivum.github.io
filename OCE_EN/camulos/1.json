It was a magnificent sight, white petals flowing in the glow of dusk as the Prince and his vanguard marched to the citadel under blue and gold banners... it was a glorious triumphant return. I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t stay, why I let curiosity better me... but you need to know, people need to know that they&#039;re out there, that they&#039;re real.\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw someone pushing back through the crowd from the front. It was a nobleman, not from a family close to the king (not how HE was dressed) but nowhere near as low as house Laurent. I think is name was Cyrus? Gah, I can&#039;t remember. Regardless, the man was sweating, and as white as a sheet. His wife was just looking at him, with a confused expression, but didn&#039;t seem to be overly concerned. At first I thought the man was ill, but then... \nThen I saw a shadow. Just for a second, a shadow sliding around the corner where the nobleman had gone. \nA trick of the light, I thought. It was sunset, there were petals and banners everywhere, I&#039;m just seeing things. That nobleman though, he looked pretty well done in, I couldn&#039;t shake the feeling that something was off. I followed him, I mean, it couldn&#039;t hurt to make sure he was just ill. I thought maybe I&#039;d get a bit of gold for my concern... such a bloody fool.\n{{champion:59}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:5}} {{champion:114}} \n\nHe broke into a run when he was a street from the parade, but not all nobles are warriors. It wasn&#039;t difficult to keep up. The sun was setting as he came to what I could only assume was his manor, it was a small place, well, compared to some I&#039;d seen; just off the edge of Tailor Road. Probably made his money in fabrics... Anyway, he lost his breath as he got to the door, I could hear several locks clicking hurriedly after he slammed it, he got there before I could get a word in. He obviously wanted the house to himself, I thought I could just walk away. \nThat was when I saw it.\nIn the window on the second floor, it looked like a woman, but she was gone before I could get a good look. Was that old noble having an affair? I thought the wife might like to know, again there might be something in it for me if I was right. My stupid curiosity was peaked, and I managed to get over the fence into the manor&#039;s garden. \n\nAs soon as I came by the window I heard hurried voices, I crept under the windowsill.\n&quot;... -y&#039;d you run away like that? It takes a lot of effort to move like this in heels...&quot; It was a woman&#039;s voice, it was raspy, but she spoke in a sultry tone. Was I right? Was this &#039;nobleman&#039; unfaithful? I peeked up into the window, I had to make sure...\nYou&#039;ve all heard stories I&#039;d imagine, the assassin from the Shadow Isles, I thought they were just stories too. \nUntil I saw the Widowmaker scraping her claws slowly across the nobleman&#039;s chest.\n&quot;P-please... d-d-don&#039;t...&quot; \n&quot;Shhhhhh, no whimpering, that&#039;s so dull.&quot; She flicked a violet talon upwards, he yelled out in pain and tried to cover the ear she&#039;d just split in half.\n&quot;WHY?! WHAT HAVE I DONE?!&quot; He screamed, blood and tears streaming down his face.\n&quot;Mmmmmm, well since you screamed so nicely I&#039;ll tell you.&quot; The azure-skinned assassin purred, &quot;Firstly, your poor little wife was so unhappy with the way you were looking at your lovely customer Lady Lumen...&quot; She licked a droplet of blood off her claw, making a show of it as the nobleman sat shocked in the knowledge that his wife had ordered him dead. &quot;I like showing bad boys like you what they&rsquo;ve earned...&quot; She leaned in over his intact ear and softly said, &quot;I like it when they scream.&quot;\n{{champion:28}} \n\nI looked away as she raised her claws for a full swipe, trying not to listen to the nobleman&#039;s screams of terror... \nThen someone laughed.\n&quot;Hu huhuhuhuhuhuhehehehahahahaha!&quot;\nIt was high-pitched, hoarse in texture, and sent shivers down my spine. \n&quot;Oh drat, looks like the party started without me, I hope I have a spare present for our extra guest! Hehehehehe!&quot;\nI didn&#039;t think someone could have that much bad luck, or be hated so much... There was no mistaking it, the Demon Jester was here as well.\n{{champion:35}} \n\n&quot;*tsk* You should know better than to interrupt a woman&#039;s fun, Shaco.&quot; She ran an indigo claw across the noble&#039;s cheek, &quot;Stay right there honey. ~&quot; She turned to face the inhuman grinning mask, from her reflection in a glass cabinet, her expression was that of sheer annoyance.\n&quot;Huhuhu, oh come now Evelynn, don&#039;t be so selfish! I have contracts to fulfill too! Not only has this guy been sleeping on the job (if you know what I mean), he&rsquo;s been cheating on his partners too! Hahahahaha!&quot; He pulled out a brightly wrapped box (I still have no idea where he was hiding that), &ldquo;Here, a token of my appreciation for letting me get a stab or two in, hehehehe!&rdquo;\n&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s kind of your thing, but do you ALWAYS have to clown around this much while you wo-&ldquo; Spikes of shadow erupted from the ground, piercing the hands and feet of the nobleman&hellip; the poor bastard was trying to get our while they were talking. &ldquo;*tsk tsk tsk* Don&rsquo;t make Mamma angry honey, I told you to stay there.&rdquo; I froze as her sensual tone was replaced by malice on her last two words&hellip; Why do monsters like this exist?\nThe Jester cackled all the more, &ldquo;Hahahahaha, as prickly as ever I see Evie.&rdquo; \n&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me Evie, ugh, must you try to kill my target AND my mood?&rdquo;\n&ldquo;Bahahahaha! Well, we both know how much I love doubles, Evie. \nA flash of silver streaked across the room and the nobleman screamed again, an elaborate but jagged shiv protruding from his thigh. The Widowmaker hissed at the sight and bolted for the deadly fool, the shadows launching her forward with blinding speed. Just as she reached her target, the Jester disappeared in a puff of orange smoke, dropping the present he&rsquo;d been holding. Evelynn kicked it away as the box flung open, I couldn&rsquo;t see what came out and frankly I don&rsquo;t want to know. I couldn&rsquo;t pull away as I saw the blue beauty scanning the room, her bright red eyes and the mark on her forehead burning with fury.\nOut of thin air the Jester appeared behind her, but before his shiv could reach the Widowmaker&rsquo;s throat, the entire floor of the room exploded into spikes of shadow and blood. The Jester hung from the spikes like a puppet with his strings cut&hellip; and then he started laughing, as he cackled he inflated like a grotesque balloon. Evelynn jumped out the door and I ducked under the window as a flurry of knives burst out, shattering the window. Sense finally came back to me and I ran, I ran and I never looked back. I hear that they found the man&rsquo;s body that night, cut up beyond recognition, nothing more than a bloody mess on the foyer floor&hellip; \n\nI&rsquo;ve had to keep a look out constantly since that day, I&rsquo;m always afraid that one of them saw me, that they&rsquo;ll kill me to keep me quiet. I want my blissful ignorance back&hellip; But they are out there, you need to know. So whatever you do, if you even suspect that they might be coming for you, don&rsquo;t run. Don&rsquo;t get curious and follow that shadow, or open that box, or try lose them in the streets. Keep the guards and your loved ones close. If you&rsquo;re lucky they&rsquo;ll stay away, if not&hellip; Well, at least you won&rsquo;t die alone like that noble&hellip;\n\n_This is about 1,300 words, and I wrote it in the space of about 4 hours. I hope it's not too troubling to read, and that I don't offend any Shaco or Evelynn mains!_","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T09:58:47.953+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As an Evelynn main, I approve of this portrayal <3 \nThough I would've liked more on this 'contract' business Shaco mentioned.
