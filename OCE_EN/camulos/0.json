My username and password are authenticated, but it cannot get past the &quot;Logging On&quot; stage, where I simply get the error mentioned in the title.\nI have tried:\n-Restarting my computer\n-Flushing my dns cache\n-Clearing the blacklist on my firewall\n-Literally everything on the recommendations from Riot\n-Uninstalling and re-installing LoL\n\nNone of these have worked, and I am completely out of ideas. Please comment if you think of something.\n\nEDIT: Turns out someone else had a similar issue 4 months ago and [Agent Mindstar](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/player/OCE/Agent%20Mindstar) responded but no fix was included in the conversation [found here](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/nRjKLbjz-cant-login-to-league-of-legends)","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-11-13T22:51:56.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nIt does sound like a similar issue, although the post where I included some [more troubleshooting steps](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/6nsIb1HL-cant-login-with-home-internet?comment=0001) was in a different thread by the same poster.\n\nGiven your description of the problem, it does sound quite similar, and I'd definitely look for signs of issues with failed connections or packet loss between you and the OCE platform.  I'd be especially interested to see if you have any success connecting to the chat server via telnet (per below instructions).\n\nWhen you're looking into the issue, have a look at the key areas highlighted below and how you can rule them out as a potential source of the issue.\n\nI'll paste my response from the other thread here so it is easy to reference:\n\n> Just explaining my thought process here, this is how I'm thinking about where the problem could be.\n> \n> Potential sources for the issue:\n> 1) Your Computer.  Unlikely, since your computer works if you switch to using your phone.\n> 2) Home Network.  Possible -> switching to your phone bypasses this.\n> 3) Local ISP Issues.  Possible -> switching to your phone bypasses this.\n> 4) Backbone ISP issues.  Possible -> likely as we are not seeing widespread problems from Telstra.\n> 5) LoL Server issues.  Possible, but again less likely as connecting to the server works from your phone.\n> \n> It seems like you have tried most of [the obvious stuff](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) - and providing traceroutes is a great first step.  The traces you have so far are to our OCE game servers though, so login problems will be hitting a different set of servers.  Try running a trace to the following urls:\n> \n> * lq.oc1.lol.riotgames.com\n> * chat.oc1.lol.riotgames.com\n> \n> Once you have done that, you can also try using telnet to connect directly to those services, and make sure that you are able to hit them at all.  (Instructions for enabling telnet in windows [here](http://www.itworld.com/software/227783/enable-telnet-windows-8))\n> \n> In a command prompt: \n> telnet chat.oc1.lol.riotgames.com 5223\n> (post if you get a \"connect failed\" or \"connection timed out\" error)\n> \n> telnet lq.oc1.lol.riotgames.com 443\n> (post if you get a \"connect failed\" or \"connection timed out\" error)\n> \n> You won't see any meaningful output from these commands, but what you need to look for is to make sure they do not fail with a timeout or other issue.\n\nA couple more questions specifically for you:\n\n* Have you tried logging in from that computer with a different connection (eg. phone tether)?  This would be a key way to make sure it is not a local pc issue but something outside of your computer.\n* Does the problem happen all the time or at specific times of day?\n\n\n_Note: my follow up might be delayed a bit as I'm currently travelling_","replies":[]}]}
