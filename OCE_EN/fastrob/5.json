The longer a bloodstained champ is near Stryd the more Bloodstain he builds. Stryd can also see these enemies anywhere on the map. Bloodstain does not have any other negative effect and will also wear off in after 5 seconds; 5 bloodstain stacks. This passive cannot stack on the enemy. \n\nQ- Launching assault:\nStryd will launch himself in straight line off either a wall or from a grassy area, with different effects from each. Stryd stops once he hits the first enemy or reaches the end of Launching assault’s range. Has a 9/8/7/6/5 second Cooldown.\nWall: Stryd gets a speed boost and when he hits an enemy target will deal attack damage and build up Bloodstain.\nGrass: Stryd is made invisible for a short duration of time and when he hits an enemy target will deal magic damage and slow them \n\nW- Quick Thinking\nStryd will throw his sword a short distance away (think olaf’s q) and deal attack damage to all enemies that it comes into contact with. Stryd can then press W again to launch himself to his sword dealing magic damage.  Has an 8/7/6/5/4 second Cooldown.\n\nE- Recklessness \nActivate: Will decrease Stryd’s attack by a small amount to increase the amount of Bloodstain produced\n\nR- Bloodlust:\nStryd will drain all of his Bloodstain stacks and launch forward causing all enemy units to be knocked back in a V shape causing them to be slowed. The more Bloodstain Stryd used the larger the V formation, knockback and damage will become. 120/100/60 second Cooldown. \n\n\nLore: From the time Stryd could look after himself he has been on a battlefield. Left to fend for himself, Stryd learned many things and become something else. If there was no ready food available to him, he would go and kill someone to eat. He never touched a body that was not his own kill. Living this lifestyle quickly turned he mad. He wondered from battlefield to battlefield fighting, killing and eating whom ever he pleased. After the institute of League caught wind of a monstrous man seeking blood, they quickly subdued and bribed him. ‘There are far better opponents here and much more of a variety of food’. \n\n\nPoints: you can add stats to him if you want and by all means if you like an ability but you want to tweak it be my guest, I just want to put my work up here. Stryd also means battle.","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2015-03-20T05:26:44.213+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"... bloodlust is already an attack {{champion:23}} Q.{{champion:432}} is fat","replies":[]},{"poster":"NeoSimmer","date":"2015-03-07T02:59:50.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Stats\nHealth 750/10\nRage 200\nHealth Regen 1.5\nRage Regen 0\nAttack range 450\nAttack Speed 0.8\nArmour 35\nMagic resist 35\n\nQ Should cost 70/60/50/40/30 rage  and have a 7/6/5/4/3 second Cooldown\nW should cost 100/75/50/45/30 rage And have a 8/7/6/5/4 second Cooldown \nE should cost 35/30/25/20/15 rage  and have a 1 second cd\nR should cost 150/125/100 Rage 120/100/60 second Cooldown \nBoom PLS implement theese into it ty","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tekken Lord","date":"2015-03-31T08:51:24.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Strygwyr the Bloodseeker","replies":[]}]}
