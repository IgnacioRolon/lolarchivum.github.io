If Galvous applies another auto attack or ‘w’ range he will root the enemy in place. \n\nE- Hopeful Light\nPassive: The more streaming light Galvous has the higher the speed and mana/health regain is.\nActive: Galvous creates a stream of light for allied champs to follow, after the light has been run over by allied champs it will boost their speed, mana and health regain. The light is then returned to Galvous streaming light stack. \n\nR-Bright dark\nGlavous takes all light from with a certain area around him (takes away vision eg noc ult) and creates a ‘ball of hope’. This can be seen within the darkened area. If Bright dark is used on an allied champ it will boost their speed and damage. If used on an enemy champ it will slow and do aoe damage. \n\n\nBackground: Thrown out by the Noxus empire for being too weak Galvous searched for a place to fit in. However no other kingdom would allow the entrance of a Noxian man. He was thrown back into the wilderness every time and was warned never to show his face again. Each time Galvous was denied a little part of his sanity faded. Tired and filthy he laid down to die. But death would not come to him, a young grey faced women had taken him to a nearby cave and had brought him back from the brink of death. She saw that he was conscious and left simply saying these words: ‘Do not give up yet human, the gods you praise have not abandoned you yet, look in the back of this cave and you shall receive hope’. And before Glavous could stumble after her, she was gone. In the back of the cave there were ancient texts and images decorating the walls. They surrounded a long box which had long since been opened. There he found the ancient weapon and when he took hold of it, light burst from the tip of it. He realized this was the hope that he was meant to find, with this he trained day and night. After he had perfected using the weapon he again wondered the world but instead this time to help others in need.","replies":[{"poster":"fastrob","date":"2015-03-06T05:51:44.644+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes sorry, thanks for the feedback guys :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-06T00:46:00.868+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"10/10, is unique, can see him fitting into the game as a character, his abilities are well tuned, im pretty sure you meant binding instead of bonding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Envidia","date":"2015-03-10T12:20:24.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really cool idea\nNice lore too","replies":[]},{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-03-04T05:26:50.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice champ design, needs cooldowns, damages and mana cost, I think his w should be expensive, and long cooldowned  Also need stats etc, check my champ post to see the full needs of a champ design,","replies":[]}]}
