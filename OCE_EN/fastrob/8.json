(eg bubbles+vicious grip, bubble act+bubbles, Movement of the strong+Bubbles)\r\n\r\nq: Bubbles              \r\n Cost:              Cooldown:\r\nSquank can place bubbles around himself that deal a small amount of damage when hit(). They can be destroyed by enemy champs. \r\n\r\nw:Vicious grip           \r\n     Cost:              Cooldown:\r\nSquank grabs hold of an enemy with his mouth dealing(). He can now drag them around for(), however they can still use abilities. \r\n\r\ne: Bubble act             \r\n   Cost:              Cooldown: \r\nSquank dissolves himself and leaves a small group of bubbles() where he was. He then pops up in a nearby location. His next attack takes an enemy by surprise and knocks them back.\r\n\r\nr:Movement of the strong            \r\n    Cost:              Cooldown: \r\nSquank hits the ground, dealing() and ordering all bubbles that are up to surround him. He also gains a move speed(). \r\n\r\nBackstory: Most squonks will run and flee in terror at the slightest hint of any other creature near it. Most. Squank is a completely different breed from them. He is vicious, deadly, and uses his unique abilities to kill instead of run. Hunters have been trying to capture a squonk for hundreds of years, but with Squank around they have become the hunted. The league was sent to get rid of this beast but saw far too much potential in such a tiny beast. So they took him back to become part of the league of legends. \r\n\r\nDescription- \r\nface: four different colored eyes that vary in sizes. Takes up most of the facial region. A mouth that you almost can&#039;t see, hiding under the head.\r\nskin: a greyish-red, like meat that was long dead. \r\nbody:....a smooth version of a squonk (it&#039;s an actual thing)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, no I don&#039;t want stats, cooldown, damage or cost. I am simply supplying the imaginative part of a champ. I have no desire to calculate what would be suitable in order for a champ to be balanced. Thank you for your kind thought though.","replies":[{"poster":"ApeX SlowZ","date":"2016-02-04T06:26:59.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think his w would very hard to encorporate into the game graphic wise and the interactions with the other champs abilities but the rest seem like a very good idea and I would love to see a champion like this in the game","replies":[]},{"poster":"lordofrage","date":"2016-02-05T03:57:42.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is this the lulu rework","replies":[]}]}
