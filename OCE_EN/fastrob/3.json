If it hits a minion or monster they are slowed and damaged. If it hits a champ they take() damage over time and the tendrils spread out, making 3 routes. The enemy champ hit must run along one route to escape. While running along the route the champ is slowed. Any champ hit by the tendrils after they spread from the first champ must also follow a route, however they take(()less) of the damage. The closer the original enemy champ is hit the longer the tendrils will be but the slow is reduced. \r\n\r\nw:Hurt Shield                  Cd:   Cost:\r\n Genace Gives up half it&#039;s current Health points and gains a shield of the same amount. Both armour and magic resist are increased by () so long as the shield is up.\r\n\r\ne:Original jump                 Cd:   Cost:\r\nWhen an ability is activated against Genace,it jumps to where it was cast from. \r\n\r\n\r\nr:Transferrable pain                 Cd:   Cost:\r\nGenace connects itself and another champ. If an ally, Genace will gain hp for ()% of the damage dealt by that champ. If an enemy Genace will inflict ()% damage dealt to him to that champ. It will also inflict ()% damage for the amount damage dealt by that champ.  \r\n\r\nBackstory: Genace was never meant to exist. It was the result of two research projects that both came to an immediate end. Two scientists were working on separate projects in close proximity of each other. Both seemed to have made a mistake at the same time, spilling a mix of genetic material and spacial matter. What remained of the explosion was Genace.  \r\n\r\nDescription: A giant ball with tendrils coming from it (you could imagine a giant eye, a lightning ball, snow globe, whatever you want is good). Not really like vel&#039;koz, more like a floating orb with lots of little tendrils coming off it.\r\n\r\n(Look even I don&#039;t think the Backstory or description are very LOL like but i think the abilities are unique and could fit)(Thanks for reading, no I don&#039;t want stats, cooldown, damage or cost. I am simply supplying the imaginative part of a champ. I have no desire to calculate what would be suitable in order for a champ to be balanced. Thank you for your kind thought though.)","replies":[]}
