When the minion or monsters dies it releases the voids energy in a small area and deals a small amount of damage. \r\n\r\nq- Weakened Spawn      Cost:45/55/65/75/85\r\nTra&#039;Kez spawns an egg in a designated area. After a few seconds where the egg is most vulnerable it will then hatch into an immobile tentacled creature and proceed to attack up to three enemies at anyone time.(Melee range)\r\n\r\nw- Void Casing     Cost:55/60/65/70/75\r\nTra&#039;Kez enchants the attack of a champion, including himself as a target, increasing the basic attack by 10(+ 5 for each w level, max 30) and deals 5%(+ 2.5%for each w level, max 15%) to surrounding enemies for 4 seconds\r\n\r\ne- Space Swap     Cost:80\r\nTra&#039;Kez manipulates the area around him switching places with another champ (range 350)\r\n\r\nr- Infectious Essence     Cost:50/65/80  \r\nTra&#039;Kez can store up to 3 Infectious Essence. At any time he can open a gate letting only letting the voids essence escape dealing 20/50/80(+20%) per second for 5 seconds. If an enemy obtains 3 stacks of Infectious Essence they are driven to fear for 1.5/2/2.5 seconds. Enemies can obtain 1 stack by being within the affected area for 1 second.  (size of Infectious Essence, think Morgana&#039;s &#039;tormented soil&#039; size)\r\n\r\nBackstory- I believe I am an odd one even among the Voidborn. I crossed the threshold into Runeterra so as to entertain myself with this world. It was blinding at first but it would serve as my playground for many years to come. The first group of playmates I encountered was a small village. I simply opened the threshold and left to watch from afar. While it didn&#039;t last as long as I&#039;d hoped, it was pure ecstasy to see them eaten or driven insane. After that I was driven all over for many years, opening tears in space and leaving them open to see how this world would react to them. It was an unsustainable hunger for entertainment. Only after years of playing with the children of this world was I invited to join this spectacular tournament; the League of Legends.\r\n\r\ni had fun making this and i hope you had fun reading it. If you find something inspirational by all means use it.","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T16:30:19.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it'll get walked all over","replies":[]},{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-12-11T03:07:05.873+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imma just say straight up he doesn't look fun to play.\n\n_Passive_\nThat's horrendously useless sorry. \"A small amount of damage\"/\"Randomly chooses a minion or monster\"/\"When it dies\" all generally contribute to this being near useless in laning phase, maybe only to occasionally zone a melee champion. In teamfights it would do nothing either by the looks of it. It needs more oomf, to be a little more predictable, and be made more useful all around\n\n_Q_\nNot enough details to judge it accurately. Looks like a cool concept. I think it is a little on the weakside.\n\n_W_\nThis ability is super lame. It doesn't seem very fun at all and the benefits are cool early game, but later on are probably ehh. \n\n_E_\nNo benefit for leveling it up. Could be cool. Looks very exploitable. Maybe the ability to use on ally **units** not just champions.\n_R_\nNot enough power in it.","replies":[]}]}
