Her name would be up there with legendary explores like that of Ezreal. The staff before her hummed with power unknown, simply floating amongst the ruin of this ancient civilisation. Hands trembling with excitement, she reached forth and grabbed it. Excitement turned into fear. \r\n\r\nSuddenly the staff sent splinters of its main body flying towards Jules, digging deep into her arm. Her mind was overrun with pictures, images of war, famine, and death. A life that was not hers. Fighting for as long as she could, Jules realised her soul was quickly fading. She held out for as long as she could but the power was too great, forcing her to retreat to the very depths of herself. \r\n\r\nBlyton was free for the first time in centuries! The human had been no match for her sorcery and soon, neither will the rest of her kind. Blyton, eager to destroy the humans, set out to find the closest village. Upon discovery, Blyton went about preparing a spell capable of finishing the village and every soul in it. In mere seconds they would be no more. Jules felt the attack on her soul lessen for no more than a second, and in that time realised what was going to happen. With incredible willpower Jules seized this moment to try and regain some control. \r\n\r\nFor no more than a moment, Blyton lost control of her host. The spell, lost half of its power and failed to kill even a single villager! Furious with how this had turned out Blyton turned her attention to Jules&#039; soul once more. Blyton forced her back into the abyss of her body but could not rid the host of her completely. It was likely that everytime that Blyton would cast a spell, Jules would try to stop her, forcing the spells strength to diminish. Blyton reevaluated her position in the real world and to her surprise heard a lovely sound. Agony. The villagers, whilst not dead, were dying. Not very fast, in fact it may take weeks, if not months for them to all die but dying nonetheless. \r\n\r\nSome were missing body parts, others had collapsed unconscious to the ground, but all of them were in torturous pain, wailing, calling out for family members. Although none of them had died straight away, Blyton thought this may be better. The joy she felt now had been far more than any she had for a very long time. And as these villagers would die to her, so would Jules, eventually. \r\n\r\nPassive: Name: Diminishing hand\r\nBlyton&#039;s spells decrease the enemy&#039;s armour and magic resistance by x(plus y per level), so long as they affect an enemy champ. This stacks up to 3 times. \r\n\r\nQ: Name: Seeking conjury \r\nBlyton selects a target and fires a ball of magic at them. If the target is not an enemy champ or large/epic monster, the orb will bounce off of them harmlessly to the next target in range. If it hits an enemy champion or large/epic monster the spell will deal mag dmg x(plus y% ap).All targets that this ability hits, or bounces off, are revealed for 3 seconds. \r\n\r\nW: Name: Quick Plague\r\nBlyton dashes in and releases a burst of aoe magic dmg dealing x(plus y% ap). This also slows the enemy for 20% for 3 seconds. \r\n\r\nE: Name: Floored magic\r\nBlyton channels this spell for 1 second before leaving behind an invisible aoe trap. This trap lasts for 2mins. When an enemy champ steps on it they take x(plus y% ap) mag dmg. The damage in tolled out over 3 seconds. If the enemy champs are slowed whilst in this damage, they then take x(plus y% ap) over 3 more seconds. \r\n\r\nR: Name: Control\r\nBlyton momentarily gains control over the body. The staff engulfs an allied champion, increasing the mag res and armour by x(plus y% ap) for a duration of 5 seconds. After those 5 seconds the armour then goes to the selected enemy champion, in range. They take x(plus a % of how much dmg was taken, plus ap%) over 5 seconds. \r\n\r\nI understand that it&#039;s this champ may not be great, but i enjoyed the story and the abilities i&#039;ve put in here. If you feel inspired or even feel there is ability more suited to this champ feel free to make an input. Also feedback if you feel like you want to.","replies":[]}
