The abilities can be activated once more within the 3 seconds to be used immediately.  \r\n\r\nq: Forceful Stab- Shaki forces his sword forward creating a straight line and pushing back enemies caught in the attack. Range about 500.\r\ncost-60/65/70/75/80 cd- dmg-70/115/160/205/250 85% AD\r\n\r\nw: Backslash- Shaki uses a powerful strike that creates a brief line(like vik&#039;s laser but all at once) that slows and damages any player in that area. It can only be done horizontal to where Shaki is facing and is out by about 500 so Shaki must position himself.  \r\ncost-40/45/50/55/60 cd-10/9/8/7/6 dmg-45/65/85/105/125 +45% AD\r\n\r\ne: Clever Doll- Shaki creates a doll that cannot move or attack or do anything really. It spawns with 1/4 Shaki&#039;s max health and defences. It&#039;s only effect is that it counts as a champion. (Think of this for cait traps and ult, brand ult, fid&#039;s crows etc.) A max of 2 can be out at any one time. Range 1000\r\ncost-50/60/70/80/90 cd-15/14/13/12/11 dmg-0\r\n\r\nr: Counter dash- Shaki deflects the next champion attack that hits him and rapidly dashes to the assailant, counter striking them. The dash can be canceled by activating the ability again( remember the ult is not a regular ability, take zilean&#039;s w for example). \r\ncost-120 cd-130/115/100 dmg-20%/35%/50%of the attack +1/3 of Shaki&#039;s AD\r\n\r\nBackground: With light comes dark. When the beginning was made the ending was determined. When the Wandering Caretaker was born so was the Heartless wanderer. Not much is known about this figure. That&#039;s because all that see him in this world are killed. Only few have escaped with their lives due to interference of other Celestial beings. Though there may be a guardian it is only a matter of time until the destroyer succeeds.\r\n\r\nLooks: \r\nWeapon- Imagine a giant peeler in sword form. \r\nBody- Imagine a skinny bard with ragged, dark clothing. The face gnarled like that of an old tree, covered by a hood, and with 3 randomly placed red eyes. No meeps but he has actual feet and shoes.   \r\n\r\n(First time with stats so be kind :D)\r\nStats:\r\nHp-575-2076\r\nHp reg-8.5-20.4\r\nMana-297-1058\r\nMana reg-7.4-16.8\r\nRange- 125 melee\r\nAtk dmg- 57-111\r\nAtk spd-0.647(+0%-47.1)\r\nArmor- 25.3-76.9\r\nMagic Res- 32.1-53.4\r\nMov. Spd- 345\r\n\r\nFeedback appreciated, no nasty things please :P Thanks for reading this far, feel free to use this as a base if you want to build anything off it( eg you like one of the abilities but think it could work better elsewhere).","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-08-15T11:30:13.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like if {{champion:157}} and {{champion:35}} had a baby","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-08-14T01:29:06.505+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just nao this wont work","replies":[]}]}
