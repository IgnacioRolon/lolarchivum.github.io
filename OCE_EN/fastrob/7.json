This will last 10 seconds. If &#039;Fish Line&#039;  is applied to another enemy champ the two champions will be pulled towards each other dealing (). \r\n\r\nQ &#039;Slipknot&#039;- Kurayu leaves a fishing net from one wall to another. The first champion to walk through it takes () dmg and is slowed. If that champs uses a movement spell/ability(anything from movement speed increase to a dash) they are instead rooted. \r\n\r\nW &#039;Fogged down&#039;-  Kurayu creates a watery, foggy, large area. While he is within this area, Kurayu is invisible so long as he doesn&#039;t move. Kurayu cannot move normally while within the fog. When he moves he makes large dashes instead. There is a pause between each dash.\r\n\r\nE &#039;Give and Take&#039;- Activating &#039;Give and Take&#039; will allow the user to switch between the 2 abilities. \r\n1- There is an increase in Kurayu&#039;s damage() and range()\r\n2- There is an increase in Kurayu&#039;s attack speed() and critical rate()\r\n \r\nR &#039;Skip the line&#039;- &#039;Fish Line&#039; is now stacked every shot but will only stack on 2 targets at a time. \r\n\r\nWeapon: spear gun\r\n\r\nBackstory- Sick of the ocean life below Kurayu decided to come to shore. Others had gone before him and he was sure others would go after him. He didn&#039;t know where to start and he didn&#039;t know where he was going but he knew he would make his mark. The moment he stepped on land however he knew it was a mistake. Broken boats with fishing nets everywhere, trees black and rotting, a heavy fog filled the air, and a constant wailing could be heard from within the fields. Retreating back to the water he tried to swim away from this place. However after swimming for hours he resurfaced but found himself in the exact same location. He swam and swam himself into exhaustion but no matter how much he tried he never moved from that spot. Unable to move he drifted to shore, his eyes barely able to take in what as around him. His body worked against him, forcing him into a deep slumber. When he finally awoke he was different, hurt, angry and above all had a ravenous hunger to avenge what had been done to his ocean. His body knew where to go and he started his journey to take revenge for his old home. From the ocean, to the shadow isles, to the League of Legends.  \r\n\r\nFurther notes: Thanks for reading, no I don&#039;t want stats, cooldown, damage or cost. I am simply supplying the imaginative part of a champ. I have no desire to calculate what would be suitable in order for a champ to be balanced. Thank you for your kind thought though. I know there are faults and if you want you can make improvements. Again thank you.","replies":[]}
