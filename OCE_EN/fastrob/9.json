Tormented souls would generally look like souls from the Shadow Isle however to make these a bit different have them chained down by their own weapons. Using Orianna, Syndra, and Ahri(any champs that use circular weapons) you can make chain and balls. If you want something to tie it up with a nice little bow, why not Soul Trader(King?) Thresh. Make a Thresh skin that has a throne of souls, and keeps lock and key on each of these tormented souls he has captured and released. \r\n\r\nAlternatively make some punk prison girls with a classic ball and chain, add some punkish hair, dark makeup,  basically the bad girl type look. \r\n\r\nJust ideas I wanted to put out there, no hate.","replies":[]}
