Enemies hit will take X amount of damage. (main damaging ability). \r\n\r\nW, Helping Hand- Erick can give X amount of his health to an ally. This health is then replaced with grey health. Activating the ability again can take back the health. Upon the ally dieing the grey health will disappear. Note you cannot kill an ally champion this way but can deny a minion in this fashion(no gold or exp received).\r\n\r\nE, Swing that Horn- Erick gets ready to swing his horn, slowing himself by X%. Depending on how much he has charged Erick will swing further. Any enemy caught in the bell end of his horn will follow the swing. Enemies will take X amount of magic damage. The swing can can as far as behind him but it must charge for a while to do that. Small range(darius pull), the bell with be about the size of a zyra seed. \r\n\r\nR, Sensitive Ears- Passive: Ericks horn will make a sound every time a new enemy enters this abilities area of effect(think about ziggs ult). If the enemy leaves no sound will be made the horn will not work make a sound for them for a fair bit of time. \r\nActive: Erick blow his horn with such force that all enemies in the area of effect will be revealed and receive a debuff of X% of damage and magic damage. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackstory- Erick was a famous herder that loved and cherished his cattle. he was the best in the land due to his most prized and cherished bull, Apis. Apis was a massive creature that stood with his head above any humans. Due to the sheer size and absurd strength he possessed he was sawt out from all over for breeding, fighting, even eating. Erick denied any eating or fighting of the bull but with the money he made with the stud, he bought a magical bit of farm land in the kingdom of Demacia. \r\nThis land was surrounded by deep rivers, vast plans, and a magical energy flowed throughout the land. Most cattle that lived in this land were able to grow much larger, produce finer milk, and have the make the most luxurious leather. Apis was much larger than the any other bull that had been there before and was able to absorb a lot more magic. Erick poured his heart and soul into Apis, making a true companion and a friendship that would never end. \r\nHowever, one day a fierce warrior screaming for death came into the pasture. He claimed he was Olaf, of Lokfar, and that he was here to battle the beast named Apis. Erick refused him hi challenge but the warrior would not hear it. He charged passed Erick and ran straight for Apis, creaming and slashing.\r\nApis seemed to know what was about to happen and braced for the coming fight. The warrior slashed at Apis but was not able to get passed the bull&#039;s horns. Both bull and warrior went on for what felt like days, slashing and hacking at each other. The man would land a blow but it would be far too shallow in amongst the muscle Apis possessed. Apis would strike back, his horns scrapping the man&#039;s limbs and torso, but never quite landing the finishing blow. \r\nErick could only hide, hoping his bull would be enough to fend of this intruder. As the fight went on longer and longer Erick noticed something. The warrior began to lose himself in the battle, becoming more and more like a beast that man. As apis struck the man once more with his horns that warrior let out a violent scream that rang through the air. Suddenly each strike forced deeper cuts into Apis. The bull struck out in a final attempt to finish the man in front of him but his horn flew from his head, and landed near Erick&#039;s hiding place. With a final strike the warrior killed Apis. Though he did not stop there.\r\nThe warrior was lost in a bloody haze as he swept through Erick&#039;s herd, killing all his cattle that he had once cared for. Erick was a fit man from living his life on a farm, but what person could stop a monster like this? All he could do was sit and wait until the warrior Olaf had left. \r\nErick wept for the lose of his friend. The Demacian army finally came to investigate what had caused such carnage. Soldiers came and asked him one by one questions of what had unfolded and what type of monster had there been. Erick retold his story every time, tears falling when he mentioned the death of his friend. In one of these tellings a large, strongly built man came and gave Erick what was left of his friend, a horn. The rest was buried at the request of Erick himself. \r\n&#039;The man who did this to your cattle is long gone. There is no way to follow him and even if we could he would slaughter far too many of my soldiers. You have nothing left here, nothing to live off of. Though you did not engage in battle we can train you to become a soldier, strong enough o that one day you may prevent others from losing what you have.&#039;\r\nErick shocked at such words looked at the man before him. It was Garen, the might of Demacia. With horn in hand he nodded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: I did not give stats, exact damages, or cooldowns. I hope this does not annoy anyone but I&#039;m not experienced enough in that area. You are more than welcome to add a comment to this post to add what you think Erick should have. Lastly feedback is wanted, obviously nothing nasty but don&#039;t sugar coat it too much. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-08-06T03:18:05.043+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea\nhowever\nthe static passive seems like a programmers worst nightmare with the bugs and glitches that could arise from it\nalso, as unique as the helping hand ability is, what does this attribute overall? Furthermore, does this fit in with his theme of using his horn?\nhis Q could become a knock back as well, since it is sound\nyour ult is, like with the passive, likely to become REALLY buggy, but it is niffty. However, the debuff you speak of is vague. Do you mean you reduce their AD and AP? or what?\n\n>  receive a debuff of X% of damage and magic damage.\n\nThis doesn't really clarify any details as to what this does.\nGood luck with all your future designs and have fun :)","replies":[{"poster":"fastrob","date":"2017-08-06T08:12:46.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, great feedback. The passive follows the line of Kled where he will gain a speed boost bonus if he is charging toward an enemy champ. Of course this would be an aoe type passive so I can understand the pain.\nFair call the helping hand not really fitting in. Mostly I thought this could be great for supporting your teammates at the cost of yourself. I also thought this would be a good way to deny minions, whilst not very many, one or 2 every wave would start to take effect possibly. \nThe ult I was kinda lost with. I did like it's passive or the idea of it at least. The active was more of a clutching at straws idea. And yer I did mean to reduce AD and AP. I'm terrible when it comes to naming specifics. \n\nAgain thanks for the great feedback and I hope this clarifies any queries you had. \nLove to hear back from you if I come up with any other ideas. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Cosmicpanda2","date":"2017-08-07T11:52:29.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"okay well, the passive perhaps, needs to be more unique, to start off with, because at the moment it seems like a free Righteous Glory without the slow. Perhaps since your character was a shepherd of sorts, perhaps it does the opposite? Make him a defensive support that can help get allies out and enemies away. This couples nicely with your Q and E as you can peel enemies off while your passive makes your allies be able to make a hasty retreat.\n\nThe heal, perhaps instead of this weird obscure \"Heal at the cost of yourself\" ({{champion:16}} ), perhaps make it a heal that is strong, BUT, is over time, and can be cancelled by damage. So that means in order to heal, he has to FIRST get you out of the danger, going back to his Q and E, and passive which gets them out of damage range. Maybe the heal can be like folk medicine that he has in a pouch which he throws to the target. \n\nWith his ult, if we are to continue down this path of PEEL and RUN, HEAL later when danger is gone, why not make his ult a powerful disengage, perhaps keep the passive, but when active, it inflicts a massive movement and attack speed slow to enemies when they are moving towards or targeting allies, as well as revealing them, making it that enemies CAN try to engage but now have to assess whether or not they should commit while the passive is on as it can put them way out of position or the slows will make it a gamble they shouldn't have taken.\n Good luck with future designs :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
