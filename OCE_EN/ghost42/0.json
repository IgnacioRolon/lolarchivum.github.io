I&#039;ve picked a champ I like to play and I intended to continue playing it till I got better at it. where in the rules does it say that&#039;s not allowed?\r\nI have been doing it with no problems at all until it&#039;s a weekend and suddenly every 12 year old thinks that if you accidentally die you&#039;re inting.\r\nI&#039;ve been flamed, called a %%%got, told to kill myself, told to uninstall, called a stupid %%%%.... barely reacted to any of it.\r\nbut because a bunch of kids think that playing non meta is trolling so report me I get perma banned with no warnings? wtf riot\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve played this game literally since since season 1. I was playing on US servers and then GARENA servers before OCE was ever a thing.\r\nI&#039;ve never seen a player perma banned with no warnings.  You guys literally had a video on the home screen of the client for weeks encouraging people to &quot;break the meta&quot; and try new champs in new rolls. I do that and get banned for it? I get called far worse in every game than I&#039;ve ever called anyone in game. but I let it go and don&#039;t bother reporting anyone for it, thinking I&#039;m doing the right thing. but because a bunch of kids get together and group report me none of that means anything? a straight up perma ban with no warnings for this is fucking pathetic","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-03T14:39:10.128+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are very few things that will net you an instant perma ban.\n\nThings that do, are things like cheating, illicit 3rd party program use, chargebacks (which are reversible upon settlement), security/compromise bans (which are reversed upon the account being secured), that type of thing.\n\nBehavioural offences (gameplay, chat, griefing etc) will _never_ result in a perma ban for first offence, there will always be at least a 14 day ban as a warning first. Even no tolerance language like hate speech and suicide encouragement gets that one warning.\n\nYour reform card (the popup you see when you login) will tell you what you were banned for, or at the very least point you to support to get the full story. You can also submit a ticket directly to player support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they will be able to tell you what you were punished for, and often offer more context.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-02-05T00:09:31.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Behavioural offences (gameplay, chat, griefing etc) will _never_ result in a perma ban for first offence, there will always be at least a 14 day ban as a warning first.

Granted, I did say that Hitler the right idea and that gays and Jews should be killed off, but case in point. This was a while ago, though. May have changed.\n\nOf course, I have never gotten a warning, either. First punishment is normally always a chat restriction or a fourteen-day ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-02-05T02:46:52.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends how long ago it was, the system changed drastically around the time OCE started, and quite significantly again a year or two after that.\n\nAs for warnings, the chat restrictions/14 days *are* the warnings.","replies":[{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-02-05T03:20:22.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=AOIe001U,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2019-02-05T02:46:52.631+0000)\n>\n> Depends how long ago it was, the system changed drastically around the time OCE started, and quite significantly again a year or two after that.\n> \n> As for warnings, the chat restrictions/14 days *are* the warnings.\n\nMaybe.\n\nThat is not how warnings work, mate.
