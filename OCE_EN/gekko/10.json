Firstly and mainly is the client. Secondly in game ward clarity.\r\n\r\n**Client practicality &amp; clarity:**\r\n-**MOVABLE RUNE PAGES**: There is a feature I have always wanted when I am on my profile, to be able to able to organise my rune pages without having to clear them. Like when you are on a web browser and you can move tabs around. \r\n\r\n-**SUMMONER SPELL WINDOW**: When in champion select and I need to change two {{summoner:7}} summoner spell{{summoner:4}}  but cant do it in one go? I want that back. It used to be just fine. New isn&#039;t always better  (personally i always click on a champ in the backgrond cause if forget that the SS window closes and pick a different champion, and then get ****ed cause the timer ended{{champion:17}} ).\r\n\r\n -**CHAMPION CATEGORIES**: Another feature for Champ Select. It would look like the &quot;Item Sets&quot; feature in the profile section but for champions. That way when you are in champ select you can have different categories. For example, all ADCs under the ADC category{{champion:22}} {{champion:51}} {{champion:42}} {{champion:119}} {{champion:81}} {{champion:104}} {{champion:222}} {{champion:429}} {{champion:236}} {{champion:21}} {{champion:133}} {{champion:15}} {{champion:17}} {{champion:18}} {{champion:29}} {{champion:110}} {{champion:67}} , etc. These categories would be expanded or not (just having categroy title, so that there is no need to scroll down. Additional a &quot;General&quot; category should be at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere could also be a &quot;Recommended Bans&quot; category when you are Team Captain. Which would appear above the general pool of champions. It would  just be a feedback from other games played at your current elo. Say for example that at 1700 elo people keep banning {{champion:112}} {{champion:72}} {{champion:17}}  . These could then appear in the Recommended Bans. If the popularity in a certain ban would change, so would the Recommended Bans.\r\n\r\n{{item:2043}} **IN GAME CARITY (WARDS) :**{{item:2044}} \r\n-When placing a ward, having the max range circle of vision it will provide if placed &quot;there&quot;. I dont know if calculating terrain would be possible without having a visual overload, but have atleast the optimal circle had the terrain unobstructed to help with better ward placement.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and please post your opinion bellow!\r\n\r\nCheers, G{{champion:245}} When do I start work Rito? xD","replies":[{"poster":"Veryhungryperson","date":"2015-09-18T01:16:38.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reasonable suggestions\n\nMovable rune pages - Riot's client is coded with spaghetti code so this is unlikely to ever happen until they release a new client.\n\nChampion categories - Already a thing. Typing in \"marksman\" will bring up all the currently player classified attack damage carries.\n\nRecommended Bans - An unneeded feature that discourages actual team interaction and creates a hivemind banset.\n\nWard vision indicators - Interesting idea, find it kind of redundant though because I've placed enough wards to know the limits.","replies":[{"poster":"Gekko","date":"2015-09-20T13:10:09.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but you have to type in \"marksman\". In that case just type in the champions name and get it over with.","replies":[]}]}]}
