{"poster":"Gekko","date":"2016-11-20T05:51:57.522+0000","title":"Siab, the Stilt Stalker","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The concept of this champion evolves around a melee jungler. His theme is that of an addiction to height and all things long, hence a possibility to inverse that height into range.\nSiab is a yordle that is obsessed with Shaco and wishes to join his clown act as a stilt walker.\n\n**Abilities:**\n- **Passive: &#039;Can&#039;t Reach Me&#039;** Champions that have less range than Siab take additional damage.\n\n-**Q: &quot;I&#039;m a grower not a shower&quot;** Increases the length (which will affect W and R) of the stilts and Siab&#039;s damage ratio (both items and abilities).\n\n-**W: &quot;Grow!&quot;** Siab makes his stilts lengthen in a freakish way for a brief period of time allowing him to traverse terrain and increase his movement speed. The additional height also increases his vision and can be used to scout over walls.\n\n-**E: &quot;Pin them!&quot;** Siab gets rid of all his unused stilts by throwing them in a line (like Rumble ult or Viktors laser) and rooting all those touched.\n\n-**R: &quot;Timber!&quot;** Siab switches his stilts from his feet to  his hands which in the process will (passive must be accounted for):\n                                              - Reduce movement speed by 90%\n                                              - Increases range to 700 (+level of Q)\n                                              - Attacks gain width and deal  reduced damage to the secondary targets (primary one gets the full ratio).\n\n                           Visually I imagined that Siabs autoattacks when using R would look like Ilaois tenticles\n\n**NOTE: WHILST IN R HE  CANNOT USE HIS OTHER ABILITIES**\n\nExample of a gank. \n\nSiab just killed blue and shall gank top.\nHe uses W to cross terrain and the use of the additional movement speed to surprise the toplaner. Following this Siab uses E to root the opponent and can switch to R to take advantage of the additional stats on his attacks whilst not being bothered by the reduced movement speed as the opponent is rooted.\n\nExample of a team fight. \n\nSiab is strong in small spaces around objectives or in the jungle as he can root an entire team and deal damage to them all with the use of his R. Nevertheless the relatively high cooldown on R means that he has to pick the right time and position to use his R or can get caught out of position easily and can be left behind by his team if they chase (90% ms reduction is limiting when you are running after a kiting team).\n\nThanks for reading, leave a comment below if you think this is worth it!\n\nGekko    {{champion:245}}\n\nPS: Siab means tall in the Hmong language.

A bit confusing for new player's (needs a good skill curve) and 2. A bit too restraining and underpowered. Maybe instead of 90% its a 90% slow for half of the duration and full damage then no slow but less damage (a 40% reduction maybe) so that if you do miss E then it's not hopeless. The Q name wouldn't get in because of obvious reason's so maybe a new one like \"Loj\" (giant in Hmong) and maybe he trained in the art of Hmong like Yi and Wukong with Wuju. He could be like Zed and killed his Hmong master because of Shaco. Message me at smerson121@gmail.com if you maybe want me to help you out with a concept art or idea's. Looking forward to working with you, Smer (summoner name on League is Smersanomicon)","replies":[{"poster":"Gekko","date":"2016-11-20T10:06:15.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes the name of the Q is not to be taken seriously, I was just chuckling to myself as I wrote it so decided not to change it.\n\nI see your point on the fact that if Siab misses his E he is screwed, maybe his W could gain one charge when he is using his ultimate. Something like a small jump that would allow him to reposition once.","replies":[]}]}]}
