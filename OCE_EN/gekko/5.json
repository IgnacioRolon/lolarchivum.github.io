Here are some examples:\n\n- If you are in a bush that is not warded (it was scanned or has a pink in it) and Fiddle casts his crow, you will still get hit. That is BS. I&#039;d understand if he had no vision of my whilst I was out of the bush and I got hit, but not when I&#039;m in a bush.\n\n- Brand casts Pillar of flames (the centre of the spell inside a bush), you can&#039;t see the area of effect if you are standing outside of that bush and have no vision inside that said bush.\n\n- Illaoi tentacle is in a bush and slaps you, can&#039;t see slap zone if you (again) are standing outside of that bush and have no vision inside that said bush.\n\nThere are more, like fiddle R, Kennen, etc etc. \n\nNunu R should be exempt as channeling is ok to be hidden.\n\nCheers , \nGekko","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-08-03T05:44:14.236+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.\n\nIf I get hit with an ability, I want to know it, and I want to know why.\n_(Although I personally think that Nunu's R should also be visible.)_\n\nThere should be a standard, either everything is visible from bush, or nothing is. And everything follows those rules no exceptions.\n\nIt seems weird to me that Xerath can slap you from out of a bush half a lane away, and you have no idea until half your  HP is gone. Meanwhile Sol gets to be the ultimate hide and seek loser as he sits in a bush and everyone gets to see his stars orbit it.\n\nAnything that is ground targeted or has a hitbox indicator thats visible to the enemy, should be seen from brush.\nYou can't have some working by different rules than others.\n\n\n________________\n\nOn a seperate (but mildly related) note, the range on placing wards should be larger.\nThe meme is: _\"Never face check bushes\"_, hahah we all laugh at someone when they die from it, and we all know its a silly thing to do.\n\nThe way to prevent face checking: **Warding.**\n\nThe issue is, damage creep has ramped up the damage output of every champ over the last few years, and now many champs _(especially those with CC or dashes)_, can still kill you relatively easily from the maximum range needed to place a ward.\n\nI feel like you shouldn't be punished for warding.\nIf you know Rengar is in the area, it's actually safer NOT to go place a ward in the bush. Because if he is there, bye bye you.\nThat just isn't on, _\"Don't ward our lane ADC, because the enemy jungle might be nearby.\"_ is a sentence no one should have to say, ever.\n\nIf you know Rengar _(or Zed, or Fizz or whoever else can 100-0 before you even know it.)_ is in your area,  thats their bad for not being sneaky enough, you have countered their roaming play by either good MIA communication, or your own good map-awareness/warding. So you shouldn't be punished by warding your nearest bush in preparation of their arrival.\n\nWards have a long cool down, and warding shouldn't be a task that puts you in danger _(seeming the whole purpose of them is to alert you to danger in the first place)_.\n\nFace checking the brush is lethal, warding shouldn't have to be.","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2018-08-03T06:15:00.019+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> There should be a standard, either everything is visible from bush, or nothing is.
