The damage dealt is worth 1 AA per stack and can critical strike. In addition, the tracer is consumed burning the target for a percentage of their HP over time.\r\n\r\n**W (Running Start):** \tMarvel hold out his arm giving Mavrik a platform for him to run along, gaining speed to throw grenade at a targeted location.\r\n\r\n**E (Hold on tight):** \tMarvel leaps to a new location a short distance away\r\n\r\n**R(Machine Gun Mode) = MGM:\r\n**\r\nMarvel unstraps the machine gun that is on his back and holds it at shoulder height whilst, Mavrik, perched on his shoulder fires away. During this period Mavrik cannot target select but shoots at the closest target available and gains the &ldquo;tracer bullet&rdquo; burn effect every third shot and proc&rsquo;ing passive. In addition, the duo can attack whilst moving (like Syndras casting) but have reduced movement speed. \r\n\r\nNote: Other abilities cannot be used whilst MGM is being channeled.\r\n\t\r\n**Summary of R:**\r\n\t-Attack the closest target but with the advantage of additional AD and AS\r\n\t-Attack whilst moving but at the cost of lower MS\r\n\t-Third shot burn effect (% hp over time) and proc&rsquo;ing passive (leave a trail).\r\n\r\n**Strengths** are in taking down tanks with low hard engage and in prolonged team fights\r\n\r\n**Weakness** are CC and burst damage\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,\r\n\r\nGekko","replies":[]}
