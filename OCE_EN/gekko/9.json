It&#039;s so simple it&#039;s dumb. It&#039;s exactly the same as how Central Banks conduct monetary policies. \r\n\r\n**YOU CONTROL THE CASH. PERIOD**\r\n\r\nCrit was never an issue, it&#039;s that ADCs on two items could carry before anyone else could. So just make those items more expensive, delay their spike. And voila, ADCs can only start carrying a bit later in the game.\r\n\r\nYeah sure if they or any other midlaner/top gets a triple kill they are most likely going to snowball the game... what&#039;s the definition of snowballing again?? \r\n\r\nI&#039;m not saying champion specific balancing shouldn&#039;t be done, but role specific ones can be balanced via the items they need, simply by the cost. If a champ is too stronger lvl 1-5, nerf the base stats. If the champ is an early game champ, make them fall off hard late by having low ratios on bonus stats. It&#039;s not hard.\r\n\r\nStop over complicating shit Rito, you&#039;re just making it worse.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-07-16T09:41:22.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What you are suggesting is far from a balance resolution.\n\nThe true test of balance is between dealing damage and receiving it, which has forever been LoL's problem. Either damage is too strong or tanking is too strong, they haven't had it right since seasons 2-3.\n\nWhat you suggest doesn't actually solve anything, because increasing item costs effects more than just ADC's. What if your top lane or jungler want some AD items, oh shit, your \"fix\" just fucked them.\n\nYou say \"stop over complicating shit\", but you're trying to over simplify it. I'd say go play MtG and PoE for a few years, then come back with a better perspective on balancing.","replies":[{"poster":"Gekko","date":"2018-07-18T12:59:51.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are talking crit items here. Are you a Garen IE main or something? Or a Xin static shiv ? Or a Stormrazor Wu? These are off meta builds for sure and would effect the game.\n\nBeing able to carry on 2 crit items from the adc role was only an issue because other roles could not survive the dmg long enough. So if you delay them getting those items, then frontliners have time to get enough defensive items to create a proper midgame.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-17T23:24:28.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if u can only kill squishies ur not a carry are you you're more an assasin, this change further diversified and defined the carry role letting them kill armor tanks through true damage. this however puts more value into health, and again with removal of lord doms regards. it turned the game/or reflected what it already was becoming by leading meta/ into a nuke fest (healths good vs nukes), with more reward for grouping and strategy, which is what you want to do as a flagship casual pub game in moba genre, teach new people.\n\nsomeone said to me in rift the other day and i swear on my life it was like this:\n\n\"if you want to group go play aram\" lmao","replies":[{"poster":"Gekko","date":"2018-07-18T12:58:48.770+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"if you want to group go play aram\" \n\nHAHAHA so true and so sad... SoloQ is an issue with nukers as an adc anyways. I've already been one shotted by a Rengar whilst literally in the middle of my team. That's yoloQ and it won't change","replies":[]}]}]}
