These targets are revealed and can be seen when in stealth/Camo or in a bush.\n\n**Q - Inseparable link:**\n\nQ has a double cast. First cast is a skill shot that &lsquo;marks/attaches to&rsquo; the target hit (enemy minion, neutral monster or champion), the second shot is another skill shot, if the second shot hits a target (again: enemy minion, neutral monster or champion) the two targets are &lsquo;linked&rsquo; and cannot move away from each other (each level decreasing the length of the link and thus obliging the targets to stay within a maximum range of each other &ndash; they are free to move but within a maximum range of each other).\nNote that if the distance between the targets exceed the maximum distance allowed by the link when two targets are linked they are pulled together to the max range (think Zac).\n\n**W- Bouncing Orb: **\n\nThrow a ball of light that bounces between allies, healing them with each bounce. Multiple bounces between the same champions or allied minions is possible (think reverse Fiddle Dark Wind, the bird ability).\n\n**E- Ethereal Ring:**\n\nSicaris casts a circle of ethereal chain around himself (moves with him) which doesn&rsquo;t allow for any of his abilities to leave the perimeter, this includes targets that are under the effect of Ethereal Touch.\n\n**R- Binding Orb: **\n\nCasts an Orb that latches (think morgana chains that target people) on to anyone that enters its zone of influent, slowing then and dragging them to towards the Orb. If the targets reach the Orb&rsquo;s inner circle they are stunned for 1 sec. \nThe zone constitutes of 3 circles, the outer, the middle and the inner (stun zone), with the slow and the drag being stronger in the middle circle than the outer.\n\n**Game Play 1: Maintaining a target within reach of the damage dealers**\n\nIf Inseparable Link has hit the targets you are seeking, you can then cast Ethereal Rings with one of the targets marked by Ethereal Touch within the circle. This will prevent the marked target from leaving the zone and the linked target from moving further away. You cannot however force an enemy to move by you yourself moving back &ndash; you are both trapped by the others movement.\nNote that this also works by linking a Champion to a minion or neutral monster.\n\n**Game Play 2: Bait the assassins**\n\nIf an assassin tries to pop you ADC or other whilst other members that don&rsquo;t need healing are around, you can cast Ethereal Ring and then Bouncing Orb, which will not leave the circle and focus the healing on the targets within, thus a heal on steroids.\n\n**Game play 3: Keep your allies safe**\nAlong with the above scenarios, you can cast Binding Orb, which works well in constricted spaces, by obliging the enemy to either walk through and get slowed/stunned or find a way around. There is also no harm in having your squishes standing in the zone itself (say if Zed is around). \n\n\nThanks for reading - Please leave a comment with your thoughts below.\n\n**Gekko**\n\nPS: I have not created any illustrations so feel free to draw up what you think he/she should look like!","replies":[]}
