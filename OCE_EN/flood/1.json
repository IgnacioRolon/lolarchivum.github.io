However I&#039;ve noticed that there is an almost a complete change in player behaviour, attitude and overall gameplay. Players are aware of possible counterplays, matchups and champion skillsets as opposed to Silver division. Over the next 20-30 games I&#039;ve find it almost impossible to climb out of Gold V, peaking at around 65 then having losing streaks thereafter. \r\n\r\nI have mained support since season 2 and enjoy the challenges set my this role. I prefer defensive and or passive plays as opposed to agressive, playing over 700 games with champions such as Janna, Sona, Lulu and Braum. If anyone would give some advice to my play style or make criticisms to anything, I would greatly appreciate it. Also, if anyone is looking for a somewhat decent support main, I&#039;m up for games.","replies":[{"poster":"Vote 1 Trump","date":"2015-06-07T01:54:26.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Played since season 2, 700 games this season, still not plat. Only reasonable advice is to give up and play minesweeper.","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-07T02:23:08.870+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember saying 700 games this season, rather throughout the sum of seasons I've played.

There are players above plat. This alone is proof it is not impossible. It is actually much easier than it seems. You are making it harder for yourself to climb by playing support only. You need to be able to play at least one other position. If you want an easy way to get to plat, pick a split push champion and split push. Its that easy. I proved it to myself by playing Heimerdinger top only from gold 5 to plat 4.","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-07T06:18:27.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for that.

We both went from Silver 3 to Gold 5 in about 4 days. I'm now in my Gold 4 promos too.\n\nI know what you mean about the \"quality\" of games. Its more about playing well and 1 person making a mistake that causes the game to shift rather then simply having someone who has no clue what they are doing LOL","replies":[{"poster":"Flood","date":"2015-06-06T13:01:03.034+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for the advice!\n\nI had a duo once whom I climbed from Silver 4 to Gold 5 with. We were so hyped to reach Gold 5 in the same game. But I think he has encountered the same situation as I. We have experienced that people are often prone to the situation I'd like to call \"If you don't get first blood it's GG\" coming from (surprisingly) Gold players. We communicated effectively via teamspeak and often win bot lane but the problem might be the transition from mid game to late game. I'm not saying that we don't do these things but our team members troll or feed a little because of the \"freelo\" so much so that they actually throw the game. After a week of losing streak, he has now completely given up...","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-06T14:43:15.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try getting the ADC to learn and play Hyper Carries. Jinx, Kog or Trist who can take over a game. If you have godlike peel, you should be able to win teamfights if you manage to win lane.\n\nThe reason my friend and I did so well is because he likes to play Jinx. So all I have to do is protect him and he can kill everyone pretty easily.\n\nYou can see in my items I pretty much went {{item:3190}} {{item:3401}} {{item:3222}}  every game and saved them mainly for him.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
