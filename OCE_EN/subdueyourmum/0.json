BUT! There is only so much as a player I can do.  I'm not Faker, nor do I claim to be.\r\n\r\nHowever I have noticed I'll go on win streaks of about 10 then lose 10 in a row.\r\nOr as of late, end up in teams who are constantly FF spamming, afking or inting - or alternatively we get bloody boosters and smurfs.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be someone addressing the matchmaking going on. I'm not the only one who's noticed this as I've seen it on reddit posts as well. \r\nIt's putting me on some serious tilt and I just don't enjoy this game anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-09-13T03:51:47.244+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm just here to tell you that this will be shrugged off because i've been saying the same thing for months.","replies":[{"poster":"SubdueYourMum","date":"2019-09-13T08:05:04.035+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an absolute joke.
