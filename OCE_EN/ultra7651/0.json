There was a situation today where I called a role and on my screen it showed first, but somebody else said that they got it. So I asked the other team members and one said me and the other one said the other person.\r\nThis leads me to wonder why is this the case? Is it because of connection speed or something? Also is there anything that can be done to fix the problem.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T06:11:16.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's just people connecting to the chat at different times. It sucks, because Riot seem to have done nothing in regard to messages not going through. Hell, in the coding it's possible to send a message but have no one receive it due to a temporary drop in internet connection (it does not save to RAM and send when possible, it just won't send.\n\nThis is a design flaw in the game, something which cannot be fixed.","replies":[]}]}
