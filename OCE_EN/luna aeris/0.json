The hype, the general concept of 80% Cooldown Reduction, and the enjoyment of discussing with friends the op champs and team comps we all could create. Now, I have another proposal that will be able to fill the time between now and the next urf days. \n\nConcept: \nOk, so my friends and I for a fair while have been discussing the idea of a game mode where unique passives and actives do stack. Now, you may think, but some builds are going to be more op than others? But, no. There are numerous, legitimately dozens of different builds for virtually any champion. From a 6 spirit visage mundo to a 6 runaan&#039;s marksman.  Every champion can benefit off a full stack build, even supports. Can anyone say lichbane sona OP?\nThis game mode also contains various countermeasures, say there is a fed vayne who&#039;s carrying 4 infinity edges to counter this a tank with either thornmail or randuins will be needed, however in doing so the enemy mage will be able to kill him/her with their 6 rabadon&#039;s. But then your friend;y adc will be able to take down the enemy mage. Then rinse and repeat the process. Therefore really there is no OP champions / builds within this game mode unlike some others we have all played in (URF). \n\nThere is one small problem, at the start of the game from early to mid game it will be as if its just a regular game, therefore like URF the gold income of every champion should also increase so summoner&#039;s will be able to acquire their desired build much faster and increase the game&#039;s overall entertainment. \n\nI know this is only a brief concept, but with your help and assistance we can actually allow the oce community to contribute to something great. \nLeave comments below and any suggestions on how to better improve this concept. With enough followers I hope we can see this implemented within a  brand new league of legends game mode concept. \n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}} \nHope To See You All On The Rift","replies":[{"poster":"Thornax11","date":"2016-05-11T09:02:53.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the very least Rito could implement this on the PBE, surely","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-05-10T10:30:57.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"6 Triforce's on an Ezreal\n\n96.6 Base damage, X 2 = 193.2  1 Triforce proc at level 18\n193.2 X 6 = 1159.2\nQ damage: 115 base + 106.26 (AD scaling off base AD) + 165 (AD scaling off Triforce's) + 1159.2 = 1545 damage Q, every 1.7 seconds (assuming you hit the Q)\n\nAnd this is ezreal, so he is going to be miles from the enemy team while doing this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-05-10T03:47:59.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Imagine stepping on a teemo shroom when he's got 6 liandry torments.
