If a skin/champion had been gifted, you would not be able to refund them, but if they had been hextech crafted, you could return it into the shard and essence/permanent, but of course you would have to meet the games played requirement if the champ/skin was hextech crafted, because that doesn&#039;t necessarily mean that you have played the champion, as hextech crafting is random.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-06-20T07:29:19.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?","replies":[]}]}
