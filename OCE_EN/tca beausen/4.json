Strong in team fights, good at peeling.\r\nWeakness: Can playing over aggressive sometimes. Can be a little to passive in lane. Don&#039;t roam enough, I like to stick with the Adc most of the time. Also i can&#039;t shot call. \r\n\r\nI am looking for a serious team that wants to go somewhere and put time in, blood, sweat and tears, I don&#039;t rage or anything, i do like to talk about what went wrong at the end of games and where we could improve, i like to watch over the games at the end of training to see how i could improve or others can improve. I can take constructive criticism. I don&#039;t like shit talking either nor do i like people fighting when we are losing, &quot; the blame game &quot; if you have problems with a member please leave it till after the game and talk about it, it ruins the game as it will make you play shit. you can always win if you keep a calm and collected mind. \r\n\r\nAdd me up, I&#039;m keen for a trial.","replies":[{"poster":"SmashBro","date":"2015-07-24T09:26:59.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: SmashBro\nAge: 17\nDiv: Season 3: Silver 4,   Season 4: Silver 1,   Season 5: Gold 2 currently\nTimes: Student.  So I can usually play from 5-9 or 10 (NZST)\nSkype & Curse Voice: Yes\nLocation: Tauranga, New Zealand\nPosition: I am a pretty good all-rounder when it comes to positions.  I'm not fussed and I usually fill so I have experience in all roles.\nFavourite champion in each role:\nTop: Gnar\nJungle: Skarner\nMid: Zed\nADC:  Jinx, Sivir\nSupport: Thresh\n\nStrengths: I communicate a lot.  I have a long fuse so it's hard to get me angry.  Make good decisions (most of the time).  Can shot call if needed.  I have a flexible champion pool so I can literally go anywhere I'm needed.\n\nWeaknesses: Tend to get a little cocky at times if I'm doing good.  Inconsistent with warding, can have games where I'm good at it and others when I'm not.  I respond to pings well but when it comes to looking at the map, I don't do it as much as I need to.\n\nAdditional Notes:  Loading time is pretty slow.  Can get up to 5 minutes or something so if you need to make a sandwich, I'm your guy :D.\nCurrently with the new 5.14 patch Macbooks are screwed when it comes to playing with the new HUD.  The game is unplayable for all Macbooks in this patch so until they fix this I will not be able to play sadly.","replies":[]}]}
