We know what Objectives are best to go for depending on the situation.\n\nWe play passive and aggressive just depends on items, levels, if they have any sums up also got to count the farm as well.   \n\nMy strengths are I&#039;m good at Warding, Team fighting, Listening to calls, able to peel pretty hard for the ADC, able to set up for objective,  E.G dragon control.\nMy Weakness are that I don&#039;t roam enough as other support depending on what champ I&#039;m playing and the ADC is playing, If we are behind i tend to not deep ward in there jungle but try and light up our jungle so we don&#039;t get picked out 1 by 1. \n\nI can play pretty much every champ but Thresh and Annie are my down fall but my main champs are. Braum/Jana/Lulu/Nami/Naut/Morg/Ali/Taric/leona/Raka/sona. I can learn any support the teams need. \n\nThe ADC strengths are Positioning, Team Fighting, Lane phase, knows when to play passive, also wards haha. knows who to focus in team fights, also can peel for himself to an extent. \nThe ADC weakness are really nothing to be honest. He is a pretty strong ADC. \n\nWe have Skype and we can get any comms if needed. \nWe only play through out the week, we play together about 7-8 hours a day or more with breaks in between. We are climbing pretty fast.  \nwe are over 18 and mature.\n\nAdd OCE Secret SUPP if you have any questions or try outs. \n\nCheers, have a great day.\n\nADC: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=OCE%20Secret%20AD\nSUPP: http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=OCE%20Secret%20SUPP","replies":[{"poster":"Oliver Twist","date":"2015-08-30T07:55:50.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man this is exactly what I was looking for!
