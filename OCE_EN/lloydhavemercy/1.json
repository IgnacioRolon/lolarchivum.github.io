I would like to know why a number of client features are not available on the League of Legends website, features such as the store, runes, masteries, collections etc.\r\n\r\nI would suggest these features could be made accessible out-of-client, allowing players who are mobile or using another computer to engage in the pre-game of League of Legends, spend our RP and IP, and be ready to go when we hit the rift. The fullest extent of this would be to develop a League of Legends app which makes these features available on a mobile client, although I understand this last part would require more significant development.\r\n\r\nAn answer on this and the possibility of it happening in the future would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLloydhavemercy","replies":[]}
