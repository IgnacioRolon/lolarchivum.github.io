Despite my efforts of playing well in my past games in this current season, I keep on losing and have reached a certain point that my win rate is below 40% which is embarrassing to present to other players. In previous seasons, I was able to climb as a support main but due to immense changes to gameplay has caused supports to suffer. For me its hard to play other roles due to my nature as a helpful person and find it hard to play other roles. Throughout my 6-7 years of playing League Of Legends I have supported Riot Games by buying Riot Points to commend for their actions of creating a great but no longer feel like supporting commending them for making the game less enjoyable for those who play a role which gives lesser impact to the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-21T15:27:32.068+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whats worse is we're dependent on NOT getting tards (protip; adcs are nothing but in my experience) so we have a harder time climbing.

We're the ones that get nothing but blame while our adcs go off, int feed and troll the team. \nLike, less LP loss, more LP gain. lil more XP would go a long way too. \n\nIn game rewards would be great too like a lil extra damage, or better scaling, or things like that. \nSupports are gettin shafted maaaaaaaaaaan :(","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-22T00:00:03.834+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"as much as it's harder to hardcarry in a single game, like any role; at the end of the day, 'can you outperform other players in the same role?'.\n\nI might have abandoned being a support main this season in favour of the much more exciting jungle gameplay; but I'd say support is good role for climbing simply because not many people main it, even last season in the ardent meta (which was good for climbing as a support, but cancer because it made games very one dimensional and laning phase very boring). I was confident I could win *any* lane as janna, regardless of whether my adc was gold or bronze (and I infact did cheese my way to gold by duoing with a low elo adcs btw, always good for quick climbing if you can put up with the ego they develop after they win their first 5 games against gold players), and this was because compared to someone who decided to pick janna simply because she was op, I was an insane individual who thought janna was a toplaner in my first few months playing in season 6.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-02-21T10:01:24.311+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"At least support is more impactful than top","replies":[{"poster":"Speak or Die","date":"2018-02-21T14:40:42.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticLlamaZ,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=3xIZAJPY,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2018-02-21T10:01:24.311+0000)\n>\n> At least support is more impactful than top\n\nRIIIIGHT THROUGH THE COUNTERSTRIKE","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-21T16:29:15.741+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"You know what supports should do? Less complaining. All of that complaining at the end of season 6 has contributed to the current state of the meta. Support items are overtuned and supports run the game at the moment. Back in the golden age of league (seasons 3&4), supports understood that they would have less gold, because gold is not essential to their role. They would actually support.\nThen when champion select included hard fixed roles and autofill, people started crying, instead of actually learning the role and understanding it. Support is only a role because thats the way the meta is, you have an extra damage carry (marksman) in your team.\nThis season its truly too easy for supports to climb, and they should be whinging less, or changing their role to top if they really what to whinge.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2018-02-21T16:34:20.427+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're obvs baiting, but in case you are legitimately not that.........well smart. \n\nOnly if you were stupid and didn't know what to do in them seasons.  \nBeen supporting since then, and I usually (among others that knew how to play) ended with most gold. \n\nYou also have adcs going \"OMG SO OP MUST PLAY RANKED WITH IT\" then go intentionally feed game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after game after as the champ giving the enemy team whats essentially freelo.\n\nInstead of taking a shot of us players, actually play the game solo Q and you'll see i'm right.","replies":[{"poster":"Star Tear","date":"2018-02-21T21:26:50.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's not even Level 30 from what I've seen from his profile so he wouldn't have any experience from ranked queues.

The worst abusers of ancient coin and spellthiefs aren't mage supports like karma, morgana or brand, no, that would be gangplank. That isn't supports being op, that's riot screwing up.\n\nImo a good mark of the state of support items is whether traditionally midlane mages are migrating botlane. When spellthiefs was op, we saw velkox, xerath and veigar.\n\nAlso support is just about as balanced as any other role. Jungle holds the most pressure, midlane shortly after, botlane holds dragon control and determines which team opens up the map first with first blood tower. Toplane is an island where nothing happens provided nobody fucks up. Toplane has a tank/gangplank problem, but that's more that riot has been beating down on traditional early/midgame bruisers like renekton, darius, irelia, kled, olaf and poppy (more damage oriented builds).","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-27T04:58:52.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support items were overtuned (when you see Vlad buying FQC, for example), so I'm glad that its been removed. Still, it would be better if their gold generation was tuned down to stop other laners using them. 8.4 pro play is gonna be the real test. I still expect Nidalee to get frostfang.\nJust another example of them being overtuned - DaSticks builds the Eye of the watchers on Teemo as his first item in the current patch, and he's a challenger player and streamer.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-02-27T07:36:10.144+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the issue I have is, support items are op, on champions and roles that aren't support.\nseason 6, taking a support item (or even Cull, this item inexplicably would loses you lane) to a sololane or jungle was extremely inefficient, but with changes to the way support items balanced out gold income, kleptomancy and other sources of gold acceleration, support items became a problem.\n\nSupports aren't abusing support items, income wise, they're still the poorest lane, and secondary support items are balanced enough that only supports really build things like redemption or rush locket or knights vow.
