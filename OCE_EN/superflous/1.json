Because there is no information on who you might want to go to in these cases as a disgruntled and unhappy paying customer.\n\nThough of course from experience Riot as a company doesn&#039;t like to take criticism or even reports on their own staff&#039;s lack of cooperation and actual support and thus doesn&#039;t provide the appropriate contact information publicly.\n\nSo who do we contact in these cases? or should i get the local ombudsman to get this sorted out via backend channels.","replies":[{"poster":"Shishimato","date":"2016-09-13T23:28:58.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a warning for leaving game but i never left and was never afk, when i reported the employee claimed i was lying and i was afk and leaving warning in place. \nhowever what happened was i brought items then went to my tower in bot lane and waited for minions and adc (i was support) because i waited under tower they are accusing me of being afk which ofc was not the case and is backed up if they bother to watch the game game in question and see for themselves. \nBut this support guy keeps telling i was afk when i was in front of the screen the whole time\n\nany ideas on what i can do to take this further and report the guy?","replies":[{"poster":"Shishimato","date":"2016-09-13T23:31:09.499+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hana was the name of the support rep and ticket number is #23184146","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Mecha Hunter","date":"2016-03-16T08:16:45.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My account does not work, when I log in it say permeant banned and I was on holidays I never played on it and I don't who did can you help me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Only Heimer","date":"2015-08-23T08:01:51.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well what exactly is the issue with the employee? would need to know more details before recommending ombudsman or not. you need to keep in mind that this is a free game, and therefore their support service is a free service for a free game so you're not really a \"paying customer\" in that regard.","replies":[{"poster":"SuperFlous","date":"2015-08-23T11:54:43.670+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They refused to actually read the report in question and simply gave me a \"blanket\" response when it came to \"solving\" my issue, it had next to nothing to do with the issue i was reporting about, i replied as such and explained my report in a bit more detail, again, it wasn't read properly and it was brought to a player support specialist, once again the details and reasons behind the report were not read properly (as per previous and unrelated experience this happens ALOT) I then asked to speak to the specialist's manager to see if i could actually have contact to someone that would actually read what is being written instead of sending pre-written responses that only infuriate the user by leaving the issue un-solved and ignored completely by the so called support staff. As stated, i asked to speak to their manager and i quote:\n\n> Hello there,\n> \n> I'm sorry if you don't feel I am not genuine and gave you a blanketed response. :/\n> \n> We love hearing feedback, and it seemed your issue was with player reporting. I would be more than happy to speak with you.\n> \n> If you have any other questions or concerns please feel free to voice them here, otherwise we will have to consider this matter closed. I'm here to help and I apologize for any confusion regarding your ticket.\n\nYes, it is a free game, however there is a certain level of support they need to provide to both free and paying customers if they don't wish to have individuals like the local ombudsman breathing down their necks for negligence on their part, by paying i mean both monetary value in purchases made in the store and in emotional state paid by the infuriating circumstances that follow talking to a support staff who ignores the issue completely. This can be interpreted however, but this isn't the main issue here (the \"paying customer\", although i have paid for stuff in the store, this was to see if i would actually get a response from a RED or anyone Riot Staff related but it seems they care just about as much as support staff do about reputation and supporting users with issues)\n\nGetting the ombudsman involved is simply to be given contact with someone that will actually take into account what is being said instead of reading a single line and then sending pre-written crap as a response under the ruse of support. This would be the last resort if i don't get into contact with anyone prior to losing further patience.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-08-24T01:55:30.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm happy to look into this for you but I can't seem to find your ticket.
