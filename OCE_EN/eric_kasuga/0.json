The biggest issue the Singed has was he was playing in ranked.\n\n> It concerns me that when you have not allowed that type of game play\n\nIt was only partially Riot's decision, which a lot of people are misunderstanding. The players decide what they think is ok or not, and this player received a _staggering _ number of  reports.\n\n> it is understandable if the team is not happy and causes negative behaviour\n\nThing is that this was the case with this player. With a sub 50% winrate in support, he wasn't convincing anyone with just his words, and he was playing in ranked, where players are a lot less open to strange or out-there picks, hence the vast number of reports. In all likelihood, his unusual playstyle of leaving his ADC to fend for themselves and roaming the enemy jungle was something that most players in his games felt contributed to the loss, and for those that won, more than a few likely felt he was dead weight.\n\nYou have to consider the bias here of course, not all of those opinions are going to be fair or accurate, but the amount of reports he received means some of them certainly were. I'm sure you can see how this kind of stuff would create a negative environment.\n\n> needing to buy \"sight stone\" is necessary why?\n\nFrom a \"what can get me banned perspective\" it isn't, but from a \"he's really trying to win we swear\" perspective, a bit more so. Sightstone is more important than ever with ward limits and the inability to buy sight wards straight up, and vision is more important than ever with all the high mobility/roam potential champions we have been seeing a lot this season. \n\nYou could argue that you can support without it, but you cannot deny it is an incredible detriment to your team, and an active decision the Singed player has made. In a ranked environment, that doesn't really say \"I'm trying to win\" rather it speaks to \"I'm just here to have fun and play what I want, and I want to rpove it can be competitive but am not willing to compromise with my build or my team (in a team game) to do so\".\n\n___\n\nLike I said, his biggest problem was that he was playing in ranked, and as much as he or other people might say \"he's really trying to win\", his complete lack of compromise disputes that. Many people say to this, but his team needs to compromise too, and that is perfectly true HOWEVER, he is the one and they are the four, so he's gonna have to take that first step, not them. \n\nSinged has great roam potential, especially in this capacity, which means he could ward all those key spots and keep eyes on the enemy jungle and mid laner (if they're roaming). If he would just change one single item in his build he would be doing so much work for _his team_ and would be far less likely to invite so many reports.\n\nIf you were going into a ranked game and got given ADC as a role, maybe it's your off role and you can only play 2 or 3 ADCs confidently how would you feel? \n\n> **Ok he's playing Singed support**, it's sketchy and I don't trust it but ok maybe he knows what he's doing....even if he does have a sub 50% winrate. \n> \n> **Oh....he's going to leave me on my own in lane and roam the enemy jungle?** Well that really sucks, I play x and I really need the support presence, and the enemy is playing x, I REALLY need the support presence this is going to be really bad for me.\n> \n> **He's not even going to buy sightstone?** So now I have to sit under my turret the whole game, even if my lane isn't around...I can't roam, I can't push, I don't know if they're going to dive me. I'm officially useless this game.\n\n___\n\nYou see my point? He's not just removing the effect a traditional support has and replacing it with the effect his playstyle has, but he can with three simple decisions essentially take an entire other player out of the game. This is hardly going to have a positive impact on at the very least, his ADC. \n\nWhich funnily enough, has a very simple solution. Duo queue. With just one more decision added to that list, he effectively negates a vast amount of the negative impact he is having on his teams, because the ADC is not only ok with his playstyle, _they are equipped to play with it._\n\nYet still he chose to solo queue. Still he chose not to provide vision. Still he chose to leave his ADC whether they were ok with it or not. It's all well and good to consider the black and white \"he should be allowed to play his way\", but this is a team game, so it's not black and white, because his team also has that right.","replies":[]}]}
