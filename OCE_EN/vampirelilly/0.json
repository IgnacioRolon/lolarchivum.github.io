Brand is a support mid laner, Diana is a mid laner or a jungler, pantheon is a jungler and a top laner, twitch is an adc jungler, the list goes on, but pyke is simply a support support in a game with the off chance to be autofilled shouldn't I be able to play my main champion in other places then just support? Like maybe in the jungle {{sticker:sg-ezreal}} Which brings me to small adjustments we could make to make him semi viable in the jungle without making him overpowered as a support or make him into a solo laner (eg. top or mid laner) \r\n\r\nThe changes I'd recommend\r\n1. Make it so his grey health can proc off monsters (ONLY MONSTER AND NOT MINIONS) This could also not work on epic monsters, too stop it from being too effective\r\n2. Increase his attack speed  10% not a large amount just as much as the current attack speed micro runes give, too help him use Hunters machete \r\n3. NERF HIS ULT, I feel a large problem with pyke right now is he is SUPER SNOW BALLY, he literally get 2x the gold by killing one person with his ult, too make him a viable support assassin jungler he'd need this nerf or he'd be far too strong and just take over the game, revert his ult too what it used to be \r\n\r\nAs a pyke main I'd like to play one of my favorite champions somewhere else on the off times I've been auto-filled {{sticker:vlad-salute}}   \r\nSo basically with these changes it'll give him jungle sustain while not effecting him in lane (exception of the added attack speed) and if anything nerf his solo laning capabilities as he isn't getting his e dmg too minions back and its also weakening his ult, I think would be a cool interesting addition too him! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ãƒndy","date":"2020-01-09T10:41:53.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Watch one of mid beasts recent videos.
