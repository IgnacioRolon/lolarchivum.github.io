The other option could be to invest millions into Riot, buy your way in. But in reality the best way would be to make a new account, call it \"8 inches long xd\" and just play on that one. Seems quicker.\nIf you get that one banned, make a new account called \"7 inches long xd\", just chop an inch off each time for punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-25T04:49:16.346+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tyler1 never had any accounts unbanned. \n\nHis lifetime *player* ban was revoked because it was decided it didn't line up with Riot's fundamental goals for the punishment system, but he *never* regained access to any accounts that were previously perma-banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-01-25T04:51:21.792+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A ban will only ever be removed if it was made in error. If you feel it was applied incorrectly you can appeal the punishment through player support: https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nWhile I don't know the specifics of your punishment, it's worth noting that it doesn't matter who started it. If you continue it, you face punishment as well. Like the age-old adage \"two wrongs don't make a right\".","replies":[]}]}
