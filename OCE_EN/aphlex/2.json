I like playing League really competitive as it strives me to learn more mechanics. I&#039;m rarely to be seen toxic and always love to work with a full team rather than playing solo que.\r\n\r\nAnyways, My IGN is Aphlex and I main Mid. I play a large variety of champion for any situations. But the main champs I play in SoloQ are {{champion:103}} {{champion:268}} {{champion:91}} {{champion:157}} \r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll be a great option for your team :)","replies":[{"poster":"Aphlex","date":"2016-01-08T22:29:44.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bumb","replies":[]}]}
