Any position is available though we have no need for set positions. This will depend on what everyone feels like playing on any given match. Skype or Steam is necessary for communication and voice chat. \r\n\r\nPS. There will be some profanity when voice chatting but that should already be the norm :)","replies":[{"poster":"JackOffAllTrades","date":"2015-10-07T00:47:00.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PLat 1 im interested in having fun and chilling HeadbutPulverize add me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Pagoe","date":"2015-10-06T21:18:17.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey, i'm gold 5 and play mid, i'd be happy to join, feel free to add me -Pagoe","replies":[]},{"poster":"A W00KIE","date":"2015-10-06T08:46:55.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IGN: A W00KIE (try both zero's and o's, I've had problems in the past..)\nRole: Can play all, but would prefer Jungle.\nIssues: I can only Skype every 2nd week due to internet problems...\nAdd me if interested :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"EndlesschocxD","date":"2015-10-06T07:55:21.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"add me my IGN is EndlesschocXD im 19 and i have skype and can give that to you if i am recruited,\ncheers","replies":[]}]}
