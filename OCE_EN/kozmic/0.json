Has anyone else been experiencing any bad lag spikes/random disconnects in game? In the 7 games i played last night + today, 4 of them i&#039;ve randomly disconnected, then had to close the client, relaunch and then load back into the game. This is becoming annoying and i was wondering whether anyone else had been experiancing the same thing","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-11T12:37:44.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey KozMic,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you're encountering connection issues to the League of Legends servers.
