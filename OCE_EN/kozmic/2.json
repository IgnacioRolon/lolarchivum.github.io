Like i mean dead opposite. It also happened with a Lucian who was in my game today except it was with his ult. If i had footage i would but i have no recording program. So was just wondering if anyone else was experiencing this?\nAlso tfw no spaghetti icon\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}\n\n\nEdit: Have also now experienced it with Elise E","replies":[{"poster":"Groterood","date":"2016-08-26T20:38:04.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's because your cursor was accidentally on your HUD when you cast the ability. You can also put your cursor on an ally's icon to cast abilities in their direction. I never noticed this before and It's probably because of this bugfix in patch 6.17:\n\n> Fixed a bug where attempting to use the minimap to select a target for a long-range targeted ability (ex. Teleport) could instead target a unit hidden underneath the minimap if the cursor happened to be hovering over that unit\n\nAt least give us the ability to disable it in the settings. It's really annoying when you're in the heat of a battle and you cast your skillshot in the opposite direction -_-","replies":[]}]}
