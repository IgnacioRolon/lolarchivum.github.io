This started happening about two weeks ago and the problem does not seem to have fixed itself with the recent patch. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, my game crashed twice in a row which resulted in my first set of low priority queue games (10 min wait). After that happened I followed all the steps suggested by Riot if experiencing game crashes for Mac clients. It seemed to work, as all my five low priority queue games had no problems. My first game after finishing these five games crashes at the usual time (in the first 2-5 minutes), and I am set into another series of low priority queue games waiting for 20 minutes. \r\n\r\nFor all the games that have crashed, I have always attempted to rejoin the match, and often turned it around  to win, yet I am still being punished for something outside of my control. In addition, I have experienced trouble rejoining matches, and often by the time I reach 90-100% on the load screen, the client seems to think my computer has disconnected itself from the internet (which isn&#039;t the case). I then sit through another load screen before I can rejoin the match. \r\n\r\nI am growing tired of these problems which seem to be with the client itself, as I have taken all measures  suggested by Riot to counteract the problem of game crashes. Are there any other suggestions on how to avoid game crashes on a Mac client?","replies":[{"poster":"Honorius91","date":"2015-03-29T23:33:25.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No bugsplat, it becomes completely unresponsive and I have to either force quit or restart my computer. I have reset the NVRAM and System Management Controller and repaired corrupted game files. My system has been updated automatically so I would assume the graphics drivers are updated, though I might have to look into this, cheers.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-02T06:14:39.151+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please use the \"Reply\" feature of the boards, because if you don't, I won't get notified of your response.
