So basically the rework gutted her Q and buffed her cougar abilities, from this, arose top lane tri force ad nidalee, although it had been done before it was basically the only way to play her now as her spear was so weak. Realising that this was cancerous and broken they buffed her spear a ton and stripped her cougar back slightly, now what we have is AP spear spam nid once again, she is essentially identical what she was pre rework except now instead of needing to hit 2 spears to kill someone from 100 she only has to hit one then she can commando leap half way across a lean to finish them if they are 50% or less hp.\n\nAm I the only one confused as to why her spears are almost doing identical damage now to what they did pre rework? her spears can 50% hp bars easily now and tanking one at max range means you&#039;re out of the fight. This was THE REASON SHE WAS REWORKED.\n\nPersonally if I was Riot I'd just delete nidalee as I don&#039;t value her existence and haven&#039;t since Season 2. Are people finding her AP spears are just as cancerous as ever? sure Dodging them is easy in lane, but it&#039;s over the wall spears in sieging that become a problem, they spend the majority of their travel time in terrain and have essentially no time to react, and if Nidalee throws enough spears shes going to hit someone eventually.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T10:05:18.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Her spears only half health at near max range.\n\nAlso cancel her spears over walls with WARDS.","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-03-28T10:16:16.148+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol alex ich is playing nid now, showcasing how shes nothing but a spear bot. she needs another rework, she can't exist in ap form as anything other then a spear bot as the rest of her kit isn't good enough to justify her viability, her spears will easily 60% hp an adc btw at max range if not more, http://www.twitch.tv/alexich","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-28T10:17:59.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I play nidalee, she is more then a spear bot, sure she needs to hit one for a mark, but a good nidalee uses cougar form just as much as her human form.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention she is fucked with where the meta is heading, Sejuani and co of tank junglers and full tank top laners coming back in means nidalee only has 2 targets she can hit with spears that does anything, and for both of them she can't actually dive them cause the tanks will screw her.","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-03-28T10:21:37.368+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mAEtA4mc,comment-id=000000000000,timestamp=2015-03-28T10:17:59.185+0000)\n>\n> I play nidalee,","replies":[{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-03-28T10:52:55.596+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You are cancer on this game.
