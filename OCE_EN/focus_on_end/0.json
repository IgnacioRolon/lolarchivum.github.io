Turkey and Brazil are clearly better than us, and look how long Brazil has been trying to get taken seriously... huehuehue.\n\nAnd btw, the only reason Oce pro scene get a salary pay in this shtty OPL that no one watched is because Riot knows that having a pro scene in oce will draw a lot more people to their game and the small salary they pay these pros (it&#039;s probably near nothing) is all made back in profit from the people addicted to the idea of becoming pro. (They just use the pro scene as advertising for their game, instead of paying for ad&#039;s they pay some kids to play at &#039;pro&#039; level and it has a better affect then in your face shameless advertising since it makes people think Good Guy Riot supporting pro scene.\n\n~Sincerely Only Corki the God","replies":[{"poster":"Fruitsalad","date":"2015-04-25T03:11:46.957+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"I remember \"only corki\"\n\nhe was the guy who had a boosted account in plat.. was too shit to maintain it so he played and streamed on his silver account which he also sucked balls playing, used to talk himself up on his stream like he was a god then gets put in the dumpster and tries and play it off LOL.. was such a dip $hit","replies":[{"poster":"Focus On End","date":"2015-04-25T03:47:00.914+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":5,"body":"Boosted wut? im plat 2 now 90 lp, i got demoted to gold v for start of season 5 and rose to plat 1 with ease, are u on drugs?
