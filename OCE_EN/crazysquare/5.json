Basic attacks also make the enemy go back to the position they were in very shortly ago.\r\n\r\nLaser of Pulverization Q: Creates a two sides of a portal and then you send a laser through it, and the laser damages all the enemies it hits. (You can choose where they go but they must be both near you and you need to be near one side to send a laser through it)\r\n\r\nPortal&#039;s Gift W: Makes a portal that spits out a gift  for you or an ally that&#039;s a weapon for a while. (you or the ally chooses the gift)\r\n\r\n\r\nBow and Arrow: If melee, you can use ranged basic attacks. If ranged, you get faster attack speed.\r\n\r\nSword: If melee, your basic attacks do extra damage. If ranged, you get melee basic attacks BUT you do even more extra damage than melees do picking Sword.\r\n\r\nStaff: Grants extra mana and extra AP. This isn&#039;t an option if the champion doesn&#039;t have mana.\r\n\r\n\r\nTeleport E: Select a nearby ally or enemy and you can teleport him/her/it/yourself through a portal to a nearby location.\r\n\r\nPortal of Mystery R: Creates a two sided portal anywhere on the map for a few seconds which anyone can enter. If an enemy uses a ability through the portal, the ability will then act as if it is an ally&#039;s ability. For example, if a enemy Braum uses his Q through the portal and there is another enemy on the other side, the enemy will take damage, will be slower and it will activate a quarter of Braum&#039;s passive.","replies":[]}
