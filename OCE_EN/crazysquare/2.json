If you die you turn into Quiver again. But you will not receive their items or level, but you will take their masteries and spells. \n\nQ: Spits out a snowball, damaging and slowing the first enemy it hits.\n\nW: It dashes into an enemy, damaging and stunning them, then dashes into them again from the other side doing more damage. By the time he dashes the second time the enemy&#039;s stun is over. If used on an ally, it does the same thing but heals them twice instead of damage. Both do physical damage. If it hits and enemy, you get extra movement speed, if used on an ally, the ally gets movement speed\n\nE: The next hit that an ally takes will not do any damage, and the person that was trying to attack your ally will take the damage instead.\n\nR: Similar to Ivern&#039;s Ult, Quiver will create a clone of a chosen ally and it will attack whoever you click R on. It will be exactly like that ally, same build, same level, everything. It will also use abilities however the bot chooses to, and will be smart by avoiding turrets, abilities, etc, like a bot. If the ally levels up or buys more items during the clone is up, it won&#039;t effect the clone. Eventually the clone will disappear or die.\n\nExtra Info:\nPrimary role: Support\nSecondary role: Assassin\n\nAttack: XXXX\nDefense: XXX\nMagic: X\nDifficulty: XXXXX \nMelee\n\nDesign:\nA pure white cat, with ice coming from his whiskers, transforming by freezing and then appearing in the shape of the champion. \n\nSkins:\nPool Party: will be scared of its own water attacks and the water coming from its whiskers. Transforms by making a huge wave come, trying to run, but when it hits her he comes out as the champion. Spits out a balloon filled with water instead of a snowball.\nJungle: yellow and black stripes like a tiger, and instead of white fire there are vines from its whiskers. Transform by wrapping itself in the vines then comes out as the champion. Instead of spitting out a snowball, she roars. The roars look like a bunch of &gt; symbols.\nFire: pure orange cat, with fire coming from its whiskers. Transforms by melting, turning into orange goo, takes the formation of the champion but pure orange, then turns colorful again. Spits out a fireball instead of a snowball.\nGlitch: like normal skin, but instead of ice it has 0&#039;s and 1&#039;s coming from his whiskers. He transforms by glitching out. Instead of spitting out a snowball it spits out more 0&#039;s and 1&#039;s.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered Fate","date":"2016-10-30T00:13:10.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They should actually put that in League of legends!!!!!!\nHey why not have more busted asf champions, dude this is the most braindead champion idea i've ever saw.\nits also a boring asf champion that would take 0 skill.\nHey guys lets make a champion transform into another champion that uses their abilities.\n2 Karthus? fun!!! 2 Yasuo Fun!!!!!!!!!!! 2 Zeds fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 Lissandra fun!!!!!!!!!!! 2 annies and 2 tibbers fun!!!! \n2 iverns and 2 daisy's fun!!!!!!! \n{{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} ","replies":[{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-11-01T10:52:45.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It would probably be one of the hardest champs to master, because you need to learn how to use each champ you transform into!","replies":[]},{"poster":"surferfijio","date":"2016-10-30T15:10:12.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Baileyballs,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=6Zb2II39,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-10-30T00:13:10.610+0000)\n>\n> They should actually put that in League of legends!!!!!!\n> Hey why not have more busted asf champions, dude this is the most braindead champion idea i&#x27;ve ever saw.\n> its also a boring asf champion that would take 0 skill.\n> Hey guys lets make a champion transform into another champion that uses their abilities.\n> 2 Karthus? fun!!! 2 Yasuo Fun!!!!!!!!!!! 2 Zeds fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 Lissandra fun!!!!!!!!!!! 2 annies and 2 tibbers fun!!!! \n> 2 iverns and 2 daisy&#x27;s fun!!!!!!! \n> {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:157}}\n\nyour a retard. :) you go around on forums and make troll comments. i thought the idea was nice champion sounds cool {{champion:112}} head","replies":[]}]}]}
