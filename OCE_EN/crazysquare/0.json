W will be your damaging ability by shooting minions, and after a possibly weak Q and two hits use W so you can eat a enemy. I&#039;m saying this because I see many guides saying to level Q first.\r\n\r\n Also, with his R, when and where would you use it? It seems very situational, maybe to get to lane faster or help another lane, but that&#039;s all I use it for.\r\n\r\nPlease answer my question about my ultimate and why it might be best to level Q first.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-04T12:09:52.201+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not a Tahm player, but he is one of the main supports my friend uses when he supports my Kalista. He maxes Q first too.\n\nMy guess would be that Q is your most reliable poke, and it scales quite heavily when you level it up. It also has a much shorter cooldown than the W, so even though your W is more useful, and does a lot of damage when you eat someone, you probably get more damage overall damage by maxing Q (as you'll be hitting the enemy more often with Q than W. Even if you're spitting minions, you are still going to hit Q more times then W.) Q also costs less mana, so you want to use it more than W, and theres no point maxing an ability that you don't use as much.\n\nWith his R, my friend uses it when we both go back, we let the enemy push up to our tower, and then he ults both me and him behind them.\nBut if we are in a losing lane, and we both need to buy, but we cant leave lane, we will go B and then he will ult us back to our tower (so its like a free shop basically)\n\nIn the late game, my friend uses R to get people (Usually me) into fights.\nFor example, ill be farming bot, and he will be with me at all times (as is customary with Kalista), then if it looks like the team is about to fight he will ult me straight into position in the fight. This makes for good split pushing, like TF and Shen.\nIts also good during an ACE, he will ult right into their base and he will tank the tower while I take it down. (this means we dont waste time, pushing minions up)\n\ni hope all that helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-12-04T23:46:32.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But I find it's more fun to max W first because you can easily eat your ally when he/she takes damage since you're a tank, if a enemy comes close Q then W them, and spit minions for poke.

His Q is used to harass or help stun an enemy to secure the kill for your adc or yourself (if your playing top/jg).  Im not too sure but his Q has less mana expense than W.\n\n(just talking in the sense of support role, since I play him in support)\n\nHis W, the very important and threat in his kit, it can help saved allies or catch your foes. However the cons are that it has a very long CD in the waning phases unless you get CD items otherwise it has a very long CD. Because his W CD is very long, it must be used carefully, using it prematurely will either get your ally killed when the enemy ganks or missed out on a opportunity kill.\n\n(As a support I tend to not use my W as often, as I would use it to save my ADC)\n\nAlso because you want to trade your enemy either by equal or out-trade your enemy, you would level your q, as melee the laner (say a ADC) could kite you down. Its a good ability to poke while staying at a safe distance.\n\nAs always try to out-trade your enemy rather them out-trading you.\n\nFor his ult, when and where would you use it?\n\nDepending on the situation during either mid/late game, you can either use it to get away unless they have some sort of CC to stop your ult, to flank the enemy, I wouldn't use my ult to get to lane faster since first point into his ult is very very short. \n\nMaybe use it on lanes who have potential wins over a lane if the laner is in a stalemate.\n\n(I also don't use his ult as often when it comes to first - second skill point put into his ult)","replies":[{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-12-07T10:17:32.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ty!

IF you want to be aggro and passive then Q and E.\n\nI think that it is best to put points into skills that you would be using more often like Q and E or Q+W.  \n\nThen again, you would want to max out an ability first, prob max out Q -1st then W as tahm kench E scales off the missing health which can be used as a shield or recover some health.\n\nIF your playing aggro then Q+W, Passive Q+E.\n\nPlaying against a high-burst ADC then Q+E is the way to go, they chop down a chunk of your health, you can choose to recover some health or get a shield and go in. \n\nAlways level Q up since it is tam-kench's main source of damage, coming second is his W.
