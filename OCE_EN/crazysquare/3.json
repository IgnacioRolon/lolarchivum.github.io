I want to decide my main early, and I found {{champion:267}}Nami really fun to play as (but she is pretty hard to play as) and she really suited my play style, mostly magic, second attack, last defense. And her abilities cover pretty much any magic ability I think I would need, Bubble to stun and to attack multiple enemies, Ebb and Flow to deal nice damage and heal, Tidecaller&#039;s Blessing to increase my own or a teammate&#039;s attack and Tidal Wave pretty much to deal damage and slow any enemies and heal all allies in front of me.\r\n\r\nBut some people say she is bad, hardly ever used (which is actually true, but I like using a uncommon class, or in this case, champion) and can&#039;t land Bubble or Tidal Wave. What should I do? Should I main her or should I keep looking for a good support (I want to be a support class)? I enjoy a challenge too, and maybe if I get good enough at her, I can do beat a lot of champions. I know, I can change whenever I want, but I want to get pretty good with one champion as soon as possible so I can get good at the game itself. Thank you for helping me on this decision. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Skouriasmenos","date":"2016-10-21T11:27:24.851+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrazySquare,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=fMWKtPJc,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-10-21T11:02:24.677+0000)\n>\n> But some people say she is bad, hardly ever used\n\nyou should try and play whatever you like, as long as you get good enough to play it ... **what \"some people say\" is irrelevant if you can hold your part of the deal within the game** ... \n\nfor example I play malphite support (which most people say that sucks) and sejuani support (which noone believes that it is even a valid pick and call it borderline trollpick), but I make them work within the level of play that I belong ... I even dabble with galio support (in ranked) or even irelia support (in normals) ... \n\nare they meta picks .?. No ...\ndo other people say they are at least good picks .?. No ... \nbut do they work .?. **Yes, and that is what counts** ... \n\nso, by all means, main nami ... it is a champion that can get you quite far if you master her, so why not .?. :)","replies":[{"poster":"CrazySquare","date":"2016-10-21T11:42:43.274+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much!

Part of the reason why i picked up Renekton was because he was played by skt1 last year at worlds. Now of course i know he is out of meta a little but still the point stands, as well as champs that i play like poppy and kennen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tempered Fate","date":"2016-10-30T00:22:54.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play bard dude!!!!!!! {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} {{champion:432}} \nI think he really suites your play style!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tomo7182","date":"2016-10-22T02:54:40.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The downside to nami is she is extremely squishy in lane so playing her verse the current jhin zyra meta is really bad (most zyra's rush guise) she doesn't offer much damage and lacks a gap closer.\n\nBasicly of you get cc'd as nami your pretty dead and also looking into the pre-season assassian changes I honestly don't think nami will be that good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Taze","date":"2016-10-21T12:07:51.659+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there!\n\nI have mained nami from b3-p1. This season/last season. \n\nI think a lot of people will say that she probably is not the best pick due to her bubble being slow (Its pretty easy to doge in laning phase) and her ult has a bit of a wind up (If missed its pretty bad!)\n\nThat being said she is truly one my favourite champions. \n\nI recommend, meta comes and go but if you are really good at a champion it wont really matter about meta to much. Pick a main that you are going to love and enjoy! I have had people call nami op after playing her but  she really isn't. I have honestly played her to much. \n\nShe can be a lot of fun! I do recommend to also have back tank as Nami doesn't also go well into things like bard/zyra. \n\nGood Luck Summoner!","replies":[]}]}
