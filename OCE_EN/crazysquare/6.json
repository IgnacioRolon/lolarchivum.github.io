He searched for the temple and found it, but soon, he fell in a trap and was electrocuted. He was paralyzed and couldn&#039;t move, until he died of thirst. He came back as a ghost as haunted his own body that had become so old that it seemed like a statue. He was able to quickly drag his body out of the temple and, as a ghost, he could do anything. He never died, could control anything and could see everything. He went to the nearest population, and entered League of Legends to earn gold for his tribe in the woods.\r\n\r\nPassive: \r\nQ: Swap your defense stat with your magic stat for 10 seconds\r\nW: Pulls nearby enemies toward you for 1 second, then they become a statue take damage and are stunned for 2 seconds, \r\nE: Joshua&#039;s ghost picks up the statue and pounces it on the ground dealing damage to nearby enemies.\r\nR:This ultimate can be used anywhere on the map, even if dead. If used on an enemy, they a turn into a statue and is stunned, doesn&#039;t do damage or anything else. If used on an ally, Joshua leaves its statue if alive and enters an enemy&#039;s body, turning them into a statue, but they are not stunned and they get a lot of extra defense. During that time, you can&#039;t control either your body or their body, but whenever you want to you can leave their body and go back to controlling yourself, because it costs mana the longer you stay in their body.","replies":[]}
