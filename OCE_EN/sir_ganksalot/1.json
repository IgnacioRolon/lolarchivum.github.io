He can actually duel about every aa based bruiser melee champ that WAS designed to counter adc's. The fact that a Tryndamere with 340 AD, 100% crit strike has to actually blow summoners AND ult even when Graves was caught out is an obvious sign that this champion needs a serious nerf. Although, I will admit the idea of Graves having an actual shotgun is awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"AxeRaider","date":"2015-11-11T18:59:28.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well its a good thing that graves isn't and adc anymore, hence why the standard adc counters cant deal with him. Reasons he isnt an adc. 1. Scaling magic resist, 2. a skill that give up to 120 armour and magic resist with full stacks, 3. an attack speed cap of 0.9, 4.auto attack range 425 and blockable by minions urgot is only other adc with 425 range but he's rarely seen and can use his tracking missles to get a much larger effective range. Also broken champs in preseason is kind of a given.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Far King Penguin","date":"2015-11-12T08:48:49.365+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just played a game with Graves mid-lane. Everyone on my team got fed except for our mid-laner who got totally destroyed. All 5 of my team went in on a half health Graves and he got a penta-kill. If a fed swain, lee sin jinx and a relatively fed blitzcrank combined with a nidalee cant kill a champion who was caught out by himself with half hp, something is wrong. There was simply nothing we could do.","replies":[{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2015-11-12T09:39:23.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how fed did the nidalee get him?","replies":[{"poster":"Far King Penguin","date":"2015-11-13T02:40:14.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he had 8 kills and 100 cs","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2015-11-12T09:39:37.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ummmm, i dont know how to say this but graves is on free week, that is the only reason you are constantly seeing him, it is the marksmen update and a free week marksman is the best most people can do if they have had little earlier interaction with the role","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrMunstr","date":"2015-11-12T01:58:37.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Definitely need to release a hotfix-nerf,  {{champion:104}}  **Graves** is the new star of League nightmares {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}} .","replies":[]}]}
