I can see how healing on her Q is a pretty good way to sort the good Soraka's from the bad but i cant get over how stupid it is if its a good Soraka. It's so vastly overpowered and consistent compared to other shielding and healing champions in the game.\r\n\r\nI would suggest something like a targeted Q on herself to heal for less than she currently gets on hitting champions and remove the on hit heal on champions, or change it so it gives less healing than at present. Really something needs to change so that she needs to sacrifice harass to stay healthy, it just seems so crazy that she trades to heal and heals a lot!\r\n\r\nand lets not even get started on how dumb she is in aram... i might puke. seriously though, disable her in aram that shit is as broken as anything i have ever seen in this game.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nmugsy","replies":[{"poster":"TehFoxx","date":"2014-12-15T17:47:29.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She's broken? i would say she's more bad(new raka sucks) & that heal isn't much & it's really easy to dodge as it's too slow if anything her starcall needs to be faster","replies":[{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2014-12-16T05:18:31.736+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bit slow yes... but quite large and I find it fairly easy to land a hit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wiggy","date":"2014-12-15T14:34:37.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you know what's broken? your ability to dodge consecutive aoe skill-shots.\n\ngit gud.","replies":[{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2014-12-16T05:14:14.303+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"is this supposed to contribute to the conversation in some way?\n\nI don't understand why you are here, please go and play Call of Duty.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2014-12-15T11:39:17.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Punish her.

I played her for ranking and I have managed to get up to bronze 1 with her. I love her character and her role to heal and give support for the team. But she is seriously missing the edge what could make her  a real champion. She is good to play a normal game and have fun but when its come to a little more serious play 99 % of the others out weight her. my support kills are good high number and my healing the others is high too when I check the statistics at the end of a game but I feel its still not strong enough to make a real difference. My feeling she will slowly sink in to the void and people only will play her for curiosity not for real. I hope changes will come to her character and she gets stronger either with her magic or with her armor. C U at Summoner`s Rift .
