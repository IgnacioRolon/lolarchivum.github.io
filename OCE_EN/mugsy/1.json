The stuggle begins in plat 2 and extends to plat 1 and diamond 5. Most Diamonds don't care if they win because they have achieved realistically the highest rewards they can, so they will first time galio. The plats are so toxic because they have the dream that they can make it into diamond and any little mistake ends up in crucifixion. Then once you pass this hell you end up in diamond 4 where in the early hours its not uncommon for you to end up against master and challenger players in ranked as d4 is the top 1000 players on this server.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-15T03:09:02.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've noticed.
