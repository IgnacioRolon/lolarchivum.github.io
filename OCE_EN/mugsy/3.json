It's a trap!","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"I have been playing league for a long time now with a friend of mine, I&#039;m getting better and he is not. This season I had bad placements and got bronze 4 or 5.\r\n\r\nAngry with that I proceeded to win game after game with some good carry performances and some luck. Even managed a 13 or 14 game win streak along the way to leaving bronze in a hurry.\r\n\r\nDuring this time I duo&#039;d with my friend and won him his first three placements. After a while he started to finish his placements. All losses, and tonight he lost a 70 minute 700 MMR game. \r\n\r\nIs this my fault for dragging his MMR up so he is matched with people he can&#039;t beat? And how does the matching work now that I have more than double his estimated MMR, if we duo again how does it affect my LP gains and losses. \r\n\r\nLol... And as I climb towards gold, at what point can I refuse to duo without feeling guilty haha... Because if there was a division below bronze, he would be in it.","replies":[{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-06-25T03:37:47.512+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about your assumptions about the MMR system. I had instances where I was winning 5 or 6 games in a row and my estimated MMR was still going down even though there was no losing streak.\n\nI can't begin to assume that I know anything about the system, but I cant believe that the system would punish me for example for losing 3 games in a row while still managing a 6.67 kda. like I am getting some losing games with champion mastery S- and A+ when the team as a whole loses by 30 kills (sometimes when I am ahead enough of my opposite I can turn a game like this around, 15 or more kills is a lot of gold and often I just do my best and its not enough). Is the system not intelligent enough to rate performance like this and only rates win or loss?\n\nI suppose he plays as much as I do, though I have been playing a lot less the last few weeks as my wife and I are expecting a baby any day now, but I have made a concerted effort to try and improve my in game decisions and my attitude when I do get to play and I continue to improve... and he just plays norms with minecraft running in the background.\n\nI want to play more ranked and he keeps inviting me to games. I still like playing the game with my friend but its certainly no longer practical for ranked when I can't see him getting out of bronze 5 :'(\n\nPerhaps I can level another account and use it purely for duo. I suppose I could try and get him out of bronze haha.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-23T20:22:22.429+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does he play as much as you? I wonder why he isn't picking up the game as quickly as you are :o \n\nIf he lost a 700 MMR game then its not your fault. No matter how much you would've increased his mmr with duo games, he would lose them anyways. Also when you duo then you do get matched against slightly better opponents from what ive heard. This is because you and your friend can communicate which can give you an advantage over the other team, but your opponents are only slightly better than usual. \n\nThe ranking works like this now, if you play duo with him and lose, you'd lose a lot of LP and for wins, you'd gain less because you're overall being matched with easier players. Him on the other hand, if you carried the game and made him win, then he'd gain huge LP for each win and lose hardly anything for each loss. This is coz the players he's going against are really tough for him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Teletubbies","date":"2015-06-23T17:25:47.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think your previous games with him will have a big impact on his solo gameplay. After all, you only won 3 games for him, so I don't think that you are responsible for his 700mmr game loss :l Although there is a possibility that your duo has affected his mmr a sligh bit, but it is very unlikely since you were in the roughly same divisions. MMR lose and gain is very simple, if you are on a winning streak you will gain more LP, the best thing you can aim for is having mmr a lot higher than the one estimated for your division, you can check your mmr on op.gg, if your mmr is high enough you might skip one division and go straight from Silver 3 to Silver 1, without the struggle of climbing through S2. Pretty much same system works for the losing of LP, if you keep losing games the amount of lost LP will be slightly increased. Imagine it like that.\n\n\nYou have a line in the middle like this one: | this is the neutral line and you can go two directions, minus LP and plus LP if you lose a game your line grows towards minus and vice versa, if your line on minus is longer then you will lose more LP than you gain and this is often refered to as Elo Hell, this will continue to happen until you balance it out by winning enough games. \n\n    Starting point:                                 |\n    Lost Game:                                     -|\n    Massive losing streak omg rito fix matchmaking plox:                       - - - - - - - - |\n   ^ at this point the amount of LP you lose is greater than amount of LP you gain and people complain because \"elo hell\" btw there is no such thing...\n   BUT as soon as you start losing the games your minus \"line\" will start to grow smaller.\n   \n  1 won game: - - - - - - - | and your minus line went from 8 to 7 and it will continue to do so in this pattern, the \"plus side\" will not grow until there is nothing on minus side.\n\n\n*PLEASE NOTE*\nI only gave an educated guess based on my previous experiences, my prediction can be totally wrong and the values might not be the same as seen above, what that means is: If you are on 8 losing streak and you win a game you might lose 2 or even more lines from your minus side, the values given are just estimates that you should not rely on, this is just a little sketch of my thoughts about so called \"elo\" and lp gain.\n\nIf you have any further doubts or need more assistance please feel free to reply to my comment and I will be more than glad to provide you with help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zaconator","date":"2015-06-23T17:14:39.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Make it to gold so you aren't able to duo with him anymore would be my best advice \nAlso congrats on your quick climb","replies":[]}]}
