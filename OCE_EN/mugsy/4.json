Swap positions in the list like swapping champions in aram.\nStep 2. Wait you mean its that easy?!\nNote: should be able to be done at any time (including ban phase for player in first slot) as long as you have not picked and if you have a ban you take it with you. easy peasy, might need some restrictions based on pick timer. would work well if everyone got pick intent first?\n\nOption 2 - your pick\nStep 1. Select the Summoner who will take your pick slot.\nStep 2. Allied summoner gets a yes or no choice to take their pick now.\nStep 3. Allied summoner picks their champion and you trade places with them in the pick order.\n\nOption 3 - pick trade\nStep 1. Select the Summoner for pick trade.\nStep 2. Allied summoner gets a yes or no choice to allow the pick trade.\nStep 3. Allied summoner picks champion and it is locked into your slot.\nStep 4. When allied summoner pick comes up you choose and lock your champion in their slot.\nStep 5. Champions are automatically traded at the start of the trade phase.\nNote: there is no need to be able to cancel this one as the risk of trolling is minimal, you get to pick your own champion after all.\n\nCheers,\nmugsy","replies":[{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-11-19T05:21:07.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thought I would edit this and put most of the post there... as most people probably wont bother going to the NA boards.\n\nhere is the original post/link\nMy post on the NA boards about a pick phase trading system in champ select.\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/skin-champion-concepts/MEEsOVLs-new-champion-select-pick-with-your-team\n\nCheers,\nmugsy","replies":[]}]}
