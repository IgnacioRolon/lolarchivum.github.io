But I see little benefit when there is no clue of matchups. people in OCE in lower ranks just don&#039;t understand putting the team together properly because we never get the opportunity to practise a REAL game.\r\n\r\nThe Normal Blind Pick queue is no better than ARAM and I get very salty when I end up with a matchup I would NEVER have opted into depending on pick and bans. There is just no opportunity to pick or counter.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-15T10:24:07.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I veto this and say we should get a permanent Twisted Treeline queue. Reducing the amount of people needed from ten to six will surely have a higher concentration of games being made than there is now.\n\nAlso, this probably doesn't belong on this board.

NA) but in a server with a small player pool it takes far too long to find anyone, let alone a whole team, i know it might seem like a down grade to an older version of lol but it genuinely worked better for the oce server","replies":[]}]}
