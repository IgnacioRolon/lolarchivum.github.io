With all the other quality of life fixes that have been given to a couple of champions recently I thought it was worth the post, because really who even looks at the QoL icons they added... changing this would actually do something that has significant impact in only certain situations without changing your thinking.\n\nedit : ok so the other champion with an ulti of similar use is nunu but I don't know off hand if he suffers from accidental cancelling\n","replies":[{"poster":"mugsy","date":"2015-06-11T01:32:57.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol really? there cant be only 4 of us that have mucked up an AoE ulti.\n\nI really think there is great benefit in not cancelling these ultis on click.\nI would make using them feel a lot more natural.","replies":[]}]}
