But recently playing against a Fora in quite a few of my games tonight, I have to ask, why is an assassin allowed the kit that she has? If she does have a weakness, please enlighten me, but for all my mere silver eyes can see, she has none. Healing, slows, atk slows, true damage, and I&#039;m talking monstrous amounts, dashes on low CDs as well as an ability that returns stuns and blocks everything for a time. \n\nI would very much like to know peoples&#039; thoughts on the current situation. If this is balanced at the pro level, then that&#039;s fantastic, but 99% of LoL players aren&#039;t pro, and when a champ can be abused that much, I feel something needs to be done.","replies":[{"poster":"Atlus","date":"2015-09-10T02:46:28.685+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know what you mean man! Fiora can be a beast. Honestly though there's a big difference between a good Fiora and one that can be taken advantage of.\n\nOne thing you can do is play champions that can match her early game, something like Renekton (who outsustains and bully's in lane) or Darius... for reasons.\nYou then just play the 'bait the riposte' minigame. Get her to use it on a basic attack or non-CC spell then go ham!\nBasically if you play something that will get beefy in the late-game you'll also be more relevant than the squishy Fiora, just remember to put a target on her head and don't let her get a free pick to start the fight, that heal is nasty!\n\nI found playing as her for a few games really gave me an idea of her weaknesses also so maybe hop in a few normals and try her out =)","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2015-09-10T03:13:53.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"She also has somewhat medium-high mana costs too.\nSo if she just uses abilities left right and center, eventually you can go in, and she wont be able to cast anything.\n\nAlso you know exactly where she is going to attack *hint* - Your vulnerable spot.\nSo move between minions so when she dahses, she might accidentally hit a minion instead.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-09-10T04:34:27.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I could be wrong about this but Fiora gets a lot of power if shes able to hit Vitals, if you get a vital that the enemy Fiora can easily hit you can move into the brush to reset your vital (idk if this works) so she has to put herself in a dangerous position to hit it, potentially setting herself up for a gank.\n\nAlso early game Fiora has massive cooldowns early game, she has a lot of early game power but her long cooldowns give her a decent sized window of vulnerability.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BadMrFrostie","date":"2015-09-10T02:34:50.775+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riots take on the new champion kits is just ban them...\n\n Ban = counterplay...\n\n I saw a bronze Fiora easily destroy a normal against plats and golds last night despite losing lane... Please don't tell me she is hard to play, when you have an overloaded kit like that it is pretty forgiving.\n\n**Note the Fioras team still lost, but she got fed as fuck in a situation any other champ would have had trouble performing**","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-10T04:56:02.329+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well she is only good as an assassin if she gets ahead, if she doesn't she will get smushed as assassin, she is better as a bruiser sort of thing now, still squishing everything, while being tanky. \n\nAnyway, a solid way to leech some of her power off is to move out of her champion sight range to reset her passive, so if its directly in front of her, going backwards to reset it to the side or behind helps a lot, just try to keep the mark opposite of her position and then she has no sustain and her actual damage goes down the drain, she mainly deals true damage more than anything now. I you look at the damage she does late game she is like 75% true then the rest is physical and magic. But early game getting a cloth armor or dorans makes things easier. (cloth reduces all early damage except for the low early passive damage, while dorans reduces it all by 8 while giving a little healing and hp back to you) Also, don't let her engage you with her ult, if she ults you, just try and hide to wait it out","replies":[]},{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-09-10T00:07:18.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Her weakness is that she is actually difficult to play, especially early game, this is because her new skill is very skill shot related and requires some skill to pop her passive. Her ult is also hard to land in a 1v1 sitution, as you gotta hit all 4 of those vital things before the heal. In my opinion, she is only OP late game :p","replies":[]}]}
