I would like to be able to check which game mode is going to be active at specific times. It would help people like me, who are getting bored with regular League not miss out on the game modes we actually like.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-03-25T00:58:35.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be clear, the RGM is still fully active, there's just no announcements about the current and forthcoming modes as there was last year. Part of the reason for this might be to do with Riot's announcement in late November that they were going to \"slow down\" the queue (have each mode run for two consecutive weeks) while they worked on \"something else\" (no updates yet, though). If all else fails you can look at what's on the PBE (I'd suggest using [surrender@20](http://www.surrenderat20.net/)) for a *semi-accurate* indication of what the next mode might be.","replies":[]}]}
