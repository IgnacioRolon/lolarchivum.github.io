I know she can be played as a support champion which is why I got her as I am a support player. I was convinced that I would be able to play her but I just can&#039;t! She&#039;s so hard for me. I don&#039;t know what to build with her or to play aggressively or defensively. Any suggestions or advice? Please send help!\r\n-Liam","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-07-12T12:34:34.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got level 5 Orianna solely through playing her as a support. I also got her to play as a support when I was level 20. \n\n* Max your E first and R whenever you can. \n* If the lane is safe to constantly poke (vs someone that all in engages), max your Q second.\n* If the lane is a little more challenging (meta right now with Lulu/Karma being popular), you are going to need to make your poke count. Max W second. \n\nMasteries: Standard thunderbirds support page\nRunes: Standard AP page\n\n**Build**\n\n{{item:2301}} /{{item:2302}}, {{item:3048}}, {{item:3174}} {{item:3050}} {{item:3158}} {{item:3001}} \nMake sure to get a tear early so you can start stacking :)\nLocket is always good in place of the Abyssals in case your team needs more protection. \nGet the support item that combines with a sightstone, as it will free up an item slot for a lil AP \n\n**How to play.**\n\n* Shield your ADC whenever they go in to trade, keep the ball on your ADC. Auto attack poke as much as you can (safely). Try to stay away from ability based poking until you have some mana sustain or you will run into issues. \n\n* Orianna is really strong with ADCs that have heavy engage, like Varus and Ashe. She isn't so good at supporting ADCs like vayne and kogmaw that need a lot of babysitting. \n\n* She struggles vs supports that have more poke than she does (lulu, karma, sona), due to her high costs. She also struggles to come out on top vs sustain supports. Like stated previously, Ori is really good vs engage supports like Leona and Braum. She is also super good against thresh, where you can place your ball on his lantern so the enemy has trouble clicking it. \n\nGood luck, have fun ♥","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-12T04:27:20.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Orianna is a late game champion and by hard, you might mean you feel you do no damage (or something like that)\nJust farm up early and Q>R>W 3+ enemies in teamfights\nShe feels sort of like lissandra to play","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T01:30:46.700+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I highly recommend researching some vids on utube specific to Orianna support. Also, I agree with Roguestoney that she is better mid and you should build to sustain mana not as much damage because don't expect many blue buffs to come you're way.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-11T23:15:15.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IMO Ori is much better mid than she is support.
