Also, her E is slowly becoming worse and worse for me and Riot is slowly removing silencing from the game. I think some people will agree with me. I just hope a Riot employee reads this so Soraka can go back to being as good as she was before.","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T16:48:42.586+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"make her passive an aa bleed","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maximum Spice","date":"2015-12-19T00:36:20.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"your kidding right?","replies":[{"poster":"LiamTheViking","date":"2015-12-19T04:53:22.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm pretty sure Soraka is getting worse and worse and causes lag for me.
