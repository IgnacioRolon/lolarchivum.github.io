I can't decide whether to buy Lux or Sona.","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I&#039;m thinking of getting a new champion. I kind of feel like getting Lux because I&#039;ve seen other people play her and she seems good and easy to play. Also, I&#039;m mostly a support player but I need a good champion that I can play in Bot lane or Mid lane, so this is why I think that Lux would be a good option. The other option is Sona. She seems good as well because I&#039;ve seen some players in worlds play as her and she seems like my type of champion. Also, she can play Bot lane and I think Mid lane. She&#039;s also a pretty good support champion. So which one do you think I should buy? Lux or Sona?","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-19T16:20:10.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"sonas best double pantheon jungle in the game, buy varus instead of lux and play mid","replies":[]},{"poster":"vhumy2001","date":"2015-12-19T10:32:33.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux would be better in the long run,as her all-in is DECIMATING against squishies( ADC)\nBut Sona can fit into lots of roles and have lots of options to ultilise into(Ap,tank?)And she has better sustain in lane\nOh well,It All depends on your personal choices\nHave I told you Lux ult is like a 3d ap cait ult?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Er√∏se","date":"2015-12-19T01:40:22.360+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What TELECASTERDUDE said.Unlike sona,lux is a skillshot reliant champion and if you miss all your skillshots basically you've screwed everything up,though she can dish out high damage she can be vunerable if her skillshots misses since it gives an opening for junglers and enemy laners to go all out on you.She also does not have any sustain.As for sona she has alot of sustain in lane and is easy to win lane with as your constant poke is not a skillshot.However if you are really pursuing a support champion,I recommend going someone like leona or braum,they have tons of cc and can peel for the adc really well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-19T00:44:46.170+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lux is a little lacking as a support, but really **really** good ATM in mid. While Sona is decent in mid and pretty good at support right now, but not a stand-out in either role. \n\nThat being said I would still recommend Sona. Since you're level 16 I assume your mechanics aren't as good as they could be, so someone like Lux, who is very skill shot reliant, might be a little difficult. Sona is also very forgiving because she has so much sustain and it's really easy to win lane with her.","replies":[]}]}
