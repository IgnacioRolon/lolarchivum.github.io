Does anyone know why there were so man technical difficulties?","replies":[{"poster":"Smite","date":"2015-12-20T21:53:17.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So funny story about the spectator being disconnected there. APPARENTLY (I really do not remember doing this) while casting the game I somehow kicked out the ethernet cable to the spectating PC.\n\nOn the issue of pauses the players were on new PC's they weren't used to so there are usually problems that come up with just not being used to the set up. There were way less pauses later on during the day.","replies":[{"poster":"LiamTheViking","date":"2015-12-20T22:34:23.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wait are you the person who was on the spectating computer?","replies":[{"poster":"Smite","date":"2015-12-20T23:12:35.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No but I was casting next to him","replies":[{"poster":"LiamTheViking","date":"2015-12-21T07:23:23.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
