I was wondering if this particular ability could be used in a support role. Let me explain: Her q can be used do damage enemy champions as usual, her foxfire could be used the same (I know this doesn&#039;t sound too good but its possible) and her ult could be used to dash in front of your allies to charm the enemy away from them.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-07-11T23:36:00.640+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Much like Ori IMO; Ahri is better off mid.\n\nIf your picking her for support due to her \"E\" Charm there are much better champs that provide more engage and peel in the support role.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2016-07-12T10:57:46.974+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i play ahri support in my ranked matches occasionally.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Level1Pentakill","date":"2016-07-12T10:27:50.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play support Ahri sometimes. It used to be better, because Support itemisation was a bit better - they nerfed a lot of Support items.\n\nCharm is arguably one of the strongest CC's in the game.\n\nI play her as an ADC sometimes too: {{summoner:12}} {{summoner:14}}         {{item:1038}} {{item:1056}} {{item:3006}} {{item:1053}} {{item:3086}} {{item:1038}} {{item:3046}} {{item:3031}} {{item:3072}} {{item:3033}} /{{item:3036}} {{item:3022}} \n\nU do have to push sometimes to harass with Q as support Ahri tho and this can cause problems in denying ADC CS and causing you to overextend but the mobility makes you incredibly strong with your dive/CC effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-07-12T06:35:31.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You could but you'd soon find out that itemisation is a pickle. You can either:\n\n* stay true to the support role and buy Sightstone, Locket and whatever else is necessary so that you can become the perfect charm bot OR\n* build full damage and become an additional carry at the cost of the utility (which other champs can offer going a similar build path).\n\nIf you're just messing around, I'm sure you'll have still have fun with Ahri support but otherwise it has limited use out of the middle lane. You might consider Lux or Vel'Koz support since they transition smoother to the bot lane.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-07-12T04:29:12.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for these sorts of things its best to just imagine the possibilities, then if it still seems fun, imagine its viability, if it still seems viable, stop joking around and be srs. now is it really viable? if you think it is, think harder, twice, then go have a fap and come back and think about it some more. now that you have those dirty thoughts out of your mind you'll realise that for niche picks theres probably more viable things to contemplate than ahri support","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2016-07-12T03:56:08.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I remember doing this, it works pretty well with burst adcs and is pretty good for kiting but sucks in teamfights. It's like leblanc support. If you're behind, you'll be useless (though it's hard not to get your adc a kill lvl 6).\n2 seconds on e is insane thats like having a skillshot warwick ult every 7 seconds or so if you max cdr.\nOf course there are champs that are a lot better, but if it's fun for you and your adc doesn't mind, I don't see any reason not to try it","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-12T01:24:32.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can see value in it, maneuverability + poke + cc could work well. Although, the higher up the elo you go with out of meta type drafting the more you will get punished.  There are a lot of holes that can be poked in using out of meta drafting and that's why meta exists in the first place. Having said that, a meta started some where because someone tried something different and unique which created the concept. Anything is worth a try whether it be just you're style or maybe it's an out of meta type pre-set strategy.","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-07-12T00:31:56.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the charm, why not just take blitz / thresh / naut who have an even more effective skillshot","replies":[]}]}
