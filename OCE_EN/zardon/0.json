I asked in /all chat and most players in the game were experiencing this problem. It&#039;s the second time it&#039;s happened now just wondering if other people are getting it aswell??","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-25T07:37:34.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \n\nHave you experienced this issue since? Are there any common conditions that occur prior to your fps dropping that don't occur/dont exist when your fps is fine?\n\nCould you try running a client repair for me, let me know if this helps.","replies":[]}]}
