I&#039;ve gone from 6 minute queues at peak time as a support player to 15-20 minute queues, and I&#039;m getting plat 5&#039;s and masters in the same game after all that waiting.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be much more prominent in mid diamond and less so low diamond and high diamond. But it&#039;s really degrading to have 10 super imbalanced games in a row, and gaining gains like +6, +11, +12, +14, +15. \r\n\r\nWhatever happened it seems that I&#039;ve fallen into the minority that suffer from the result :(","replies":[]}
