E.g.:\r\n\r\nI have &#039;Rune Page 1&#039;, &#039;Rune Page 2&#039;, and &#039;Rune Page 3&#039;, my current default is &#039;Rune Page 2&#039;, as it was from the previous game and dedicated to a specific champion, as is &#039;Rune Page 3&#039;, so if I want a customise a rune page for X champion, I would use &#039;Rune Page 1&#039; and toy around with it. With that said, when I change to &#039;Rune Page 1&#039; in the drop-down menu within the lobby and click on &#039;Edit&#039; it will still load &#039;Rune Page 2&#039;, which is rather annoying, and assume &quot;Not working as intending&quot;, please fix.","replies":[]}
