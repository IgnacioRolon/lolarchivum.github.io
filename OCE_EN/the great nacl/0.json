It seemed that further across on the dying sunset, a shadow loomed across between the divide between creation and destruction, living and survival.\n\nFor him, this was the world of opportunity. \n\nThe air was thick with a pungent smell; a horrid mixture of all things synthetic and scavenged. Smoke billowed from the factories in a myriad of industrial greys, rust breeding in its steel hollows. From the first hour of morning light to twilight, the mechanical orchestra of Zaun never ceased to play its humble whir of industrial concerto. Hammers clashed with molten slag, chemicals were brewed together to form the foulest of concoctions. The average Zaunite craftsman was content with scurrying about the concrete below, carving a place where more hands were shaken underneath cloaks than in the light. Secrets here were like currency traded with absolute care: military and industrial secrets of Demacia, Noxus and with Piltover &ndash; a slight chuckle beforehand. \n\nSteel groaned in the empty hollows of abandoned warehouses, towers pierced that cloudy dust from above as the flash of a young man whizzed from one rooftop to another. Straddled onto his back was a leather sack, tied securely with rope. \n\nYou see it once, you see it twice, but never before had he missed this place so much. \n_\nHuh, maybe you do only realise what something&rsquo;s worth it is when it&rsquo;s lost._\n\nThe feeling was exhilarating; the wind in your hair and maybe even the slight glimmer of sunlight found its way through the smog on your skin. He ran as fast as he could possibly go, feet dancing between ledges and obstacles. He would always run without a plan &ndash; only a destination in mind. \n\n_Now this? This was freedom._\n\nLooking ahead, the unmistakable sight of the slums put a grin on his face. \n\nHis heart almost skipped a beat, but the enthusiasm wasn&rsquo;t without distraction, as he would soon discover. As he jumped on the railing to reach the next building, his footing suddenly slipped from underneath him. That grin on his face was soon plastered with wide-eyed panic at the brick footpath below.\n\nRooftop jumping was a dangerous business, and one little slip such as this meant that he now faced a very sizeable drop with an exasperated look.\n\n&ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;One more time!&rdquo;\n\nHe promptly twisted the device on his wrist, triggering a blue flash to erupt from the device on his back. The temporal cogs re-winded instantaneously, and he felt a lurching sensation on his body pull him into a world of distorted light as he started playing his slip-up in reverse. When the light of the Z-drive faded, he attempted the jump again, this time narrowly avoiding the slippery surface he&rsquo;d jumped from last time and landing squarely on the other side. \n\nHe looked over his shoulder, his breath ragged and irregular. It was no secret that no matter how many times he did that, a sudden Chronobreak without mental preparation was like a stressful adrenaline burst. \n\n_Maybe I should kink that out of the Z-drive..._\n\nBut he had no time to think further, not when he places to be. He frowned, a growing anxiety stirring inside of him as he looked into the darkness of the slums of Zaun. A crimson light cast its shadow over the factories, a sunset that looked so beautiful to behold across this wide place he called home. \n\nHe hated duties, so it was more like him to just wander the world by himself without anyone&rsquo;s burden to concern himself with. Yet he couldn&rsquo;t, his footsteps always retraced to this very place every single time without fail. Maybe it was fair to say there was a Chronobreak in his mind.\n\n_Just wait for me._\n\n-\n\nHe was carrying a heavy sack of grain over his back, trudging through the dirt roads towards progress. There was a certain gap between two large abandoned warehouses that served as a good hideout from prying eyes, and he made the journey without making a single sound. He double-checked to be sure his steps couldn&rsquo;t be traced, remembering with great pain the last time he was careless about coming here. A giant brute clad in armour had followed him, destroying most of the place in the process, a guy so powerful it took a dozen Chronobreaks to take him down.\n\nIf he remembered correctly, it was right through this narrow alleyway and right on the other side...\n\nAs soon as he managed to squeeze himself out; he stared blankly at the sight around him. Light flickered from dozens of small bulbs that were scavenged and repaired. Piles of leftover scrap were piled at every side, evidence of recent tinkering still on every piece of metal. The forge was still there, burning as it did all those years ago. It was exactly how he remembered it before he left, except someone had been busy with fixing the damages.\n\n&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo;\n\nThe moment those words were spoken, the slums started to come alive.\n\n&ldquo;Look everybody, Ekko&rsquo;s back!&rdquo;\n\nOne head popped out of the trash pile, then another, and then a whole swarm of kids started to emerge from their foxholes. They flanked from all sides, tugging onto his shirt and smiles as wide as the horizon and asked him a dozen question every second. They were much younger than him, all of them wearing clothing stitched together with left-over fabric and dirt-smothered faces: the same kind of orphans as him. Ekko greeted them as best as he could, ruffling hair, giving high-fives to each of them with a smile of his own. He remembered each of their names, all of their history and how they ended up here.\n\n&ldquo;Hey fellas, long time no see right? I&rsquo;ve been busy lately, so you know what? I thought to myself, I needed a break.&rdquo; He ended his sentence with a coy smile. &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t come empty-handed, know what I mean?&rdquo; \n\nHe heaved the bag over his shoulder, bringing it down in front of them. With one unloosened string, Ekko revealed a treasure trove. In the sack came an aroma of freshness, a smell of sweetness that no child in Zaun could ever dream of: packets of food from the best stores money could buy. The children looked at each other, digging into the pile with glee.\n\n&ldquo;Bread!&rdquo; they cried in unison.\n\nThey all dove into the pile, each taking as much as they wanted. Nothing made him happier than watching these kids get a fair meal; maybe it made all that head-bashing in the fields of justice worth it all. Not a single crumb of this stolen as well, except maybe a few cupcakes from Piltover &ndash; not like the pilties needed it. Although, the children had an appetite for more than just food.\n\n&ldquo;Tell us about what you do Ekko!&rdquo;\n\n&quot;What, on the Rift?&quot;\n\n&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, tell us!&rdquo;\n\nEkko leaned back, scratching his chin. &rdquo;Well then listen up, because this is gonna get crazy...&rdquo;   \n\nWhen the children of Zaun had nothing, they were left for dead at the mercy of the cruelty of some of the nation state&rsquo;s worst. They were the abandoned that no one would look after, all except for those who gave sanctuary to the ones who needed it. They kept the nation&rsquo;s orphans safe, and above all ingenuity and genius, was a testament to what Zaun was underneath its exterior. He would spend every second he had to keeping it alive, if that was what it took. \n\nHe understood that many saw his home state as the breeding ground for scoundrels; mad people that took advantage of Zaun&rsquo;s industrious spirit for their heinous gain. Mad chemists like Singed, robotic nightmares like Viktor, they tarnished his homeland with fear and scorn. Piltover and their goons did just as terrible, using their technological prowess for nothing more than to flaunt their plastic superiority. The mural on the wall of the woman showed Ekko what a true Zaunite was: ingenious, resourceful but not selfish for their own gain. He was taught that Zaun was a land of opportunity, where one could invent a way to be free from the shackles of any rule or law.\n\nWas the Z-drive itself not just his own proof that not even time itself couldn&rsquo;t bind them?\n\nSo he would laugh, he would smile as they did.\n\nThe boy would continue to run; just as he&rsquo;d always done. Escape from the inescapable, fix the unfixable and live to run free from destiny itself. For in time, and if he had any experience in time, things would change.\n\nTimes will always change.","replies":[{"poster":"KeiPe","date":"2016-06-27T02:19:39.825+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"This fanfic is not boosted, good work!","replies":[]},{"poster":"itsaneeps","date":"2016-07-28T05:29:18.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love the description of Zaun, almost as if I could smell the smoke and grime of the place. You totally captured the heart of Ekko and the story really sweet. The voice wavers a bit here and there.
