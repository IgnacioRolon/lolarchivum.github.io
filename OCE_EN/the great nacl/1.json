They are really cool looking skins, and it&#039;s a bummer seeing them being neglected, so I decided to write about them. Inspiration for this story came from Lovecraftian themes, as well as the reapers from the Mass Effect series.\n\n-------\n\nHe falls.\n\nSuspended on the grand space of splendour, he finds himself falling on the edge of eternity.\n\n&ldquo;Where am I&hellip;?&rdquo;\n\nAn endless tunnel, a kaleidoscope of crimson and darkness reaches out to a hollow light. No body exists to carry this soul, he is a wandering spirit that swims in the timelessness without any reason. Where his vision crosses the event horizon that lies ahead, he imagines them all over again: the voices of others as they passed through this very same world.\n\nThe world around him felt bizarrely surreal, fazing in and out of focus. It possessed none of the features of a typical world. For one, there was no horizon - the ground was one with the skies, filled to the brim with a crimson wash. Far beyond his reach, cosmic clouds were scattered across the darkness, painting space in a light that he had never seen &ndash; a palette of swirling violet and turquoise that were driven by a chaotic drive. He witnessed the birth of stars and the creation of new worlds, from singularity to their fiery deaths. Flashes of lightning joined the beacons of light in wondrous constellation. This infinite space enveloped his senses, and no matter where his sight could wander, they could find no end to this realm.\n\nTimeless, endless, meaningless.\n\nUpon its center laid the object of this world&rsquo;s fascination: a black monolithic structure that was embedded at the event horizon. Covered in an alien chromatic alloy, veins of flesh clung to its base while it breathed to the rhythm of life. It inhaled in tandem with the pulse of this universe &ndash; beating as the heart of this infinite world. The monolith answered him in a deep, distorted voice coming from within.\n\n&lt;This domain is where reality is weaved&hellip; and subsequently pulled apart. This domain is where the time begins&hellip; and brought to its conclusion. This domain is eternity, so we are Eternum; the embodiment of truth.&gt;\n\n&ldquo;I do not belong here.&rdquo;\n\n&lt;No, you are a fragment that has returned to its rightful place. Here, we free you of the curse that has divided us since we were scattered across Runeterra, the moment the veil of self-reasoning covered the truth.&gt;\n\n&ldquo;None of that makes any sense.&rdquo;\n\nThen the visions began. The truth, it was the truth of everything he&rsquo;d ever known. Their screams would pour over the other, their cauldron boiling over until it turned into a high-pitched whistle. The darkness of that life shattered into light, the ground underneath cracked like glass and let the soul fall into this eternal dream. The pieces of reality became metallic alloys of their own, and even in such darkness they reflected a light that couldn&rsquo;t be seen &ndash; the future that ceased to be in a single day. Fibres of flesh joined the metal together, and an agent of the Eternum awoke in parallel with this realization.\n\nIt began as a skeletal frame, but more crimson veins threaded the composite armour. From chaos was born the perfection of flesh and machine. With each layer interlaced, the nightmare of the Eternum was given shape, the horror with eyes of burning flames and claws that rend asunder the hopes of all who looked upon it. With a screech that resembled the pitch of a spinning sawblade, Nocturne of the Eternum rose. It eyed the wandering soul, grasping the formless in its claws and suddenly the memories made sense.  \n\n&lt;PIERCE&hellip; THE VEIL&hellip;&gt;\n\nA thousand voices speak at once, images of swords and banners flash before his vision. Every detail is visible, yet at the same time, they are almost unperceivable. The pain then became familiar, up to the point where he remembered the desire to scream against the madness. It was this being, who without mercy or reason, laced its blades with the blood of the innocent. \n\n&ldquo;You killed me&hellip; but why?&rdquo;\n\n&lt;Kill, to bring a permanent end, that is not our desire. Every soul in Runeterra exists in ignorance of their true nature, they die and are reborn countlessly, unable to realize they are the pieces of Eternum&rsquo;s entirety. As long as that cycle exists, we can never become whole again. You were the first to be brought back to the fold, to join your primeval rebirth.&gt;\n\n&ldquo;So, you have brought me to hell.&rdquo;\n\n&lt;I have brought you into perfection, it is a vision of a unified existence.&gt;\n\nNocturne slashed the air beside it, opening a rift in space where the Eternum envisioned his scheme. Within the torn space was a world where the cities of Runeterra were consumed in destruction; their towers and idols of their civilization in ruin. Portals were opened in their hundreds, where creatures infused with the Eternum&rsquo;s will ravaged everything before them. All those slaughtered by the Eternum would end up here, sucked into eternity. The agents screeched in unison against a blackened sky, against the burning flags of all nations. \n\nWar was the ancient primal language that all people knew in their blood, an act so painful in its conveyance but eternal in its meaning, it lasted longer than any words of paper or spoken word. That is what the Eternum desired to show.\n\nThe world that the soul had known; that blue marble from the space above, the pebble floating amid the universe, became nothing. Likened to its coldness, its silence, the evening twilight was the curtain to a show &ndash; a show of the most ingenious of species, now brought to its final chapter. Against the rage of the heavens, which sounded of bitter and accusatory defiance, he heard something that made him think.\n\n&ldquo;Are you of the Void?&rdquo;\n\n&lt;Those with no souls are not of Eternum, thus they make the ideal pawns. Once enraptured in our strings, they will be the shepherds who guide the lost back into eternity. They are the will of perfection, with bodies impervious to all impurity.&gt;\n\nThey burst out of the ground, claws of perfect design tearing apart all resistance. They rose with bodies of armoured conduits woven together by the same exposed, crimson flesh. The soul looked upon these creatures born from the Eternum, and they almost looked&hellip; incomplete in a way. They had no thoughts of their own, they were merely an autonomous function that served its dictated code, and its adherence to this law was absolute.\n \n&lt;Soon, all will fall to the Eternum. No matter their strength, nor their cunning, one by one, they will return to us.&gt;\n\nNocturne released the spirit, letting it float aimlessly again.\n\n&ldquo;I do not have a choice, do I?&rdquo;\n\nImages of his old lives past by me, he heard the soothing waters of Bilgewater, the blizzards of the Freljord and the warmth of the Demacian spring. He wanted to hear it again, he wanted to hear the only thing that he could hope to trust. But this place would not let go. The echoing chasm toyed with him, promising him with the premise that one day, he would be able to find peace.\n\nHe knew that in this empty heart, there was a conviction to see these places again.\n\nThe warmth, the coldness, the sensation, the taste, the pain, the sorrow, the joy &ndash; all these things he wanted to feel again, the instinctual reach from his heart longed for the familiar. \n\n&lt;You can be forced to assimilate, or you may choose as your last act of free will to become something greater.&gt;\n\nIn this place with no concept of direction or time, the soul stared into its creator&rsquo;s eye. It stared into death, possibly already enclosed in its grip. The vein, the network of life that connected it all was not a part of his imagination. Voices of people coloured the emptiness of this palette-less world &ndash; bringing the Eternum to life. Yet he longed to shout across true emptiness; into the blue sky where the eastern winds blew, shouting of freedom.\n\nA decision was granted to him whether he was to accept this fate or move forward, a chance granted by destiny or something lesser. It was the easiest of choices, and the hardest. He would die in his home, he would die in truth. Even if the result was nothing, he could disappear knowing full content.\n\n&ldquo;Will I be able to see that world again? Will I be able to hear those voices once more?&rdquo;\n\nNocturne&rsquo;s blade pierced the soul like a drop of red ink in pure water, stretched out to form cloud-like patterns across the surface world. Random and chaotic as they were, they sprawled out across this non-Euclidean boundary as the voices now merged together in unity, as all souls converged into one.\n\n&lt;You will stand above it all, and much more&hellip;&gt;\n\nSaying nothing, the soul crumbled into a red mist. The cracks blossomed, several pieces crumbling away as a light emerged from the layer beneath and lighting the darkness. It \n\n&lt;&hellip; For that is the will of Eternum.&gt;","replies":[]}
