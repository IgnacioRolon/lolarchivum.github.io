Got it again just before and it said it switched to an older version of the client and now it wont let me log in. I know i&#039;m using the right password as I used it to log into this but it keeps saying incorrect username or password. I&#039;ve clicked the link to reset my password 3 times and it still hasn&#039;t sent and i&#039;m putting my team at a disadvantage now. Is there any way of resolving this or should I just delete and redownload?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-15T05:55:35.164+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would definitely run a clean reinstall with the Hextech Repair Tool: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool Especially so if you've copied or moved your install at some point. \n\nIf that doesn't work submit a ticket to Player Support and they should be able to help you: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
