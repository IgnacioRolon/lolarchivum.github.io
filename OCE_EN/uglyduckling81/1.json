I have to reset the PC.\r\nIt happens as soon as I press the button to go to post game stats and chat, instant black screen and crash.\r\nI guess it wasn't enough I have gotten bug splat messages almost every game for the last 8 months or so, since 4.10 patch or what ever it was. Now I have to reboot after every game.\r\nPlease don't bother with the \"it's your PC, not the game\" comments. This is something that only happens at the exact same time every game and only since tonight.\r\nRIOT PLS","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-06T22:53:21.304+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Instead of restarting your PC, have you tried force-closing League from your task manager?","replies":[]}]}
