After 5 mins of clicking to re-queue and nothing happening it finally says you have dodged too many games and you now need to wait 30 mins. Fuck this new system. Who fucking cares if I click the ban button or not, I clicked the champ I wanted to ban. Lock that shit in auto like it used to. Also 30 mins for missing a single ban select? WTF is that. Why am I required to even ban. First punishment 30 fucking mins. That&#039;s complete horseshit.\nI spent over 40 mins to even get a game there was that many people forgetting to lock in their champ select.\nGoto be the worst decision made so far by Riot. Just a terrible new system. \nI do like the new champ select method just not this BS about getting kicked back if you don't press lock in.","replies":[{"poster":"sad little benju","date":"2016-01-23T07:50:48.928+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just try banning the champ by locking it in.

It will get better with time as people remember to lock in.","replies":[]}]}
