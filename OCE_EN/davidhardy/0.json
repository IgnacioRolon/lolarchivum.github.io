Went 4-0 in 10min solo killing the enemy malz , Hes playing xer. Felt pretty confident that we are gonna win after getting drag and shoving mid down. But then i realise that every single ability that xer is using is landing directly on the center of enemy champions .... Cait will net away only to get q&#039;d directly while xer is mid cast ... And it knows before she lands where she will land. Every ult every stun every w Directly in the center of an enemy champion. Tried to throw the game because of how trash it feels to win with scripter but by that time malz had afked.\r\n\r\nI should have recorded it but i didint have fraps installed at that time ..

If people get rekt, first thing they do is call scripter. Unless you know what you're looking for, you couldn't pick it. Even then, it's difficult.\n\nProblem is that since so many people accuse others of scripting, it's impossible for rito to take action and find the ones that actually are.","replies":[{"poster":"DAVIDHARDY","date":"2015-04-03T05:43:53.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ive actually never seen someone accuse someone of scripting , ever. In over 5000 games. Not once has someone accused another player of scripting, I myself havent seen it didint see it on NA. It is becoming a big thing right now. And its quite obvious what to look for if you scroll down and look at the video. Scripting is blatent ....

But he did stand in a minion wave at lvl 1 trying to out-trade the enemy malz only to almost die and have to base ... At level 1. I think its pretty obvious to anyone whos played you know a good 5000 games of league. Mained xer over 3 seasons. The best mids in the world do not predict like this although they would play alot better obviously. Its un-deniable actually, If you watch the video ....
