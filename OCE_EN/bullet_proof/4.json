They invited a Zed.\r\nIn the game everything was normally but at a point in laning phase I accidentally used the seed plant incorrectly and it ended up killing my support, this was not my intent and I wanted to apologise in chat but before I was able to even state anything this Thresh starts massively pinging me and getting frustrated in chat, soon later within the match they used all chat to bribe enemies to kill me a certain numbers of times and a skin would be gifted in compensation after the aforementioned match. Example: (Thresh): I will gift anyone who kills Vayne 20 times an ultimate skin. The Thresh also once revealed my position to enemies in all chat. Zed was also wholeheartedly participating with the bribery towards enemies to killing me. At one point they followed me through jungle and recalled when I did to follow me and deny me farm.  The bribery happened multiple times in my game.\r\nI did report them after the match with a shorter description. The pinging did also occur on multiple occasions throughout the match. I request a review of the all chat in the match, as these players were harassing and extorting me. I thank all who assist me kindly, Regards Fox.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T13:20:22.554+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"As per usual, trolling is just not a thing that gets banned regularly, you should submit a ticket to support, but it won't do jack and or shit.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nHonestly the funny thing is these trolls tend to avoid bans constantly, whereas simply saying the wrong word once, can get you 14 day bans.\n\nI know which i'd prefer getting bans, but we all know which gets the bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Ã–rnn Bot","date":"2018-01-09T05:12:45.767+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"riot have a very very poorly made behavior punishment system i agree with you 100% my mate has been banned for simply saying blabalblabalblabalblabalblabalblabalblabal and there reason was because hes using chat unconventionally","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HeavenlyTonkatsu","date":"2018-01-14T10:42:56.195+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly this is what happens when a game goes beyond popular.
