At 05:00 AM AEDT, the servers will be shut down and all games currently in progress will end in a draw and stats will not be recorded.   We estimate the battlegrounds will be unavailable for 3 hours.\n\n\n**Update 30/03/2016 @ 12:00pm AEDT**\nHi folks,\n\nAfter this mornings maintenance, there was an issue with the OCE server and the way it dealt with Ranked games. This meant that you wouldn't have been able to see your correct rank, and matches ending during this time did not record results or LP. If you played in ranked and the game finished between 9:20am and 10:20am AEDT (Sydney time) today it would have been affected this way.\n\nWe're really sorry we didn't catch it earlier, but we've fixed the issue now.\n","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-03-30T00:59:58.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi folks,\n\nAfter this mornings maintenance, there was an issue with the OCE server and the way it dealt with Ranked games.

I am able to log in via a VPN, start a custom game, turn off the VPN, and the custom game automatically reconnects with my own internet connection. Since the VPN is disconnected though, the adobe air client is unable to connect, so once I leave the game, I have to start the process all over again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LAMP90","date":"2016-03-29T22:18:10.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"been waiting for 4 hours to play ... about ready to shoot myself , the refresh button is killing me !! im sooo depressed right now .:( RIOT PLEASE HURRY UP :(","replies":[{"poster":"LAMP90","date":"2016-03-29T22:19:20.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"YAAAAAAAAAAAAY ITS UP !!!","replies":[{"poster":"HermitXD","date":"2016-03-29T22:24:33.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Name of your first porn movie? =]","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-03-29T22:21:33.838+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teemo must of invaded their workplace and blinded everyone{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-03-29T22:22:51.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"IT'S FINALLY UP GUYS, the blind effect wore off {{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} soo happy","replies":[]},{"poster":"Shiba Inu Sana","date":"2016-03-29T22:19:14.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIOT why is this maintenance  taking so long, it has been over an hour and I am stilling siting for the servers to be back online","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rivalry","date":"2016-03-29T21:26:11.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Is it late or is you guys asleep? haha","replies":[{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-03-29T21:41:49.508+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They've got to be asleep, it's been 40 mins after they said it should be up, i hope the new launcher will come out soon, i'm getting pissed of with this glitchy one {{champion:122}}","replies":[{"poster":"HermitXD","date":"2016-03-29T22:01:16.489+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope not, sitting here playing tablet games....","replies":[{"poster":"Lumaxious","date":"2016-03-29T22:06:13.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's now been an hour... i've got to practice for an event coming up and 2 days before it THIS HAPPENS {{sticker:slayer-jinx-unamused}}","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"cait shot JFK","date":"2016-03-29T22:04:31.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey riot, wake up","replies":[]},{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-03-29T19:01:50.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Will it be dealing with alot of people have Hextech loot issues?
