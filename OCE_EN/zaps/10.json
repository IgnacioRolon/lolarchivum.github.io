This occurred in solo Q. I was diana Skarner ulti'd me. Then Tahm on my team ate me, whilst running away skarner ulti'd tahm for a second time in about 3 seconds. I think the bug is that skarner ulti gets reset if tahm eats the target. I have not tested and only happened once. Thought I'd let you know.\n\nZombieTucan :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Idroold","date":"2015-09-16T12:50:00.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"please refer this link please riot....l cannot login  many others have the same problem... in the comment section\n\n\nhttp://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/4KcH7kEJ-unexpected-platform-error","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nova X","date":"2015-09-16T00:00:43.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Dasrus forge chroma skins dont come up in the skins menu at all or my yi ones???","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-09-16T00:22:25.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, do you mean in Champion Select or when looking at your profile?
