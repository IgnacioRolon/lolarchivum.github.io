I previously worked in the NOC, as well as working as a Live Tech for a while. \n\nI&#039;m a sucker for fantasy, science fiction and pretty much reading in general. When it comes to gaming, I&#039;m a sucker for pretty much any kind of RPG - especially ARPGs and JRPGs! My first gaming console was a Super Nintendo, and I still think it&#039;s one of (maybe the!) best consoles of all time!\n\nI&#039;m also a bit of a cricket tragic - love the game, love watching it... but horrible at playing it. For context of how bad - one of my greatest achievements was managing to get 2 runs in 20 overs coming in at #11! It didn&#039;t even save the game!\n\n**Please, ask me anything! I promise that I won&#039;t bite that much!**\n\n_EDIT: I've had to slow down a bit for the night, so I'm sorry if I haven't replied to you yet! I'll still be answering questions over time!

These things can be relatively minor annoyances - all the way up until not being able to play the game. \n\nQuite a bit of what I do involves identifying and quantifying the impact these things are actually causing people, and then finding the best way to prioritise and resolve those issues with the resources available.\n\n----\n\nI feel like Oceania is pretty well aligned with the worldwide experience of League of Legends. More tailored towards my own field - it's clear that there are some issues with home network connectivity in Australia and the quality of connections that ISPs are able to provide.  \n\nUnfortunately, the ability to improve this part of the connectivity problem directly is outside of our control, but we're always trying to find ways to improve connectivity or bypass issues that can occur - and we've been able to do this in a number of ways since starting up the Oceanic server. \n\nThat said, we're never going to be satisfied with the current state - there's always things we can do to make things better!","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-09-03T11:38:34.567+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you're working on the tribunal and reporting system, I assume?\n\nNow you've got me curious, what are the most noticeable or most important issues you've solved and what do you consider to be your greatest achievement in your career?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"0j0j0","date":"2015-09-02T12:43:08.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a question for you.
