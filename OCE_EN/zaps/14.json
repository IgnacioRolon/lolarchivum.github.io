However, after this 5.15 patch there have been many bugs such as: incredibly long time to log in, delayed responses in gaming queue, and the worst is that even though I am playing at 45ms and 60 fps, whenever any summoner casts a spell i experience severe lag and dont know what happened until about 2 seconds later.","replies":[{"poster":"enemyofrule","date":"2015-08-08T11:23:35.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Me to my game started lagging with jumpy play during your bilgewater event, now it lags during EVERY match i play ranked, also i cant open my shop...17000 ip, i cant play anymore..can u do something? i heard patch 5.14 made a lot of players upset because of lag/disconnections which i also get from 5.14 bilgewater event.{{summoner:12}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-08-07T12:20:08.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"After my most recent match, it went to the 'Skip waiting for stats' post match screen. However the screen bugged and then a prompt appeared saying \"Has encountered an errorâ€¦ yada yada\" like the one after the ward skin bug. It wouldn't take me to the post match stats screen, and I had to skip waiting for stats. Error message left after I did that. Hasn't happened before, thought it might be from the latest patch.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAlso experienced another issue, where I would rank up an ability, but the icon would not turn into colour, but stay black and white. Happened with a couple of champs, I think Fizz was one of them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Badgie","date":"2015-08-07T10:18:41.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't login to my account because it says its the wrong password, even though it isn't.
