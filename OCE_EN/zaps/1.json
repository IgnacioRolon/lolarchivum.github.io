This continued to happen throughout the game to the point where I wouldn't even leave the base to help my team due to the fear of my champion locking on to an enemy and not allowing me free movement unless I die. \n\nA player on the EU boards has also had the same problem.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThis is the other players thread:\nhttp://boards.eune.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/suggestions-bug-reports-en/qLxT0W8P-bug-champion-stuck-in-attack-mode-patch-56-57","replies":[{"poster":"MagicSpeedo69","date":"2015-04-12T23:36:32.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this probably has to do with the left click/ right click cancel bug","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CyanPhoenix","date":"2015-04-18T10:24:41.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know i'm pretty late on this thread, but i just had a pretty big problem while in champ select...\n\nso you know how when someone is selecting a champion, they have the grey boarder around their portrait, and otherwise they have a black boarder? well, when it came to my turn to select a champ, my boarder stayed black, and the 2 people on the other team who had just picked still had grey boarders... at first i was fairly confused, and thought maybe i had misheard the sound notification thing that tells you it's your turn, and since i couldn't select a champion i just waited it out. well, the timer ran out, and then the game kicked me out saying i had failed to select a champion. i lost 3 lp (which while not a lot, does mean that instead of winning 1 game to get to promos, i will now have to win 2 since i was on ~80 LP) and also got the cooldown for queue.\n\nthis should really be looked into, since if it happens to someone on promos AFAIK they will automatically lose a game which could cost them a lot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Daburukiru","date":"2015-04-15T19:54:32.281+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

The reason that this is such a huge problem is that you can ONLY right click in game and once you go into range of an enemy unit, you will attack it and you will not be able to stop until the units within range are killed. This bug also causes almost all keys to not work in game. Some of the keys that do not work are: Left Click, Shop(button, you can still right click the shop but you will not be able to purchase anything), Scoreboard, Pings, Cannot level up skills, camera stuck in place (you can manually move your mouse to far left or right), all skills come off smartcast and go to regular cast, cannot recall, cannot click continue at end game (Victory/Defeat).\n\nHowever, you can still chat and right click although it is still in attack move mode.\n\nThis bug makes the game unplayable for many mac users if they experience it. I would hope Riot would put up a notice on the client letting people know that they are aware of it and trying to fix it.
