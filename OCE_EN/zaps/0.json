The queue will also be extended to 3pm&ndash;1am AEDT &mdash; the same hours that TT Normals are available. **TT Ranked will return to Thursday and Friday nights only on 07/11/17**.\n~~~\nAfter the announcement of the [2017 Ranked Season Rewards](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends-november-7) - we&#039;ve seen renewed interest in the Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex queue. \n\nBecause of this, we&#039;ve decided to turn Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex on **every day** until the end of the 2017 Season. This should help everyone making their final climb up the Ranked Ladder before the end of the season. We&#039;re also extending the start and finish times to match the up with the current Normal times (3pm&ndash;1am AEDT).\n\n\n**End of Season Rewards:**\nIf you reach Gold in Twisted Treeline, you will earn a unique Chroma for Victorious Graves that is only available through this achievement.\nIf you reach Silver in at least two ranked queues, you earn the Victorious Ward Skin.\n\nYou can also earn a Summoner Icon based on your final rank in Twisted Treeline, as well as a ranked border that will appear in the loading screen of all of your TT games during the 2018 season. Check out the [2017 Season Rewards page for more details!](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends-november-7)\n\n# So, from 24/10/17 until 06/11/17 Twisted Treeline Flex Ranked will now be available daily from 3pm to 1am AEDT.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is no longer the most recent Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex update, check out [this update](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/FKbiy2gY-twisted-treeline-ranked-schedule-preseason-update) for more up to date info.","replies":[{"poster":"Ariana Grande","date":"2017-10-26T05:47:15.742+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":1,"body":"I really think we need to increase the challenger slots by at least 1-2.

When we expanded from 3 to 6 slots, the appropriate amount for the time was 3 slots. The hope was that the queue population would stretch to fill 6 as an appropriate amount. It had an almost negligible effect. It only now fits the 6 slot limit due to how many more players are in the queue due to end of season rewards.\n\nFlex having 200 slots is not ideal, given the decreased interest in the queue this year. I will be pushing to have SR Flex ranked slots limited to what they should be next season, only expanding if usage of the queue grows, similar to TT. No guarantee this will happen, will have to see what we can agree on internally.","replies":[{"poster":"ïuv mmmmmmmmmmm","date":"2017-11-03T23:52:58.726+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you please help me , i made ticket like 30 times ,\n\nim so down ,\n\ncan u help my ticket ,\n\nonly u can help me ,\n\nlast time u banning me for botting Third-party plug-ins\n\nthis time u banning me for toxic ,\n\ncan u check my last game please ,\n\nonly u can help me ,\n\nthe supporter from ticket they are never help me , they never checking my chating history from last game ,\n\ni have nearly full skin ,\n\ni can't let my acc gone, please help me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Stubborn","date":"2017-10-26T08:15:43.074+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"Yeah I'm currently ranked #5 on TT and I think it's unfair that people who have been playing this game mode for the whole year get a giant middle finger as a reward for their hard work just because the queue gained more days and people have more time than them.

So much for evaluating if it's possible to keep up the extended days. On a personal note the only reason I and 3 other friends have come back to league is because of the extended days 3v3 ranked is available.\n\nI'm around low silver elo and queues pop instantly. \n\nAlso can't have TT but there can be blind and draft for 5's on most of the time. So much for the excuse of splitting the player base.\n\nAlso with the rewards we can clearly say that this has increased the popularity of 3v3. Is it possible to have some ongoing rewards for playing 3v3 to motivate people to play it more often? This may not only help the health of the queue but allow us to expand its availability on a more permanent basis.\n\nReward e.g. Missions that involve 3v3 or a daily IP reward that involves 3v3.","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-10-26T02:33:55.065+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"After 2017/11/05, we will analyse the impact of this change and make a decision around availability in preseason.

But, we are open to making appropriate expansions to the queue if enough players continue to play TT after end of season.\nI'll talk with some other Rioters next week about actually leaving some of the expanded time open after season end for a little while to see if interest sticks (it does make more sense, I just pushed for the more cautious approach in the announcement). But if it goes back to pre-reward announcement popularity levels, expanding it much at all has a good chance of killing the mode outright.\n\nThe thing about motivating players to play a queue for rewards is that it's an overall unsatisfying experience for them. They're only choosing to play the queue because if not they miss out on something, even though they'd rather play a different mode.\n\nBribing more players into TT is great for the players that really enjoy and want to play the queue (myself included), more players = more up-time. But for the majority, they question \"why I can't just get these bonuses playing a mode that I prefer\".\n\nYou may consider the TT exclusive Graves chroma a similar thing, but the aim of that reward is to recognize the players who care about and play TT regularly enough to earn a Gold ranking.  Non-TT regulars coming into the queue to also earn the reward is just due to the bribe effect to  them, and they aren't the focus of the reward.","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-10-27T13:41:54.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see what your saying there.

Some people that are playing for the TT chroma might decide that they do actually like the queue and would like to play it more. But can't because of how limited its hours are. \n\nAnyway thank you for responding to my post and looking in to leaving the queue extended for a bit longer to see if interest sticks. I mean if we find that its a day or 2 too much can't we simply be cut the queue times back a day? It's all about balance right? Also the community can't say you didn't at least give it a go if that turns out to be the case.\n\nOh and as far as the bribes go can't I get all the rewards for just playing TT? ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-11-01T00:15:12.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's true that the queue being on more hours may attract more players to it. But there have to be enough players coming over to TT to sustain the queue for another day if that's how much it is extended by. So for example, we could see that expanding to Saturday nights brings a 20% increase in TT players (a substantial increase), when sustaining the queue for a third day at the same level of quality would actually require a 50% increase in players.\n\nPlayers who already play TT on Thurs/Fri may also then choose to play on Saturday. But whenever we've expanded queues times by days (with the exception of the new SR Draft mode) we see most players playing only slightly more or the same amount of the expanded queue, spread out over another day of up-time - which of course, increases queue times and lowers matchmaking quality.\n\nBut I am hopeful that the recent drive for players to jump into TT will lead to a good shot at TT surviving a couple of extra nights of expansion.","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-11-01T04:34:18.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall that sounds very positive.\nThanks so much for giving it a chance.
