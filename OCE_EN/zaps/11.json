We&#039;re going to extend the time the queue is available for the[ remainder of the test period.](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/WEAy3U0l-normal-draft-test-coming-to-oceania) From today until 2017/10/19, the queue will run from 11am-3am AEDT. At that point, we will look at the data and make a decision around the ongoing time for the queue. \n~~~\nAfter our mos[t recent changes,](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/glATfXAE-queue-changes-draft-update-ranked-change)  we&#039;ve been able to monitor the impact to the quality of the queue. \n\n* We&rsquo;ve seen that the breakdown of games between blind and draft has remained pretty stable after the changes. (Around the 17% mentioned in the[ last update)](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/glATfXAE-queue-changes-draft-update-ranked-change) \n* The quality of the matchmaking and queue times remained acceptable during the greatly extended time period the queue was available. \n\nBecause of this, we&rsquo;re planning on pushing the available time for the queue even further for the remainder of the time period. We&#039;re uncertain that the matchmaking quality and queue times will remain acceptable during this entire time period - but we want to push as hard as possible to have as many modes available for as long as possible.  This will allow us to get data to make a final decision of where to end up at the end of the test period. \n\n# So from 2017/10/15 until 2017/10/18 Normal Draft will be on EVERYDAY from 11am to 3am AEDT. After 19/10/2017, we will assess how this change went and decide on the ongoing availability of the queue. #\n~~~\n#Twisted Treeline#\n~~~\n**TL;DR:**\nWe&#039;re enabling Twisted Treeline on Saturday and Sunday for the remainder of the 2017 Season (until (2017/11/07). We want to have the mode open as much as possible to allow for everyone to obtain end of season rewards. Since rewards were announced, there has been an increased of players in Twisted Treeline, and we&#039;re confident the queue will be able to handle this increase until the end of the season.\n~~~\nAfter the announcement of  [end of season rewards, ](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/2017-ranked-season-ends-november-7)there has been renewed interest in Twisted Treeline Ranked Flex. We&#039;ve seen a large increase in players taking part in the mode during the last week. \n\nWe&rsquo;re confident that this level of interest in the queue will allow us to temporarily extend the availability of the mode until the end of the season. without impacting matchmaking quality or queue times.\n\n## So from 2017/10/15 until 2017/11/05 Twisted Treeline Flex Ranked will be now be on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 5pm to Midnight AEDT. ##\n\nAfter 2017/11/05, we will analyse the impact of this change and make a decision around availability in preseason.  Good luck with your final push up the ranks!\n\n~~~\n\nTo get all the info about when which queues are on check out the [Queue Schedule post](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/wgM0WBsO-queue-schedule-updated-feb-8th).\n\nPlease keep sharing feedback with us around queue times - and support your favourite queue by playing it. We want to have as much availability of queues as possible, while keeping a high quality of matchmaking and low queue times - and your feedback helps us reach the best possible outcomes!","replies":[{"poster":"PurpIe","date":"2017-10-15T04:48:19.994+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"YAYY!!\n\nMy gold + Twisted Treeline dreams are achievable now !!\n\nTY rito :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-15T03:57:33.963+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"It's almost like there was never that big an issue with draft queues and your removal of it was purely for bad reasons.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-15T11:01:29.507+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'm certain you've been around for this discussion before and seen us talk about the issues.

This is the primary reason we saw it possibly working here. Even still, OCE's taste for draft doesn't come anywhere near close to other regions. But it is enough to continue to test the limits of the queue for now.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-10-15T23:58:11.409+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":4,"body":"Yeah sure whatever but here are the facts.\n\nDraft was removed because of teambuilder (sure you tried saying that it wasn't because of this, but it was so blatantly obvious).\n\nTeambuilder failed.\n\nYou didn't put draft back in.\n\n2 years later you are just now putting draft back on, and realizing that like we were telling you, there was nothing wrong with draft in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-16T00:29:20.285+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":2,"body":"You got two facts right: Teambuilder failed, and we didn't bring back draft. The rest is your opinion.\n\nDraft was removed at the recommendation of matchmaking experts in Central Riot. We were the first region to start doing limited time queues due to our low population, and there wasn't a good precedent for what the teams in Central were seeing happen to Draft. Imagine a line going down and to the right at a sharp angle, that was Draft.\nMost OCE players showed us they didn't want draft anymore when they stopped playing the queue, just like Teambuilder. Sure there might have been a die-hard group of Draft players that could have kept it running a few hours a week, and if I could go back and had my way I would have put Draft up 1 night a week because that's how much it would have been able to sustain at the rate it was going, but at least it would have still been around.\n\nTeambuilder went live in OCE because we believed it was a better Blind experience and wanted to give it a shot. Problem is it required 5 times as many players in queue as Blind pick would to achieve minimum queue health. So we would have required at least half of the Blind pick players to switch to it to make it really healthy all week. Draft had so few players in it that removing it would have had a negligible effect on the health of Teambuilder. It was a non-factor, plain and simple.\n\nTeambuilder definitely stayed up longer than it should have and is what happens when people slowly drain out of a queue. It becomes almost impossible to find a game. This is why queues are restricted or removed and it should be a memorable example of why, for instance, TT isn't on every day all day and why Draft was removed.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-10-16T01:55:07.030+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having Twisted treeline on weekends has actually made me return to league of legends from other games.

I have dodged queue all but one game and kept ending up with support (sorry to lengthen other people's queues, but I wanted mid for a change).\n\nI understand that support isn't an often preferred role but if I am going to be placed as support all the time I may as well have it as my primary preference. It almost feels like my mid preference isn't there. I am almost tempted to simply choose mid then top as my preference so that I don't always get filled into support (even though top isn't something I want).\n\nI just feel like if you get shoved into your secondary preference all the time like support but really wanted to play your first preference such as mid, it doesn't really happen since other people want mid so you get shifted to support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gol Acheron","date":"2017-10-16T07:20:33.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank god my favourite game mode is finally more playable! {{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ren","date":"2017-10-15T07:03:55.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SeemsGood","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-10-16T21:37:45.617+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I know it's a long shot, but can we get support gold gen items disabled in tt.
