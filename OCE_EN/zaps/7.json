We&#039;re currently working on a solution to this issue and will update this thread as soon as possible.\n\n**UPDATE: **\n\n**22:30 AEDT**: Loss forgiven has been turned on - and ranked queues are currently disabled. We're currently working on identify the cause of these issues. \n\n**23:15 AEDT**: We've found an issue with an upstream provider and will change-over users on that provider to another provider temporarily. This will have a very small period during which you may be disconnected, but after the changeover should lead to improved reliability.\n\n**00:15 AEDT**:  Our upstream provider has been able to identify and resolve the issue at their end - preventing the need for the changeover from the previous update. As of now, player connectivity appears to have stabilised  and we're now turning off loss forgiven and re-enabling ranked.\n","replies":[{"poster":"boba","date":"2016-03-17T12:09:03.845+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"so \"Loss forgiven has been turned on\" doesn't help any of us that reported it in the first place right as it is not retroactive?","replies":[{"poster":"BLAZE IT FGT 42O","date":"2016-03-17T14:09:19.120+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wanted to +1 this, those of us unlucky enough to experience the disconnects before loss forgiven was turned on are just SOL?","replies":[{"poster":" Nai Khanomtom","date":"2016-03-18T00:04:25.500+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately that's how it works... {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Im JuCi","date":"2016-03-17T11:14:53.740+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":1,"body":"Thank you.
