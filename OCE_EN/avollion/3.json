Unfortunately another teammate of ours(ADC) wanted jungle how ever our jungler didn&#039;t want to go ADC and nor did I. So this player decides he will then ban the jungle champion that I was prepared to pick for my jungle. Now I decided to dodge and Why? Well it is not because he just banned my pick but he thought it was very funny and he was clearly now in a mood that wanted him to just mess around. I am not in the Queue to mess around in a game of ranked. This has happened to me before and so because I decided to dodge im now waiting a 30 minute timeout all because I didn&#039;t want to lose a game due to somebody messing around. Not only that but I lost 10LP because if I didn&#039;t dodge it would have been -15lp Lets be fair to say its not fair to put some in a situation in which they will lose LP and a full games timeout because of another persons troll mood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please put a system in that dodging from lobby will not lose LP and give a timeout? If required have an option to dodge with review of a game moderator. Much like csgo have their system that they allow players to decide if a player was hacking or intentional feeding by watching a review. \r\n\r\nSurely this is something league of legends needs to fix as its just not fair to anybody trying to get out of these elos.","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-05-15T10:04:58.927+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There has to be a timeout etc for Ranked Dodging because otherwise trolls would just pick Jg and something like top and then they would just dodge whenever they dont get it, thus wasting incredible amounts of time for others. Be realistic, why would Riot remove something that's fair only for the small portion of troll victims when the dodge stops countless other trolls. Riot reviewing games that get reported wouldn't take an instantaneous amount of time so they would get away with it if 1) Riot was busy for an unknown reason or 2) if they just queued up instantly after dodging, thus giving Riot no time to review the reason of them leaving.  \n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Avollion","date":"2016-05-15T10:42:45.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok so what about losing elo? Why should I lose 10LP because another player is going to troll in the lobby?","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-05-19T06:50:20.135+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't leave? It's not like bronze 5 matters. Trolls decrease in frequency the higher elo you go up. Don't play support in Bronze 5, play someone you can carry or spoon feed your team as that doesn't rely on your team having < 2 brain cells. It was YOUR choice to play ranked. It was YOUR choice to leave. It might have been THEIR choice to troll or to decided they didn't want to play their lane but you made your decisions based off that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
