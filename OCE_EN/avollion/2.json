Our main aim right now is to grow a stable and active group of players looking to socialize around the game. However what we would love to do is start with some small scale events that provide some prizes for the winner of each week! The prizes are not huge however I am sure nobody would turn down a free skin or two!\r\n\r\nOur organisation was started up by a small group of friends on the 14/07/2016 and since then we have created several small features accessible to all of the community. This includes our web page, forums and teamspeak server. Over the next few weeks we would like to expand our services to the community by opening up game servers that anybody is welcome to join and be apart of.\r\n\r\nOur community is aimed to be self sufficient this means hiring players of their favoured game to take an influential role to help control the community in times of need.\r\n\r\nWhat can Sector Four offer you?\r\nWe aim to offer anybody a place that they can come and relax in without knowing that they won&#039;t be judged by others, We want to open the opportunities for friendships by providing real time talk servers for people to join and chat to people who are also playing the same games or listen to the same music! With a fantastic forums you can keep upto date with events happening weekly across multiple games that can even provide prizes for taking part!\r\n\r\nOur Teamspeak server is a huge part of what we are and it has no limitations on who can join! If you are interested in just hanging out with people then drop by using the following address: ts66.gameservers.com:9155\r\n\r\nOur Forums are a continuously updated place in which we provide news and updates revolving around our games that you love to play! Make sure you sign up and get involved on all the latest action over at www.Sectorfour.co\r\n\r\nWe are aiming to create weekly events and tournaments that offer prizes and statuses throughout the community servers.\r\n\r\nWhat does Sector Four get from me joining?\r\n\r\nWhen you join our community you are opening us to a wider community and us knowing that you are here enjoying your time means that we get the\r\nsatisfaction of running this organisation.\r\n\r\nDo the Founding Partners of Sector Four earn money?\r\n\r\nWe are a non-profit organisation which means anything that gets given to us we put straight back into the organisation to grow further.","replies":[{"poster":"KurrgaN","date":"2016-07-18T17:00:23.818+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey man  add me I'm keen to play with more people its people that make the games.","replies":[{"poster":"Avollion","date":"2016-07-18T23:57:31.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly that!
