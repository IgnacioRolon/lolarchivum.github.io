I waited my 10 minutes and played my 5 games only to just play my first non low priority game and disconnect due to an ISP failure. I was able to reconnect but 10 minutes late. We lost the game and I am now in a 20 minute lower priority queue. Why? I reconnected to the game and made an attempt at winning it. I did not self willingly disconnect from my last game my internet service provider failed and I still made it back only to play 20 minutes, lose and then be placed in to the low priority queue with a higher ban timer. How is this fair?\r\na response from a Red would be appreciated.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-05T23:38:56.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems really unfair, I know, but if Riot decide to make exceptions like this slide then trolls and toxic players will just use this as an excuse to whenever they purposefully disconnect from a game.\n\nRight now, the Leavebuster system is doing a (overly) great job of discouraging people from disconnecting from games.","replies":[]}]}
