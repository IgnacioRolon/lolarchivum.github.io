One of the things i&#039;ve always respected about Blizzard is the time they take to put out content that&#039;s above the usual, and i respect you guys for taking a similar approach in this regard.\r\n\r\nI know it doesn&#039;t mean much from a lowly pleb such as myself, but you guys are doing awesome. Thank you so much and have a wonderful day ;)\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[]}
