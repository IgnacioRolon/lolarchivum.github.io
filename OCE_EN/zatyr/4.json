With a wall leap on the shortest of cooldowns (forshame talon...you are nothing, watch this), a fizz e mid ult (we all now how annoying and unhealthy that feels), and a 90% slow (but oh no lets nerf Rylai&#039;s), she is quite frankly OVERPOWERED.\r\n\r\nNow all of this being said, her champion design is amazing, but the current state in which she exists just feels frustrating and unhealthy to play against.\r\n\r\nI remember playing her for the first time and thinking &quot;this is busted, rito plz nerf&quot;, well that was a while ago now.....so here we are.\r\n\r\nRiot Games, i sincerely implore you, please, for the love of all that is healthy for this game, PLEASE, nerf Camille.\r\n\r\nPreferably a longer cooldown on her wall dash, like a lot longer, a slight nerf to q damage may be a help, and maybe not a NINETY PERCENT SLOW.\r\n\r\nAnyways, Thank you for your time, and I&#039;d like to say at this point, I do truly appreciate the time and effort the team at Riot has put into keeping league a fresh and enjoyable game.\r\n\r\nCheers guys,\r\nZatyr.","replies":[{"poster":"Mortis Ex","date":"2017-01-08T11:05:38.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Huge mobility, gets a shield for a % of her max hp, does true damage which negates building resistances and does %HP damage which negates building HP to counter true damage, has a displacement ult that you can use like a Gragas ult to split a team up and the target cannot escape from except in very few interactions with other champs (stops Ekko and Vi R which went through Azirs wall) can jump over almost any wall in the game, oh and lets give her a ranged slow so she can peel chase while waiting for her enormous dash to come back up which also heals her for a % of her HP which is almost double Darius heal and isnt capped like his is.\n\nDid I forget anything?\n\nOverall if they remove her %hp or her true damage that would give a build path vs her, atm there is none except Deaths Dance and Phantom Dancer which is not optimal for a lot of champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2017-01-08T07:09:23.823+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think Camille is only OP in a 1v1 fight which seems fair but may seem unfair while laning against her.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-08T06:56:32.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They already have damage nerfs to her q and cd nerf to her e on the pbe, 7.1 patch was due a couple of weeks ago, but with the mass testing they are doing they extended it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2017-01-08T04:00:03.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok yes I agree she is busted but there are ways to trash a Camille and champions that can absolutely ruin her day {{champion:78}} {{champion:114}} {{champion:126}} {{champion:54}} this is from my experience, anyway the thing they really need to do is nerf her e hit bot it is larger then a shen taunt","replies":[]}]}
