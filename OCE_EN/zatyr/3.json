Can we bring back the old snare mechanic, i mean its semi busted, but there&#039;s a reason seeing Nid jg on the enemy team is generally a free win, and i for one am pretty fucking sad about this.\r\n\r\nLike, she&#039;s been nerfed for the old meta, slightly reworked/butchered, and then buffed to no avail, but i think its time for something to bring her back through into the meta again, and the old snare mechanic i feel is just the ticket.\r\n\r\nFor one, her early clear is trash, her late clear is excellent, but getting there before your team is 0 11 is near on impossible. the basic jist is, giving her snare doesnt exactly affect the late game as ur dps vs camps is one shot worthy, but in the early game makes the difference between a good clear and just getting shit on by krugs.\r\n\r\nIt wouldnt affect the power of her laning (which is trash anyways, let&#039;s face it, but meh), as it only affects the jg camps, but i&#039;m reasonably sure at this point its whats needed to bring back the cougar lady....and let her actually be of some value to her team, not just another squishy for the enemy team to chow down on.\r\n\r\nBasically u cant have an early game roam pressure champ, with no early game, due to clear ability, give her the snare, she has clear ability.\r\n\r\nAlso see Nidalee jungle win rate.\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-07-16T04:19:15.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, she is awful atm.  Her early clear is quite decent, you just have to know so many little tricks to do it well that it's the excluesive property of high elo Nidalee mains.   I can manage a pretty decent and safe clear with her, though it does mean concentrating a LOT on the clear, so I'm not watching the lanes.\n\nPutting the trapsnare back might help the bad nidalees pretend that they aren't throwing games by playing her, and would increase her winrate for those not expert with her.  It would give somewhat less bonus to the nidalee gods, so it might not be so bad, I suspect I wouldn't like the fact that I have to dodge more jungle nidalees in ranked though, as her core REAL problems (poor scaling, no cc, falls off super hard lategame, beyond useless when behind) would remain.\n\nShe's disappeared from pro play completely, and could probably use a buff.  She's also incredibly fun to play, so any buff that makes her much easier to operate with may result in a lot of tragic low elo feeding, and getting a worse reputation than she has now.  \n\nPersonally, I would like it if she was 'bruiserised', and lost some ratios in return for better base damages.  This would make her a bit more forgiving when diving, whilst calming the 'nuclear tipped spear' issues when she is ahead and glass cannon, because we have to calm the extent of her feast/famine gameplay if shes ever to be playable by non smurfs below diamond.  I suspect calming the spear range multiple to +1.0 times base damage from +1.5  might help (with an increase in its base to compensate).\n\nI wish I (and the balance team) could find a solution to her issues.  Trap restoration of snare might be part of it, but I wouldn't expect it to do that much to her core issues.  Currently it serves as a sort of 'gateway' to keep players away from her if they don't know her tricks, as the jungle craps on them early enough that it's obvious they shouldn't play her.\n\nShe always was bad at low ELO, and always will be, baring a complete rework, where she becomes a cc laden tank or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Zatyr","date":"2017-07-16T06:35:28.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what your saying is you have to play her perfectly or the keyboard face rolling lee sin will always have a better clear, and basically better everything.
