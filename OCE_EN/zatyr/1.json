You commented on my post and this actually has gave me some hope I mat get my account back. I really hope that the time is taken to look into my situation and I can get my ban lifted as well.\n\nHonestly mate this has restored a little faith back to me from riot. \n\nGehirn I'm glad you looked into this for this guy. It's super uncommon I'm sure for this to happen, just glad you didn't let it sit and had a closer look.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-18T08:45:28.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nope because i don't bot.","replies":[{"poster":"Zatyr","date":"2017-02-18T11:01:01.434+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly mate, neither did i, but yet somehow, here we are.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-02-18T05:44:57.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get constantly chat restricted and 2 week bans for being annoying, and coping a lot of reports.
