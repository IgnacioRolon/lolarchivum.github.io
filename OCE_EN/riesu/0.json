So I was wondering even though the event is over, is it still possible to obtain the skin through crafting, or something? \r\n\r\nI tried having a look around for some answers but couldn&#039;t find any real straightforward answers.\r\n\r\nThanks!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-12-11T07:59:52.948+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately, you cant obtain the skin anymore through conventional means.\n\nBut _(as it was just pointed out to me recently)_ they will be making a return into the game at a later stage:\nhttps://twitter.com/Mortdog/status/1069717611825360896\n\nHowever, it is unlikely that the border will also be making a comeback, as borders don't seem to usually work that way.\n\nIt may be possible to still obtain the skin through re-rolls in hextech crafting, but because of this post I would have my doubts about that:\nhttps://twitter.com/mortdog/status/1044646318767886336?lang=en\n\nHe specifically says _\"Getting the prestige Kai'sa skin won't be possible without paying somewhere.\"_\n\nSeeing that re-rolling is free as long as you have some skin shards to spare.  His comment would suggest that it cant be re-rolled.\n\n\n#**TL;DR:** \nYou will be able to obtain the skin at a later date.  \nIf you are really desperate, try re-rolling your skin shards, but I cant promise that will work, and even if it does, the chances of getting the specific skin you want in RNG are low.","replies":[{"poster":"Riesu","date":"2018-12-11T08:22:08.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply!\n\nGuess I will need to wait till a later date to see what happens.
