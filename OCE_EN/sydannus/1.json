Work experience is a program where a group of 10th grade students are sponsored by their schools to attend a workplace environment where they are to learn what being a part of the work force is like. These students are shown the basics of how the business is operated and they get to look over the shoulder of people who have managed to grab a job in the area in which the students aspire to joining. These students attend for 4-5 days and work free of charge. Riot Games is a company which has shown little to no interest in this program in the past but I believe that your company has an opportunity to change and invest in young minds. League of Legends is a hugely successful game which leaves Riot Games with the funds to either continue to improve on it and hope that it survives constant competition, this is something that this game has done remarkably well and become a huge success off of. I strongly believe that with the rise of E-sports and gaming in general, Riot Games could continue to grow, as long as they plan for the future and not just the present.\n\nWhy you should consider me for this program:\n\nWhen I find something that I enjoy, whether in game or out, I am able to put my mind to it extremely quickly and learn new things with a strong sense of persistence, (This seems to end up on literally every report card I have received since 5th grade) Some elective classes that I have taken in the past or am currently taking are: IST - Information and Software Technology, (This course is all about creating and designing our own robots to be entered into the Robocup competition, or any other purpose that we have in mind. I attend a school that is nationally recognized for this course, the first year that it ran we had a group of students place third nationally during Robocup, these students then went on to an international level.) Graphics, (I took this course in year 9  and we learnt how to use software such as adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, we learnt about the composition of an artwork and made our own company logos. Some examples of my work are found here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XIKfVHapiuDeR9dc4kJU5JH30KbJHg1xe4r6oSQXa9o/edit?usp=sharing) Writing to Publish, (I have always found immense joy in story writing and as a kid I used to write my own books, I am currently learning to write a full length novel as I have already proven that I can write in elaborate detail and exhibit a sense of emotion in my reader.) Commerce - Go Start It (I selected commerce for this year and was surprised to be selected for a special project called Just Start It, I am currently a part of the first Sydney class to take part in this program, in this program we split into groups and have to design our own business idea from scratch, this idea is then put to the test when we have to pitch our ideas and products and investors looking to invest in young minds.) and finally, electronics. (During this course we learnt how to build circuit boards, including the etching. We made our own alarm clocks and robots from scratch.)\n\nI am well aware that making it into this program with Riot Games would be highly unlikely for me as I am sure that you have had many great potentials request this sort of program and been turned down. However I feel like it is time for Riot Games to look towards the future of their company and League of Legends as a whole. If you so choose you can contact me in game or on this post and I will provide you with further contact information such as my e-mail and Phone number.\n\nI sincerely thank you for your consideration, \n\nSydannus (had to lose the 1 N when I transferred my account from NA to OCE... Still salty &#039;bout it :P)\n\nPS: I LOVE THIS GAME!!!","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-02-10T00:46:45.134+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sydanus,\n\nThis is a really cool post. The first thing I would say that going to this much effort and putting yourself out there is really cool. The detail and personalisation you're putting into the application will help you stand out.\n\nI also had no idea what the Robocup is and looked it up - seems awesome! Wish that existed when I was at school.\n\nUnfortunately though, we don't currently offer work experience positions at Riot OCE. Something you could look into is the internship program in North America. It's for university-age students, but something you could look at in a few years: http://www.riotgames.com/careers","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-10T01:00:00.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sydanus!\n\nThere's also an internship program with the Europe team as well!

Hence why they also turn down people asking for a tour of the office. There are some things that we just aren't allowed to see! Sure, with work experience, since there are contracts being signed, they could get you to sign an NDA, but that's at the discretion of them if they think it's worth the large effort and time needed.\n\nEither way, best of luck :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Darthski","date":"2016-02-09T13:21:24.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hope you get the opportunity kid.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-02-09T20:16:25.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man.
