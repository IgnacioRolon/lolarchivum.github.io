However it remains an issue and to be honest I just wanted to try and place it back on the boards. So I&#039;m going to share my two cents with all those who choose to read this. While it has been previously stated that Key Fragment drop rates will lower the more fragments that you gather I feel like this system should probably be revisited. Even if only in the matter of drop rates. As soon as Hextech Crafting dropped I spammed matches, holidays started and Ascension returned so I got 3 keys really quick. Since this system has been implemented I have been leftover with 3 chests to this date and despite it being holidays, and despite the fact that I am playing hours on end nearly everyday I have not received even a fragment in over a week of non-stop playing. As soon as the Holidays end I&#039;m not going to be able to play nearly as much, so the fact that I am unable to gather the keys that are required to open another chest at the current rate that I am playing concerns me of the fact that I am going to soon have a whole pile of chests stacked up but I will not be able to use them. While I understand perfectly that Riot Games intends to profit off of the system, it could be done in a slightly more mutually beneficial way. At the moment. Riot is using player frustration, whether intentional or not, as the mechanic that convinces people to drop money on keys. However a way that Riot could not only please the player base more and possibly benefit economically as well, is to allow players to earn their keys quite comfortably and quickly. Players then would be tempted to buy chests and keys after they have earned their assigned keys. However there are still issues with this solution, hardcore players will feel like they are earning the keys to quickly and will complain about the lack of chests that are earn-able. This could be solved by careful balancing of ratios. I feel like this is what you tried to do with the current Hextech Crafting system, however the curve is too steep and it just frustrates the players. The main cause of frustration for people like me with all of the champions is not only the fact that it can take upwards of 30 hours of grinding per shard. But you need three of them. Aaaaand then you get a champion shard. This shard is completely useless. A couple of suggestions that I have include:\r\n* Essence becomes a single value\r\nChampions and skins can be enchanted into essence, not just champion or cosmetic essence. This allows newer players to get champions when they are not yet interested in skins and it allows veterans to at least have value in every box. I for one am not going to spend money on a system where 50% of the time I get nothing.\r\n* Rerolls across types\r\nYou can reroll 3 champions into a skin or 3 skins into a champion, or even 2 champions and 1 skin shard. This benefits both new and veteran players for the same reasons listed above.\r\n* Summoner icons can be disenchanted like other shards\r\nI am not suggesting that they hold the same value as a champion or skin shard but this at least lets the player have a greater illusion of control over their inventory. \r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the suggestions that I feel most frustrated about the lack of their existence. I believe that implementing this system would not only make people feel better about dropping money on Hextech Crafting, but it would also encourage people who despise the current system due to its seemingly one-sided nature (I realise that the fact we are getting anything is great and all but the current system doesn&#039;t feel like we are receiving a gift, rather it feels like we are being milked for profit.) Yes, Hextech Crafting is intended to be profitable, but it was also supposed to make the players feel good. The possibilities of getting something great are very much there and I quite like that about the system, unfortunately it feels like a grind fest where you never get anywhere.\r\n\r\nThank you to all who made it this far,\r\nSydannus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: I&#039;m 8 RP short of a key and It&#039;s killing me... soo....

That would be a decent way to get an idea of what the approximate drop rate has been, and maybe a clue towards who's been lucky or unlucky.\n\nI'll be honest, I've picked up 12 key frags since hextech crafting started and while I think that's more than fair it sounds like I've been extremely lucky. Maybe you've just been extremely unlucky, and if that's the case I'm sure there are many more on both sides of the spectrum.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-17T09:07:57.493+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've unlocked 4 chests (at least) during this whole thing, so i don't honestly understand the complaints.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-17T19:13:36.221+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As it is, I haven't received a single key fragment in well  over a week despite having won plenty of games across that period, and  I currently have 3 chests acquired through the mastery system, Surely this isn't an intended effect of Riot's new Hextech crafting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vanilla Bread","date":"2016-04-17T11:27:12.565+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"why do the guns look like dicks?","replies":[{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-04-17T14:43:38.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leave it to SoFlo, it was just meant to look derpy because...

This makes them far more likely to become medium or hardcore users, who will buy skins and play more.\n\nIf **Riot** had a linear key drop rate, then we would have a grind-fest where hardcore players have all the cool stuff, and casual players wouldn't really benefit. \n\nWith our current system a player who plays 1 game a day, might earn the same amount of keys as a players who plays 4. This way **Riot** doesn't loose heavy profits and turn the game in to a grind-fest, while still keeping a strong incentive for casual players to keep coming back.\n\nI know it can be frustrating sometimes when they keys just wont come, but please understand that **Riot** has to pay for new content, employees and servers.\n\nI hope this cleared things up.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-04-17T09:23:51.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can very much appreciate what you are saying but the low drop rate is what inadvertently makes it feel like such a grind, at least for me. During school I am a considerably more casual player and the fact that I cannot get keys to open chests at the rate that I am playing now then I do not see myself earning the keys to keep up to date on my chests when school starts back up. This and the fact that despite all of the grinding that it takes to earn a single key, it could be a champion shard is frustrating. Just as earning a skin shard for a champion that you don't own can be frustrating for a newer player who just wants to try all of the different champions in the game. This is the core of my argument and I hope you can at least see the merit in my points just as I can see the merits in what you are suggesting. A possible compromise could be that the drop rate slows down when you have one or chests remaining and only slows severely once you have already earned the same amount of keys as the possible amount of crates that you could earn. Because right now, 30 hours of game play, much of it in Ascension, which was a faster to complete game mode for a single fragment is too much when I still have 3 crates unopened.\n\nHowever as I state here I can very much see the merits of this system for newer players, I have a smurf which I am currently trying to level but the system doesn't feel like it is working for me in that sense either. I believe that the reason behind this is because when I get a skin shard I don't really care about it unless it is for Lucian. And I cannot turn my skin shards into champions. So this has negative affects on both sides of the scale.\n\nThanks for taking time out of your day to view my post and comment but your response feels like it misses the point that I am trying to make.\nI hope this has allowed you to understand my point of view and the fact that I am not looking at this from just my perspective, I always make it a challenge to view decisions from other peoples perspectives. I can completely understand the points that you describe but I feel like the counterarguments outweigh the current decision from all angles, for hardcore players, casual players and even Riot themselves who stand to be seen in a more possible light while making money at the same time.\nI thank you for your consideration,\nSydannus","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-04-17T09:26:40.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">During school I am a considerably more casual player and the fact that I cannot get keys to open chests at the rate that I am playing now then I do not see myself earning the keys to keep up to date on my chests when school starts back up.\n\nSo question how often do you play while your at school?\n\nI ask because how the keys are setup is they are based off wins and reset monthly, so even if you can say get a couple of games each weekend during school you should get the upwards limit of what you can get in a month.","replies":[{"poster":"Sydannus","date":"2016-04-17T10:12:34.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Right now the way that I am grinding I am not receiving anywhere near the soft cap of keys, therefore when I am at school and mainly just play on weekends I won't have much hope for actually getting the keys that I need.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"dividedkong pow","date":"2016-07-04T21:34:49.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Three months down the road.

Buy making it easier for players to earn keys Riot would also earn good publicity as well as potentially making profit in the long run. The exact numbers would come down to market research but my biggest issue with this is that you can spend ages grinding and get something completely useless. This again would benefit Riot if the players knew that they would be getting something of at least the type that they want or at the very least something that holds value.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2016-04-18T05:52:52.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well  i have a 4 chest and im stuck witb 2 key fragments for last 2 weeks.
