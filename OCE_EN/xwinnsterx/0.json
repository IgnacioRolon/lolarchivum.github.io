It is extremely difficult to play as everything freezes in team fights and when it unfreezes I&#039;m already dead. Abilities and spells are also very delayed by atleast 5 seconds. I also glitch around the map alot because of this. I&#039;ve lost most games because of this and I don&#039;t know how to fix this problem. Anyone know how?","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-03-23T06:20:53.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, \n\nSorry for the delayed response.\n\nCould you please download [WinMTR](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/winmtr/WinMTR-v092.zip) and run a traceroute to the following IP address (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export the results as text and reply back with them (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this.)\n\n>103.240.227.5\n\nCould I also get you to run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results page.","replies":[{"poster":"XWinnsterX","date":"2016-03-23T08:19:13.071+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=SephirothSG,realm=OCE,application-id=ElA0rvVL,discussion-id=58uA8nXc,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-03-23T06:20:53.539+0000)\n>\n> Hey there, \n> \n> Sorry for the delayed response.\n> \n> Could you please download [WinMTR](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/winmtr/WinMTR-v092.zip) and run a traceroute to the following IP address (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export the results as text and reply back with them (You can use [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) for this.)\n> \n> Could I also get you to run the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post back with a link to your results page.\n\n Here is my results from WinMTR which I have uploaded to Pastebin http://pastebin.com/ZpavgMdW\n And here is my ICSI netalyzer results http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=43ca253f-30007-b101294e-5c9c-441f-a319.
