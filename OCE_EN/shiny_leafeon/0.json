First, sustain champions were found to be too difficult to deal with on average and thus &quot;balanced&quot; to the point of being borderline-unplayable.  Then, that idea was scratched and a different approach was taken, and so here we are with what looks to be the age of Grievous Wounds coming up.  Now, I myself am not a fan of sustain champions as many of them are very frustrating to deal with, but I know this change is a bit too much for them.  The issue with changes meant to weaken sustain is that sustain isn&#039;t overpowered in the first place, it&#039;s just annoying.  Nerfing something for being annoying doesn&#039;t make it &quot;fair,&quot; it makes it unplayable.  But, of course, the fact that this is a GAME has to be taken into consideration too: it&#039;s meant to be fun and as such, unfun elements should be eliminated or adjusted until they are fun.\r\n\r\nSo, in light of this, leaving sustain alone isn&#039;t a good option, but nerfing it like this destroys any champions who happen to rely on it.  But fear not, for I have an idea to fix this!\r\n\r\nCurrently, with how things seem to be going, sustain will be better during the laning phase if anything, but will be absolutely destroyed later on in the game.  So, why not give sustain champions a way to transition their healing into the late game?  Here&#039;s my suggestion: in short, a shield.\r\n\r\nIt would be an item you can purchase in the shop that gives normal stats like any other item, but it would give one more thing.  It would convert all self-healing done into a shield, rather than actually healing.  This would only apply when damaging champions and would not be affected by grievous wounds.  It would work something like Bloodthirster&#039;s shield, giving a shield equal to the HP you would have gained from lifesteal and being able to go over your max HP(perhaps with some form of cap.)  This way, if grievous wounds are rampant on the enemy team and you&#039;re playing Aatrox, you don&#039;t have to worry about being absolutely useless, you can still get some use out of all your healing!\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s a suggested build path and final item stats to give a general idea of what I&#039;m talking about.\r\n\r\n{{item:1028}}  + {{item:1053}}  + {{item:3145}}  + 1,000 gold = ???\r\n\r\n500 health\r\n15% Lifesteal\r\n15% Spellvamp\r\nUnique Passive: ??? - Self-healing effects no longer work and instead, 80% of all self-healing that would be done is converted into a shield that is unaffected by grievous wounds and can go over maximum HP.  Shield will quickly decay when out of combat for 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nNote: I know the stats there may not be very good in practice, but keep in mind this is just for the sake of demonstration.  It would fall on Riot to balance such an item and figure out a build path in the end, as I am nothing more than a lowly community member.  The basic idea is that a shield is easier to balance than sustain, as shown by there never being issues with the many shields already in the game, so this allows hard-counter options to be introduced against sustain champions while still letting them remain viable without being overpowered or frustrating to deal with.  If their healing is being oppressed to the point of them being useless, they can choose to give up their ability to heal and transition into a decent tank.\r\n\r\nP.S.
