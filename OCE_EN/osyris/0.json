The majority of my game-time has been spent JG but I found you need a great deal of TOTAL game knowledge to pull it off in ranked. ADC is another role I&#039;ve enjoyed a lot and it was the first role I ever got into. The interaction with your Support is really enjoyable I find and very satisfying when you hit a nice combo together and crush your opponents. So I&#039;d love to become a high level ADC but have limited time in my day so I figure the best way to improve would be to play ranked with a high level Support who can give me feedback and help me sharpen my skills.\r\n\r\nRight now I&#039;m really getting into Jhin, he feels pretty natural for me and it seems he has a lot of depth. I&#039;m pretty strong with MF but I&#039;ve mastered her so I only like to use her when I don&#039;t really have any other choice, so the XP continues to flow. I can also use Ashe reasonably well, I&#039;d prefer Jhin but Ashe would be my second pick. I have Skype and Teamspeak so we can communicate, I&#039;m generally on after 6pm and in the morning if I&#039;m not working.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-05-30T10:37:51.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"friend me and we can play when im on, usually im on weekends","replies":[]},{"poster":"DV Arjay","date":"2017-05-27T17:49:54.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mate\nIm a Top and Supp main in Plat elo \nClimbing the ladders with irelia/darius/jax for top\nand Karma/Blitz/Brand\n\nI can teach you how to get better for sure\nIll add you on my 2nd account\nDG AU2K1N6","replies":[{"poster":"Osyris","date":"2017-05-28T00:40:56.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks mate I'd appreciate that!
