I based it of the &#039;dark souls skins&#039; (Iron inquisitor kayle,black scourge singed , cursed revenant nocturn  and undertaker Yorik) and tried to go for a sort of darksouls vibe. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nThere lies a certain cruelty in hope, that it is always the last to die. Those who are too stubborn, too unwilling or perhaps too stupid to know that this world, that Valoran, is going to die, cling to it spouting their beliefs, taking up arms or trying to convince themselves that this is all just a bad dream. Yet even hope itself is pointless. Because when four heralds of death itself march across the land, hope, like everything else, dies. And I, shall be the one end it all.\r\nFirst came the angel. Clad in black, hiding her face behind a porcelain white mask that wept blood, she held her massive sword in a single hand and soared over the land on blood soaked wings. \r\nAnd war followed in her wake. No one knows where exactly she came from; many saw her, yet few knew what her coming truly meant. Those who did were silenced, called cowards or lunatics by the very people they were trying to protect.\r\nFirst she soared over Noxus, enticing a terrible blood lust that horrified even the Noxians themselves, yet they could do nothing to stop their own march across the lands, burning and pillaging all in their way. \r\nNext she swept over Demacia, inspiring the stalwart soldiers in their shining plate, giving them visions of triumphing over a terrible foe. And as the great armies of Noxus and Demacia met in terrible battle, the Angel flew elsewhere. And everywhere she went, violence followed. Riots in Zaun, civil war in the Freljord, pirates raiding Ionian shores, and soldiers of sand soaking the Shuriman desert in the blood of nomads.\r\n\tA year of blood shed followed. Countless killed. Many smaller towns or hamlets were destroyed. The men forced into fighting, the women and child consumed by it. The rest were weakened, and begun fighting for what little scraps of food that could gather, and it was then what few wise men that still lived came to a horrific realization, yet now there was none to hear them. This angel, this bringer of war and carnage was not the calamity, merely the herald of something far, far worse.\r\n\tIt was much more subtle than its predecessor, no grand flights around Valoran for all to see. None truly saw it, yet all saw it&rsquo;s hand, and all heard its voice:\r\n&lsquo;Darkness&hellip;&rsquo;\r\nIt swept its way thought the countryside, a mere shadow in the night.  What few farmers could still tend to their crops and livestock, found their fields shredded, livestock butchered, with a cruel laughter drifting on the night winds. Some took to defending their livelihoods, and they too were found in the morning, bodies slashed to ribbons, their faces frozen in terror. Similar fates soon spread to hunters and fishermen, setting out to see, never to return, or hunters venturing out in search of game, returning empty handed and gibbering wrecks, describing a hood specter that now stalked their nightmares. And like the Angel, this being spread around the land, striking terror into all who did not live behind strong city halls.\r\nFear was not the only thing this being spread. The specter&rsquo;s haunt had brought a famine like never before. With farms and gathers unable to produce food, soon even the rich began fighting tooth and nail for even a scrap of food. The poor wasted away, then the common folk, and finally the rich. Only the vermin did not suffer. Instead they feasted upon the fallen. The fallen of war, the fallen of terror, the fallen of famine. They grew, they multiplied, and they gorged themselves on the weak.\r\nLike the Angel, the specter was simply a herald for something worse. And as the people wasted away and the vermin grew strong, a great plague started to spread. \r\nMost think it started from Zuan, a new Chem-weapon that was supposed to be used in the ceaseless fighting. They would only be half right. The true cause would be a simple man, driven to insanity by his craft and tormented by visions of what he could be. The man travelled from place to place, carrying an open coffin on his back, carrying the lid in one hand and a plague mask with crimson eyes over his face. And as he travelled, the disease inside the coffin leaked out, infecting both man and rat alike. The former was brought low by it and the latter was used to spread it. \r\nThose who suffered the illness soon found themselves decaying from the inside, a slow painful death that none could halt, and any pleads of help to the one spreading where simply met with either an insane laugh or mumbling under his breath:\r\n&lsquo;Mix, mix, swirl, mix&hellip;&rsquo;\r\nNearly all were afflicted, and as they all slowly suffered their hope started to fade. \r\nAnd so it came to my turn. As war, famine and pestilence spread their havoc across the land, a common end followed them all. Death.\r\nAnd so this is the way the world ends. Not with a cataclysmic bang that the blue wizard was trying so hard to prevent, nor devoured by the world eater or the other creatures of the void, No. Valoran ends with little more than a whisper as life itself decays all around. \r\nThe black mist carries me across ocean and land. I hear the madding whispers inside of my mind, yet I resist them. I must. \r\nI first come to Ionia, and they greet me like an old friend, long ago accepting that death can be peaceful, a fitting end to a life well lived. I gather their souls into the black mist; their empty bodies soon rise up and join me. Next is Bilgewater, who&rsquo;s people thrash and scream and beg as they try to fight me. It is hopeless. They too join me on our ceaseless march, and follow in my wake. I stroll across the frozen north, the crimson sands, the silent battlefields, and the dying cites, collecting all, the fallen and the yet to fall.\r\nThere is a certain cruelty in hope. It gives strength when perhaps it is better to just lie down and die. Yet here I am, at the end of the world, and I hope&hellip; I hope that one day, long after we, the heralds have turned to naught to dust and nothing that something new may build upon our ashes.\r\nAnd that brings me joy.","replies":[{"poster":"ZVCKK","date":"2017-03-12T12:50:00.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"very nice","replies":[]}]}
