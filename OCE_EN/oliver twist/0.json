Please only add me if you are actually a duo, takes too long to get a new support/adc to create a good synergy and relationship so getting a premade duo saves a lot of time :) If you are a duo do not hesitate to add me no matter what your rank. \r\nIt would be preferable if you can use teamspeak/skype because obviously it helps in communication during games and getting to know one another.\r\n\r\nReally helps a lot if you are confident on a variety of champions to fit in with different team comps and counters. \r\n\r\nWe are a friendly group of people and welcome everyone! Look forward to meeting you and playing some fun games together :D","replies":[{"poster":"greatdeathz","date":"2015-08-25T03:05:20.875+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":":( oliver twist always asking for more","replies":[{"poster":"Oliver Twist","date":"2015-08-25T04:03:38.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pls sir may I have some more bot laners..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ä†olossus","date":"2015-08-25T06:07:09.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a Supp Main and have two Adcs I work with a lot one is super aggressive the other not as much feel free to add me and we'll come on board and see if you like us","replies":[]},{"poster":"inducedshadow","date":"2015-08-24T16:02:07.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets do it ill adc should help me get some prac before the climb","replies":[]}]}
