Also please do the poll I'm not sure either if I should get the digital collectors bundle or if its best to get the starters bundle. Thank you Sears Dragon for your help.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-10T08:22:25.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The champion (Annie) for the skin in the Digital Collectors bundle (Goth Annie) is included in the bundle, so if you bought the bundle you would get both the champion and the skin.\n\nAny bundle that includes a skin will also include the champion, and any content that is already owned in the bundle will be taken off the displayed price automatically.\n\n___\n\nAs for whether the bundle is worth it for you, while there are champions in the Digital Collectors that I would recommend for beginners there are also a bunch that I wouldn't. The starter pack on the other hand is tailored for beginners to have those champs that are easier to learn (though Ryze and Nunu would be exceptions to that in my mind simply due to the climate of the game at the moment).\n\nWhat I did when I eventually wanted Goth Annie, was simply bought all the champions in the Digital Collectors with IP so I was only paying for the skin with real money.\n\nIf you really want a good starter collection of champs and don't want to just roll with the free to play rotation every week, I'd honestly say stick with the Starter Bundle, and come back to the Digital Collectors later when you know more about the game and the champions and choose whether or not you still want it then.\n\nThe Starter Bundle also comes with and EXP and IP boost which will help you get on your way to getting those champs you really want to try without paying any more money for them.","replies":[]}]}
