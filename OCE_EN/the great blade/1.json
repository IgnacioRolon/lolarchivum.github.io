I was very excited to finally see a well laid out concept but it was really disappointing.\n\nI love his passive, it allows for nice trading and isn't as large as a buff. The only thing that I don't like here is the duration, 7 seconds is a very long time in the damage terms of League of Legends. It allows him to trade fairly too well in the early game, invading and counterjunglering would also be fairly too easy.\n\n\nI also liked his Q, but I found it a bit too strong in terms of utility and too weak in terms of damage. With 40% CDR your enemy is given 3.6 seconds to get up to 525 range away from him, that's equal to some ADC's attack range and bigger than Kassadin's R. With the amount of movement speed from his passive and W allows it to be fairly easy to continuously dashing towards enemies and because his passive allows so much early game trading, it's not fairly hard to get ahead, rush a BOTRK and stick on enemies like glue.\n\nThis is the downfall of your concept, just the fact that you put TRUE DAMAGE there was enough to say that you don't know the game too well. It was just disappointing and it wasn't even a huge buff, this is literally one of the weakest abilities in League of Legends in terms of Risk and Reward. You take full damage of everything and you only get some movement speed and attack speed. I'd highly recommend you changing this to bonus damage taken instead of True Damage.\n\nThis is where he gets ironic and just disgusting, you have an ability called quick step and dash. Both mean pretty much the same but ironically your W doesn't even do what it's meant to do. You have 2 steroids and 2 gap closers, your E and Q for gap closers and your W and Passive.\n\nNo. No. No. No. 90% of Current Health really? You also have 5 levels in an ultimate ability, lord save the queen. \n\nEither way, check out Adora :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-08T11:57:52.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont like the title mainly the part *The mobile assasin* all assasins (ive seen) are mobile even off tanks, sorry just nit picky","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-05-06T22:23:07.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so much work put into writing this but its so off. you need to research more of what are the capabilities and plateaus  that each champ have in order for them to be strong and weak, but not too much of either, in most scenarios on the field. he doesnt seem to require skill anyway, in fact this is probably the most unoriginal champion ive ever seen. hook shot, dash and skillshot, yeah i havent seen those abilities 20 million times. you call him a mobile assassin, hes only an assassin because you made him so weak. also, all assassins are mobile, thats what makes them an assassin, they need to get into close range of an enemy that deals a lot of damage/cc and kill/disable them before they can do anything against your team. also also, we dont need another fucking katarina running amuck, how dare you suggest such an abomination as a copy of katarina","replies":[]}]}
