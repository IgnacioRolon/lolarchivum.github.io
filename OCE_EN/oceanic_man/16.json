I have a confession to make. I have been sharing my acc with a close friend =/.... got perma for it even tho in the &quot;TaC&quot; it says 2 week suspension but wuteves its not like riot will listen to me. I went over to a friends house and played with him for a little bit ( not naming anyone btw ) he was gold 5 and i was B3. we duo together and it was fun. Then i asked him if we could duo till i get to silver and he said why dont he just play on my acc and help me and i might even learn a thing or two from watching him play. He played a few games got to B2 and then he told me that since he had uni he could help me play in the night while i improve in the morning and i did. woke up 1 day and i got perma. According to what the TaC says this was my first offence and and am only suppose to get a 2 week suspension and didn&#039;t rly know why i jump straight to perma. I&#039;m not on the boards to get sympathy, i just hope that riot will see this and talk to me about the situation.  I feel like the perma came out of nowhere. I&#039;m not saying i shouldn&#039;t get banned, im just saying i shouldn&#039;t get insta-permaban. Even riot don&#039;t follow their own rules. If anyone can get a rioter to see this post and get them to talk to me...would appreciate that","replies":[{"poster":"Devils Advocate","date":"2016-04-21T18:07:56.466+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"had to delete a few openers as it all sits around the obvious T&C's with account sharing.\n\nIt may also have to do with the fact that your i.p address was from one location regularly, to suddenly switching i.ps for a long period of time, then back to the original i.p\n\nit wasn't just done in a custom/aram/norm but a ranked. Your account was shared intentionally to benefit yourself. We can agree to an extent that its not the end of the world nor worth having your account perma banned for. \n\nNot flaming, just laying out the series of events.\n\nRegarding the I.P thing... have you considered the fact, that when you and your friend play from seperate locations, riot has your i.p addy's from those games, maybe not actively humanly aware at the time, but the data is there to be checked, its noted that the bulk of your games represent those addresses. They realise these are your home/work/schools etc. They suddenly realize two different accounts playing from the same i.p, both friends, they see that both are on at the same time, then the \"friend\" account is the only one logged on... from the host i.p... Now as you confess, log in one day and your banned. So it wasn't just that night that after you left, it was that night, the next and a few more/couple of weeks more... So not as T&C's, not only are you sharing your account. Your boosting your ranked elo. Through i.p's that match records.... \n\n\nare you starting to see it's not just the sharing? and that the evidence when laid out in front of you, is a bit more damning than just a social account share for an afternoon because perhaps you've got different champ pools etc.\n\nI'll confess on my original account, it was common for a group of friends and i to go to a net cafe, we all enjoyed certain champs at different moments. We'd play musical chairs with the computers and use the account that had the champ we felt like playing at the time. We didn't know eachother's login details, but considering when we played it was usually on Lan together, we didn't need to. \n\nThough that being said, if that were to have been found out at the time and i was suspended or banned.... well, i'd be in your shoes in a way. We'd be scratching our heads wondering if this was really such a big deal. Older your account, less likely you are to share to try different areas, often its like a \"try before you buy\" approach, you still end up getting champs/skin yourself eventually as you just want it on your own account.\n\n\nIn a way i feel for you, in a way i don't. \n\nJust clearing up, not flaming here... Just... What did you expect to happen if you were caught? You have grounds to ask riot on what basis they decided to ban rather than suspend. \n\nThat being said, why have rules if you're going to bend them case by case?","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-21T21:09:55.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well...i got good news a bad news from riot support.

It's not a sign of skill, its taking advantage of a bug to win games.\n\nUnlucky, but what can i say? Cop it on the chin sweet, get an exp boost and rush back to 30, doesn't take long anyways, only took me 2-3weeks from 1-30 and thats without a boost.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-22T06:33:52.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did talk to my friend and ive played him him b4 even went to his house as u know.

For example, there was a bug where you could get BotRK to have no cooldown, but you had to make an effort to accomplish it.\n\nDoes that sound familiar? If it was for a third party application/script then it should've said that instead I think; have you ever downloaded and/or used any programs that interact with League, even if you didn't take advantage of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-22T06:34:12.864+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In the Email it doesn't state what exploits and if there was something that i exploited, i'm obviously unaware to it. And i have spoken to riot about third party programs, the only program that i have that interacts with league is LVOC which i have already had a conversation with riot and them agreeing that i was not banned by it. And i have seen videos of the BORK \"glitch\" which i doubt is likely to happen again since that bug only appeared in s3/4 and i have seen videos on it while i was researching on how to tell if someone was scripting. i've only played this game for less than 9 months now starting only on the 2-3 week of July in 2015 and i have not even got to play URF yet. So this is rly unusual for me and getting an Email about it without knowing what i have done wrong seems rly selfish. Having spent $390 on this game and just have it all go away because of a supposed misunderstanding is just rly hilarious and dumb. I might be clear to riot but again only 9 months of experience and i barely made it into silver. And tbh if i did someone come across or used and exploit myself it wouldn't have been my intentions and think about it form a logic type of view, I am not stupid enough to spend money ( alot ) and just gamble it all away because i intentionally used an exploit especially in my ranked games. No one would be stupid to do that. I have a second account that i made cause me and a friend of mine wanted to beat the game together again and get to lvl 30 as a duo and i use the exact same setup with the same VO and i don't notice a difference in terms of the system that changed and then i got perma without a clue in the world besides a very plain \" you used exploits \"  Lets put this in real life format, New born baby 9 months old, don't know anything about the world yet. The baby takes a few steps and suddenly he is convicted to 2 centuries worth jail for a suppose stealing. The baby has no idea what in the world is going on as he has just entered it. Innocent and clueless the baby is and if he had done something wrong he wouldn't have been a ware or did not even intentionally do it. Obviously not the scale but it is an example to if it was a real life situation. You see how unfair it is? \n\nTL;DR if i did come across an exploit i am clearly un aware of and was totally unintentional if i somehow abused it and have no clue what the exploit is in the first place and riot instapermabanning me is a very harsh part of them to do if you cant already tell from what i have written i am very sad and am %100 percent honest with my post, as u can see ^^^","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-04-22T07:17:07.185+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is really unlikely that you'd have been banned for an exploit you were completely unaware of, generally that would mean you'd rarely have \"used\" it. I don't think Riot give out permas for exploits if it's a one-off case, especially in situations where said exploit isn't \"common knowledge\" within the community, since that might indicate the individual has randomly encountered it and might not even be aware of it's existence.\n\nIf the exploit in question is relating to something you do often then that would explain the ban. Even though, in such a situation, you're unaware the exploit exists, it still becomes a regular thing on your account because it exists in conjunction with something you normally do. That indicates to Riot that it's more likely you are aware the exploit is there and are simply trying to gain an unfair advantage. In this situation, I honestly don't think there is anything you can do about it. There isn't really a way to prove that you were unaware of said exploit if it shows up on your account regularly.\n\nThe only other possibility I can think of is the time your friend spent using your account (though you'd think they would have also received a punishment for exploits if his was the case). Perhaps they were using an exploit, intentionally or otherwise?","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-22T08:13:29.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have created a smurf and i play the same way as i do on my account and have even spoken to my friends...everything in game on my smurf seems to be the same as i do in my main.
