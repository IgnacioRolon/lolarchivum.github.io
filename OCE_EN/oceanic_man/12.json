If you forgot to report post game or have extra info you can submit a support ticket here:\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nIt's also worth noting that if a report is ambiguous or for cases involving in game behaviour rather than chat (which is harder for the automated system) sometimes a rioter will take a look. What this means is that if you add a description to your report you help them out by making it much clearer what was going on (as they don't have any means to review the games). So especially in cases like this, always describe what happened in the post game report, as it can be the extra piece of info that guarantees a punishment for that person.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cyrater","date":"2016-02-07T10:49:13.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People wont and dont get banned for things like this, check his match history and you'll continue to see him play games.","replies":[]}]}
