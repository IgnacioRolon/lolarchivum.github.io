If they are constantly like this, then yes. Eventually they will get punished. \n\nPunishment works in four tiers:\n\n* 10 game chat restrict\n* 25 game chat restrict\n* 14 day suspension\n* permaban\n\nIn game:\n\n*  you can mute the players and you wont have to see their flame. \n* You can make a big friends list and constantly play 5 man premade (you get ip bonuses and more mastery points).\n* Just ignore them","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-02-21T09:53:51.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i didnt flame them....it was a simple question i didnt rly intend on even starting anything maybe its because i was tilted that i didnt realise i :flamed: them but that deosnt give them the right to all turn against me like i did a crime and ik the reporting system works. i have sent 2 people to the tribunal already i just want to know if its effective cause i get frustrated when a guy says in all chat \"report me you c, report doesn't do jack\" and   it just frustrates me that those people are still playing like they did nothing wrong","replies":[{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2016-02-21T11:37:41.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Oceanic Man,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=Mmrzg8or,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-21T09:53:51.575+0000)\n>\n> i didnt flame them....it was a simple question i didnt rly intend on even starting anything maybe its because i was tilted that i didnt realise i :flamed: them but that deosnt give them the right to all turn against me like i did a crime and ik the reporting system works. i have sent 2 people to the tribunal already i just want to know if its effective cause i get frustrated when a guy says in all chat \"report me you c, report doesn't do jack\" and   it just frustrates me that those people are still playing like they did nothing wrong\n\nmaybe its just a difference in skill, the lower players will engage when you SHOULD NOT, since you decided to not engage makes you the wiser champion. unless there was a Great time to get in there but you didnt. it comes down to your mental state aswell.\n\naussies are know to refering to each other as mate/dick/Cu.. and so on, if you cant take it, go back to nany state NA. toxic behaviour is one thing, not saying its acceptiable but its just something you have to learn to look past and get over it... you could allways enable text filter.\n\n\njust report, and get over it.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-03-11T03:25:36.882+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In champ select someone goes..
