And guess wtf happened. Permaban out of nowhere. Riot u fucked up once more. oh perma for third party usage? funny the only 3rd party shit i have is a VO changer (LVOC) and thats not against ur Ts and Cs so fuck u riot. Secondly i sent u 2 tickets in the morning and i havent heard jack from any of u guys gj riot. i may be a dick but wut ive heard from the forums so have u riot so we have something in common cause apperently playing nice doesnt work anymore since ur filthy rich. cut the &quot;we help to keep the players happy&quot; cause if u were actually trying to do that i wouldnt get my acc ban for no reason. VO changers are allowed and thats the only thing ive been using when i play league. the only thing i have open when i play league is LVOC thats it and thats no change the VO in game. So if i dont get a god dam rioter in here then fuck u riot u wasted my $400 to feed ur gready lil butthole.  i havent done shit wrong and i havent got bans b4 and i only played for 1 year and just got to silver m8. what are u doing riot? This is the reason u loose people. Ur system is faulty ur employees are useless AF just copy and pasting. bich i didnt ask for a copy and paste i ask for help and explanation. and lets not forget that ur shit isnt together. G E T    Y O U R    F U C K I N G   S H I T    T O G E T H E R  and stop getting innocent players like me in trouble trying to be like &quot; were helping the community &quot; bullshit. Talking nice to u hasnt seem to work so im going to be honest about it riot. This isnt fun riot. oh and btw dont come back responding with a copy and paste. i want answers not the Ts and Cs that ive already read 3 times trying to figuere out why the fuck i got banned.     Lets take this real life shall we. Lets say i was found out to be stealing from a store. i get arrested. i proof my innocents and instead of letting me out u keep me in jail for a life time. now lets compare. I was apparently cause with third party software i proof my innocents even sent u the file in the ticket i sent u takes u focking forever to reply. Oh look the resemblance. How do u think people feel when they get wrongly jailed huh? might not be as extreme but the concept is there. i tried talking nice to yall and it seems no one is being up front about it so i will be.  I my be just 1 person talking to a company but that doesn&#039;t change the facts in the passage about u guys \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                        Sincerely: Gothalion07 ( IGN Oceanic Man)","replies":[{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-04-21T16:38:10.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You sound toxic, your writing is painful to read and you're complaining that after yelling at Riot, that they cannot be bothered to help you in depth, you  shouldn't expect a caring reply after that.
