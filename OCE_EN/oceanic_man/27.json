Just have a break (maybe play a different game) and when you come back you will be nice and refreshed.  \n(I have been through this so many times, [check this link](http://www.lolking.net/summoner/oce/2181252) and expand my lolking score and see the tilt at the end of last season)","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-26T14:52:16.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Decrease\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-26T15:06:29.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CHEESYLEEKS,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=f7k4bHMz,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2016-02-26T14:52:16.436+0000)\n>\n> \"Decrease\"\n\nRip my copy paste laziness","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-02-26T15:19:20.783+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lel","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
