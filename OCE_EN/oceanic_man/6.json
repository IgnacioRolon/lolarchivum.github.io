This excuse is used by people who lack self-control and NEED it to be accepted to protect themselves from being punished & looked down upon for their own abusive behavior.\n\nTo \"handle\" being insulted by people, is to accept abuse as normal and desensitize yourself to it's effects. This is something that humans (particularly young children) who undergo severe abuse/torture do as a sanity/survival mechanism.

Its a teenager calling you a scrub.\n\nI just dont let that get to me - prefer to divert my energies elsewhere.\n\nYou're enabled with a mute button. One simple button click and you remove their power. Only you let their words hurt you.\n\nEver been to the toxic comments in the telegraph? Ever been to reddit? 4chan? Ever commented on a public post on facebook or had an argument with a stranger about a political issue?  This problem is not unique to gaming and certainly not unique to LoL. This is a symptom of internet anonymity, not an expectation of malice in gaming.\n\nIt is called the \"online disinhibition effect\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect\n\nThis has been the subject of academic study published in respected peer reviewed journals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15257832).\n\nAnd a quick google will show you that this is not riot's problem to solve - you immediately get a sense of the fact that this problem exists in a far greater sphere than LoL, and a far greater sphere than gaming.\n\nhttp://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-is-everyone-on-the-internet-so-angry/\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-psychology-of-online-comments\n\nhttps://www.techinasia.com/why-are-people-rude-online\n\nhttp://www.chathamdailynews.ca/2015/01/25/online-anonymity-form-of-deindividuation\n\nhttp://www.empowher.com/relationships-amp-family/content/anonymity-makes-people-rude-editorial\n\nI commend riot for providing the mute button to \"manage\" the issue (ie the ability to mute) and player behavior inititatives (to kick out the REALLY bad apples), but these are tools to manage the issue - it is too big an issue to expect riot to solve.\n\nIt is just a fact that the world has dickheads, and the dickhead effect is amplified when people are protected by a veil of anonymity, turning those who are normally quite reserved and reasonable people in person into toxic tools online.\n\nGaming may intensify the frequency of unpleasant interactions because of the reliance on those in your team, but the fact remains that when people are shielded by anonymity (whether it be in gaming or other online environments where commenting and interaction is encouraged) they say things they would not dream of saying in real life or face to face.\n\nAnd although not the most confident person in the world, I am more than confident enough in myself to give online abuse the attention and respect it deserves. (none).\n\nGetting angry at online mockery is about as constructive as having a 4 hour spirited discussion with a coconut. Ultimately pointless and a complete waste of your time and energy.\n\nIf you want to let the words of a 14 year old virgin ruin your day go right ahead, but I can tell you that it wont stop once you leave LoL, and if you have any intention of contributing to any open discussion on the internet, you're gonna have a bad time if you let every neckbeard ruin your day with a taunt.\n\nTrue cyber bullying - using an electronic communication service to communicate death threats, legitimate threats to the safety of your family, constant personal targeted abuse from those known to the victim in real life - is a very real issue. But in game chat in a video game? No. That is just disinhibition in action from random people you are unlikely to play with again and even more unlikely to meet in real life, and not to be confused with legitimate cyberbullying which is targeted, ongoing, and malicious. And certainly nothing that can't be reported for immediate action if it even hints at getting serious.\n\nThe only power these people have over you is when YOU let their words hurt you. And the only person who's behavior you can control is your own. Set an example of the sort of behavior you'd like to see, and ignore the losers who are epic tough guys only when anonymous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-03-02T08:02:30.398+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NOICE!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"TwoHeadedFreak","date":"2016-03-02T01:42:27.265+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why should you learn how to be insulted by other people?

Sure it's not just an OCE problem but it's pretty bad here.\n\nSadly this happens in every game, thank god LoL doesn't have voice chat, because of a few things. First is children who don't know what sportsmanship is because I know if my mum caught me going on like that, even today, she'd take the computer off me. But there are also people who are just (word I shouldn't say on the forums) who just take enjoyment from being like that to people, I've always said that those people are truely sad but they keep apearing.\n\nAlso if they're posting abusive videos about you, on youtube atleast, you can report them as harrasment.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bald Orange","date":"2016-03-02T14:58:19.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Tell your girlfriend.
