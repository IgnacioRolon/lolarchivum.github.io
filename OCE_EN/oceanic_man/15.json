WTF how is that my fault i lost that game another game where tryn feeds a nasus and he ended up with 300 stacks in 15 minutes and i lost that game even tho i went positive like how the hell does this placement matches work. U can loo into my match history I&#039;m not even joking but if the placement matches work by a matter of winning or loosing than why am i getting placed is somewhere because of a bunch of people who doesn&#039;t want to play well or who likes to intentionally throw the game. Pls reply me. Im in bronze now because i went 3 wins and 7 losses and half of the losses besides the 2 at the started was hardly my fault. As i said went positive in most of them got good CS but someone in the game was either throng, AFK or just traight up saying gg even tho the game just started.

Sit behind them and benefit off their good plays and even off their mistakes. I've had team mates get caught, but turned the situation around by counter catching the enemy. \n\nJungle duo isn't all it's cracked up to be. Majority of the time your duo will be pre-occupied trying to help your team mates that don't listen to your requests to play carefully haha. Two players in two lanes, two out of three lanes controlled :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
