The jump up will be hard to adjust to, and seeing yourself fall all over again will really take away your love from the game. Also if you're just looking to improve, then the reward of climbing on your own should really be a good drive for you!\n\nI've done a bunch of coaching and I can lend you some general tips which will help you at all levels of play.\n\nFirst of all write down the cooldowns of a few of the main midlaners you commonly see. Memorize them as well as you can as these are your windows of opportunity. Knowing when its safe to go in and also when they won't have anything to fight back with is huge. This is especially important for gapclosers as that is an easier kill-window. \n\nTime all the summoners you can remember from a fight in the ally chat. If you can communicate to your jungler that their mid is pushing you without flash theres a lot better chance he will come to gank. Secondly, it will let you know if they are able to kill you with ignite/teleport from their recall etc. Summoner spells are huge and not utilizing the window when they are down is a really big opportunity wasted!\n\nRemember that out CSing your opponent should be your priority. If you can focus on winning CS by a decent margin you can deny the enemy in a few ways. The first of which being when you hit a signiciant milestone (Say Large Rod (1250 Gold). Neither you or your opponent have backed and he is down by 4 or more cs. If you all in him to the point where you both have to base, you will be able to buy a much more significant item and thus come back into lane stronger than your opponent. This should help you win lane from that point on due to an item advantage. (Same goes for bot lane ADC BF Sword spike!)\n\nCommunicate when your lane goes MIA! When you're farming minions and noone is there simply give a few (not just one) missing ping and think about where he is likely to go. Simply give a danger ping over an area you are suspicious of (maybe a roam bot lane/potential). Its frustrating when other lanes feed your lane,  but this should help them avoid it more often. Following that if he DOES roam bottom you need to shove your lane or rotate VERY quickly. This is situational based on how far into the roam they are and whether there is cleanup potential, but either one is a better answer than freezing as it wont deny them.\n\nI hope these few tips help out for now. If you're looking for some more advice and feedback on your builds and masteries feel free to add me.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-02-29T08:09:41.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First: I don't want to get boosted cause i think i deserve higher elo. all i want is just that border and thats it i don't want to go higher i just want that border. \n\nSecond: I do memorise cooldowns. Everytime i see my laner use an ability i time them i know when to go in and when to disengage i have always done that. As for sumoners spells i do type it in chat i type \"champion F/Ign then the time\" but i dont even think my jg cares or anyone in my game cares. remeber this is bronze half the time i play jg and i ask if someones lane has thier sums they tell me to F off cause they dont care\n\nThird: I do try to CS so i will have to pratice on that as im not the best at CS with AP champs \n\nForth: Pinging is useless in bronze. half the time the otehr lanes dont look at the minimap when someone pings mia or help or danger its only after they die that they look wheather u ping or not but still balmes u anyways so i find it redundant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-24T10:59:05.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Look up good builds for champions. ({{item:3152}} is questionable on Viktor.\n2. At the start of the game don't be afk at your tower.

Should be autoing him when you dont need the auto to cs.\n4. learn how to cs under tower (practice in customs or normals)\n5. learn your damage.
