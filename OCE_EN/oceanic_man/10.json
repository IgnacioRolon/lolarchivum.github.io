It's used for zone control which can bait people into coming into your range, but it's not a tool for engaging.\n\nYou can use R to execute but the damage it deals while being controlled is enormous. It's usually better to use it when it will get the biggest AoE effect or you know you can keep it stuck to someone.\n\nE is simple. Harass, waveclear, or damage, you just need to use it depending on what you need. Aside from that, if you have trouble aiming it, then try changing your settings.\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Oceanic Man,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=vpZ3Pah7,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-02-29T09:09:24.291+0000)\n>\n> Look at my match history. im shit at vik. need training viktor mains prefered\n\nAdd me if you want and I'll try and help you out.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-29T15:25:44.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hes one of the most popular mid laners for the pro scene","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T12:29:36.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Learn to aim E, win games, get bitches.\n\nCan't skillshot?\n\nPick a different champion.","replies":[]}]}
