The real reasons why this champs like yasuo zed yi riven ect are getting called toxic and trash and all around bad people is because of u other guys who dont play them. u call them no skilled champs just cause u went 1/15 with them and dont know how to play them or got rekt by a good yasuo or riven. THIS HAS TO STOP The only reasons we are toxic is cause of u others. we are only trying to be noce to u by saying that we need help in lane, what gives u the rights to tell me to smd cause im a yasuo main and i dont need help. then when i die u say report for feeding even tho i am 1/2. If u stop abusing this champion mains. they will stop abusing u. every game i get called trash just because i have 3 deaths and am going 12/3 just because i am a yasuo main. this isnt fair. otehr champions get a pass but this specific champs...just NO.

If he falls behind, he is useless in every factor except for a tiny bit of cc his r gives. If your team doesn't have a knockup and a yasuo hasn't snowballed and fallen behind, he is useless for pretty much the rest of the game. + Yasuo does tiny ass damage unless he is ahead, his crits start around 100 damage (on minions) then only up to around 350 with ie and shiv (minus shiv damage, to minions) and full end builds only end at around 450-650 damage (on minions) its just the fact people don't take the time to learn to beat him.

If a yasuo walls? why the hell would you then use spells into it then complain its bs, it really isnt hard to counter it. + yasuo has one of the weakest dashes in the game when it comes to cc, any cc affect yasuo's dash, hard cc and silences and things like that completely cancel it and its damage, while still giving it full cd, slows increase the duration of the dash depending on the slow amount, 10% slow = 10% longer 50% = 50% longer etc. and aa speed reductions like exhaust and malph e or nasus w are are most cancerous things for a yasuo.\n\nThen you have people like annie. She is so much more bs than a yasuo. Her q can be blocked by yas windwall or a spellshield, yet the stun isnt consumed. So no matter what, unless she misses r or e she will always get a 2 stun, which is 8x longer than she needs to kill people anyway. Her ult is muse better for teamfights as well, x10 stronger than yasuo, so why does yasuo get attacked for it over annie? Answer. People are stupid and can't develop the skill to counter play, only people who know how to counter play are good yasuo's because the only way to be successful with yasuo.
