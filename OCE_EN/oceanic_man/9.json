Anything that messes with the game files is against the ToU.

VO mods are fine, they're localised to you and they don't give an advantage to your team.\n\nNot fine:\n- Exposing information that’s intentionally obfuscated (cooldowns or timers)\n- Taking actions on your behalf (botting or scripting)\n- Drawing conclusions for you (predicting enemy positions)\n- Otherwise altering your field of intelligence (zoomhacks or global ult alerts)\n\n\n(VO mods are fine , they're localised to you and they don't give an advantage to your team. ) i have no custom skins no nothing just LVOC","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:33:28.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAFAIK LVOC isn't bannable at the moment, however as with any tools that modify league files, **use at your own risk**.\n\nIn your OP you mentioned you have a ticket open at the moment, this would be your best bet to have the ban reviewed so just wait for a response there.\n\nThese bans are rarely ever handed out in error as from what I know they go through a human review process for 3rd party software bans.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-20T09:46:40.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well human errors accrue much more than computer errors and i got my responds back form the ticket i sent and guess what it fucking came back with \n\nYour account has been permanently suspended following the use of scripts, hacks, exploits or unauthorized third-party programs in League of Legends.

The riot employee that reviewed my case must be blind AF and should get fired and if this was a joke that i hope the person pulling it will hang themselves. I will take however long it will take to prove that i have done jack to deserve this even if it means sending emails day and night or even calling them about it and personally donating to rioters who stream. For wrong to take over it takes right people to do nothing and i'm not going to let this go. @Riot-Fuck you .I.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
