If you had the unfavorable MMR then you'll gain more LP and vice versa.** Riot Support** has an in-depth post on this [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h2q3).\n\nWith that out of the way, this is why you might not be gaining the LP you expect:\n\n+ According to [OP.GG](http://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=oceanicman) your MMR is not above average currently. You might need to hit the refresh button to see this. It's at **986** MMR as of right now.\n\n+ OP.GG does not give official MMR. No one but **Riot** knows your MMR. What you see on OP.GG is simply an estimate, your actual MMR could be quite a bit different.\n\n+ You're duo queuing with friends who have far higher MMR than you. This is bringing up your team's average MMR thus resulting in less LP gains and more LP losses.\n\nThere could be more reasons than just this, I've just mentioned the most likely reasons. It's possible that **Riot** has made some small changes to the LP and MMR system without notifying us.\n\nI hope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Oceanic Man","date":"2016-04-05T03:57:55.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea it was above than aevrage but I recently lost 2 games in a row so it might have dropped than and but if I do manage to get to bronze 3 and still duo with my friend will I get the same amout of LP 10-15 or will I get more","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-05T05:00:33.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should get slightly higher amounts of LP when you're in Bronze 3, because your MMR should be higher.
