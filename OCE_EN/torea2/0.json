In games I've versed/played with Diana and Ahri, I've found Ahri very hard to lane against (especially if playing a champ with no escapes), while Diana doesn't seem to do much.\n\nBack to Thresh. He's super fun to play. He has a high skill cap, so more difficult to use and learn his combos. He is weakish early on, because he gains armour and ability power from gathering souls. But around mid game he gets much stronger, and late game, if you've collected souls like you should've been, he has a real power spike. Plus his voice and effects and general theme are pretty cool. You can even get into it a bit further and tell the enemies you're keeping their soul safe for the death god, after you kill them.\n\nHis auto attacks count as ranged, so you can even play him as an adc, but generally you'll build him tanky and as an initiator/cc machine. His Q has a long, but slow pull, that can be used to pull the enemy closer to you slightly, or to pull yourself to them. Great for initiation or quick escapes through the jungle. His W is a shield that Thresh can throw, and allies can click it to fly to you, or you can use it to pick up souls haha. Getting your team to click the damn thing is a pain though, since most are too deficient mentally to use itâ€¦ His E is good for wave clearing and keeping enemies away from your adc. His R is amazing though. CC or the highest power. Nothing is funnier than watching someone try to dash through one of your box walls, and slam into a chilly death.\n\nThresh is really one of those champs where you need both skill in yourself, and a bit of understanding from your team on how to work with him. However, once you have his basic combo down (Q-E back-R etc) and let your team know to RIGHT CLICK THE LANTERN, then you can use him to good effect. He's definitely one of the better support picks in the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-09-24T07:49:47.022+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whereas I on the other hand play both Ahri and Diana quite frequently (Diana's my main :D)\n\nAhri's early game is quite weak as none of her abilities do particularly significant damage until there's at least 3 points in them. \n\nHer passive heals her every 9 times an ability hits an enemy, and is best used with ur q as the no. of  targets hit isn't restricted, where as her other abilities can only hit 1-3 times each\n\nHer Q is her primary damage source and is also her only ability that isn't blocked by other enemies so use it to harass (after 3 points). You can obviously use it earlier but  bc it lacks much damage all you're really doing is wasting mana. \n\nHer W should be maxed last imo as the damage is mediocre and I only use it during 1v1 fights early-mid game as although they prioritise champs the damage is reduced after consecutive hits so rly it's not worth maxing it (it's also good for kiting which I'll get to later)\n\nHer E is a rly important skill to land as her burst is most potent when u land it. Try to stay to the side of  the wave during laning as it means ur more  likely to hit the charm and more often than not E>Q >W will make most squishies flash away during mid game(and late often). \n\nHer ult has a relatively low cd so dont be afraid to use it to escape a gank or to try and catch ur opponent who is being ganked. It also can be used to steal baron/dragon as u can ult in, use ur burst, ult out, and still have an extra charge on hand if someone flashes after you, but be aware that after the initial activation all 3 charges go on cd (its not like Akali's ult, for example), so you only have a window of time to use all 3 charges before they all go on cd.\n\nAhri's very hard to gank as all her abilities make her exceptional at kiting. Her Q provides MS, W has no cast  time so can also be useful if u have Rylais as u can slow any nearby enemy with it. E slows the enemy hit as well as charming them, and ult obviously provides a lot of mobility. Be aware that you shouldn't wait around to see if ur E lands as many Ahris do. Just send out a charm and a Q (away from where u run so the MS lasts longer) and keep running\n\nDiana is a very strong dueler due to her passive which provides atk speed and an aoe magic damage thing every third hit, so shes a strong pick against melee  champs. A downside is she has no escape unless an enemy minion or monster is behind her which she can ult to, which is unlikely\n\nHer Q is relatively low mana cost and cd so its an effective harassment tool but it can be difficult to land, but i find getting in closer than max range makes it alot easier to land as you  can aim it just behind them as they will run into it most likely. I max it first as the damage is quite good after 3 points \n\nHer W is useful for trades as it damages enemies nearby and shields her (strengthens when it hits enemies) so i take a point either level 1 or 2 (usually 1) and is particularly useful against melee champs. Activate before engaging  as the duration is quite long so dw about it running out u have a few seconds\n\nHer E does no damage so i take it at 5 (before i get ult) but is useful in teamfights as it draws in and slows ALL nearby enemies so its good at disrupting channeled abilites and keeping enemies off ur allies.it can also be used to slow chasing enemies if they are close enough as they cant move during the small knockup either.\n\nHer ult has 2 charges if u ult to an enemy that was hit with her q so if u are struggling to catch an enemy, q the backline of the wave, ult to a minion hit, then u should be able to  ult the fleeing enemy. it has a low cd so be aggressive with it, but remember u must commit as she has no escape if its on cd \n\nhope that helps!! any questions let me know :D","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-24T22:21:08.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok thanks both of you guys-it means alot :D\n\ncouple of question for you guys\na) how hard/how many games are needed on Thresh to become amazing at him?\nb) same as before but for Diana\nc) how long do you think i will take me to pick up diana?(i main fizz{{champion:105}}  btw)\nd) where is diana better off=jungle or mid\ne) any combos for either of them?\nf) is it better to get ancient coin or relic sheild on thresh?\ng) and last one-what about builds?\n{{champion:412}} {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ghazan","date":"2015-09-26T04:40:51.863+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"b/c) i think it took me about 5 or so games (spaced over many weeks when she was on rotation) but it was just one random game as her i got super fed and realised how strong she was so i kept playing her and then began to get better and better so id say upwards of 5 but it can vary i suppose. in terms of difficulty i wouldnt say she's too hard but the important thing is to get her combo right\nd) i actually find shes strong in both aspects  as her snowballing is rly good but the only downside is her ganks are pretty bad before 6 whereas when she goes mid she can be pretty reliable providing she doesnt get poked to death {{champion:101}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:112}} \ne) the most common  (probably) and seemingly most effective is Q(wait to see if it lands if not then u have to consider whether u wanna risk going in w/o second ult)>W(activate before engage)>R>E(to keep enemy close)>R and Q should be off cd again shortly\ng) {{item:3020}} \n    {{item:3285}} get first ONLY if ur winning lane and/or got at least one kill with no deaths as the cost is quite expensive and its better to build defensively in lane first\n{{item:3001}} should be rushed vs any ap champ and {{item:3157}} against ad, but u should definitely get zhonyas within first 3 items to make up for her lack of escape\n{{item:3116}} the slow is good for chasing and provides a nice ap boost. the hp is also extremely beneficial as it provides more sustainability during fights so u arent deleted straight away\n{{item:3151}} only if theres 3 or more tanky champs in the enemy team as ur damage output will be low otherwise. the hp is also good which is why i favour it over {{item:3135}} \ni personally dont get {{item:3115}} unless theres only 1 or 2 ranged champs as most of the time you'll be hitting with abilities rather than actually auto attacking, however if u end up split pushing (which as i said shes good at) this is a rly good choice","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Spawn Man","date":"2015-09-25T09:10:31.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A) If you play support, then you'll just find the combos with Thresh take effort to learn. But if you've never played support before, then you'll struggle regardless, because he is probably epitomises the support role. If you want to learn support, try easier champs like Blitz, Braum or  Morgana. Otherwise, it shouldn't take too long to get his basics down (took me about a dozen games to get his combo down, and be decent with him). No idea on how long it'd take to become amazing with him, as I switched to maining Blitz support, although by the time I did, I was fairly good with Thresh (able to go roughly 6/2/25 every consistently), which was about a couple of months after I picked him up.\n\nE) Yep, so the basic combo is pulling an enemy with Q, turn around and E them back towards your adc, and then R to lock them in. You can also combo with champs like Blitz where you throw a lantern (W) and then Blitz pulls someone, then clicks your lantern. This pulls Blitz to you, and the enemy champion he's pulled too, far away from where they originally were. Or instead of using Thresh's lantern as a lifesaver for your adc, you can use to it to bring junglers or gankers into your lane and ambush the enemy. Outside of those, it's less about 'combos' and more about synergy and just having a very solid support kit.\n\nF) I like Ancient Coin more. With Thresh's Q, and being able to pull himself to minions and monsters in the jungle for a quick escape, the added movement speed of the final Talisman is great to make you fully mobile. Some people swear by Relic Shield though. However, Relic shield only triggers off melee attacks, so only Thresh's E (Flay) counts as a melee attack (Thresh's autos count as ranged attacks), which can make it a bit harder if you're out of mana or it's on cooldown. It's really up to you, and either is viable though. A good thought would be that if you're the only initiator, get Coin. If you're the only tank, or need more tank, get Shield.\n\nG) Thresh can be built any number of ways, from adc, to initiator, to tank. Even seen him built ap. The most common is as support, and he generally profits from health, utility and armour. Because his ultimate locks an enemy in, Sunfire Cape is great. Gives health, armour and dps. Other good choices are Randuin's Omen, Locket, Frozen Heart, and of course, Thresh should always get a Ruby Sightstone to fulfil his support role. It's up to you though.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DamnationsHound","date":"2015-09-24T09:15:11.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on what role you play. Diana is quite versatile, she can mid, jungle and even top lane if you need. Ahri can't really leave mid, unless you find a way to play her as support. And Thresh, best support in the game and can potentially mid with his passive, though early game weakness may lose an early lead.\nBut I'd say test them all if you get the chance, hope this helped :)","replies":[{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-09-24T22:24:58.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey thanks for your advice man\nit means alot :D","replies":[]}]}]}
