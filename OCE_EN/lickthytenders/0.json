So what is the point in getting S+ or even an S rank in games. Sure it gives you more points towards your mastery. But why not for every S+ you get some other sort of token where the more you compile *Infinitely* You get a number inside your mastery 7 emote. To let the enemy know that you are a pro on that champion. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Put a number inside of your mastery emote for every S+ you get.","replies":[{"poster":"LickThyTenders","date":"2017-12-05T10:59:07.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Upgrade the icon past certain levels?
