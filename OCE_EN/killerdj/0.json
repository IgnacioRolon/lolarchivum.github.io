That worked, i got in the game around 2-3 minutes in and we later won. The next game i opened up discord and turned off overlays (which i was suspecting was my problem) and it still didn&#039;t work, the overlay showed up anyway and i had the same problem as before, but this time after 4 or so attempts to reconnect it worked and i got into the game at like 1:50 minutes in, they had 1 kill on the toplaner ( i was support) and our team remade (i dont know why, 2 of them were trolling and apparently 2 is all you need for a remake?!?!?!) then i got low-pri? This is ridiculous ??{{item:3070}}\n\nP.S: You can't say that its my fault i wasnt able to load into the game, it was clearly a conflict with discord and LoL, as soon as i shutoff discord the problem was solved, not sure if its only me","replies":[]}
