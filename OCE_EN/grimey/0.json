Have you seen AP janna's shields? or her Heals? or the amount of slow percentage on her slow?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-26T23:16:42.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"janna gets mejais for AP rush, not Dcap. 3k gold is WAY out of a supports budget for utility....","replies":[{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-12-27T00:29:18.271+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=s6zndgV2,comment-id=00020001,timestamp=2014-12-26T23:16:42.321+0000)\n>\n> janna gets mejais for AP rush, not Dcap. 3k gold is WAY out of a supports budget for utility....\n\nyeah, i was just trying to put it into perspective for the player base that try tp build high AP items on supports. Then again, Dcap is 120+30% guaranteed AP, unlike mejias which requires you to not die, play smart and position well, something this guy and his teamates seem to lack or lack to understand","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Grimey","date":"2014-12-26T16:23:13.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I understand what you mean here, but these people are last hitting kills, stealing cs, rushing items like DFG, taking ignite things like that, that aren't necessary at all.","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-26T22:52:52.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ignite is one of the 2 summoner spells the support should take....exh or ign...depending on the type of lane they are playing or the type of enemy they are going to face.\n\nyou really want an ignite in a lane vs a raka, always...","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"AusPaladin","date":"2014-12-31T07:00:03.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main support happy to play with you anytime","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2014-12-27T07:05:04.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Peenoss.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2014-12-26T23:27:01.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer top,mid and jg but I will sup if needed I main Thresh I have a 60% win rate with him and usually set my adc up to carry I don't take kills unless I believe they won't get them and I will shield em even if its not needed and usually we will win bot without a gank because I know how to engage and when to use my e just as the q stuns finishes","replies":[]},{"poster":"Solanthus","date":"2014-12-26T22:52:35.141+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It can be tricky, especially in normals where people may experiment or practice different things before using it in ranked. The only thing I can suggest would be to try and take advantage of whomever your partner is in the lane to try and get ahead. Its better to have at least a kill lane working than 2 separate champions trying to solo farm.

I'll pick an aggressive laner like Annie or Rek or whoever the hell I want and guess what its completely my own prerogative on how and who I want to play. \nBelieve it or not... there is no game user manual.
