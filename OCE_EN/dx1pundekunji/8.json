Yeah I know I suck right? So, recently the last two weeks I have been having internet spikes, sent a ticket to riot, keep asking me to use the hextech tool ( mac os ) when I started lagging ( which didn&#039;t work cause the tool keep asking me to key in the password before I get to scan the issue...sigh ). I gave up troubleshooting as it drove me crazy. Asked my internet provider if there any issues, they said no our side is ok ( maybe they don&#039;t even care ? I don&#039;t know ) . This is the part where you people will not care or pray hard for me to keep quiet\r\n\r\nSo now, I am basically playing support which I am actually kinda decent ( I am not like some thresh god support ). Worse come to worse I would jungle but with that random spike I am able to still manage though. Thanks, to whoever read my long boring rant paragraph and to people who wish I would shut up and not care. yay!!!!","replies":[]}
