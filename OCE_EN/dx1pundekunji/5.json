At the champion selection they were 2 people. A and B. (A) chose adc role and picked a champ..then (B ) also chose adc...so then (A) switched to support. Then while in game around 10 minutes. Down at the bot lane...was doing terrible.....the adc went attack speed items straight away after his first death ( he still insisted going attack speed then only damage )...Meanwhile at top lane...I saw my enemy stood still for like 3 minutes and I am like...I don&#039;t have the heart to kill a player who dced or afk..BUT he died to minions LOLLLLLLL ( feels bad man). \r\n\r\nBack to the adc, I told him off  for blaming a sp who wanted to play adc when you chose his role duh...He was like I didn&#039;t know our sp chose adc...and I&#039;m like yeahhhh broooo  Caitlyn is a support  ( was chosen by the sp earlier in champ selection )...He needed glasses...maybe he is blind to teammates who chose adc role....or....maybe he has tunnel vision..It remains a mystery....\r\n\r\nIn the end obviously...we 5 won the 5 vs 4 match..and after the game..our adc was like gg ez..the enemy team replied angrily of course...Feeling bad for the other team ...I honored them expect..the dude who afk and died to minions...and also reported the adc..\r\n\r\nThis kind of player has no honor at all...If the enemy team didn&#039;t have a dc..I guarantee that we would lose the game and the adc would be raging at his sp...\r\nEnd of rant.\r\nヽ(`Д&acute;)ﾉ AAARRGGHHHHHHHHH!","replies":[]}
