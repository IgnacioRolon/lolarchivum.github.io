There seems to be an issue with them being rewarded in the mystery icons (which they aren't meant to be a part of yet even once the emporium opens).\n\nI'd recommend submitting a ticket. They may not be able to do anything yet, or they may have to wait until the shop opens, or you might just get the icon when the shop opens and the icons are active. Really don't know, but support should be able to point you in the right direction at any rate.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-04-11T03:33:31.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi zantheon, you've run into an issue here that is unique to OCE as the blue essence version of mystery icons is actually not supposed to be available right now.\nSeras Dragon is right that the icon you got isn't actually in the game yet, but it exists in the store system and can still be added to your account as something that you \"own\". Hence why you can select it but it shows up blank.\n\nWhen the patch next Wednesday lands the icon will show up as expected.","replies":[]}]}
