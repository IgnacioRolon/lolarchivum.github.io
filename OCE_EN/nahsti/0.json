Do I expect this to get me unbanned? haha of course not and this isn&#039;t an attempt to be thought it would be nice, I don&#039;t have some fan base like Tyler1 or something but it is something that needs to be done in my opinion and I feel a lot better about doing it.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m currently playing as a reformed player and person and getting a lot better games and elo climbing is a lot smoother right now and I hope it is the same for everyone else.\r\n\r\nI wish I could give some advice for people that may experience the same stuff but really the only answer is to shut up, mute toxic people and gank often,\r\nJust stick to the triple P&#039;s.\r\n\r\n{{summoner:6}} \r\n\r\nPOSITIVE\r\nPRODUCTIVE\r\nPERSISTENT\r\n\r\n\r\n{{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nDon&#039;t ever give up and never stop trying, especially on a late game champion! {{champion:67}} \r\n\r\nAnyone that reads this, thank you for your time, and preemptively for anyone writing a positive comment or sending out any positive support in anyway thank you :)\r\n\r\nI know things in this post may be all over the place and not totally make sense but again I have learning issues I&#039;ve had all my life and this is the best I can do. :)\r\n\r\nP.S. For those wondering about how I&#039;ve spent so much on this account, I do work and I work hard. I don&#039;t loath on any government benefits and feed everything in to gaming.\r\n\r\n\r\nNahsti.     {{champion:201}}","replies":[{"poster":"Nahsti","date":"2017-01-26T12:05:07.356+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was mature enough to write a public apology without the intent to get my account back and you children write stuff like this and you're not toxic?
