I could also hear some sounds coming through from the pick/ban phase but I guess once it got to me it just timed out as I couldn't pick anything, so yay immediate loss in my promos. Unfortunately I don't have any screen cap setup so couldn't get a recording but just wanted to bring this up in-case it's some ongoing issue.\r\n\r\n[Lobby screencap incase the add link didn't work, I don't know how this forum works](https://imgur.com/a/WoAaEQW)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-08-19T10:24:11.805+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've seen and heard of the issue before, but it's extremely intermittent. Honestly, I thought it had been fixed. It probably won't happen to you again, but if I could get some more info off you that would be great:\n\n1. Windows or Mac?\n2. Solo/Duo, Flex, 3v3?\n3. Had you already played a game or was this your first since opening client?\n4. Have you seen this issue before or is this the first time?","replies":[{"poster":"Kajahe","date":"2019-08-19T10:43:24.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. Windows\n2. Solo/Duo\n3.
