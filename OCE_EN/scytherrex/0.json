But Ashe will decimate Lucian, in teamfights, due to Q + hurricane obliterating everyone. Not many people can actually duel Ashe and win. She's in a real good spot right now. I didn't mean to say that Lucian is bad because he's actually really good if played well, but... he's low-tier, just like Vayne.\n\nThat's the joys of ADCs, though, one small change will cause one certain ADC to drop off. When Lucian was nerfed, Sivir and Ashe took his place.\n\nIdk, though, you cannot use a pro to show how good a champion is. No matter what, a diamond player isn't going to play an ADC as well as a Challenger. The skill gap may appear small, but there's a difference from Diamond ADCS and Challenger ADCs.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-09-01T02:37:28.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think you are making a lot of assumptions when you say Ashe will decimate Lucian in team fights. The great thing about League is that it's all dependent. Lucian is \"different\" not weaker, in some team comps and team fight situations Lucian is stronger and the same can be said for Ashe. I don't think a blanket statement like Ashe is ALWAYS better than Lucian in team fights is accurate.\n\nOf course when I was comparing the two champions I am assuming a similar skilled person is playing them. I.e. challenger Ashe vs Challenger Lucian. It really comes down to the compositions of the team, how the game goes etc etc, each is situational and has their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOf course different skilled player will have different levels of power on champions, thats why when determining champion strength you need to remove that variable. If you are saying Ashe is a better choice because she has a lower skill floor and is easier to pick up then I 100% agree. But I don't believe Ashe is 100% always better than Lucian in every situation.","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-09-01T03:20:14.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Maraudaur,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=rHbk9Ev7,comment-id=0002000000000000,timestamp=2016-09-01T02:37:28.469+0000)\n>\n> I think you are making a lot of assumptions when you say Ashe will decimate Lucian in team fights.

Buy Hurricane and she's a better version of Kog'Maw.\n\nIf Lucian gets fed and Ashe doesn't, Lucian will win. A fullbuild Ashe, will beat a full build Lucian, assuming the Ashe is _decent_. When I say this, I don't mean a 100% win rate, as that's redicilous. I've lost to Lucian as Ashe, but I have also wiped them into the floor.\n\nAshe is the best ADC for teamfights. Even worse if the teamfight starts and she has full Q stacks, no one will be able to duel her.\n\nTo be honest, it depends on who has the better laning phase, but a full build Ashe should beat a full build Lucian, unless he can dodge her ult. Even then, her Q + W will chunk him badly and if she has lifesteal, then it'll go eitherway. \n\nBut I stand by the fact that Ashe is the best ADC for etamfights. If you can peel her, she'll AoE everyone down with her Q + Hurricane. Plus kiting and slowing with W. Again, a Lucian that can weave autos with spells is a severe threat. I am rambling for the sake of rambling.\n\nAt the moment, Lucian is good, but he's a low-tier ADC. That doesn't mean bad, not at all. I mean, Jhin is labeled as a low-tier ADC and most of the time, he's better than Ashe. His burst is asinine.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-09-01T00:27:36.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lucian damage these days isn't the best and often just gets rekt late game by Hyper carry adcs, kgs if you play him well is strong throughout the entire game","replies":[{"poster":"Scytherrex","date":"2016-09-01T00:59:56.666+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok, THANKS!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-09-01T00:06:59.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I probably find Kha more fun.
