But recently during a game my laptop froze due to being, unable to keep its sh*t together rendering me useless until my laptop collected its sh*t. Anyways whilst waiting for my game to unfreeze i was kicked from the game due to clusterf**k i was in. Unbeknown to me at the time my internet provider gave me a modem that enjoys to reset at the dandy old time of 11:59 pm and rejoin our world at 12:01pm. So whilst waiting and discovering this little problem of mine i was able to rejoin the game within 5 mins of this sh*t that just had gone down. Thinking that i was in clear, since i had finally rejoined i started to buy some items then head back to lane. This was a relief to my team as it was in fact a team ranked game. Though Riot wasnt done yet oh no the rally had just begun Rito aka leaverBuster had its F**king gloves on now and was swinging. With one foul swoop i was once again kicked for inactivity as i bought my items. Outraged by this event i joined back to the game fuming and to find that game was finished. As punishment for my banishment caused by Leaver F**king Buster i was given a good old 10min 5 game low priority queue by my 'good pal' leaverbuster. \r\n\r\n[had to post this somewhere just venting my anger. Sometimes you just want to puch leaverbuster in the face and this one of those moments] (not the greatest of writer)","replies":[{"poster":"ibohydrates","date":"2015-02-23T02:11:31.338+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I bet you also post on the forums complaining about AFKS...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-02-21T13:21:16.472+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Get a better internet connection and you wont have a problem.\n\n**This is a Internet performance based video game.**","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2015-02-22T05:20:35.420+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"***magic***","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-05T02:37:09.678+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there we go, I made you a thing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-26T22:37:17.067+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Tearikiw,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=2AhT3cZ1,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-02-21T11:47:41.305+0000)\n>\n>Though Riot wasnt done yet oh no the rally had just begun Rito aka leaverBuster had its F**king gloves on now and was swinging\n\ncan't lie this is my favourite part","replies":[{"poster":"Tearikiw","date":"2015-02-27T04:31:30.330+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i think you are my new best friend","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-02-24T03:19:04.582+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its not about the leaver buster, its about the lies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-02-21T20:45:52.306+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"tl;dr","replies":[]},{"poster":"HippoHunt3r","date":"2015-02-21T13:01:10.886+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty for the gud read ^^","replies":[]},{"poster":"Schakle","date":"2015-02-26T05:25:22.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had the same issue recently, but it was explained to me that there isn't much Rito can do about it that doesn't involve letting *every single leaver through the net.* Now obviously that ain't a great idea, but unless your internet provider is the issue and Riot has noticed it off of a large number of players then all leaves and AFKs are detected with the same system. No matter what the method. And if you put some thought to it it's pretty simple why.","replies":[{"poster":"Tearikiw","date":"2015-02-27T05:16:46.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well rito need to save me from leaverbuster asap","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Tearikiw","date":"2015-02-22T06:02:53.147+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well wasnt expecting any type of view or comment on my rant towards Riot.

Once again the idiots in charge of this game have literally no idea what they're doing, and failed to even take into account their own bugsplat system when assessing whether or not a player intentionally left the game.\n\nLike the game itself is great, it's what everyone loves, but it's all these extra, new, additional features designed to \"improve the community\" or whatever that have turned the game into a steaming pile of %%%%. Leaverbuster, the Division/LP system, the Tribunal (thank god they removed that!) and everything that comes with it, is a complete and utter joke and the designers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such pathetically bad features.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-22T05:15:54.464+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your getting LPQ off of a bugsplat, it's probably your fault for not trying to fix it after the first 1-2 times.","replies":[]}]}]}
