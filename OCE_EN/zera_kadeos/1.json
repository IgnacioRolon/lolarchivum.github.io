But I alt-tabbed accidently after trying to ping the summoner spells used on my opponent. But when i tried to get back in my screen went black and there was nothing I could do at all. I tried everything and decided to quickly restart my computer. I have tried to log back in and it says no I have to do an update? So the update may be ongoing but I tried to log in and when I do its telling me to choose a summoners name? as if I started a new account. I have retried many many times and the same thing pops up. Meanwhile I am still in a promos match of ranked. \r\nAny ideas on how to fix this? Or if my account still exists? Seems like a huge bug to me.","replies":[{"poster":"Zera Kadeos","date":"2017-05-17T01:05:56.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looks like I have found the problem. I am selected on the wrong region at the moment. Never actually happened before and when trying to rush to get back into game I must have missed it. Still not sure why I crashed and all but I guess thats a problem for another time. \n\nDisregard this post","replies":[]}]}
