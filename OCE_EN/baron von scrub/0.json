Yes, you used to be able to change base AD with Sterak's, but now it's a defunct mechanic on SR after the Sterak's rework.\r\n\r\nWhy bother? Because it makes difficult champions easier and fairer to balance. Let me explain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to buff a total AD champion's damage scaling, this is currently impossible without tweaking their base damages also, which tanks benefit from, and this can have the exact opposite effect than intended, as high base damages can mean less need to build damage, particularly when tank items are safer.\r\n\r\nBUT. This can be converted numerically identically into a better formula, as seen here. (Skip over the next section if you don't like a little algebra, but I assure you it's sound.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ny% Total AD = y% Base AD + y% Bonus AD\r\n\r\nThis means that an ability that does\r\n\r\nx + y% total AD damage\r\n\r\ncan also be written a\r\n\r\nz + y% bonus AD,\r\n\r\nwhere z = x + y% base AD\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis means that you can now change AD scaling without giving free base damages, thus properly incentivising building damage without the unintended consequences of also buffing tank builds.\r\n\r\nThese cases, where damage goes up per level rather than per skill rank, already exist in the game, and are generally represented in tooltips by white text, so this does not add anything new to the game or the code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn example of where this would be practical and beneficial.\r\n\r\nA prominent case where this causes issues is on my beloved Gravedigger's ghouls, as explained here: \r\n\r\nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/4TmmEEaz-yorick-ghoul-formula-is-inconvenient-and-untransparent-solution\r\n\r\nCurrently, ghouls scale too well without building AD, and too poorly WHEN building AD. By separating the base and bonus components, you can nerf the base damages whilst buffing the bonus scaling, making the balancing nightmare that is Yorick far more handlable, especially since the MMR discrepancy in his winrate is in part given rise by the reliable scalings in low MMRs but lack of gold-based reward in high MMRs.\r\n\r\nThe ability to separate ghouls' scalings from bases means that skilled players may be rewarded whilst less skilled may be nerfed, allowing a relative shrink in the MMR winrate discrepancy, and making Yorick a less frustrating champ both to play AS and against.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut, this wouldn't be a fair analysis without viewing the cons too! Just what is it that makes this such a seemingly unattainable move by Riot, when the ability to better balance champs would improve the playerbase's experience?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nActually, there's just one con.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRiot would have to do a one patch overhaul of a number of champs - and nothing intensive, just a shift of numbers.\r\n\r\nYep. That's it. All that stands between Riot and a more balanceable game is the decision to actually do it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheers for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-29T03:45:21.014+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"there is actually some point to using total ad scaling instead of bonus ad scaling + base damage, since levels don't always equate to gold, especially on tank champions, whose win condition in high elo lanes is more dependent on a level advantage than gold distribution.\n\nAdditionally in some matchups, a champion would much prefer to change their build or levelling order.\n\nFor instance Sion's q is a total AD spell, which gives him good value when building tank due to his high base ad, but also balances the possibility of Sion getting a lead in lane and buying bruiser items. In this case, Sion is rewarded for level advantage through both base ad and levels in the skill, and he even gets a bonus for being ahead in lane and possibly having a bruiser item like Steraks/Black Cleaver/Titanic.\n\nThese 3 factors are critical to Sion's role as a lanebully tank and his role in the meta.\n\nHowever Sion's q also has a 200% damage bonus dependant on channel time, which would generally make lethality/ad Sion builds ridiculous if it was a bonus ad ratio significant enough to reward bruiser Sions for winning their lanes equally to the total ad ratios currently used (since bruisers with level advantage get a feed in from base ad + bonus ad).\n\nIt's very important to consider how base stats impact dynamics of laning, especially toplaners, and particularly tanks. A 'buff base damages' and convert it to a 'bonus ad ratio' approach is very shortsighted, and assumes wrongly, that levels are equally valuable to all champions in all lane matchups.","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Scrub","date":"2018-12-29T15:41:36.779+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heyo, I think I was't clear enough in what the the conversion is here. I'm not talking about splitting the base AD into 5 tiers that increase when you rank a skill up. I'm talking splitting the base AD into 18 segments that go up with your level, the same way Zoe passive currently does and a number of other abilities. You already get that extra damage on the skill when you level up, from base AD growth: All I'm saying is shift it from \"Hidden in total AD scaling\" to \"Hidden in base skill damage\".\n\nYou can change your leveling and building order and it wouldn't matter; the conversion is PURELY cosmetic, not a single number in all of Lol is altered, no matter what you do.\n\nWe'll consider your Sion example.\nHis Q is:\n90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% AD)\nThis is identical to\n90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% base AD) (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% bonus AD)\n\nFrom there, the initial \"white\" base ability damage and the damage that comes from base AD are converted into a new white number.\nSo you get\nx1 / x2 / x3 / x4 / x5 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% bonus AD), where the xs are the appropriate number; 18 different level increments from base AD, 5 different rank increments from skill rank, all combined into one white number.\n\nAlternatively, because Sion's an odd case in having this \"scaling total AD %\", you can just leave it as\n90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% base AD) (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% bonus AD)\n\n\nThese 3, \n\n90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% AD)\n90 / 150 / 210 / 270 / 330 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% base AD) (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% bonus AD)\nx1 / x2 / x3 / x4 / x5 (+ 135 / 157.5 / 180 / 202.5 / 225% bonus AD)\n\nAre all numerically identical. AD Sion does not have a single number change. Tank Sion does not have a single number change. Q max Sion does not have a single number change. E max Sion does not have a single number change. They are algebraically identical in every way, they just look different.\n\nIt is PURELY a coding side cosmetic change, a balance team \"Quality of Life\" change, if you will, that allows them to tweak the champ's values easier. They are algebraically identical in every way, they just look different.\n\nFor example, right now, say that hypothetically Tank Sion is too strong and AD Sion is too weak. If they increase his total AD scaling by 5%, you just handed tanks free damage, since you gave them 5% base damage scaling packaged away inside of total AD. You just buffed tank damage alongside AD damage, thus meaning it's always gonna be better to go tank.\n\nHowever, with the \"cosmetic change\" I suggest, Riot can directly buff BONUS AD by 5%. This will give you 5% of whatever AD you buy, but will give tanks *NOTHING*. And so with this slight repackage, suddenly Riot can balance AD Sion without the collateral damage of overbuffing tank Sion in the process - or they can buff/nerf tank Sion without making AD OP.\n\nThe change itself does not change a single number in all of LoL. What it DOES do is make the scalings more accessible independently of each other, making it far more viable and far less collaterally damaging to consider balancing AD Sion to be viable ALONGSIDE Tank Sion. It means these niche styles you love can stop being overlooked by Riot, lest they break the more mainstream styles.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-30T11:45:46.660+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wait, do you mean, you would like to display a ratio as\n\n(base damage) + (base ad scaling) + (bonus ad scaling) = total damage\n\n( x ) + ( y % ) + ( z % ) = total damage\n\nbecause if you are, you could have definitely made that clearer in the first post.

OG Yorrick and Morderkaiser).","replies":[{"poster":"Baron Von Scrub","date":"2018-12-29T15:45:05.759+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just to rephrase what I said in the other comment; You're not giving anyone more free base damage. No number shifts.

Yorick ghouls aren't going from 2 AD to 21 AD at level 1, they're ALREADY on 21 AD currently - this just makes that more visible, and means Riot can potentially buff Yorick's AD incentives without giving free damage to tank Yorick, just like how it would allow them to buff Sion's AD incentives without buffing tank Sion's damage. :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2018-12-30T11:46:33.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it might be clearer just to show it has double scalings, such as with shaco e, it has an ap ratio and an ad ratio displayed but in different colours.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
