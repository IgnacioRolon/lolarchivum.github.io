To soothe my hunger for ranked goodness I play Flex. Although Flex is nice I can&#039;t really brag with it. So I came here to ask for any skilled **ADC** mains (Preferably the **Non Laggy** kind) in Mid to High Silver that will like to duo with a friendly stranger that has his mother only let him play Video-games on Fridays to Sundays only {{item:3070}}   and is ok with a bit of banter on the discord. \r\n\r\nI do play a bit of a small pool of champs including: \r\n{{champion:121}} \r\n{{champion:56}} \r\n{{champion:154}} (If not banned) \r\n{{champion:90}} \r\n{{champion:53}} \r\n{{champion:16}} \r\n{{champion:9}} (If you&#039;re into that)\r\n\r\nI am quite content on playing a few Norms or Flex to get a feel for each other and to synergize our play style. \r\nIf you are unsure when is a good time to Duo for me its Friday nights and on the weekend (I am a student btw) So that makes this a little more difficult but I hope we are able to work something out. \r\n\r\nI really look forward to Duoing with you and that you also have a good time bantering.  **Bonus points if you&#039;re a grill ;) **\r\nHit me up in the DM&#039;s on Discord if you wanna Duo. ** Snoddy#4049**\r\nI look forward to Duoing with you! \r\nLove Snoddy &lt;3","replies":[]}
