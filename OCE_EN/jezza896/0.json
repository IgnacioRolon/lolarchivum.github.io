If she gets ahead in lane she will crush you for it. Make sure you're running +12 Magic Resist Glyphs in mid and look to build either {{item:3001}} or {{item:3174}} as an early pickup to stop her snowballing.\n\nLeblancs kill potential pre-6 is pretty mediocre, and second to that she REALLY SUCKS AT FARMING when pushed under turret. This is huge for denying her in lane. If you can pick a safe waveclearing champion and look to cs and shove her under turret (being aware of where the jungler is) she has to use spells to get farm. (and even then her W will screw up the wave so its unfarmable, and her Q will only guarantee her 1). Apart from this Leblanc players typically are always looking for a trade. So you can bait them quite easily. Communicate with your jungler that you are going to bait her W out (as you know shes going to use the q-W combo whenever she has the chance). Once she's used it she has no escape and its your opportunity to all in her with the jungler. \n\n\nAnother thing to note is that if she uses W to farm at all and then uses another spell after level 6, this is an opportunity to all in her. She wont have any form of damage to retaliate with (thats enough to kill you anyway) and using another spell means her mimic of W wont be available.\n\nLeblancs teamfighting ability is really poor. She cant just ignore the frontline and kill your squishies if you're grouped up well and have any form of CC ready for her. Go into a siege position and watch your flanks! If shes not in vision she is looking for a pick, so make sure you're aware of where she could be. Forcing a siege position is great for the fact her only true waveclear is her W/R. Both put her at risk of getting poked and caught. Also most team compositions have mid-laners to rely on for waveclear. Hers is especially weak in these situations.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RA63ING F1R3","date":"2016-03-12T10:38:20.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Leblanc is perfectly balanced\n{{champion:7}} {{item:3165}} xD\n","replies":[{"poster":"Jezza896","date":"2016-03-12T10:39:47.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"RA63ING F1R3","date":"2016-03-12T10:46:06.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If not y hasnt she been debuffed{{champion:7}}","replies":[{"poster":"Jezza896","date":"2016-03-12T10:48:36.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"SHE WAS NEVER FUKN DEBUFFED U ALCHOHOLIC BLITZCRANK! {{champion:53}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[{"poster":"RA63ING F1R3","date":"2016-03-12T10:53:47.202+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My point if shes op she would be debuffed","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-03-12T10:56:09.634+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the problems was riot gave her 5 buffs in a row without reason","replies":[{"poster":"Jezza896","date":"2016-03-12T11:28:00.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"her Q needs change because when she hits with a buff it does SO MUCH damage, its insane.
