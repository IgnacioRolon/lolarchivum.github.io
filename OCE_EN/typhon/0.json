He also provided the name of his main account which I really want to share but naming and shaming is frowned upon. I still play LoL even though all my friends have abandoned me because I enjoy the game and the competitive nature of the game. I&#039;m going to avoid playing ranked now since it seems pointless if someone can just buy an account, pay for a boost or have a friend play his account (still boosting). I guess like so many I&#039;ll have to report and move on, which is sad because this truly does ruin the game.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-07-14T06:47:31.687+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":">What will Riot do when a booster admits to boosting an account after a rank game?\n\nNothing, because they don't really care, fact is if someone has the money to buy a boost, riot don't want to ban them because they have disposable income.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-14T09:33:08.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They will ban the original account, but not the booster's main or the actual player getting boosted's future accounts.
