I mean kassadin is supposed to be a late game hyper carry, but with 450 range ult I don't see how he can possibly be relevant at any stage of the game anymore. I usually don't complain when riot tries to balance the game out but I believe this is over the top.\n\nWith 450 range he wouldn't even be able to close the gap on an ADC.... I can't help but feel this nerf is completely directed at professional play, which is unfair to the rest of the League of Legends community. I can only hope they don't go through with it....","replies":[]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-02-21T23:00:08.086+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh sweet so now dumb bricks can't play like derpy kids and fly off your screen the second they sense danger!","replies":[]},{"poster":"RagingThundarino","date":"2015-02-21T10:21:57.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree the nerf is going to hurt him, but the truth his he needs a nerf.

I am very puzzled why they'd hit the the ult so hard, I guess everyone was sick of him jumping on carries and blowing them up, but I don't see Kassadin as much of a burst mage his role is also another doozy. The problem I find is, that they nerfed the damage on his q and then they reduce the ults range and all that is done in return is lowering the stacking mana cost but by simple math this only means that you'll be able to ult and extra 1 or 2 times.
