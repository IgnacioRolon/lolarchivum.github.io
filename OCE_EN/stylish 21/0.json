I can always come back with good scaling and make key plays late game{{summoner:6}} . I don't see my fault. \n\nAny advice on the situation? It kinda pull me back a lot in some of my games.

Also, Draven can't scale in that situation, you are as useless as a bard trying to do damage late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"II DeCeiVeD II","date":"2019-09-09T16:56:26.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The i can feed early cause i scale late mentality is the issue most likely. Try play safe early if you get behind, cause if you die a bit early and the enemy bot lane takes over the map it affects all your laners/jgler and the lanes that were slightly ahead/even are now losing due to the enemy botlane pressure thats where the frustration would come from, on the other hand your in the low elo bracket and alot of players there are looking to blame others for the loss and give up mentally as soon as someone dies a few times, its a common trait amongst low elo players and is also the reason they cant climb as they never focus on what they did wrong and only blame others.. if people start being toxic, mute them its the best way... focus on your game try to make less mistakes and remember its a team game so what you do affects your team","replies":[]}]}
