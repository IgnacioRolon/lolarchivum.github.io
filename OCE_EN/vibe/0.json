I didn&#039;t know what the issue was when I got into game, so I did various things such as restart the client, restart my computer etc etc and spend about 20 minutes trying to figure out what the issue was.\r\n\r\nTurns out turning off the software mouse option somewhat resolved this issue (although it makes the game unplayable without disabling other Mac features such as spaces) and I ended up winning this ranked game. \r\n\r\nBUT when I got out of game I found myself in low priority que. \r\nSo I just spent 20 minutes trying to make the game work, and I get an afk warning because of it.\r\nIs this justified?","replies":[]}
