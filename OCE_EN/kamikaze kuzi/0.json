I know that his walking animation changed significantly, but still having the original recall doesn&#039;t make it worthy of being a 1350 RP skin. The new blood moon skins have a different recall and they are only 975 Rp. Please add a new backing animation for astronautilus!","replies":[{"poster":"Bunny","date":"2016-02-28T23:30:59.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.\n\nIf a skin is 1350 RP it should definitely include a new recall.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-29T08:59:07.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would really love if he would have a recall where he does something with floating around.","replies":[]}]}]}
