This \"button\" or client setting would honestly be a waste of Riot's time/money/effort. It's not hard to cycle through and pick a different skin every game, given you actually play the champion enough. I have multiple Ahri skins and I usually stick with the same one, I like all of them but doesn't mean I'm going to alternate. Same goes for Nidalee and Akali. I have at least 3 skins for all of them but rarely use more than 1 or 2.\n\nIt's simply not that hard to switch skins yourself. What would randomizing it do if you could easily change it.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-23T10:54:07.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No sense of adventure!
