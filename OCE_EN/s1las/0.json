Will require some effort. \n\nOther things you can do is hire a coach ([lol-coaching.com](http://lol-coaching.com) is one such site - i recommend Saiclone on that, he's very good), watching youtube higher rated players (for Zac I recommend watching TheOddOne, search for him) and you can also create a diary of your improvement and what you need to change.\nHere is some other good advice that i found on these boards:\n\n> [{quoted}](name=Main Line,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=xgp4AbnZ,comment-id=00080000,timestamp=2016-04-26T13:13:43.263+0000)\n>\n> Do everything you can to **get towers and protect your own towers**. If you are in a situation where you cannot do this, then think about the baron/dragon.\n> \n> Don&#x27;t all rush to dragon when it spawns if you have \n> \n> 1) No vision\n> 2) Your lanes are not pushing over halfway\n> 3) Your jungler is miles away\n> 4) Enemy team are all up and MIA (they are likely in the dragon pit already!)\n> \n> Learn to give up dragons to re-acquire map pressure. Otherwise you&#x27;ll just set yourself up to lose quickly.\n> \n> And most of all, don&#x27;t chase after 1 kill. You&#x27;ll lose map pressure, losing towers. And towers win games in Season 6.\n\nGood luck! Bronze is actually very easy to escape by having a little more game knowledge, and **how to handle people** skills. Another thing, I wish that all oce players under platinum watched those two videos by Yasei Doubutsu, because in essence, dynamic queue has made gold the new bronze.","replies":[]}]}
