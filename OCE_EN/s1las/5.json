Eg, can I get mystery gifts for Sejuani specifically for her skin and hope for the best because she&#039;s only for a few skins ? Or it doesn&#039;t work like that? \r\n\r\nHelp please ! As I really want Sejuani poro skin","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-09-07T09:46:58.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Indeed! The Poro Sejuani skin is a Snowdown skin, which typically go on sale around the December months. Additionally, yes, you can get the skin from Mystery Gifts, as the skin is Legacy and not Limited or Mythic. Hope that helps!","replies":[]}]}
