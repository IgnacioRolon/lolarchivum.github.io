Caught somebody using my account and immediately changed the password. Days later, Riot permabanned the account and refuse to unban despite knowing the context.\n\n\nI never thought I&#039;d need to make a post like this, but it&#039;s reached the point now where I can&#039;t see any other way to get an appropriate response than to make a public post and hope for the best.\n\nAbout a week ago, my friend saw my account online at a time I was not. Days prior, I had noticed suspicious things happening on my account, such as the mouse sensitivity changing and status messages, conversations appearing that I hadn&#039;t written, and being booted from client due to another playing attempting to log in. Initially, I suspected my family or partner messing with my client while I was away from the computer, and the logins to be the result of spaghetti code. After all, I&#039;d never given away my account information, how could somebody be attempting a login?\n\nHowever, we caught the guy. My friend messaged him (I was at work at the time and receiving the news through Facebook messenger) and confronted him. He confessed that he had simply found the account details on a website full of cracked League accounts. He linked us the details, though when we informed him that we would change the password, he started threatening to DDoS us and began to harass people on my friends list. We ended up getting the account back, and even though he had played (and lost) thirteen games on my account, I assumed that would be the worst of the damage and left it at that. I neglected to contact Riot about the situation as I didn&#039;t believe that they could do anything to help beyond what I had already done.\n\nFast forward to a few days later. I go to log into my account, and to my absolutely shock and horror, discover that I&#039;ve been permanently banned. I check my email to see why and read that I&#039;ve been permanently suspended for use of third-party software.\nI have never used, nor even considered, using third-party software (beyond obvious things such as Curse Voice and Discord). Obviously, I quickly made the connection to the guy who was using my account (or whoever had cracked my details to begin with), and felt at ease knowing that surely Riot would unban my account once I explained the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, that has not been the case.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1Wa38\n\nThe imgur album linked shows my communication with Riot support following the incident. While the messages themselves explain their response better than I can in words, they have completely ignored the context beyond a simple &quot;sorry for the unpleasantness of this situation&quot;. Beyond the evidence I provided in support tickets, they themselves surely have access to log-in details and chat logs that would lend themselves in my favour. Despite this, the investigation team are &quot;100% certain&quot; that this ban is justified and flawless.\n\nI&#039;ve played League since Elise&#039;s release in October 2012. I&#039;ve spent over $1700AUD on RP and close to 1000 hours in game according to WastedOnLol (potentially longer due to normals game data?).\nRiot&#039;s complete lack of empathy thoroughly disgusts me here, and their refusal to change their stance on this issue, despite the glaring evidence in my favour.\n\nI want to play League of Legends. Not a single game I&#039;ve played has come close to the level of involvement I&#039;ve invested into this account. My account was taken from me without my knowledge or consent and I am now suffering the punishment for the actions of another player (or players). Refusing to unban my account not only removes a dedicated player from the game, but does absolutely nothing to stop the culprit and many others from doing the same thing. Nobody wins here except the hacker, and Riot refuse to acknowledge this.\n\nApologies for the length of this post, but I can&#039;t see any other way to get attention for this. I&#039;ve seen this work for others so this is now my final resort. Hoping for the best.","replies":[{"poster":"Wolfcchi","date":"2017-10-11T23:04:02.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Did you get your account back?","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar Goddess","date":"2017-10-14T13:14:25.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, Riot came through in the end. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Idols","date":"2017-10-09T12:11:20.776+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"A friend of mine had his account hacked + permabanned and was initially denied its recovery but then managed to have it unbanned and returned to him after a bit of persistence; he had evidence and stuff to back it up as well so hopefully Riot is reasonable enough to listen eventually seeing as you can prove it wasn't you breaking the rules\n\nGood luck!!","replies":[{"poster":"Lunar Goddess","date":"2017-10-09T12:29:36.438+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's actually really helpful news - do you have any more details??
