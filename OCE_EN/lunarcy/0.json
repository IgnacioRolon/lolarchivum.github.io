However with the amount of rerolls available and being able to go back on a roll or pick up another players discarded champ means that it is easier to get the more powerful champs. So it is no longer truly random anymore.","replies":[{"poster":"xXDiddimsXx","date":"2019-02-20T04:04:39.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bruh who cares\nyou win some you lose some","replies":[]}]}
