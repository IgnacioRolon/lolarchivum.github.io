This isn&#039;t an isolated effect either as there has a few occasions recently where I&#039;ve been knocked up while in Ragnarok or been affected by some other form of CC.\r\nHas something broken the code for his ult?","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-10T06:53:11.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Lunarcy,\n\nWhile we do appreciate you taking your time to report a bug, because this is the Help and Support boards, we try to limit posts to technical issues and general questions. As such, I'd like to direct you to the [**Report A Bug**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) sub-boards for posting your bug reports. The Riot staff looking for bug reports frequent those sub-boards more than they frequent the Help & Support sub-boards, so you'll have a higher chance of having the issue addressed if you post there. \n\nCheers!","replies":[]}]}
