Yet nowhere within the document does it reference Blue Essence.\r\nSo currently Blue Essence is outside the scope and definition of the Terms of Use. \r\nSeems like someone forgot to re write those sections.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-22T07:30:37.916+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While the [ToU](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse) doesn't make specific reference to *Blue* Essence, it does include a section on Hextech Crafting (4.1.3 \"With Hextech Crafting and Loot\") which states, and I quote, \"When you or your premade team perform well in the Game, you may receive virtual items such as keys, chests, shards, and/or *essences* (“Hextech Items”) which you can use to unlock and acquire access to various Virtual Items.\" so Blue Essence (and Orange Essence) is covered under the current agreements.\n\nThat said, you do have a point with the references to IP, as that is no longer in-game there is no logical reason for that to be covered under the agreements. One might argue that there is a possibility (however slim) that Riot may revert the changes and bring back IP, but if that were to happen they could simply modify the ToU to reflect that change rather than keeping outdated information within the agreements. It does seem unusual considering the most recent change(s) to the ToU were made on the 14th November, after the change to the new system.","replies":[{"poster":"Lunarcy","date":"2017-11-22T07:44:20.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"However with the merge of IP and BE, it is no longer tracked within the hextech loot system. \nI think this point has gained some level of importance considering the decision reached by the Belgium Gambling commission on 'lootboxes' and gambling.","replies":[]}]}]}
