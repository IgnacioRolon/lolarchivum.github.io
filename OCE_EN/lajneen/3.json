If you guys are so convinced that your community is being ruined why are you so opposed to change? I am trying to help you guys move away from this inferiority complex that&#039;s corrupting the OCE community, but it seems you guys would rather want things to stay as they are. I understand that you guys don&#039;t know how to do anything other than complain and play the victim, but it doesn&#039;t have to be that way. Together we can make OCE great ~~again~~ for the first time!\n\nWe gotta make a change.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZeTJ3PoXTI","replies":[]}
