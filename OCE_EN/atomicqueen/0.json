But for those who are, say hi?\r\n\r\nMainly I kinda want to have a conversation about the way chat censoring is handled RE: the queer community. I understand the historical use of the word as a slur makes it more sensitive in the U.S, for example, but in Melbourne it's the most popular catch-all term for everyone. ~~(I mean \"gay\" is kinda misleading in some cases, and who can be arsed saying LGBTQIAwhatever every time you want to talk about your friends in particular groups)~~\r\n\r\nAnyway, so, the word is censored in chats. That'd make sense on other servers, but maybe not on the OCE one? Like I try to talk to friends on there about being queer and all it comes out as is \"I'm ******\" which is kinda odd.\r\nI first noticed it cause some toxic onion-eyed ratsbane was running around saying \"die fa***t\" and wanted to respond with \"dude, I'm queer, find another insult\" but it was censored.\r\n\r\nI just find it really weird that people can run around freely using homophobic slurs by substituting the G for Q and other methods that people running the servers never seem to catch out, but you can't defend yourself with popular, mainstream identifying labels from the actual queer community.\r\n\r\n(I'd \"get over it\" as some people have suggested, but since homophobia in Australia is rampant enough that people are still targeted for beatings and shiz, ~~not to mention we have the biggest homophobe as a prime minister~~ I feel like it's worth still having discussions over.)\r\nRant over, whatever, add your thoughts as you all like.","replies":[{"poster":"Justify","date":"2014-12-28T14:02:46.080+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"pretty sure a large majority of gay people in Australia are tolerated, if not welcomed and enjoyed.","replies":[{"poster":"atomicqueen","date":"2014-12-30T10:13:45.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like your attitude.

Gender- and racially- motivated violence is much more predominant, for one thing.\nAs well, you don't have entire communities of those minorities saying, \"this is how we want to be called.\" Instead you have the people against whom those slurs are violent descriptors saying, \"this offends us. Do not use these words in public.\"\nBut you do have heaps of LGBT community members at marches and protests and festivals saying, \"I'm here, I'm queer!\" I do think the definition of a slur changes when the people the word was designed to hurt decide it does.\n\nYou are totally 100% right about the necessity of drawing a line though.\n\nAnd outlining Australia's attitude towards slurs is a really good point. I guess I would rather the word be censored than see it be used as a way of joking between friends in the Aussie sense. Like the subtext of those jokes is always \"you're disgusting and I love you for it\" which is loving and great, but then you're equating \"queer\" as \"disgusting\" and the implications of THAT--especially used against people who struggle with their sexuality/identity--are just gross.\n\nAnyway thanks for the talk~","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-28T13:34:17.584+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for being one of the very few people who break up walls of text.\nNow I've said that.\n\nThe majority of people don't care, especially if you run across one of the many %%%%s who just be %%%%s for the sake of being %%%%s.\nOften if you reply to them you'll just be making the situation worse.\n\nAs GoldenTomato said just turn chat filter off, most people do this, I know of very few people who leave it on (only one I can think of off the top of my head is LoserFruit but she is a streamer).\nI also doubt the viability as LoL being a place where you can discuss LGBTQ things with people, very few mature people around.\n\n\nPS: banter banter banter.","replies":[{"poster":"atomicqueen","date":"2014-12-30T10:20:54.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a firm believer in provoking situations where my expectations of other people's maturity are bound to be disappointed. :P ~~how else could I play LoL~~ It still leads to more interesting things than moping about the stupidity of humanity does, anyway.\n\nGood points, thanks for your addition~","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2014-12-30T11:31:56.317+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Moping about the stupidity of humanity is half the stuff my fellow scientists and I do!\nIt's great fun.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-28T06:16:11.861+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Title is click-bait.\n\nAlrighty, queer is most likely filtered due to it being more derogatory than the others. A lot of gay people don't like to be called queer, as queers meaning is odd.

This one person got bored and tried to actually talk to people on the internet, you won't believe what happened next!!!!11!!!* omg liek such clickbait\nEdit: Well, I guess I did try to make it relevant to the topic? Siigh. I go to LGBT forums to talk about LGBT stuff in games, and all they want to talk about is the next party happening and pokemon. I like talking about language and people's opinions on it and how it evolves, but that irritates people to no end apparently. I'm boring, so sue me.\n\nFor reals though, why is it considered more derogatory than the others? On whose terms? Why is the current cultural context being ignored in favour of what might be no longer relevant?\n\nI go to gay bars when I want to, sometimes queer events. To everyone in lgbt communities Melbourne that I've interacted with, it's already been reclaimed, and the only people I know who claim it as derogatory are straight people.\nI'm aware the cultural context of elsewhere might be different--again, it seems much more sensitive in the U.S, but we're not America, are we--so I guess I'm just trying to suss out whether other LGBTQ people on OCE servers see it as such. See the flip side of the coin to my limited experiences. I'm very curious about why people feel the way they do bout some words but not others.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-28T09:24:30.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty sure the one thing everyone has disabled in their game settings is the chat filter.
