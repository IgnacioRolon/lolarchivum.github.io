( nerf ) (Give him a stronger mr scaling to make up for the harsh nerf.\r\n\r\nQ: does 5% more crit damage at level 16\r\n\r\nW: make his wind wall have a 40 second cooldown at rank 1, 37 at rank 2, 33 at rank 3, 30 at rank 4 and at level 5. But at level 5, using e on a minion or champ refills his shield by 5% per dash. I feel like the level 5 yasuo windwall passive is pretty cool because you will be maxing this one last so it goes to the late game power and to make up for it taking twice as long to generate while walking.\r\n\r\nE: does 20 less damage at all ranks and can&#039;t use it more than once on the same target for 3 more seconds.\r\n\r\nR: base damage level 1: 200, level 2: 450, level 3: 600.\r\n\r\nR passive: if yasuo ults off another player&#039;s knock up then he deals the ult damage and only gets 50% armour pen and nothing else.\r\n\r\nIf yasuo knocks his enemies up by himself:\r\n\r\nR: ulting at least 2-3 target makes his Crits do 50% more damage, 50% armour pen and makes his q deal true damage. ulting 5 targets at one makes the ult do TRUE DAMAGE and gives him 100% armour pen and true damage on his q and makes him invulnerable by a wind shield covering him for 3 seconds. you may think that this is op but what are the chances of him ulting 5 people up? If you spread out like 2 cm this won&#039;t be a problem. And since the ult requires a champ to be knocked up it should be stronger that a champ that doesn&#039;t require the champ to be knocked up and you can easily avoid getting knocked up by yasuo by using a movement spell right before he uses e q on you. And if he doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s pretty easy to dodge. If you don&#039;t have any movement spells I suggest you don&#039;t get in range for him to ult you.\r\n\r\n20 less base damage at level 1 (HUGE NERF) he does like Janna auto attack damage) but gets much more ad per level)\r\n\r\nbase stats: 500 health ( nerf) but gets more hp per level to compensate (only a tiny tiny bit)\r\n\r\nAnd armour nerfs since he&#039;s a melee adc. But he gets more armour per level (only a tiny tiny bit so he doesn&#039;t get that blown up in team fights.)\r\n\r\nAnd magic resist base stat nerf to make up for the stronger mr scaling\r\n\r\nYou may think this is op but it really isn&#039;t because in order for melee adcs to be affective they need strong kits. It would not be fair for a ranged adc to have a stronger kit than a melee squishy adc.\r\n\r\nIf you think he&#039;s going to be too strong late game you can end the game before he gets to his strengths because it will be a 4v5 before he gets level 18.\r\n\r\n&#039;But he&#039;s manaless&#039; you can&#039;t really give yasuo mana or energy because it doesn&#039;t fit his kit. His spells aren&#039;t really worthy of costing mana because they aren&#039;t really that strong and he would run out of mana or energy in like 3 seconds because he needs to use it a lot and very quickly in a short amount of time. It&#039;s more about his auto attacks that his main strength comes. Also his ult requiring him to knock someone up compensates for this.\r\n\r\nI nerfed his early and shifted it to his late game because I feel like a vayne shouldn&#039;t be out damaging me when she is ranged and iam not in late game and in the current meta where lulu destroys yasuo with her w making him useless I felt like he just needed something to make him viable again.\r\n\r\nMaybe we may even make yasuo viable for lcs. It would probably be interesting to see yasuo in play and actually do good.\r\n\r\n&#039;He has low cds&#039; oh so would it make sense if we made his a q on a 10 second cooldown? It would take 30 seconds to throw a tornado and it doesn&#039;t even deal damage early on.\r\n\r\nFeel free to reply to me about how you feel about this rework and what you would change about it.\r\n\r\nTips: yasuo is very kitable when not in a minion wave. You can punish him early when he is squishy and deals small damage. He is very vulnerable to gamks so if he over extends, punish him for it. And finally play champs that counter him, like Fiora and Darius and rammus and much more.\r\n\r\nWhenever I play against yasuo I always destroy him because I know how to play against him. You can try and convince me all you want about him being op, but I won&#039;t budge.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#039;t circlejerk I&#039;m just trying to get some thoughts );\r\n\r\nThanks for reading (;","replies":[{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2017-10-29T04:12:09.754+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"And if he doesn't, it's pretty easy to dodge.
