My internet connection was working while this happened as I was on skype. I managed to re-log in 17 minutes after my game had started.\r\n\r\nI later tried launching the client and got a different error;\"RADS ERROR\" which occurred after the first issue was resolved.\r\n\r\n**Now after launching the client I get a Leaver Buster message, saying I have to agree to not leaving any further games .. (from the initial 17m 'afk') doesn't seem fair that i get a leaver buster warning for problems outside my direct control?**","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-10T23:55:25.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people are currently experiencing the same problem, it may not be an issue on your end.
