I have won both ARAM and Summoners Rift today and neither are giving double Ocean Week points! I signed in on the evening of the first day and it had already changed the city to Perth. This morning it is back to Melbourne, showing city defended but not adding up any more points. The website claims that Summoners Rift was supposed to be providing 2 points per win on the 23 - 24 of January but it just isn&#039;t doing it. What gives Riot? {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2016-01-24T01:16:48.653+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're looking into this: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/Aw18u40O-ocean-week-points-issue\n\nThe Perth image you saw for a bit last night went up automatically by mistake.

My points and all screwed up. Not getting double points on SR either. Saw the city change last night (and back to Mel this morn) and thought double points may have moved on too but NOPE.
