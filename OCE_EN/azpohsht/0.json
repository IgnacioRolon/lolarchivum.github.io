This means that ranked is typically cut off for me in the middle of couple hours worth of gaming. \r\n\r\nI am unsure how accurate the matchmaking is during cutoff time, or how the population numbers are monitored, which makes me wonder if it has improved since this was implemented. Would a re-evaluation of this cutoff time be required? Do many other people want to play ranked past the 4 a.m mark or am I the only one?","replies":[{"poster":"Xelvi","date":"2015-03-03T00:53:55.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oceanic ranked matchmaking is bad enough as it is.","replies":[]}]}
