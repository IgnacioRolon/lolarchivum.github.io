Anyway, when I was around level 14 or something, someone told me about Heimerdinger, and that I should buy him. The first time I used him I got an S on him, which was the only time I had ever got an S on a champion. This happened twice in a row. I am not trying to brag, I&#039;m just saying that he is very easy to use and that he does REALLY well at lower levels (he might be bad by the time people are level 30), so why do I not see any? I have only ever seen one Heimerdinger player, who played supportdinger :(. I think he is an amazing champion at low levels and he is really fun! Why do I never see anyone play him? He might be considered bad, but at low levels people should certainly use more Heimerdinger.","replies":[{"poster":"Ten Inch Rooster","date":"2016-05-19T21:19:12.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just a heads up, his hardest counters are Syndra and Morgana.  If you see someone pick them in draft mode as a mid (you will RARELY see Morg in mid though these days) so not pick Heimer into them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YellowBrickRoad","date":"2016-05-18T08:54:46.264+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"im only a bronzie so take what i say with a grain of salt.\n\nBut if there is one thing i know its tactical gameplay, and heimer does not suit it.\n\nImagine for a second, that you are up against a well organised team, they are moving around the map never in the same location for more than they need to be.\n\nAnd you are playing a champion that has to setup his turrets before the enemy team has arrived.\n\nIn low level play, bronze, and siilver he does fine because teams are unorganised and do not know how to play around constant lane pressure (if heim is pushing bot send someone who can displace his turrets or has huge wave clear to freeze the lane just infront of his turrets bot, send the rest of the team to take top towers or mid towers thus isolating heimer from his team, or taking towers, either way either the heim dies and your heim delayer doesnt, or the heim delayer gets ganked but you get objectives, reverse the strat for top, and if heim is pushing mid hes not going to get very far when you can collapse on him from every single direction)","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2016-05-18T11:28:51.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, exactly, he does really well at a low level, especially even before lvl 30, but I still don't see much of him here. Do people not use him because high level people say he is bad, so people at a low level listen to them and don't use him, yet they don't realise he is very good at their level, just not a higher level?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-05-18T06:23:56.161+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heimer top main but with recent buffs to certain champs and tank meta he really is just a bronze stomper.\nA good heimer can 1 v 5 and get a quadra, did it 5 games back went 23 4 4 as heimer top. Champs like Sion, Poppy, Ali, Yasuo, Ekko, Anivia, Zed, Lux, etc... can easily counter heimer so basically if you aren't good at using him then don't bother as he can easily be outplayed if you know how to deal with him.\nHe can be great at top lane but mid lane is just a wasteland for him. His turrets are bugged atm with random direction with the secondary pass through beam from his turrets. \nYou also get called a noob, skilless and a troll for playing him but he really does take a lot of skill to play. People think it's just put turret down but you now have to auto attack the enemy champ to get turrets to attack them unless no minions are around.","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2016-05-18T06:33:02.984+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, he does take more skill than people think. I always used to play him mid but just this week I've started taking top lane, especially when it is 1v2 and you can get an easy double. Although, I still think midlane is good, especially at my level because most people either cannot play the midlane champion well enough or are much too aggressive","replies":[{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2016-05-18T06:50:40.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, do you thing Heimerdinger do you think Heimerdinger needs a buff? Do you think it will be soon?","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-05-18T08:07:03.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, he doesn't need a buff, if anything he needs nerfing. He is a specialized champ for special counters or normal pubstomping. He has so many counters he will never see pro play. I like him the way he is but think he is a little bit strong in some situations.\nBuffing him won't help at all but make laning even more frustrating for those that face him.\nThe only thing I could think of would be starting with three turrets from the start then back to the normal turrets by point in ability.\nPeople like yasuo, renekton, sion can easily kill a turret with one hit which makes his laning phase ever so difficult having three turrets makes these champ think twice about an easy play where heimer is vulnerable at level 1. I tp straight to top when tp is available at the start to get my three turrets down before minions come.  Otherwise the enemy laner can just take out that one turret leaving you with nothing but auto attacks.  I put first turret closest to the enemy in the middle bush at the edge then at 30 secs ward their first bush so you can see when they come. That way the secondary beam gets a hit in when they try to go into the second bush. Then the second in the turret circle outline just behind where the first melee minions of yours will fight and the third closest to the river unless there are champs like rumble who have a skill shot blocked by minions then stack the two behind the melee minions. I then create a triangle. I general play aggressive and push right up to the enemies river edge forcing the to farm under their turret while getting the enemy jungler to gank. I also take exhaust . When getting ganked run into the bush and as the jungler gets within in range, hit your ulty (r key) and drop the ulty turret then place any unplaced turrets in the bush. Also run around your turrets so melee champs have to chase you making them either get you or turrets either way they are taking lots of damage. I rush a {{item:3157}} asap if facing ad top and {{item:3001}} against ap.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-05-18T08:10:42.544+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tip: If you get a yi, throw your grenade after he alpha strikes as he will dodge the nade using alpha strike.

People don't get that. \n\n\nHe's a great champion and can definitely bring a lot to the table, if he's winning lane, he's utterly dominating and constantly pressuring the enemy lane because of his ability to push lane is unmatched. \n\nHe works in siege compositions and his turrets are great at protecting your backline. In team fights, you can also place turrets to quickly gain an advantage. A lot of players especially in the lowers at times even ignore the placement of his upgraded turrets.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DravensNation","date":"2016-05-18T04:46:52.557+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He gets countered super hard by certain champions *cough cough anivia*, he's immobile and to top it all off many other champions bring more to a team than him.\n\nI agree he's super fun and I think that others at lower levels don't play him due to the fact that he has a reputation as a troll champion :/.\n\nYou should keep playing him tho, just cause people don't play him doesn't mean you shouldn't. Take rezone for an example he made it to diamond by 1 tricking heimer and in my opinion he has some of the most fun when it comes to league out of any high elo player.\n\nHave a good day! :D\n- Katlife","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinnova","date":"2016-05-18T05:19:18.349+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
