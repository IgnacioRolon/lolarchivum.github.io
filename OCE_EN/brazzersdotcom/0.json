Then let&#039;s not get started on the whole issue of lp gains and losses. \r\n\r\nSo i hope i&#039;m not the only one that prays that riot actually takes the time to listen to players and stop buffing and nerfing things for just one patch to get some solid work done on it&#039;s completely fucked ranking system. I don&#039;t care when or how, but they need a way to fix these issues where the player that trolls, feeds, leaves, ask&#039;s, rages, flames, or dc&#039;s on purpose, leaves an impact of the way the ranked game plays out, because i&#039;m sick of losing games because of this kind of crap and i feel horrible winning games against the same kind of thing. I don&#039;t even mind if it were just a loss prevention thign either, just something needs to be changed.","replies":[{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-10-30T06:30:53.631+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the thing is Riot changes the game and listens to the top tier players (Challenger and so on) and this issue that you have said, although totally valid and I defiantly agree with you... is not something that really happens that often up there. I am sure it still happens from time to time. But not really as much as it does in bronze. It is sad but really they are better at the game than we are so they get to decide what needs to happen. Of course riot doesn't want to have toxic people ruin games but it is hard for them to do much with soooooo many people in the low ranks of LoL. Just do your best and maintain a positive winning attitude and I am sure you will improve with time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-29T15:42:58.447+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"u belong in silver, the system works fine stop complaining.","replies":[{"poster":"BRAZZERSDOTCOM","date":"2015-11-01T06:45:30.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never said i didn't belong here, i'm just saying, how much more would lower tiers win if there were repercussions for trolls and their kin","replies":[]}]}]}
