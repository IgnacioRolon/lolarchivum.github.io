My idea was that A certain portion from the prize pool from the winning teams cash prize from the League championship series  get&#039;s donated to the Syrian refugee crisis or a certain percent of profit riot makes goes towards the Syrian refugees. Here are some links you can click on to donate now if you feel as passionate as I do about this:\r\n https://www.worldvision.org.nz/portal/give/Syria.aspx \r\nhttps://www.unicef.org.nz/syria?gclid=CjwKEAjw7O6vBRDpi7O-8OWSkwESJACNFsgx15vGjFRKlrBfYnQuH84jdg55n7dJhjjEzulmY2-SxhoC3cPw_wcB","replies":[{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2015-09-19T03:36:10.210+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't speak from Riot's point of view, although it is not Riot's job to donate money to any charity or foundation. I understand these people are suffering and that is obviously not a nice thing to be happening to anyone. Who is to say that these people need help from Riot? or maybe the Starlight Foundation? Prostate cancer Foundation? There are so many people who need help brother, even some players suffer from certain problems, Blindness in one eye, people bound to a wheelchair, people who have Tourettes syndrome. the list goes on. Political views and opinions shouldn't be in a video game forum.\n\nIf Riot help these people then why don't Bethesda help the Heart Foundation and Valve help people suffering from ebola?\nIts not their job my friend.","replies":[]}]}
