I’m the weakest member here and everybody knows it.”\r\n“We need you, Lulu,” Lux stated, rising to her feet. “We are a team. We all need to work together. We were all chosen for a reason. That makes us all valuable.”\r\n“You still always take my breath away,” said Janna blushing.\r\n“You’re the perfect support. You increase all of our star power and make all of us big,” said Poppy, bashing her hammer into the ground for emphasis.\r\n“Hate to admit it, but she’s right,” Jinx sighed flicking her hair and avoiding eye contact.\r\n“As the universe needs heroes, we need each other.”\r\n\r\nLulu started to sob, rain drop tears sparkling down her face. “Y-you are all a-amazing,” Lulu sobbed.\r\n“Cuddly incoming,” Janna said as she floated towards Lulu and wrapped her arms around her.\r\nThe others followed and had a group hug. Jinx was again the last to make her way over. As the others glimpsed over at her she cackled. “Duck!” Jinx yelled causing the others a second of panic. In that moment Jinx jumped up and dived upon the others to join the group hug. “Hehe, just kidding, that won’t help at all,” she finished as all the others burst into laughter.\r\n\r\nAs the day went on the girls went about the rest of their school day, shared love interests during lunch and then parted ways to proceed to their last class. As the bell rang they rallied at the school gate to meet up again.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” each of the girls shouted as they neared each other. \r\n“O-m-g that was the worst class,” said Jinx dragging her voice. \r\n“I learnt all about the projection of light, I think it could even be harnessed for new abilities guys,” Lux said with excitement.\r\n“I stared at a cute guy, hehe,” Janna added, obviously still dreaming of the boy named Yasuo. “His hair just drifts with the wind and it’s just, ahhhh.”\r\n“OK, OK, enough already lover girl. Are we all forgetting that we need to travel through the Noxian district tonight to ensure the safe travels of the Vastarans?” Jinx questioned as everyone else was drifting off topic. \r\n“It’ll be fine,” said Lux. “It’s only a simple task. And there aren’t many Vastarans to worry about. Two Vastarans are decent warriors, so if anyone disrupts our travels, there are five of us and two more for providing assistance.”\r\nStill all questioning the group agreed they should prepare for the night ahead. \r\n\r\nPoppy polished her already dazzling hammer. “Why do you always prepare that thing even though we rarely face conflict?” asked Lulu. \r\n“My hammer does most of the work, I just swing it,” Poppy replied. \r\n“The light is shining, we should too,” Lux said, entering the room smiling.\r\n\r\nAs Jinx tightened her unnecessary extra belt, the team was ready to go. The group gathered in a line and held hands. Lux positioned in the middle with Poppy and Lulu to the right of her. Jinx and Janna by her left side. “For justice, and all things bright,” chanted Lux as they all rose into the air and then shot off like stars.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before they warped through space, with distance seeming like it collapsed before they could justify planets. Slowing they noticed their destination due to the glowing colourful ships. Xayah, Rakan and the Vastarans’ had already gathered and prepared. “Thank you for coming guardians,” said Xayah bowing low, which revealed all her vibrant coloured feathers.\r\nRakan dashed to her side and bowed as well trying to steal the spotlight.\r\n“Any excuse to twirl my wand,” Lux informed.\r\n“T-t-t-ta,” Jinx cackled, “I don’t even think once about wanting to blow stuff up.”\r\n“Pleased to meet you!” Lulu said with excitement and awe as she gazed at the purple feathers on Xayah.\r\n\r\nThe crew had met and was ready to embark to Vlonqo to retrieve more mystic artefacts and weapons to improve the survival odds of the Vastarans. The guardians began casting spells to give better flight and protection in space. Lulu provided a shield and put it around the ships the Vastarans had readied. “Man quests are hard. I could really go for a nap. Know what I could use? A cart,” Poppy said leaning against her hammer, her mouth beginning to spread a contagious yawn. \r\n“You’ll see more with your eyes closed,” said Lulu as she started to rummage thoroughly in her saddle. She pulled out a flower, “never look a tulip in the eye. Hmm Hmmm Hmm, ah I got it. Just a pinch.”\r\n\r\nLulu ripped off a piece of the flower and flicked it at Poppy. Janna persisted to smell it, so manipulating the wind, summoned it her way. With a sniff she dropped back, falling into a deep sleep. “They aren’t gonna like this,” Lulu whispered to Pix. \r\n“What was that,” queried Lux. \r\n“That much was meant for Poppy. Janna is going to be asleep for a while,” Lulu said feeling anxious.\r\n“That’s alright, we can do this,” Lux said as they others seemed worried that they were a guardian down for some of the journey.\r\n\r\nRakan smiled and began to tell stories about himself as this was his favourite topic. The guardians were interested but by observation of expressions it was obvious that the other Vastarans had heard these stories many times. A few were even mimicking Rakan, but he was too hyped to recognise. Xayah was just pleased to see her partner, Rakan, happy. As the stories continued and they drew closer to their destination, everyone was relaxed and enjoying themselves, apart from the ridiculously loud snoring that Janna was able to manifest.\r\n\r\nJinx looked around and felt a strange aura, as if the area around them was changing colour and trouble was lurking. “Wait I’m thinking! Ugh.. how do people do this?” Jinx questioned as she tried to mention her feelings. \r\n“What is it, Jinx,” asked Lux. “Are you getting crazy again?”\r\n“I am crazy! Got a doctor’s note. But seriously, we’re being followed.”\r\nLulu stretched up, peered around and noticed a strange vortex developing. Irrationally, she floated over and tasted it. “Yup, that tasted purple,” she stated while everyone starred shocked at why she would lick it.\r\n“Whatever, let’s just start shooting!” Jinx insisted. \r\n“We have to wait to know what this is girls. Ready your weapons and prepare for anything,” Lux declared.\r\n\r\nTense moments that seemed like forever were passing and the Vastarans and guardians began travelling faster and with more caution as the area continued to darken. “We can’t travel through this anymore. Why don’t you try to see if there is anything around us, Lux,” advised Poppy.\r\n“Illuminate the enemy. Burn away the shadows,” Lux implored.\r\n\r\nBalls of light dashed out of Lux’s wand in every possible direction. They looked like lanterns filling the sky. The beams then grew brighter and brighter, so bright that no one could see the result of whether something was nearby or not. The girls, continuing to wield their weapons, awaited their fate. \r\n\r\nThe density of the air seemed to begin to grow thicker still. Portals to the void, a realm of constant darkness, was surrounding them. The worst enemy imaginable had been following the guardians.\r\nEyes started peering out and clusters of creatures’ legs and tentacles rallied from every crevasse.\r\n\r\n“What do you want from us,” Lux shouted turning her head around to see if anything could understand her.\r\nIt seemed pointless as more and more creatures appeared out of the voids. Lux called again and Poppy, Lulu and Jinx echoed afterwards, “why are you here?”\r\nThe Vastarans started to panic and riot in effort to work out what was going on. Xayah calmed her crew with assurance that they were safe with the guardians. “Guns don’t kill. I mean, until you shoot them. Then they kill everything,” Jinx smirked, loading her guns. \r\n“Hope you like rainbows,” said Lux as she took the first shot at the creatures.\r\n\r\n“I’ll give you till the count of - time’s up! Katchoo,” screamed Jinx as she begin firing a fury of bullets into the enemy. Her attacks seeming to get faster and faster as her guns warmed up. \r\n“Transmogulate,” announced Lulu. Sparks flickered out, morphing the closest creatures into various animals. “That squirrel looks familiar.”\r\n“Ready hammer? Guess we’re fighting,” stated Poppy. “Keep swinging til’ you hit something,” she added, trying to raise the team’s morale.\r\n\r\nContinuing to fight off hordes of enemies, they proceeded towards their destination. Vlonqo was now in sight. “Make a hole so we can land,” yelled Lux.\r\nPoppy spun her hammer rapidly and slammed it down knocking a mass of enemies back into the void they had crawled from. Jinx set up a rocket on her shoulder that was at least three times the size of her. “Where did you get that?” puzzled some Vastarans from behind her.\r\nMinions and creatures in front of Jinx appeared to be shrieking and scurrying with fear. “Seriously, screaming helps, not at all,” boasted Jinx as she fired her oversized rocket.\r\nA huge hole was cleared for everyone to pass through.\r\n\r\nThey made it to their destination and everyone ran for the nearest temple. Shots were still being fired to prevent the approach of creatures that chased as they ran for shelter. “Xayah, Rakan, you guys get in there and find the weapons you are after,” Lux advised. “We will set up a perimeter at the front arch and hold them off.”\r\n\r\nXayah and Rakan went off in search for mystical weapons from their ancestors. They were scampering through jars and chests. Rakan kept his shield up to protect them from potential threats or booby traps set up by their ancestors. Xayah would insist on going first and burst into the air to dodge even the slightest hint of concern.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the entrance the guardians did a quick head count and realised Janna was not with them. “Where is Janna?” shouted Poppy.\r\nBefore she could even finish, Lulu had already jumped onto her floating broomstick and headed back out to the ship they had travelled in. “Zippy!” She shouted like a personal battle cry, casting a movement buff on herself.\r\n\r\n“Lulu,” they each called trying to get her to slow down and be aware of danger.\r\nNothing was stopping Lulu from getting to Janna, though. Blasts from every direction bounced around making Lulu duck and weave. Launching from the broomstick to get to the ship a voice could be heard. “Oblivion awaits!” snarled a deep voice that felt like it was everywhere. “Do not challenge fates will!”\r\n\r\nAll the creatures and tentacles halted, then scurried at the ship and engulfed it in mere seconds. “No!” Lulu cried, her voice piercing above everything else.\r\n“Come mortal, witness your demise!” the voice continued to snarl. \r\n“Show yourself. Now!” demanded Lux as her and the others ran out into the open and faced each direction around Lulu.\r\n\r\nThe void creatures crept out carrying Janna’s body in their pincers but not harming her. “We demand sacrifice,” the voice stated as cold chills of wind swept across the area. Even with Jinx’s naturally thin physique, nothing scared her. However, even she knew this was different to anything they had ever fought before as her body got goose bumps.\r\n\r\nA dark man covered from head to toe in a robe slowly drifted out the void. “I am Malzahar, a man that could have died when I was sucked into the void. Now I can create voidlings with a click of my fingers.”\r\nThe girls stood in shock, looking at each other for a solution. How were they going to get Janna? How were they all going to escape together?\r\n\r\nMalzahar touched Janna and removed the effects of Lulu’s tulip. Janna woke and retaliated with confused shakes to her surroundings. “What is going on,” she fretted, unable to even rub her eyes. \r\n“Bow to the void! Or be consumed by it!” Malzahar threatened, as if he could sense the girls seeking a way out.\r\nNone of the girls budged. “I’ve been hiding my light long enough,” exclaimed Lux as she pointed her wand at Malzahars chest.\r\nLight was rapidly absorbed into her wands end. “Hiyahhh.” A massive laser beam like rainbow blasted out of her wand toward Malzahar. He flashed out of the way and vanished.\r\n\r\n“Foolish mortal,” he roared from the shadowy void. “Eh-he-he-he-heee. At once!” ordered Malzahar His voice managing to sound more petrifying when he laughed.\r\nVoidlings tightened their clutches on Janna as they dragged her into the void before anyone could react. “No!” Lulu cried again as all the remaining voidlings and creatures disappeared into the void with their master.\r\n\r\nJinx was the first to reach where Janna’s body laid. Nothing remained. She was gone. Their group was missing a member. They had lost their friend to the void. “How? Why? No. We must get her back,” insisted Lulu trying to recover from what had occurred.\r\n\r\nXayah and Rakan came running out to the others. “What’s going on? We heard screaming and came as fast as we could.”\r\n“Janna is gone,” Poppy said realising the events.\r\nJinx wiped a tear on her shoulder, trying not to let the group see her affected. “We will get her back,” said Lux. “We will have to travel to the void and retrieve her.”\r\nAs Lulu rose and rested her head on Lux, she lost control and started sobbing too.\r\nRakan was speechless, he was the jokester, the entertainer, what could he say to help people at a time like this.\r\nThey moaned together for a while, attempting to collect themselves. “Did you at least manage to collect some weapons or artefacts?” questioned Poppy not really interested in the response.\r\n“No,” Xayah replied. “I still only have my feathers and my accuracy to get me by.”\r\n“No? No! Are you telling me Janna is gone for nothing? We are no longer star guardians and we have nothing?” bellowed Lulu in anger.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry,” Xayah said as she placed her hands on Lulu’s shoulder. “We are thankful for your protection but understand if you desire to leave us.”\r\n“We will not do that,” Lux interrupted. “We are still guardians and we are still here to protect. We will find Janna again. Whether we have one of us or all of us. Malzahar must pay for what he has done.”\r\n“Did you not hear him say this was fate?” mumbled Poppy.\r\n“We decide our own fate,” Jinx blurted.\r\n“Jinx is right,” Lux continued. “We are the only ones that have the combined power to defeat the void and take Malzahar out.”\r\n\r\nThe instance Lux stopped talking a glowing feather with glittering stars presented itself in front of Xayah. \r\n“No way,” Lulu said. “It’s a star weapon!”\r\n“Another guardian already? Was this fate too?\" Poppy speculated. \r\n“I cannot do this,” Xayah said turning away. “I cannot leave my people when they need me now more than ever.”\r\n“Well it is a choice to become a guardian or not. But it has called to you for a reason,” Lux pointed out. \r\n“I must decline it,” Xayah stressed. “It is my duty to protect the Vastarans.\r\nEven after Xayah declined again and again the star weapon would not disappear.\r\n\r\nRakan goofed around and was dashing around between the others and throwing around his feathers. He caught a glimpse of the star weapon. “My fellow travellers, you are all about to witness my majestic epicness! Unless I get killed, but, probably not!” Rakan took it in his hand. The weapon started to radiate and then channelled its energy with him. It had accepted him.\r\n“A male star guardian?” everybody questioned. \r\n“Yep! I’m amazing!” Rakan gloated.","replies":[]}
