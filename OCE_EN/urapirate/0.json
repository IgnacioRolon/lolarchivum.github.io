Those punishments are Riot and the community saying to you \"Hey, we aren't going to accept this sort of behaviour\". It is explicitly stated in the reform card you receive upon being issued a 14 day ban that \"If this behaviour continues, your account will be permanently suspended\".\n\nYou have demonstrated no desire to reform until the consequences were permanent. You used up all your chances to agree to the terms of being a part of the community, if not actually agree with them and reform and you didn't do so. So in your mind, what makes you deserving of another chance now?","replies":[{"poster":"urapirate","date":"2018-09-20T05:54:56.521+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't deserve another chance to be honest {{sticker:sg-miss-fortune}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-09-20T02:06:42.044+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=urapirate,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=mdZBedNa,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2018-09-19T11:56:31.807+0000)\n>\n> wasn't actually toxic too was just putting inappropriate messages in chat\n\nIf you're making that distinction, I'd say that's a pretty good indication that you're not reformed.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"deceit1520","date":"2018-09-18T23:48:16.175+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no one likes a jerk unless ur tyler1","replies":[{"poster":"urapirate","date":"2018-09-19T06:09:16.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm Naruto Uzumaki boi! {{summoner:6}} {{summoner:51}} {{summoner:51}}","replies":[]}]}]}
