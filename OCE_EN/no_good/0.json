It's not something we can prevent right now as by the time we've identified that an account is a bot it has usually played a lot of games and gained quite a high level due to the experience to reach 30 being cut in half.\n\nHowever, we still ban bot accounts when we find them, and player reports are as useful as always in tipping us off. So be sure to keep reporting them and include at least the word \"bot\" in your report.\n\nIn the medium to long term, we are developing better methods for catching them faster and as soon as we can bring that to OCE we will!","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-01-30T11:04:59.197+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">It's not something we can prevent right now as by the time we've identified that an account is a bot it has usually played a lot of games and gained quite a high level due to the experience to reach 30 being cut in half.\n\nAnd yet you ban people for scripting, and botting is a script.\n\nHmmm i wonder what the inconsistency is here.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-30T16:07:29.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=k1EeExqF,comment-id=00030001,timestamp=2017-01-30T11:04:59.197+0000)\n>\n> And yet you ban people for scripting, and botting is a script.\n> \n> Hmmm i wonder what the inconsistency is here.\n\nI think what they were referring to is that it's often challenging to differentiate between a newly started newbie account and newly started bot account, as they both play awkwardly with bad performance and don't usually interact with/respond to pings and chats.
