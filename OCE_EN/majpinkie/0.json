When ahead she will almost always win an engage. So don't try to fight her early, focus on out farming her and then engage only when you have the clear item advantage. \n\nIn my opinion Riven is too strong, but not because of her damage, I think its her CC thats the problem. It immobilises squishy champions for enough time for her easily take them out with no risk to herself. \nNo champion should be so mobile with so much damage, AND be tanky with CC.\n\nShe does struggle against certain champs though, Cho'gath's silence thoroughly screws her over. \n\nBut yes i believe she is too strong in certain aspects, I agree that champions should be rewarded for being ahead, but some of them like Riven, become virtually unstoppable, and the game ceases to be fun for 9 out of 10 players when that happens.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-12T23:51:06.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"learn urgot, never struggle against a riven,fiora,pantheon,xin etc or any other form of ad cancer ever again.all you have to do is e while they try to last hit/farm. by about lvl 6 and a serated dirk ive made my point and am usually free farming with autos while riven has to play super careful to avoid e's.\n\n","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-12T11:59:01.494+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you forgot to mention that her q has amazing lvl1 synergy with thunderlords (if you see a riven take this, expect her to go pretty hard at lvl1) and if her auto resets are weaved perfectly grants her approximately 30% pseudo bonus atkspeed (around 0.8 atks per second, since with auto cancelling she'll get 4 autos in the time it would take for her to perform 3, whilst also getting alot of damage out of her q barrage) which means that she'll be getting an extra auto during a trade from this which again gives her more damage at lvl1 and means that only a few champions can out-trade her at lvl1.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-12T11:18:04.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a top lane main who's played against many level 7 riven's, I can say that Riven definitely has many \"gaps\" to intercept and shut her down early. You just need to know her ability cool downs and the right time to engage her. Her basic kit is pretty balanced in my opinion the only problem is her ultimate which I think gives her too much. Extra range on everything, increased AD and another free spell that's an EXECUTE. My proposed solution - Nerf the damage on her Wind Slash, or the extra AD she gets from her ultimate.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"atroquinine","date":"2017-03-14T04:43:23.188+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is bait right?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-03-14T04:39:20.721+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what I have seen, there had never been a single video about Vi beating Riven.\nYou will most likely never be able to use Vi to kill Riven.\nI never used Vi against Riven.\nOne thing you must know, is that there are some top lane champions who will never be able to beat Riven in a 1v1 fight.\n\nChampions who are tanky (such as Garen, Olaf, Nasus, etc), or champions who have lifesteal (like Irelia, Fiora, and Xin Zhao) are capable of beating Riven in a 1v1 fight.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-13T02:23:58.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think she's op. Sure she's strong but she's a feast or famine champ. Either she's going to be very strong or virtually useless. I think part of the problem is when people don't adapt to the fact there playing against a riven. IE play safe at six. \n\nAnd I'm aware I'm gonna sound super salty when saying this but. If your a jungler gank the damn riven. Whether your against her or she's on you team you want her ahead. Being left on an island against a riven can be super frustrating. \n\nWith that being said I also agree with Lord S. I don't mind her damage, but I think the combination of the damage, mobility and Cc is incredibly obnoxious. They should also think about changing the scaling on her shield. Having a shield that scales on AD that also has a dash is stupid","replies":[]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-03-13T00:59:04.664+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only a little tho, only a wee little,","replies":[]}]}
