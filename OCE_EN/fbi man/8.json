When he comes back he tryhards, gets a couple of kills. We were leading but the chat just kept going on with shyv and luc flamming each other. I call them &quot;kids&quot; and then lucian sold all his item and stacked up tears thinking he&#039;s all alpha tyler1 shit. Shyvana helped the enemy team get baron and the enemy team kept giving him compliments. I&#039;ve honestly lost hope in this &quot;low elo community&quot;, and by that im saying that there&#039;s a lot of annoying af kids, trolls and tyler1 wannabes I LIKE TYLER, he&#039;s funny af \nand entertaining, but honestly, he&#039;s fanbase can sometimes be retarted, kids who think they&#039;re all alpha shit by running it down mid makes me cringe.\n\nShyvana - _Name Removed_\nLucian - _Name Removed_\nPlease report these trolls and bring justice to this world!","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-06-12T16:27:35.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that's depressing..\n\nYeah, sometimes you get one of these nonsense, inevitable.
