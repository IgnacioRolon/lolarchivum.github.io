The main problem is the fact that his Rake is such a good poke/zoning tool and how it gives you 2 stacks of 'Wound'. The all in combo at level 3 is disgusting, however if you can manage to shut him down early game, he'll struggle. He's what Riot calls a 'feast or famine' champ.\n\nYes, unlike most assassins, he HAS to focus all his abilities on one target and maybe that's why his damage is so absurd.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-17T08:15:55.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wow, feast or famine, the perfect way to describe what used to be my skills with a few champs, that also happened with pre rework talon for me","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-04-12T06:06:40.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We need StealthVortex88, he's the true Talon wisdom guy!\n\nBut I would assume that his damage is only that extreme because he lacks any form of CC, his poke is underwhelming, he has no defensive abilities (except his ult invisibility) and he can only really do proper damage to 1 target, unlike his peers Zed/Fizz etc etc. who still do crazy damage, but can do it to multiple people.\n\nSo he has 2 choices, either jump on the enemy early, or sit and be poked into oblivion. \nAnd he should be rewarded for jumping in. (but it shouldn't be at the cost of counterplay.)\n\nThat being said, I haven't VSed a talon in a while now, and I haven't played him for a bit either. So I haven't had a fresh dose of this recently.\nSo i could be underestimating the severity of this.","replies":[{"poster":"Lordlabib","date":"2017-04-12T06:10:47.024+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with me fellow lord, talon does tons of damage but hes got no cc and is susceptible to cc which can fuck up his day easily.\n\n{{champion:91}} {{champion:91}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"I Stealth I","date":"2017-04-12T15:46:12.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eyyyyy","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-12T05:18:08.289+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats exactly it, he went from weak laning to strong late and medium mid, to strong early and weak late","replies":[{"poster":"FBI MAN","date":"2017-04-12T10:29:07.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY!
