Not only this will avoid conflict in game, it will also teach on how you can be a good teammate. Remember, you have more chances in winning the game if you would help your team and avoid flaming each other. Instead of blaming your team for taking your role, it would be best to focus on the role you are in and do your best to win and avoid behavioral suspensions.\r\n\r\nJust a reminder, leaving the Champion Select screen (&#039;queue dodging&#039;) from matchmaking does result in a penalty that prevents you from entering the queue again. Please note that the timer will increase should you continue to dodge games. This decision was made to ensure that games start as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nCurrently, dodging a solo queue ranked game will result in the loss of three League Points (ten points for dodging a ranked team game) and a six-minute penalty timer. Your second ranked queue dodge within a short period of time deducts ten League Points as well as a much longer time-out penalty.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you dodge a normal game and then proceed to dodge a ranked game immediately after, you will receive the penalty normally encountered after two dodges.\r\n\r\nDodging during a Promotion or Division series will count as a loss in your series. Your series will end if this was your final loss.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\nMisty\r\nThe Forgotten Blade Princess\r\nPlayer Support Specialist\r\nHowling Abyss Expert\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is the official attitude of riot staff members about instant lockers, this implies that if people instant lock they get no punishment that fking this is your fault not to cooperate with your team mates, and thx to riot i get to dodge and be punished when i fking team with a leona adc, riot staff members r so good at solving problems. and really should they be fired. \r\n\r\nalso they refuse to answer my question about why they close down the normal draft mode, so r they just stay in office and doing nothing?","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-05-19T01:37:10.102+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">also they refuse to answer my question about why they close down the normal draft mode, so r they just stay in office and doing nothing?\n\nIt has been stated time and time again that our population is too small to support this queue without having it having  a negative effect on the health of the queue itself, as well as the other queues.

Its frustrating, sure, but it helps you become a better teammate. You can avoid instalockers all together by playing a 5man premade. \n\n>nd thx to riot i get to dodge and be punished when i fking team with a leona adc,\n\nYou don't **have** to dodge, off meta picks sometimes work and [aren't actually reportable](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752884-Reporting-a-Player#h2q5). The other instructor, Crunch, likes to play silly things jungle like Leona and Tristana and he does well. I have had weird off meta picks in my ranked games (most recently karthus jungle and AP ezreal support), and instead of dodging, I trusted my team and played the games out. It was hard, but we won. Mainly because we all had good attitudes, and helped each other out instead of raging.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-05-19T08:27:40.461+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":4,"body":"then go enjoy it and i wish u get leona adc every rank game, have fun in bronze 5","replies":[]}]}]}
