You were derailing a thread which centred on a different discussion that what you are trying to achieve\n2. You were incredibly antagonistic and were harassing Tele _**who was trying to help you**_\n\nYour posts were not and never will be deleted because they are anti-Riot, you need only look at boards to see we don't delete stuff for that reason.\n\nI advised you in your deletion notification to submit your own post if you wanted to discuss this so you weren't derailing an unrelated thread, which you have done, but I also warned you about your attitude. This is borderline, and you aren't directly insulting anyone except me so I'll leave it be, but you have to follow the boards rules as everyone else does. I will remove any and all posts or comments you make that break the rules as I would anyone else.\n\nNot to mention that being antagonistic and generally rude does not exactly encourage people to listen to your opinion.\n\n___\n\nAs for your concerns with matchmaking, from your recent match history (even looking at only your defeats) your teammates scores are pretty average for a low Bronze defeat. There is only one game in recent history I can see where a score was abnormal (0/14/1 Fizz) and you yourself had a score of 0/7/0 that game.\n\nIn Bronze, skill is inconsistent, and player reaction/decision making is unreliable, so scores tend to be polarising (i.e extra high deaths on losing team, extra high kills on winning team) and as a result games tend to be stomps one way or the other. It becomes a matter of who gets the early lead and who has the best snowball or siege team comp.\n\nRiot is not ruining your games. You are letting your frustration ruin them for you. There will always be that extra dodgy teammate, but only **intentional** feeding is punishable, having a bad game is not. Even a defeat can give you valuable experience and lessons learned if you let it, but if you choose to throw hate at your teammates instead, then not only will you not climb, but you will be punished for it.","replies":[{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2016-08-19T12:04:45.535+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so do u mind why fking the other team get diamond and plat pp or even gold people where as all my team mates r bronze and silver? can u give me an explaination? have u ever check the ranks of the other team when i lose? and do comparasion?","replies":[]},{"poster":"AceAkali","date":"2016-08-18T19:12:42.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"stfu tbh I just match last game with troll bot lane sup and adc, will never come out of base or never use R\n\n\nyou have have sh!t loads of report for toxic people, but WTH do u guys do with troll in game ? who don't chat I game but troll ? so STFUp with ur excuses for climbing up when u guys cant do sh!t and help other players \n\n\njust want ks kill and sit inside the tower again, do this over and over so frustrating and RIOT doing sh!t to help community this is why so many toxic born\n\nI am happy to see a toxic gamer in game which I can mute rather than a troll or feeder","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WE WUZ KINGZ","date":"2016-08-18T10:22:57.318+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please.

We all seem to have the same problem with everyone we're teamed up with, which is my eyes doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. The way I see it is that if someone does something unexpected or \"bad\" in your eyes, you tend to get upset and flame at them. This is the starting point to spiralling into a long road of toxicity. I believe a way to bet this need to flame at people and complain throughout your ranked games and then onto the boards is just accepting that no one is perfect and the only way to learn is by making mistakes. Just remember, you're not the only one trying to get better and climb the elo ladder :) I hope I've been helpful with my comments and I'd love to see more and more people take this into consideration the next time they go to scream some \"well-hearted\" abuse at the next unfortunate solo queue 0/10 \"Teemo god\".","replies":[]}]}
