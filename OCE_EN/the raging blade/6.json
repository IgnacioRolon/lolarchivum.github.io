So changing your attitude can help immensely, I remember one time I was on a huge loosing streak right after I got back from holiday and had forgotten how to play the game (not really but kinda) and so I just took a rest and came back in not thinking about the losses and after a game or two I had a win and that totally got me going and turned it into quite a few wins in a row. Good luck and have fun.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkenedKnight","date":"2015-12-27T13:57:30.313+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man i hate it when those gays make you lose.. lol\n\nIf your tilting though, just play some norms till you feel like you've had a good break","replies":[]},{"poster":"the raging blade","date":"2015-12-27T12:24:08.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its normals but the problem is that they cannot just dothings like this","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2015-12-27T12:10:23.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"do you just play ranked?","replies":[]}]}
