It wasnt my client crashing for sure! I got into the game then i got disconnected for about 2 mins after 1 min then became all good for about 2 mins then disconnected over and over! I was playing leona but me,our leblanc, gnar us had the exact same trouble, BUT the real problem is i didnt get LOSE PREVENTED from this game. Honestly, we all thought we were gonna get lose prevented but nah. I lost 16 lp off it. About 20 teams experienced the same issue at the same time. Its not everyone in the game disconnecting it happened to only 1 team in 1 game. I am so mad, but i would be even more mad if you really dont get it lose prevented. They didn't deserve that win and we didn't deserve that lose. I linked a link about my match history to give you the proof and let you compare the level and stuff that game ended before 20. Sure thing is my internet was working very fine.Please get that game lose prevented and get my lp back Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:29:51.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Once you lose lp, you aren't getting it back. Secondly, completed games cannot be \"loss prevented\". They have been lost, and will be recording in history as such.\n\nLoss prevented is a tool Riot use where upon activation, all ranked games in progress will have their \"loss prevented\", and this is only done when there are huge problems affecting everyone. It is not done on an individual basis.","replies":[]}]}
