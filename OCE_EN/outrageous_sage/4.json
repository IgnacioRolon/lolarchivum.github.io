I literally have photographic proof of someone telling me to \"kys\" and calling me the N word, but because it was in lobby i can't report him. where can i send this proof so you can do something about this. or will you let it slide like normal and allow racist people to continue playing your game?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-03T13:50:01.406+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The notification that you get when someone is punished is notoriously limited and is meant more as a bonus feel-good than it is meant to be informative. Seeing the notification guarantees a punishment was issued, but not seeing one *doesn't* mean one wasn't. Riot try to keep things pretty private for a number of reasons, primarily to avoid things like witch-hunting, but the lack of feedback can be frustrating at times.\n\nAs for cases where you are unable to report in post-game, you can submit those reports via player support: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nDo note, however, that PS cannot and will not give you *any* information about another player's account, implicit or otherwise, so you will get a generic \"thanks for your report\" type response. Manual reviews are also substantially slower, so wherever possible you should still use the post-game reporting feature.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2019-10-03T14:22:53.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No offense but, it's really not that hard to ignore those comments then /mute all ingame, really, it is really easy, don't read it.","replies":[{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-10-05T05:48:30.361+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kitayo,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=ckJduB5E,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2019-10-03T14:22:53.186+0000)\n>\n> No offense but, it's really not that hard to ignore those comments then /mute all ingame, really, it is really easy, don't read it.\n\nI agree but I also agree that it deserves to be punished. I wish for more balance in society where if people are offended by something they have the right to complain and ask for action to be taken on games or in public but not force it on people because that's not okay.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-03T15:17:57.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have to mute, the damage is already done, and other people having a way to protect themselves from such behaviour, doesn't absolve the person who said it from responsibility.\n\nIf someone paints a big ol' swear on the side of your house, sure you can have a laugh at it and paint over it, and it's almost but not really like it never happened, but the responsibility still falls on the person who painted a swear on your house, and the police have a responsibility to stop them from doing it to others.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-04T01:14:57.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">If you have to mute, the damage is already done\n\nMute em at the start. \nCan't be damaged if you can't read the retarded af screeching.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Teenai","date":"2019-10-03T08:43:16.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"show me now xd","replies":[]}]}
