Riot can you please get your shit together and do something about this? i do not enjoy being told to kill myself. i do not enjoy being abused to the point that i am forced to mute everyone at the start of every single game. i do not want to go into game EXPECTING to be abused. what the hell ever happened to having a good community? where the hell is the love for OCE? i honestly feel like RIot just made the server and has abandoned it.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-30T19:14:36.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm on OCE and im able to turn chat filter on?\n\nYou see, there's this problem the league community has with the 'herd mentality.' Once enough people start saying something, it becomes true in the eyes of the community.\n\nI remember a Rioter talking about a similar thing once. They rolled out Vladimir buffs to make him move at normal speed in his pool, but something went wrong and the buff never went live. Despite being in the patch notes and on the updated tool tip. What happened?\nVladimirs pick and win rate both went up at the same time, despite the champion not receiving any changes at all. Herd mentality.\n\nThe people on the OCE server are people. Like the people on the NA server. To say we are different based on what region we are in, is incredibly ignorant and racist?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-31T08:43:38.638+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We are different in the sense that our culture differs quite a bit, particularly our social culture which obviously most impacts League. That said though, there isn't really an argument that one server is more or less toxic than the other. Certainly there are different kinds of toxicity present (culture again) and some things that wouldn't be ok on NA that are on OCE and visa versa, but the amount doesn't really differ all that much in my experience.\n\nAlso I believe the phrase you are looking for is herd mentality, not heard. It's a reference to the mentality that animals like horses (an of course people) have where they will stick together for safety and security rather than the idea that if something is heard enough it will be taken as true. Though both are certainly present in your given scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-31T09:03:45.176+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely meant herd, I am very sorry that is so embarrassing! xD","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-31T11:26:19.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an easy mistake to make, even just by association of the meaning :P","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-01-29T06:17:30.207+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yep riot don't have a clue when to ban people and when to not ban people.\n\nHonestly their automated system is a piece of shit, and even the non-automated bans are kinda ridiculous.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-01-29T05:30:45.601+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think from memory you only get that message if you were the last person to report them and they received a ban etc. The message doesn't go out to all that reported.\n\nBut you are 100% right, the really nasty toxic people I've reported are still playing to this day. People who've suggested for me to neck myself, KYS, shoot myself in the face, made blatant racist remarks to me etc are all still happily gaming away.\n\nRiot's autmated system is just fail.
