Personally i find it to be one of the lowest forms of cyber bullying. and as such, would like to see Riot take some more drastic forms of punishment with these people. On the OCE especially it almost seems like there is STILL no tribunal and that toxic players can and always do get away with things scott free and with no repercussions. this is unfortunate and very sad to see as the big consensus amongst toxic players is &quot;go ahead and report me, there&#039;s no tribunal anyway&quot; and then they go straight back to being terrible people to the team. \r\nit&#039;s all well and fine to say &quot;just don&#039; let it get to you&quot; or &quot;Don&#039;t play if you can&#039;t handle it&quot; but then you&#039;re saying that you basically can&#039;t be bothered stopping them or that you&#039;re not willing to do anything to stop them. then where does that leave us? \r\nI just want to see the game be a better place for those people that have the biggest hearts like Braum and care for others instead of seeing them pushed away because no one decided to do anything about toxic players. so please riot, im not asking you to go out of your way and monitor every single game. all i am asking for is a more active hand in the way things are run, especially on the OCE, and to try and make sure things like people telling other people to kill themselves don&#039;t go unpunished. thank you for your time and i look forward to continuing to see great summoners on the fields of justice!\r\n\r\n             OutrageousSage","replies":[{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-10-19T07:35:52.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yer like if you wont to say [ you fucking retard sped %%%%] you can just say [you fu*k!ng ret@rd sp#d c%nt] I never sed a bad word","replies":[{"poster":"SoulFaZe","date":"2015-10-20T23:55:17.839+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahhahaha i love how only i can see it out of my friends because all they see is this **** and they cant xD makes me feel special","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-21T08:12:40.761+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a friend who has his filter on and when someone says something he can't see he asks me in Skype what they say.

BUT the ban system is still working. If you have screenshots, my recommendation, send in a support ticket and attach the images, they may or may not take a look but it's your best bet atm to get them looked at outside of reporting them.","replies":[{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-10-20T13:42:04.903+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was told it is coming in the 'close future' 2 years ago. \n\nIt's too late anyway, I see people saying worse things daily, you send a screenshot to riot plus report button and nothing ever happens.\n\nHere's a few trolls residing in plat for you, just so you know, you can continue to play ranked buying 6 boots to troll your team\n\n[link removed]\n[link removed]\n[link removed]\n[link removed]\n[link removed]","replies":[]}]}]}
