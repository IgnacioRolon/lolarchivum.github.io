Removes a lot of confusion and trolling that surrounded instalocking and people not getting their roles. I am however, not fond of the ranked dodging** penalties. I&#039;ve tried dodged three times in a row before and received no timer or lp loss whatsoever and I find this very frustrating at higher levels. In high diamond the que times are already high (for me an average of 10 minute ques, SOLO QUE before any dodges happen), but due to no dodge penalties people are constantly dodging if they don&#039;t get their main role or if their champion is banned. This leads to extremely long que times, for my past games I think the shortest I had to wait was 1 dodge in champ select, resulting in about a 12 minute que. Worst case was a 42 minute que with 7+ dodges and the majority of dodges would happen every single champ select as soon as UDYR was banned, so I have reason to believe it was an udyr main exploiting the no dodge penalties and waisting everyones time.\n\nI am all for something like 1 penalty free dodge (failure to pick a champ / ban a champ per 24 hours). That gives people room for error incase they are alt tabbed or maybe have a troll in their game that they want to avoid. Any more than that and people will just abuse it to play their role and their champion, leading to the ridiculous 30+++ minute ques... \n\nWhen you first get into a ranked game it informs you that if you do not pick or ban a champion you will be penalized. Am I misunderstanding something, or is that just a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and there&#039;s no actual penalty in place?\n\nLooking forward to hearing other people&#039;s opinions on this. Maybe I&#039;m completely wrong and a Riot employee can correct me in saying that there is already a limit to the amount of dodges you can do in a day and I just haven&#039;t dodged enough to find out?\nThanks in advance for any input\n\n\n\n\n**by dodges I am implying letting the timer run out during your ban/pick turn","replies":[]}
