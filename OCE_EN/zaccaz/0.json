While also not being a perfect judge, winrate shows that you are more likely to win than you are to lose and thus you will climb. Also, the amount of games you've suggested are extremely high. If it was like that most players in Challenger would still be in Bronze.","replies":[{"poster":"ZaCCaZ","date":"2015-11-10T04:58:10.231+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the current system does not reflect your skill level... how do you determine skill if there are 2 afk and 2 beginners 1 v 5  or 2 v 5 or 3 v 5.\n\nMy suggestion is that the first 3 levels   base it on ranked wins, ( the figures i used is just a guide ), once in gold maybe then use a different formula.\n\nOr another idea is to introduce 1 v 1 solo ranked\n\nI don't profess that this will work but surely something needs to be done to the ranked system to make it  possible for those that want to climb out of B5.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-11-10T05:06:33.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Jolokia,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EYR1xoVP,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-11-10T04:58:10.231+0000)\n>\n> But the current system does not reflect your skill level... how do you determine skill if there are 2 afk and 2 beginners 1 v 5  or 2 v 5 or 3 v 5.\n> \n> My suggestion is that the first 3 levels   base it on ranked wins, ( the figures i used is just a guide ), once in gold maybe then use a different formula.\n> \n> Or another idea is to introduce 1 v 1 solo ranked\n> \n> I don't profess that this will work but surely something needs to be done to the ranked system to make it  possible for those that want to climb out of B5.\n\nFar more often than not the game will either be fine or the enemy will be disadvantaged instead of you. As for solo ranked, that doesn't prove anything beyond mechanical ability which is a very small part of this game. If you want to climb out of Bronze 5 then become better than a Bronze 5 player.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
