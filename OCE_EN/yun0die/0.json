Troll after afker, after inter, after troll, after afker","subforum":"Player Behaviour","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Like literally the most fucking ridiculous shit I have ever come across in my entire fucking life. I never ever ever post , but this is actually fucking incredible. The entire season, you cannot physically fucking climb unless you purchase a boost from a high elo player. Because all you get are trolls, then the next game you&#039;ll get an afker, then another fucking afker, and another one. You go 28-4 but can&#039;t carry because you have 1 afker, 1 feeder, and an entire fucking team that don&#039;t listen.\r\n\r\nBut hold on, this isn&#039;t just once in a blue moon, its every fucking game. Then you have the hide to say we can&#039;t carry or have to learn. How the fuck do you expect our mentality or skill level to be above platinum when we&#039;re trying to get out of bronze or silver yet you make the game impossible to carry by yourself.\r\n\r\nIts fucking crazy because when they afk, you think oh well tough shit maybe ill be able to do well the next game, but then you get paired with another afker straight after the first one. And then you get a fucking troll, or 2 of them intentional feeding running it down mid on your team?\r\n\r\nI really fucking hope this game turns to shit, because in all honesty you guys don&#039;t seem to give a flying fuck about any of your community, you don&#039;t even fucking respond to them.","replies":[{"poster":"phantom9399","date":"2018-11-24T02:13:28.000+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shall find your answer here: \nhttps://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour/IxLhZEJM-riot-support?comment=0000\n\nReporting system is fucked in this game.

I was stuck in bronze for a very long time because of toxic people trolling, afk, etc. \n\nGet a duo partner you trust won't afk for no reason (though I had a game where my friend's PC crashed during load) to 'minimise' your chances of a troll or just idiots on your team. \n\nOn top of that, I think next season will be better with the addition of Iron League, which will likely be comprised of people who don't care about climbing, and Bronze won't be as toxic and troll and memefic as it's 'infamous' for. \n\nOr play a solo carry champion like Jax lul.","replies":[{"poster":"Mo1st","date":"2018-11-13T00:21:22.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with OP 100%.    I mostly play arams - because i like that mode - and 80-90% of games have afk/bots/trolls..     reporting is a total waste of fucking time because i continually report the same players over and over, and yet they continue to play.   This proves that riot not only take no interest in the reports that are sent to them, but also couldnt give a flying fuck about aram game mode.   This isnt something new,    its been happening constantly for the last 3+ years.    \nObviously their report system is a total waste of time and is just put there as window dressing...\nI can fully understand why the majority of players dont bother using the reporting system,  because they already know that using it does fuckall.\nThe only exceptions I think are if players are using racism, hate or threats regularly..    then riot thinks that stuff morally has to be dealt with.\n\nAnything else they just dont fucking care at all.   PERIOD.\n\nThe absolute worst run online game on the planet and the most useless reporting system ever.  A total joke,  with no consequences.    Riot are completely useless in this area.","replies":[{"poster":"Typhon","date":"2018-11-13T00:44:31.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"reporting actually makes a difference in high elo/ NA where they have the tribunal. \nyoure right tho it does feel like riot doesnt really care about the majority of the community, and the truth is they dont. they make money out of the game through the pro scene etc. \nworlds this year would have lost them money since no korea and in korea.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-11-12T07:46:58.858+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This seems normal for me.
