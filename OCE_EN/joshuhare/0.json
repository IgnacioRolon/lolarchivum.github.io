I have a really bad start, versing an Ashe and a Sona in lane. They kill me early and start snowballing. I then keep getting stopped and get out fed so quickly. My &#039;Team Mates&#039; then tell me to uninstall and I suck at games.\r\nI normally get relatively good scores as an ADC, however I got 0/11/2 this game and couldn&#039;t get a kill no matter what.\r\nThese people realize they are the reason so many people quit the game, I know I did terribly but it&#039;s no reason to be a dick.\r\nDid I mention it was unranked normal blindpick, were level 15-20 players are.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-13T14:13:07.631+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you want 0/11/2 I would've said the same.","replies":[{"poster":"Azirious Mistake","date":"2015-05-14T08:07:28.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oceania community in a nutshell.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-05-14T00:00:57.602+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry you had a bad game! In the end, we all have good ones and bad ones right? Ashe and Sona are kinda annoying to face anyways, depending on who your support was. Even though people fall behind, sometimes it is hard to play safe when they dive you under turret and all that, so don't worry about what others say, it happens! To be honest, we all feed at one point in time and other times we get fed, it's just a game and it's how it works. Unfortunately people do get angry over a video game all because they wanna win, here's a fact; We can't always win! LIKE WHOA. Sometimes if someone on my team isn't doing well, I don't insult the player and make it worse, I try to encourage them and give them tips, too bad barely anyone does this anymore...Well good luck in your other games! If worse comes to worse just mute 'em~","replies":[]},{"poster":"BroteinShake","date":"2015-05-14T01:03:38.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This might be the worst advice ever but in those situations you have to sit it out and just wait for the game to end. No other way around it\n\n Just try and farm and do what you can to help. The other day I was in that situation (not that this is the only bad game I've ever had) where I was playing {{champion:126}} top, and helping {{champion:80}} who was our jg take out gromp. Long story short, I changed from Hammer form to ranged form and whilst typing a message, i fucking auto-attacked (not on purpose) and took gromp. I tried to offer to dual jg with him for a bit and let him get all the farm because it is actually kinda a big thing to lose your first farm in the jg. Anyway after that I was the first to get ganked and {{champion:114}} (who i was laning against) started shitting on me and it just got worse and worse. I asked for help and they wouldnt because they all thought I was a dick (even though i said it was an accident) because I'm pretty sure they were all in a skype call together or something and just didnt want to help me. We lost, because Fiora was fed. I didnt mute them, should have, would have made it slightly easier, especially because i would have spent more time farming trying to catch up instead of arguing.\n\nAnyways I kinda just wanted to tell my story, lel.\n\ntl;dr\nIf its a bad game, mute everyone who are being dicks, try and farm a lot to help your team, and wait out the game until it finishes, chances are the next game will be better (mine was, i went like 14-2).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unseen Predator","date":"2015-05-13T19:41:51.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, you went 0/11, you knew what was gonna happen yet you continued to put yourself in a position where you die over and over again, that's pretty stupid, if you get in this situation and you refuse to sit back and play safe then its really your fault, i'm not surprised by your team raging, players that feed that much are really annoying to get and its especially annoying when they ignore you when you tell em to get the fuck back.\n\nNot saying them being a dick is good or anything, of course its not, just saying i'm not surprised they raged at you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-13T13:43:08.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0/11\n\nas Jinx, I can intentionally feed and not do that bad.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-05-13T14:11:08.416+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"Garbage ADCs\" amirite?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fruitlewp","date":"2015-05-13T12:40:13.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm sorry you had that experience.
