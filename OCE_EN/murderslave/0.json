Obviously, because i havent played recently. However, i played a ranked game after seeing this and won and logged out. I came back on later today and the same messaged popped up claiming id decay in 8 days? So how is this possible, if i played a ranked game shouldn&#039;t it have recognized it and reset? Could somebody help me, thx","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2017-09-30T12:53:09.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It looks like you played a flex rank game that you won. \nYou need to play a soloq game since that is the plat rank eligible to decay (your last soloq game was 20 days ago).","replies":[{"poster":"Murderslave","date":"2017-09-30T12:58:57.910+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh you're right, hahahaha. I was certain that it was solo queue, but i must have just unnoticeably  clicked flex as ranked would have been down at the time i was playing. Thanks for telling me haha!","replies":[]}]}]}
