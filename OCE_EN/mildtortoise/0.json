With 1 second remaining, I was finally able to select my champion and click lock in, but I was removed from the game as if I had not locked. Upon returning to the lobby, many buttons simply stopped working all together, including queue up and the &#039;x&#039; to close the client, though I could still view my profile. As a result I had to go into task manager to close the client, and I am now stuck with a 30 minute  wait timer as punishment for the horrible crimes I have committed against the league community (I dodged ONCE previously because I forgot to lock my champion). Please fix your shit, or don&#039;t make people wait 30 minutes for dodging twice, especially when everything about the new champ select (stability, manual lock in requirement) is conducive to players UNINTENTIONALLY dodging.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-20T04:59:09.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey MildToroise,\n\nIf you're having client issues, I'd suggest [starting League as an admin and running a repair.](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202969434-Patching-Issues#wq4) Just try restarting your client before you get into that, though, and test your game in custom matches if possible.\n\nLet me know if that helps.\n\n-DTN","replies":[]}]}
