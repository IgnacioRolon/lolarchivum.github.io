I've been playing LoL since 2013 and although I'm level 30, I still feel like I'm really bad and am one of the weaker players in my friends group.  That said, my friends play LoL for many reasons; its not always about winning. Sometimes my friends are just happy to take a hit on on their chances of winning because they enjoy helping me get better. \n\nI guess I'm saying don't be too hard on yourself. The journey is a long one which I'm sure others can relate to.

Many many guides out there to help you get better. It helps if you reduce the size of chat in the interface tab of the options (esc).
