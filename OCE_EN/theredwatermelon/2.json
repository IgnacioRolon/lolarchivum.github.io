I think he needs a legendary skin that&#039;s based around some kind of job or sport (like Darius) so maybe Riot or some talented artist out there could make a Garen skin with an NFL feel. \r\nHis ult could look like he&#039;s getting a touch down on someone and maybe his sword could be the goal post.\r\n\r\nMake his E him spinning and when he finishes the animation he throws the ball down? \r\n\r\nW could be a football sprite under his feet?\r\n\r\nQ could be him holding the ball under his arm with his other extended out to push people out of his way?\r\n\r\nRecall could be like Dunkmaster Darius&#039;: He puts the goal post down and kicks a field goal?\r\n\r\nJust making a suggestion please don&#039;t hate. I thought it was a cool skin idea for him, that&#039;s all.\r\nPls Riot\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"TechnoFlame","date":"2015-08-29T01:50:56.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wont happen garen already has a legendary skin.....","replies":[]}]}
