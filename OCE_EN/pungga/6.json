I do not play League of Legends often anymore. I have had my account for 4-5 years now and I&#039;ve spent probably around $300 dollars on it. The last time I have played was 6 days ago. Never in that 4-5 years have I ever downloaded hacks for anything at all. One day, I suddenly got 2 emails from Riot Games themselves.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/dKbQjNc\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/RJsvim4\r\n\r\nThis surprised me, because as I said, &quot;Never in that 4-5 years have I ever downloaded hacks for anything at all&quot;. It&#039;s all good though because there is no such thing as hacks on my PC, so I made a request to Riot about my ban.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/L0sLvxj\r\n\r\nI was expecting them to admit their mistake and unban me. Instead, I got an absolutely useless response.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/IWeoIAD\r\n\r\nI responded again with many questions about my account and demanding to be unbanned.\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/LnS0WtL\r\n\r\nI am still unsure about this situation entirely, but I posted this to show how stupid Riot are. I also want to know if other people are getting the same problem as I am. I think it is disgraceful that they do this to my account and especially for something that I have never considered doing. If they still do not want to unban me because they think I broke the terms of use, then that just worsens their reputation and shows that they do not care about their fans, both old and new.","replies":[]}
