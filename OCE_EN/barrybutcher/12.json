Just curious. I went on my unranked smurf and remade my first placement match to see and got a minimum placement of Iron 4.\r\n\r\nSeems the base MMR Silver 1, considering everyone in that game were low gold or high silver. I personally think this is too high for new accounts. Granted its fine for me, but for new players, I feel like getting Golds in your VERY FIRST game of ranked ever is a bit much.\r\n\r\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qFljPJK.png\r\n\r\nAlso since the reshuffle, the MMR differs in the tiers now, so Im curious to hear if people are gaining/losing more or less LP since the patch, especially people who were in Div V and are now in Div IV","replies":[]}
