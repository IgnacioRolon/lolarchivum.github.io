I played her and it went ok. Got two triples. Should of had 2 pentas but im bad. Died a lot too because im bad. Still, i don't find her as useless as i used to.\n\nWent 20-14-14 for those interested.\n\nI get it now. the \"stacking\" W's. like you want multiple autos on the same target and you will melt them. Which is why you want extended trades.
