So here you go. Mainly for Riot to see. Others can read if you want.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe drop down menu for the main categories, \"game info\", \"news\", \"esports\" etc, are not available on the landing page of oce.lol. So i have to click boards, then I can access the drop down menu for News to find patch notes when it could have been one-click.\n\nAlso, why does the OPL have such a shtty site? The OCE site looks absolutely awful in terms of how the results are shown and the inability to interact with past games.\n\nAlso clicking the Esports main link takes you to the 2014 page. Why?\n\nIt also seems impossible to find http://oce.lolesports.com/ with clickthroughs\nEDIT: Nvm, found it. You have to be on the main page and click the Esports link to find the esports page. Impossible to find if using the links while on the boards page\n\nI have other minor things that could make the site better. But these are the main things to make it simply more accessible and useable.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-24T07:01:07.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I don't really know where they said to post this sort of stuff. You and others have said that reds have told you to put it \"on the boards\", but the section labelled \"Help & Support\" specifically says that bug reports and player suggestions don't belong here. This board exists mainly to help other summoners with their technical difficulties.\n\nWe aren't Riot staff. We can't do anything about this.\n\nMost of the reds hang around the [Miscellaneous boards](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous), so try over there. Where you should post the bugs with the site,\n\n>**DO NOT** post bug reports here. Instead, head on over to our [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board.\n\nand for those suggestions you might want to head over to [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations).\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}
