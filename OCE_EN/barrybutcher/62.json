No big deal i thought, until the enemy Ezreal told us it was going to happen.\n\nA check of the match history of this **diamond** player (in high silver flex que), will show you he is tanking his elo by forcing remakes.\nJunior detective work will show you he is currently 0-20 in flex que, with 20 remakes. More searching will find that his friend (he plays ranked 3&#039;s with) was placed in Bronze flex, whereas he is Plat, so there may be a motive there.\n\nI asked people to report, to which they asked why? He isn&#039;t hurting anyone. He is wasting time but only his LP is lost.\n\nSo is this punishable?","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-01T04:15:51.215+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When one deliberately abuse the said exploit willingly to achieve certain imbalance of the system that may or may not end up benefiting them in the long run; depending on the nature of the exploit and how severe they've been going at it, exploits could and generally will be considered an offence by most players and devs at large (though not always punished as different devs had different handling methods). This is true for pretty much every multiplayer centric game.\n\nExceptions happen when the said exploits add to the game than they otherwise damage it, which in that case it may receive mixed or even positive opinions from either the player base or the devs themselves. However clearly, deliberately tanking your elo is obviously not the former.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-12-31T16:53:20.610+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"almost retarded as that guy who inted from diamond to bronze to try and get the highest winrate on the server for teemo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2016-12-31T09:24:59.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who has the time for that wth lol","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2017-01-02T14:24:20.187+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Afking isnt punishable. \n\nIt's only people what want to climb that get punished.","replies":[]}]}
