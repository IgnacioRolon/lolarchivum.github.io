Such a useless mastery.\n\nEDIT: For those wondering. 2nd level in Resolve tree: Gain 8 armour and MR when near an Allied tower.","replies":[{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2017-03-12T04:37:22.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Siegemaster feels like the kind of mastery which requires the player to acknowledge that they will be pushed under tower in the early game. In that sense, it could be useful on a (likely melee) support facing off against a poke heavy double ranged bot lane (eg Caitlyn or Sivir). As for the top lane, it might be useful in the match ups where you predict you'll be shoved in _and_ they are likely to poke you as well (eg Pantheon and Vladimir). \n\nOutside those particular scenarios, though, it's hard to predict how much time you will be spending under your tower. If the lane or game goes well you'll end up spending more time on the other side of the map and get no value from siegemaster at all. But if they end up sieging you aram style and attempting dives it might turn out to be the right choice after all. \n\nWithout having done the number crunching, the +8 armour and +8 magic resist it offers seems decent compared to flat 2 damage reduction from _basic attacks_ or +15 movement speed in _brush and river_. Considering you can get around 12 armour and/or magic resist from runes, another 8 of each could save your life, especially early. \n\nHaving said all this, I almost never take siegemaster. Maybe now that I've thought about it a bit (and I've been playing melee supports a lot) I might test it out ; )","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-03-12T08:03:38.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i see your point. i just think it wasnt thought through as much as other masteries.\n\nI also feel like +15 MS is way better in most situations. In your example on support, roams. \n\nI know it sounds good as a counter to poke comps but i feel like by the time the enemy groups and seiges, 8 armour/mr prob wont be doing much for you.\nAlso it says on the wiki the range is 600. That is less than tower attack range.\n\nI think an anti seige mastery would be more like last seasons tower shields. Make the mastery \"a 100 HP shield when near an ally tower\" or something. Give it a 3s charge time which can be interupted by poke and a 45s cd when popped (like edge of night). That way, it would also synergise with Runic Armour mastery on the same tree.\n\nThat being said, i do recall watching the recent video from Riot saying Runes/Masteries are in line for a big overhaul soon TM.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFwrySPCff8","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-03-12T08:12:07.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other ways to make siegemaster a worthy option would be to address the flatness of the mastery since it's it pretty bad outside of early levels, whereas if it was 7-13 scaling with 1 extra armour and magic resist every 3 levels would make it alot more solid when compared to it's alternatives, since as the game goes on you'll have less towers and towers won't be as strong as they are earlygame but with this mastery they would still offer you a tiny bit of reassurance from the presence of a tower.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
