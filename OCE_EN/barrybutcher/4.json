However, I think she shouldn't look 16 like her classic splash currently looks. But yeah, it looks pretty much nothing like Katarina. Its a dramatic change and it makes her joints look as fluid as Zac's. Are we sure this isn't a new Zac skin? :P\nAlso, why has no pointed out that her hair is super pink in that splash?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"HackerAnonym0us","date":"2015-02-14T09:36:53.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every time when i see this new katarina wallpaper i want to be blinded.\nHow the fck to kidding too much with her really :| ?\nIt's so played and easy to be killed , but every time it's so fun.\nHIS FACE = LIKE VI'S FACE + A HOT  CARROT :| xD\nhttp://www.carrotmuseum.co.uk/photos/redjan1.jpg\n\nGuys , HELLLLLLLOOOOO   , it's katarina ...  now she is like a gayyy.. it seems to be a big nerf to her.\nFrom {{champion:55}} :* TO            ==========>  {{champion:429}}  + {{champion:1}}  + {{champion:79}} = https://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/1729/5785/original.jpg\nToooo ugly\nTOooo OLD\nShe is an assasin but please..","replies":[]}]}
