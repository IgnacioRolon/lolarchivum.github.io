I don't play him in any other role. His early clear aint so great but if you take a second level in your W compared to maxing your Q you can generally get enough sustain from the Hunters Machete to back at around level four which is a guaranteed jg item with some boots and a pink ward. At least that's what I do. My only complaint is he is generally to low to gank early but the level 6 ganks are still brutal.{{champion:72}}  is love {{champion:72}} is life.","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2014-11-24T03:46:41.748+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been playing Skarner jungle too.

It seems like it should fit her style of initiation well. Honestly looks like it'd be amazing on all melee supports to me! \n\nFor supports at least, I think that Tanky supports would generally rather get Locket. On the other side of things, I think Banner of Command could work well for when you would build Aegis on a non-tanky support to help the team, but getting the straight bonus defensive stats of Locket isn't as great.  That, or with a team that has no real tank, and wants to poke and push hard. \n\nOhmwrecker, I'm really not sure! I could actually see this picked sometimes on tanky initiatior supports, especially with the LAZORZZ from the Inhibitor Turrets. With inhibitor turrets, it's worth pointing out that the Point Runner passive works really well against the slow, and the active prevents the damage reduction / armour piercing, which shoulds pretty great to me. I'm a little wary though, because I've always kinda liked Ohmwrecker on paper, but when I actually used it, didn't like it as much when playing support.","replies":[]}]}
