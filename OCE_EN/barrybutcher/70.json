Why am I lower?\"_ _(we all know that we will likely end up lower)_ but rather _\"Why am I bronze 3 when I was gold 4? lower\"_.\n\nWhich in my opinion is a fair enough argument.\nPeople want to climb, if you've managed to climb to gold for 3 years in a row, why should you have to prove you can do it AGAIN, why not let them use that time to attempt to climb higher? instead of spending half a year proving they can get to the same spot they've been getting to for years in a  row.\n\nI think part of the problem of why we get these _\"Why am I?\"_ posts, is that we are dealing with a system that gives us no information on how it works. It's like trying to solve a maths equation where the \"+ - % x\" symbols  are twinked out. We put in all our numbers _(our wins, rank and LP etc)_, and then get a seemingly random number spat out. Because we cant actually see the workings.\n\nSo naturally people get annoyed, it's hardly their fault.\nImagine trying to solve a rubiks cube in the dark and then being hit over the head for not solving it properly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-16T00:22:00.574+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ugh, ranked in this meta?\n\nNo thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-16T01:03:12.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=pM0HFEfL,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2018-01-16T00:22:00.574+0000)\n>\n> Ugh, ranked in this meta?\n> \n> No thanks.\n\nCome play ARAM bro.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-01-16T11:18:30.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I may have to take you up on that!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Evelynnie","date":"2018-01-16T00:10:47.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd actually forgotten how bad the start of the season is... 3 games, 3 losses, all due to inters...
