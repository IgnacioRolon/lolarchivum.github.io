The other 2 teams I play on have had people stop playing the game, so its hard to get a group of 5 together.\n\nI can play Top/Supp pretty well.

Weekends my availability varies.\nI have Curse, Teamspeak and Discord.\n\nIf there are others who just want the ward skin too (you need 7 wins and 10 games played), just comment below and we can just start a new team","replies":[{"poster":"Inf3cti0n","date":"2015-11-03T09:05:48.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm keen if you're playing tonight - i'm support main, mostly Nautilus & Thresh can play others if needed.
