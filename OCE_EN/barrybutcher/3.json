I read it. Because I played couple DOTA games and was surpirsed they had tri-lanes and sometimes no jungler etc. So i looked up how Lol meta came about.\n\nThe thing is, I played a game with a Morgana+Syndra bot and a Vayne top. Thought, why isn't this \"acceptable\". Just theory crafting since Corki seems to be the only choice bottom when your team has a Zed, Irelia and Khazix...\n\nMaybe Riot needs to add more hybrid/ap marksman?","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2014-12-27T08:57:02.271+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"well you can honestly play anything, as long as it works.\nin solo queue is the main thing, people like to stick to the RULES set by the pro scene. so when you start seeing things in pro games, then you can readily use them in normal and ranked games.\n\nreally you can do anything. just make sure to explain it to your team and try not to lose too badly.\nAD/support bot lane is the strongest way to play the lane and thats why its done like that. \neven lane swapping is still not common place in solo queue, mainly because everyone sucks.","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2014-12-27T09:05:26.181+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=KingDinger,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=Zm08HxFg,comment-id=000100000000,timestamp=2014-12-27T08:57:02.271+0000)\n>\n> well you can honestly play anything, as long as it works.\n> in solo queue is the main thing, people like to stick to the RULES set by the pro scene. so when you start seeing things in pro games, then you can readily use them in normal and ranked games.\n> \n> really you can do anything. just make sure to explain it to your team and try not to lose too badly.\n> AD/support bot lane is the strongest way to play the lane and thats why its done like that. \n> even lane swapping is still not common place in solo queue, mainly because everyone sucks.\n\nYou can do anything you want, but I think people do like to stick to the norms mainly with strangers.\nMy friend and I do Gangplank Yasuo bot lane.

But then, they ignore cancer dashes which let you jump in and out of danger for free and are a bullshit all their own, like Nidalee's, or Zed's, or Yasuo's. And when they look at Zed, they don't see his targeted ability as being the problem, but his base attack speed [?]\n\n\n anyway I'll just leave this here\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/zsKQwIAT-ryze-the-rogue-mage-rework","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-29T08:27:37.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try anivia + lissandra bot with clarity.

However, once the laning phase is over, they need items to be effective, seeing as what they offer is damage. Current supports have heals, Area Denial CC, slows, shields and others all mixed around in their kits. Janna has a slow a shield, a huge area knockback, a heal and a knockup. With these many things, items aren't completely necessary to still be effective in lategame teamfights. Mages however, need items, which comes from CS and kills, which they don't get in the support role, to be effective, and so, are weak and less effective in teamfights than current supports.\n\nIn short, mages aren't effective in teamfights, needs more items.\n\nI now realise I misread your post, that replace the ADC with a mage. But an ADC is nearly completely mandatory, seeing as AD mids are mostly assassins, and dont put out enough damage throughout the entire fight.
