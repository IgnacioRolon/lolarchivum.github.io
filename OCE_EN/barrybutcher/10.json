Now makes him like a little baron as it should be considering how strong the buff is now.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, I think that means champions like Nunu, Warwick and Fiddle, champions who face tanked Dragon to solo it, will be even stronger choice.\r\n\r\nDragon changes are:\r\nDragon attacks are now treated as targeted spells - which means someone like Vayne can't tumble out of the attack area\r\nDragon attacks are no longer blockable or dodgeable - they can be spellsheilded and will pop banshees veil\r\nDragon will ALWAYS finish his attack on the person he has targeted before switching targets - no more juggling aggro","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2014-12-10T11:09:34.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah them pantheons getting drag at lvl 4 was just insane","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-10T13:27:45.736+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> yeah them pantheons getting drag at lvl 4 was just insane\n\nhe could do it level 2 with blue buff and a little attack speed","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T09:33:54.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that there will be a lot of things to change in this pre season not just dragon.

You gain one charge every 75 seconds (vs being able to cast it once every 60 seconds) and can hold up to two charges.\n\nTool tip now includes: \"Smite regains a charge every 75 seconds, up to a maximum of 2 charges.\"\nRecharge timer starts at 1:40\n\nThere is a 15 sec cooldown between casting Smites.\n\nNever miss out on dragon again because you just smited red buff","replies":[{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T13:00:17.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh man that is awesome!
