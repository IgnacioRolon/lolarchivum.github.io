Ticket sales.\nLast I checked tickets are pretty cheap to LoL events.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, the real profits for Riot come from skin sales, and not much else.\nSkins are also really easy to sell.\nPeople value their time, LoL is a game that you'll put a lot of time into, the more time you put into it the more likely you are to spend money on it.\nSince LoL is currently the most popular game in the world, that is a lot of time that turns into skin sales.","replies":[]}]}
