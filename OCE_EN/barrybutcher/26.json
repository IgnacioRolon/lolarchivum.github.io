He lacks hard cc and his dash's synergy is pretty much toplaner/jungler focused and not much use to adcs in the botlane. His bushes are high experience cap, because they do have uses but so far I haven't seen an ivern use them right. I see him building full ap glass cannon Runic echos, Morellos, Void Staff, Deathcap, Lichbane and Sorc boots in most cases which makes him very squishy and easy to kill, however the few cases when he goes mostly tanky ap he becomes a bit more annoying to deal with and alot stronger, building a runic echos, RoA, Rylias, Frozen Heart, Abyssal Sceptre and Mobi boots. He's decent at making picks, though his damage is pretty low even as a glass cannon build but his daisy can cause major issues in a teamfight since she's basically an extra toplane tanky frontliner. He's average in strength when played properly with a team who knows how to play with an ivern and is mostly mid-lategame focused but he's really underwhelming a tad like pre-mini-q-rework nunu and not going to be very useful in low elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-10-08T13:16:09.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's just too Support focused to be good in any low elo match, maybe in high elo (/team based) he may actually be meh, but he just doesn't do enough.\n\nI tried him with some of my lower elo friends, and you can't do much to actually keep them in the game if a lane starts being lost, because he has basically negative damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-10-08T06:15:51.687+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"he seems like he would be better as a roaming support rather than a support jungler.\n\ni still want to buy him tho kek","replies":[]},{"poster":"SupportWisp","date":"2016-10-08T06:10:18.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have only ever seen him once in game and when he walks it's hilarious, He wasn't given knee caps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Trustworthy","date":"2016-10-08T05:49:03.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Passive takes to much health early punishing him for no reason, he has to wait 3 minutes to take 3 camps. Besides that his Q W and E are okay, brushmaker is super situational but can be great for sieges or setting up facechecks into dragon or baron. Daisy is terrible she dies really fast and usually only gets her 3 strike passive off once twice if she's poppin off.","replies":[]}]}
