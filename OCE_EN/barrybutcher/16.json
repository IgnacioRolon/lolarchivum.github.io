I&#039;m torn.\n\nOn the one hand:\nI don&#039;t care if you say you will &quot;add bonuses&quot; for people who win auto-filled games, there are already enough people who troll when they get support. Now imagine if they get support and a loss won&#039;t effect their rank... that sounds like the best thing ever (sarcasm).\nI know there are still a handful of things to work out too, like position swapping in champ select and stuff...which seems like a pain in the ass to deal with. Just don't.\n\nEven if you do something like, you have to reach a rank in 2 roles to get rewards or something like that so that people have to try even when off-roled, you are effectively doubling the amount of games people would need to play to get rewards, which is good and bad because sometimes it can take a long time and some luck for people to reach a certain rank. To have that made void because you have to do it again just turns league into more of a grind than it already is.\n\nI mean, it wouldn&#039;t be bad if it were purely a superficial thing. As in, you get an individual role rank for the games you play but you&#039;re overall rank and MMR are still based on ALL your games. But then it would only be something nice to know but relatively pointless.\n\nWith the change not happening in Challenger and Master, it honestly just seems to me like Riot are trying to kick one-tricks out of Challenger.\n\nOn the other:\nSplitting matchmaking in this way guarantees your rank is reflective of your skill. Instead of an overall rank where you had a handful of off-role games go wrong, your rank should be relatively more stable.\n\nThe fact that ranks per role will be used in NORMAL DRAFT too would be amazing. To have a proper practice for rank rather than using Flex or playing a shitty normal where a laner gets outmatched hard.\n\nC-\nI&#039;m on the fence, but leaning towards it being more trouble than its worth.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nLetting people know what their rank will be AS they do placements is a nice change though it kind of takes the fun out of seeing where you place. BUt if it gets rid of the early season &quot;HOW DID I GET BRONZE!!!&quot; threads, then all the better.\n\nB+\nnice change.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nDividing the season into 3 sections sounds interesting and i&#039;d like to know more before judging it. If its just legit just giving you a different icons or emote, then i couldn&#039;t care less. Has no impact on me, but if people like it, then whatever. it&#039;s a neutral change.\n\nC\nI don&#039;t care.\n-----------------------------\n\nCreating 2 new ranks is also very interesting (depending on where they go). I always though the difference between Bronze 5 and Bronze 1 is rather large and the same can be said of D5 to D1 (i&#039;ve been told).\nAlso having new accounts in Silver just always makes silver a shit show. So a new rank between Bronze and Silver for unranked and the &quot;good bronzies&quot; would be good.\nReducing each rank to only 4 tiers seems like a fine way to deal with adding 2 new ranks.\n\nA\nsounds good.\n--------------------------------\nTweaking bounty and mutli-kill gold to allow more ability to &quot;solo carry&quot;. Having games decided who is &quot;carrying&quot; instead of who is &quot;feeding&quot;.\nAlthough there is no talk about this in the article (only mentioned in the video) sounds like a great idea. Have to wait for more information to see how it works out before judging.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPJ85U8rz0E&feature=youtu.be","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-07T05:50:38.810+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiS1FL2Klyc","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2018-05-07T11:35:23.104+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Sounds like some more sugar coating by Riot. \"I'm bad at this role, i don't wanna be burned out, please change my rank\" rather than play every role, understand the game, get good, get a coach, watch the pros.\nThis is gonna open a different can of worms. For example, \n\n1) Imagine you are currently gold 1 ranked support main. And you get autofilled adc and have a godlike performance in your first game, you might get ranked plat 1 in your adc offrole. So the next time you get autofilled as adc, you get absolutely stomped by a plat 1/diamond 4 adc. Or conversely, your first game in offrole you get wrecked, and the second time you play, you kill some noob. The whole breakdown of each role just makes the skill level of the game even more warped.\n\n2) Players might one trick even more, or throw games in offroles more, because their rank in that role doesn't mean much. They just won't care if they are autofilled. Especially if there is a toxic player on the team, kids without balls will not care about winning in their offrole.\n\n3) Adding betting also, is seriously overcomplicating things. Just keep it simple. Kids need to learn every role, or not be good at the game. It's a team game overall, not a role game. So don't make the system open to abusing by including LP bonus stuff like this.\n\n===========================================================================================================\n\nYou really wanna fix the system Riot? Here's what you do:\n\n1) Remove the current role selection entirely.\n2) When the game begins, the first player in champ select ticks a box saying the role that they are playing.\n3) The other players follow suit when they select their champion.\n\nIn essence, a player could end up any role in the game, just like before season 6. No one is arguing about the role they got, because they chose it. \n\nIf they are the last player in champ select and they have to play support (which happened frequently prior to season 6), UNLUCKY. THEY JUST LEARNT A NEW ROLE IN A TEAM GAME. It will help them to understand the game more, and they won't always be the last person to select their position.\n\nLess code, less arguments, less whiners, MORE SKILL. Also, less time in queue, which means matchmaking will be greatly improved because they don't have to include stupid parameters to account for role select. This fact alone would make OCE a far better server.","replies":[]}]}]}
