The scaling for Penetration will always be better at level 18 with a bunch of items - but having that extra AD might have made it easier to get those items earlier. It's a pretty solid tradeoff that generally ends with AD-casters wanting pen more as Thanatos says :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deche","date":"2015-03-03T12:37:17.656+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What he said ^.\n\nArmor pen works on your abilities and usually has better scaling that pure damage.\n\nexample Zed Q:\n\nAt level 1:\n\nPHYSICAL DAMAGE: 75  (+ 100% bonus AD)\nSECONDARY DAMAGE: 45 (+ 60% bonus AD)\nMIMICKED SHURIKEN: 37.5 (+ 50% bonus AD)\nMIMICKED SECONDARY DAMAGE: 22.5 (+ 30% bonus AD)\n\nAs you can see 10 ad will not really have an effect at .30 the normal damage, but with Armor Pen which is true damage you will get 10 true damage for all the stats 10/10/10/10 instead of 10/6/5/3.","replies":[{"poster":"kJs","date":"2015-03-09T06:28:45.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was confused with what you meant by \"pure damage\" for a time there.

You get 5 \"True Damage\" because that is not effect by armor.  where is your attack to go through is 30 - 25 = 5.
