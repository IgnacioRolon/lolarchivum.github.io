The Devil Vulture ward is also not in the Ward tab in the Collection, i only see it in the shop.\n\nAlso according the the FAQ, I should be able to unlock the Star Guardian Season 2 and the Steel Valkyries ward since it says you can unlock any ward that says Available in collection. I know both of these are supposed to be somewhat exclusive, so maybe a tweaking of the FAQ or removing them from availability in the Collection tab.\n\nOr if they are simply available and not exclusive at all, great for me.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-22T05:31:00.558+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking into this:\n- Devil Vulture ward does appear in collection, just have to set it to display \"All\" skins as it doesn't appear to have been assigned to a \"Set\".\n- I have confirmed that neither Space Lizard or Devil Vulture ward are in the loot table for Mystery Wards, and have reported this to the store team.\n- The New Horizon (SG2) and Exo (SV) ward skins should not be marked as available in collection, actually quite a few others like this as well. I've compiled a list of wards that should not be marked as available and passed this on to the store team.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-11-24T04:31:53.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"any eta on a fix? i just dont what the emporium to close without being able to grab them.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-27T00:05:28.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for waiting, Space Lizard and Devil Vulture wards are now in the mystery ward loot table.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2018-11-25T02:54:07.483+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, no eta on fix yet.

It's possible your issues are related, or that for whatever reason those wards haven't been added to the loot/redeem/whatever you want to call the list of stuff table for the mystery ward. AFAIK you should still be able to get those two via mystery wards so I suspect it's just some backend wonkiness. Regardless, ticket is probably the way to go.\n\nAs for the Popstar ward, as far as I know there aren't any wards you can't get except maybe the hextech ward so there's some nice surprises there.","replies":[]}]}
