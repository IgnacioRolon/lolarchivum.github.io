Maybe they have that stupid temp chat block? Maybe language barrier and have no idea what is going on. Generally a good idea for someone to ask of intentions.\n\nThe only time you can safely pick a role without calling is when everybody else has called and has selected champions (people change their minds). In all other cases, you must call to get the role (this includes those annoying 4man premades that don't call but have already decided their roles and instalock champs and leave the random confused and angry).","replies":[]}]}
