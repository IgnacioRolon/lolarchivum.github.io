So what Riot basically want you to do is either give up the tower for free or force a fight. No more turtling.\n\nI mean, those turret lasers can barely defend themselves against normal minions they feel so weak LOL","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-27T06:32:17.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Creep waveflow mechanics.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robin Song Robin","date":"2014-11-20T18:53:48.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think it's intentional.
