Amazing. Coming from 2-0 down in a best of 5 TWICE and then beating the Rank 1 team from the regular season. Pretty unexpected. A team that goes 7-12 and comes 7th is going to WORLDS.\r\n\r\nThey will probably get smacked pretty badly at WORLDS, but it&#039;s still an amazing story.","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-09-01T08:47:53.348+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its an amazing feat I'll grant you that, but they beat TIP who has quite alot of issues atm.\n\nTL just tilted, there shot calling wasn't on point and their picks and bans were garbage.\nthey just didn't take the match-up seriously and in the end they paid for it.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-09-01T09:46:41.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, i have no clue why they didn't drop the Rumble ban for Draven if they were adamant about picking Vayne after Sneaky's game 1. Granted they didn't feed teh Draven this time around, but that's because TL had to constantly look bottom to make sure Vayne never died with extra pressure and TP's. Took away from pressure in other lanes.\nAlso I think IWD didn't really respect Hai's jungling. Invading him and everything and he got punished a few times.\n\nThink the \"forever fourth\" curse is stuck inside IWD and Quas' heads.\n\nThe first Bo5 against GV was more C9 playing crap the first 2 games then getting their act together. I mean, Hai's Amumu was terrible LOL\n\nTIP were just so stubborn about picking the Sivir. It was such a bad pick in game 4 and game 5 they let Azir through because they had a \"velkoz counter\" and got to pick Kalista but then never forced good teamfights. Was poor play. Also the Velkoz Ult in the last teamfight... awful. I mean, when you get like an 18min inhib or whatever it was and can't win the game with that pressure... GG","replies":[]}]}]}
