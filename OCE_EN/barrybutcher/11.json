They're ruining skarner by giving him a gimmick with the shrine things in the jungle.\nWith both these changes, they're shoehorning these champs into certain positions.\n\nDarius is going to be super broken with his new passive as well, especially now that it's physical damage.","replies":[{"poster":"Chicken4dinner","date":"2015-08-20T00:03:37.389+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Infected Walnut,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=TkKlPIa7,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2015-08-19T08:09:11.750+0000)\n>\n> they're ruining mordekaiser by forcing him to either be botlane, or be useless. not to mention the ridiculous damage on his q, you get 3 q'd autos off on their adc and they're dead.

Yeah big changes that look like buffs are coming out but Daruis and Garen are getting huge stat nerfs to compensate (they cut over 20% off Daruis's late game base damage and now his q handle damage does not hemmorage (no more e q combo's for insane damage into ult), I have not read up on Garen because I don't believe he was that broken looking.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-19T08:17:17.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Infected Walnut,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=TkKlPIa7,comment-id=0001000100000000,timestamp=2015-08-19T08:09:11.750+0000)\n>\n> they're ruining mordekaiser by forcing him to either be botlane, or be useless. not to mention the ridiculous damage on his q, you get 3 q'd autos off on their adc and they're dead.

They also lowered his mana, so he won't run out as much as before (which makes the 3% mana regen on his passive a bit overkill), they made it so when he ults a target he gains 100 movement speed, so he can drag them even further now. Who cares if you think Skarner's crystals are gimmicky, he has a lot of power without them.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2015-08-19T06:35:02.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=FioraTheExplorer,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=TkKlPIa7,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-08-19T06:20:24.844+0000)\n>\n> I'm pretty sure the sheer amount of new content on this patch is well more than enough to compensate {{champion:82}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:72}}\n\nYep, also a day late is better than a week and if we were still on our old patching time, we'd be getting it Friday instead of Thursday.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Get Phreaky","date":"2015-08-19T08:38:21.395+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot forgot to permabn you off fourms","replies":[]}]}
