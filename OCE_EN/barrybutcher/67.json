And if we ever have a pressing need to discuss something with you, you're there.  Its a shame representatives of all the dev teams, skins/balance/lore etc don't have a semi-permanent presence in a capacity that can have more personal conversations with people.\n\n_(although I understand that OCE's numbers allow for that a little better than NA's)_","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2019-03-21T09:23:55.191+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea for them NA tends to be their focus for Boards listening and engagement since it's their timezone and they can jump in while the discussion is fresh and active. They of course have other methods of gathering feedback, like surveys, player labs, and other forms of social media.\nMeddler tends to post these on the Dev Corner between 0000 and 0300 JST so maybe not the best time for you unfortunately.\n\nThe NA Boards actually have more Rioter engagement than OCE because they have such a large team compared to us (NA and Central offices combined have over 1500 Rioters, OCE is very few people owning a lot of work and I just do what I can to keep the local fire alive!) but the balance team is only a small part of that in comparison with strict deadlines to meet given the patch cadence and the amount of content in League to support.\nThey do read a ton of the stuff on Boards, but when they really get involved in posting responses as well is when they open discussions with players themselves, such as the recent [Bounty changes](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/BQEfgyrs-upcoming-bounty-changes?comment=000a0000) and the experimental [Blitzcrank changes](https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/A8F8ArAw-blitzcrank-changes-heading-to-pbe).\n\nBtw when I said they'll have some thoughts on Urgot by Friday I forgot to mention that's NA's Friday, so our Saturday morning.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-03-20T06:47:06.863+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't make a diff to me lol, i'll still squash the spider with my tentacles\n\nHis weaknesses haven't changed, he's still a close ranged meat sack, if you can land poke (like illaoi Q, kayle E etc.) in a fight, you won't have an issue, you just have to wait till he wastes his shotgun knees now, and then fight around his ult (its not that hard to dodge)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2019-03-20T06:00:24.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, you're not alone in worrying there...\n\nOften with these kinds of changes, they take a champ down a peg or two, then in the next few patches, throw them up another 5.\nWe had our patch and a half of Urgot being tolerable.  Now we have to deal with the 5 pegs up version.\n\nAlso what worries me is not the buff itself to Hecarim, but what they said in the description about it:\n> We're givin' the pony an extended-combat buff to help out his more bruiser-y builds (not the ones where he rushes out of Fog of War to one-shot you).\n\nWhat that clearly states, is that they _know_ theres a Hecarim build that runs out of the fog of war and 1 hits you.  And the fact that they jokingly mentioned it, means that they _know_ it's frustrating as hell.\n\nAnd their answer to the problem, rather than nerfing it, is: \n_\"Maybe, if we try to make his other build EVEN STRONGER, then he will be weaker and more balanced!\"_\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}} {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-03-21T05:19:48.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why in the name of God are you buffing Urgot again when he was so oppressive top lane?
