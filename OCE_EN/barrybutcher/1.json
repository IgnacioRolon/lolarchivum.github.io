While it seems likely this is his base skin it doesn't have to be. It could be that this pose is from his joke and his overall feel is less goofy. It could be part of his lore and like how Nunu sees him but not how he actually is. You get the idea. We can speculate sure, but we're missing so much info here.\n\nEDIT: I'd recommend reading the bio now that it's out :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-08-13T13:49:24.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its very \"zoe-style\". Like kid-friendly kind of route to take the champ. Doesn't seem to fit league imo, but then again the new Akali is very anime, so they are definitely changing the way they want the game to look.\n\nBut looking at the size of his mouth, I think his \"Consume\" animation could be quite funny.","replies":[]}]}]}
