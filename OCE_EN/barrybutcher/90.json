I find that the people are better and know how to play better, but are little bit more unstable (mentally). Lots of &quot;GG, ff&quot; after 3 mins, talking shit in all chat and toxicity from early on but they play well.\n\njust my experience?

Plat is easier to play/work around with. Why? Because getting into plat means you're playing with people who knows what they're doing being around Plat3- gold 1. Gold is still an achievement but it also means playing with silvers and most new players play around Gold - Silver elo being placed more in silver than it is Gold. Plat on the other hands is more challenging environment as you + team vs the enemy team. At this point, you would have macro-plays equal to a mid-high plat and knowledge superior to gold & below. Its hard to climb to diamond from there on out, but also occasionally there are some plats who knows when it is a loss (diamond is usually where its at, seem some recordings of dialogue where diamonds had admitted their own fault and was acknowledge but never flamed). Plat is similar, you + others would know when to lose or if you have a solid winning chance.\n\nCongrats btw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2018-10-08T09:37:11.039+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, its possible.\nI definitely find silver far far easier than bronze, I wouldn't be surprised to find that behaviour mimicked further up the ladder.","replies":[]}]}
