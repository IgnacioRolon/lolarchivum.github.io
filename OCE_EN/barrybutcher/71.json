After Team Builder Draft is launched, if there are still significant queue dodging issues, we may allow players to report a player and specify a reason if they do choose to queue dodge.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T05:29:02.542+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":18,"body":"lmao do you think riot works on oce league where there are 10 users?","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T11:49:50.506+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=WEETBIX 4 BREKKI,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=fqaLQeRy,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-27T05:29:02.542+0000)\n>\n> lmao do you think riot works on oce league where there are 10 users?\n\n-11 <3 praise jesus","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-27T14:45:21.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I pray to the almighty weetbix for he shall recieve more votes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-27T10:13:48.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually don't want Team Builder Ranked, not if it's like the normals version anyway.
