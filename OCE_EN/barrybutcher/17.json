People like Akali still won't have the AD and attack speed characters like ADCs have which let them get through the waves quickly. This just means they do a little bit of extra damage to the minions. It makes their wave clearing a bit better, but not super strong. If it becomes a huge problem they could just nerf the damage it does to minions or something, I guess.\nMost APs already have good wave clear though, because a lot of them have AoE damage.\n\nWhat I am interested in how targetting works with this though.\nFor example, let's say Soraka gets it for some reason for the sake of this example. She throws down her Starcall hitting like 10 minions.
