That's the sound of the patch 5.5 buff barge, sailing the ocean of champion diversity. There were a few we had to slap on the wrist for overstaying their welcome but, for the most part, we've got a lot of +1s on the way.","url":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-55-notes","image":null},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bard Added - Will be permabanned not because he is strong (i think he will be good, not pick or ban, but good), but because of his potential to troll and people \"failing\" his ults\n\nTasty Gragas buff. Extra 100 mana is nice. Don't play jungle gragas so damage to monsters doesnt matter much to me.\n\nKassadin. We'll see if he is broken again. I'm sure lots of people have seen the [video of the \"new\" Kassadin.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUdyZP-lh4) I just imagine him with 10 kills and being untouchable.\n\nNerf to Nidalee Jungle. Coz fuk nid Jungle.\n\nSmall buffs to fringe junglers (Naut, Xin, Skarner, Voli, Zac). Might be nice. I like the idea of the Bami's Cinder, 1000 gold for a small Sunfire will be nice. I think the nerf to the Wolves, Raptors and Gromp damage will be a bigger impact then the item change though.\n**Plus an slight increase is gold means you can do 3 camps and back and actually afford your smite upgrade instead of having to do scuttle crab or wait for 20 gold.**\n\nChanging Sion to try and make people max Q instead of E. Don't think it will work. E is just fun.\n\nVeigar's stun now stops dashes and gives people .25 seconds less time to dodge. Will be nice, but still won't help him go back to where he was, which was a fringe pick anyway.\n\n**Trundle buff is HUGE. 20% bonus healing with level 1 W. He will be back for sure.**\n\nLuden's Echo. 120AP 7% Movespeed. Static shiv style passive. Most interesting part of the passive:  Applies spell Effects (e.g., Spell Vamp, Rylai's, etc). Akali might be back. Tibbers will now hurt even more. Don't think the item does much for Veigar.\n\nWill be interesting: {{item:3100}}  + {{item:3023}} + Luden's Echo + 3rd Dragon = 23% Bonus Movespeed","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-03-13T01:55:14.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffs to all my toons except vi.
