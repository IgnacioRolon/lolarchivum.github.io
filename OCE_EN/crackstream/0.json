We want players to fight over the creeps.\r\n2. We want roaming to be less effective.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m going to acknowledge the cannon gold increase and gold being moved off ranged creeps.\r\nThey say it is to give players something to fight over. \r\nIf this is true then...\r\nHow does moving the gold earned from each wave onto a cannon wave not promote a more passive play every 2/3 waves and aggressive play for 1/3rd the time.\r\n\r\nAnd why would they take it off the ranged creeps? The ones you have to extend farther into enemy territory to get.  So that now going for a riskier cs nets you even less gold than before. \r\nThe ranged creeps are also the ones you can most easily contest if you played lane well and got ahead.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis  just seems weird and does not seem to match motives they put forth.\r\n\r\nAs for preventing roams without seeing how fast people can push I don&#039;t know for sure but...\r\n\r\n I do know that if you roam now during any of the non cannon waves and the opposing laner pushes your lane under tower you will lose less gold with this new system,  So the current system would be more punishing to non canon roams.\r\nI also know that if you push in your opponent with this proposed minion hp pool increase you can worry less about losing cs to your tower because your wave is tankier and should be harder for the opponent to shove back. \r\n\r\n**TLDR:  Junglers plz gank my lane when the canon arrives I can guarantee the dude will go for it.**","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-04-01T22:10:00.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I keep seeing in the \"hints and tips\" at loading screen, that it it encourages you to farm, over getting player kills.\n\nThis seems wrong to me.\nSurely a PvP game should reward PvP kills more than farming?\n\nThis is why I play ARAM, where cs means nothing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acension","date":"2018-03-31T17:49:03.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"And why would they take it off the ranged creeps?

Melee creeps increased gold and will cause more trading against supports with relic as well because they are forced to walk up to proc. Also if you duel when only casters are up wave pushes into enemy and they get freezing advantage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-31T11:29:39.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They think fighting over the cannon and not roaming during cannon waves is enough but in reality it'll just promote the opposite. Take your cannon, then dont fight and go roam. Pretty dumb.","replies":[]}]}
