But What i dont understand is why does pro league have competitions with All-Stars pros legit 1 vs 1 each other. Why isn't dont we have a Ranked 1 vs 1 for the whole league community when only pro are allowed to have something similaar","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-08T23:02:57.316+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna happen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-03-08T22:41:00.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Admittedly it'd be a cool thing, to go toe to toe with just one other player to see who is best.\nBut the problem with 1v1's, especially in lower elos is that it becomes even less about skill and more about champion counters.\n\nIt would be near impossible to win 1v1's with champs like Aurelion Sol, Ivern, Kindred and basically all supports, champs that are strong, but rely on team coordination in order for them to have max effect. \n\nMeanwhile it would be basically impossible to lose 1v1's as champs like Zed, Kayle, Yasuo, Fizz, Heimerdinger, etc etc. \n\nSo the viable 1v1 champion pool would be very very small and boring indeed. \n\nEven if you restricted the champion pool to a certain class (both players must pick ADC, or both must pick tank) you'd still get very small champion pools.\nFor example in a tank 1v1 why would you pick Nautilus or Nunu, when you could pick Vi or Garen? who have equal or more tankiness, but 3x the damage.\n\nLikewise for ADC, duelling champs like Vayne or Trist would dominate, the only other compeditors would be champs like Cait and Jhin, who just sit there poking.\n\nand what about Kalista mains? _\"Im sorry, but your champ will NEVER compete in 1v1... yea sorry about that, shoulda picked a better champ aye! sucker!\"_\nHardly fair... \n\nZed/Fizz mains will get diamond, purely because the champs they are good with happen to be the best 1v1 champs, while Kalista and Ivern mains get stuck in bronze 5 forever, because their champs are more team orientated. \n\n________\n\nThe only fair way to do it, would be to have 3 or so rounds, and in each round a randomly selected champion is even to both players, and the two must battle it out to see who is the best Irelia, or the best Cassiopeia etc etc.\n\nThe two problems with that is:\n\n1. if it happens to fall on your main... Rip the enemy. \n2. No one wants a game mode that is essentially a mirror lane simulator...\n\nSo its a good idea, but in reality I just don't think it would work.","replies":[]}]}
