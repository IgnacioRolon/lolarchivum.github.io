So anyway... I have noticed as a support main I do tend to sometimes ward when I shouldn&#039;t, not so good with trading sometimes, but I do understand the kill beats sustain, sustain beats pokes and poke beats kill lane if that helps? Not sure if this is a good or bad thing but I don&#039;t pay much attention to counters as a support? I focus more on what lane combo beats what and what my adc and team need... though that still needs work too since I&#039;m still learning about good team comps etc, and counter building I struggle with... as a support I know it&#039;s technically not as important but it is at the same time since I have to keep my carry/carries alive... I get the basics of armor counters auto attack champs, mr counters ap and health counters true damage but when it comes to I guess countering specific items I&#039;m a little lost... I also struggle a lot keeping up with the current meta... apparently op.gg is good for that and so nerf pls but I&#039;m not sure which is more accurate... I also probably should ask where to place pinks, cause currently I put one either behind drag or baron or in the bush behind riv bush in mid before either drag or baron... any other tips you guys think I might need to help me improve would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-06-25T01:38:58.129+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey mang! It looks like your thread was posted in the wrong sub-board, so unfortunately, I'll have to close it out.

Just play other lanes so you can carry everyone out, or play Lux/Morgana as support so you have potential to build into a carry.\n\nMax out Q on morgana before level 6 if you are in Bronze V, since people can't dodge you can just fire the death ball, and take ignite too. It's bronze v, focus on yourself helps out more than the team since team doesn't exist. I started the season in bronze V, climbing into silver didn't feel challenging. Long story short, don't play anything team orientated if you don't have a team to begin with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AirÃ¬","date":"2017-06-18T11:44:23.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Recently climbing out of bronze myself i recommend playing play making sups/ high cc sups to carry your adc. I mainly played {{champion:412}} as his lantern is the best for saving people who cant position which happens a lot in bronze. He has a hook to catch people out and can disengage fights if they seem lost.  Aside from {{champion:412}}  i believe {{champion:497}} is good as one full team ult can sway they game and his cc is insane. For a healing/shielding sup {{champion:117}} is probably the best your ult is really good as you can save an ally and can almost remove one person from a fight with poly morph.  General ward tips are to ward the bush closest to your tower if pushed in and bush closest to their tower if pushing. If you push into them try to get some wards in their jungle or by baron. If your team has no AP or you want to carry just play {{champion:63}} , build {{item:2301}}  and then go full AP and watch them melt in team fights. Also if they don't have an assassin its best to just go {{summoner:14}} as {{summoner:3}} is not very good anymore since Nerf. \n~ Hope it helps\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-06-18T05:04:44.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My advice (take it with a pinch of salt since I'm only silver1 so I don't really know much about the game) is learn to play around 4 supports, one for shielding and heals, one for engage/peel and tank, one for magic damage and one for flexipick (someone who does a little of everything) usually with a knockup. Leanring a large pool makes you less able to carry with each individual support, so focus on being able to play these support roles. If your pick for the teamcomp gets banned and your flexipick taken, just play one of your 4 supports anyway, don't try to first time something for the teamcomp, unless you are a mechanical god it doesn't usually end well.\n\nMy supports are shielder janna, tanky engage/peel leona/nautilus, magic damage zilean and flexipick lulu (because even after the nerfs she's still strong and she really does everything). You should pick the shielder/healer into any balanced teamcomp that already has a tank or multiple offtank fighters, and a mix of ap and ad damage. The tank if your teamcomp lacks engage/cc/peel/tanks. The magic damage, if your team wants to go full ad and the enemy has any tanks or fighters. And always consider whether your flexipick works for the teamcomp, or against theirs, you can alternatively almost always pick your flexipick if they're strong in the meta and just use the others as backups.\n\nOnto items and vision, don't rush a sightstone, you generally want your tier 2 support item first, make up for the lack of early vision with control wards if you get forced to back before you have enough gold, and generally try to make sure you have a control ward up and another one in your inventory. Also control wards should be treated more like ward+redtrinket combined, so use them aggressively. Placing a control ward in a bush that won't ever get sweeped is nice since it'll be permanently warded, but it's better to be a little more liberal with control wards since having one in river bush or in a contested position, puts your side at a strong information advantage. Also try to push your wards further out if you can, so long as there isn't a hole in your vision of an area, deep wards are great for this, but don't leave your adc alone in lane to do this unless you're really far ahead.\nOther than that, support items have changed up a little, but on enchanters and healers you generally want to start ancient coin into medalion and boots into sightstone into ardent censer then talisman of ascension and cdr boots then redemption and then build as necessary, locket of the iron solari isn't so great early on for enchanters now with the rework, but once you have a bit more health and extra shielding power it becomes a good pickup, for magic damage supports, spellthiefs into frostfang and boots into sightstone, into eye of the watchers into morellos if you need cdr or RoA if you have alot of gold early on or if you expect the game to go for a long time and you're having sustain issues against a poke comp or need to a be little more tanky, other than that build like a midlaner. Tanks generally go relic shield into targons and boots or maybe a cloth armour if you are losing lane, then build a sightstone then ninjatabi or merc treads and then pick either face of the mountains and sightstone if you think your adc is worth protecting and you plan on building alot of item actives going randuins, locket, gargoyles, ect... (redsightstone is good in active heavy builds), or eye of the equinox if you plan on going a more basic tank route with items like sunfire, frozen heart, abyssal, thornmail, ect...\n\nWhen making shotcalls on objectives, try to think more about it, from the enemy team's point of view and consider who can defend or contest an objective and where their team are. Try to make calls that have the lowest risk and a decent reward. Things can go wrong really quickly in lower elos, don't go for risky teamfights or difficult contests over an objective. Don't abandon your adc if he isn't superfed and you have vision control, since odds are they won't be able to play safe for even a short trip to ward drag. Look at the minimap as often as you can, and learn to be able to click other lanes to look at their situation and then relock camera to bring the camera back to you rapidly.\n\nIn lane, try to play your role as it's intended and try to pay attention to your adc's playstyle and unless the enemy oversteps alot, don't make any risky plays without being sure your adc will follow up. Earlygame don't fight in the middle of the enemy minion wave or when the enemy has more minions than you, unless you can catch them under tower or without summoners and cooldowns. Most spells won't drawn minion aggro but auto attacks or spells that apply onhit effects will. Try to pick fights when the enemy uses a big cooldown and misses or uses it on a minion. Also as a ranged support, try to harass the enemy adc with your autos every time they try to cs.\n\nIgnite is strong for early laning and winning the 2v2, exhaust is cc and is better later on into the game or if your support lacks cc. Ignite should be dropped at the start of an all-in, to reduce the odds of you getting the kill and to prevent healing, exhaust should be dropped either defensively to reduce the damage of an enemy spell rotation or nearer the middle to disengage if the fight turns out bad or to prevent the enemy from disengaging with the slow.\n\nEnchanters/Shielders/Healers: {{champion:432}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:16}} {{champion:44}} \nMagic Damage: {{champion:1}} {{champion:63}} {{champion:43}}{{champion:127}} {{champion:99}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:37}}{{champion:45}} {{champion:161}}  {{champion:26}} {{champion:143}} \nTank/Engage/Peel: {{champion:12}}{{champion:53}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:14}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:412}} \nFlexipick (fit into almost any teamcomp): {{champion:1}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:111}} {{champion:497}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:223}} {{champion:412}} \n\nThese are the general way I think champs fit into these archtypes for picks but it can vary and I'm probably wrong on a few since I don't play some of these champs.\n\nFor more advice from far better players go to this discord: https://discord.gg/E3zC2Ey\nThe above discord is the league mentoring discord for supports, it has alot of insightful discussion with alot of higher elo players.","replies":[]}]}
