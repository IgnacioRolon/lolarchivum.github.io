I have contacted riot about this and was told it must be a visual glitch cause on their end I&#039;m still losing LP, I began checking other sites like op.gg.oce, lol-mmr.com and lolking, all of which show your LP, all 3 sites show the same LP as shown on my profile. This glitch has been going on for roughly 2-3 months, I contacted riot when it first began happening, originally I wouldn&#039;t fall below 12LP... it&#039;s slowly gotten higher . I have no idea how much LP I have so I have no idea how far I am from going into my promos, any advice on what I can do?","replies":[{"poster":"A Corpse","date":"2015-06-17T10:18:23.342+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I checked my LP on other sites etc cause after a loss, no LP was lost.
