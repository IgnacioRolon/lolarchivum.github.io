This can sometimes fix the issues you're describing.\n\nThis could also potentially be an issue with your connection to Riot's servers, required for launching the game.\n\nCould you change your computer to [use a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) for me and let me know if that helps.","replies":[]}]}
