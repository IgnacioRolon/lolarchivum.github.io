After grinding away on the new arcade mission and finally getting enough tickets for the mega orb, after unlocking it get a skin shard for a skin i already have. what a waste of time.\r\nDo you think loot system should change so you don&#039;t get skin shards of skins you already have because it grinds my gears and make me feel like the free to play players aren&#039;t being rewarded.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-08-17T07:48:21.395+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great Orb is technically better. It's 30 less to pay and includes a wider spectrum of skins (less duplicates and more possibilities). Not to mention, most of the legacy skins outside of the \"veteran\" status, worth very little, because most of them are very old skins (that may or may not have been updated, but even so it's usually nowhere as valuable as the newly release skins in terms of visual quality to cost ratio).","replies":[]},{"poster":"TimingOfLords","date":"2017-08-17T06:06:23.098+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The whole point of legacy skins is that you get skins that are supposed to be rarer than normal skins. Some people like the prestige of having a rare skin.\n\nFor example, I have The Magnificent Twisted Fate, and I also have Blood Moon. Now, I don't play TF often, but when I do, sometimes I prefer to use objectively the worse skin that is TMTF, but other times I prefer to use BMTF. It depends on whether I want to look at a pretty skin, or feel good about having a rarer skin.\n\nSome people feel good about having rare skins, some people don't. I don't understand why Riot put the legacy skins in the mega orbs instead of the great orbs because it's less actual value for people's money. Since the number of expensive and/or \"good\" skins that are legacy are very little. But they are marketing the mega orbs towards the people that want legacy skins instead of the chance to get generic and common skins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Queen Loreta","date":"2017-08-14T08:03:15.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just opened a mega orb.
