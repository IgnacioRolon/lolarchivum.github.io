Stick to doing 3 games at a time, and play them as though you're doing your promos.\n\nI've been keeping this mindset and I'm sitting pretty on 12 Wins 4 Losses (75% Win Rate) and it'll probably (hopefully) only drop as low as 66.6% (2/3rds) this season if I keep winning 2 out of every 3 games. Keeping up a 66% win rate basically means you'll always gain 2-3x what you would lose - right now I gain ~30 LP and lose only 10-13 LP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-16T04:52:24.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How do you go from Season 2 Silver to potentially the lowest spot in Oceania?","replies":[{"poster":"Sacharissa","date":"2015-02-16T07:09:35.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know, this is statistically impossible.

Not just ranked, but LEAGUE.\n\nI read and watched some stuff from high elo players on the net talking about tilting and mindset in lower elo games. One thing that stuck out to me was that you can NEVER blame your team mates. Not because it hurts morale and reduces your chance of winning (which it does), but because it actually, isn't really their fault.\n\nSolo Q is just that, a SOLO game. There are team components to it but the fact is, game after game, the only consistent factor is you. I lost like 7 games in a row or something and I guarantee you that I was the problem in all those games as I tilted. At the time I blamed my team mates but if I was honest to myself, I just played like %%%%. I offered nothing to my team.\n\nHow does this relate to your situation in Bronze 5 as a prior silver player? I'm assuming the frustration youre having comes from having \"bad team mates\" who don't know how to play the game. Think of this as a puzzle - your %%%%ty team mates are part of the puzzle. You are playing a bot game with Inters on the other side and beginner on yours and it's your responsibility as the BETTER PLAYER, to lead them to victory.\n\nTHAT's, how you win games in solo Q.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Tomblade","date":"2015-02-16T03:56:13.431+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I chuckled at your post with the DBZ reference ^_^\n\nI hope you get back into Silver man!
