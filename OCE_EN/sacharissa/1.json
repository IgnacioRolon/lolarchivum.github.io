Champions like Xin Zhao with gap closer can give serious trouble to typical solo mid champions because most of them are squishy mages. Lets discuss the possibility? \r\n\r\nNo, I don't think Garen is viable solo mid since he lack a gap closer.","replies":[{"poster":"Riso","date":"2015-02-13T05:51:55.609+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just play DFG Garen mid.
