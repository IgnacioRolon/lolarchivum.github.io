I do have 100+ champions, so when come to choosing a champion, I sometimes get confused or overlooked some champions I want to play just because I am not scrolling the champion list all the way down. So can we add a favorite champion list to add our favorite champions to a special filter for better choosing and decision making during the short window given in champion select?\r\n\r\nPS. Dota 2 has this feature, I don't see the reason we can't have that in LOL.","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-02-12T20:48:46.908+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever i go into norms i think\n\n\"FUUUCK, what to play...?\"\n\"Wish i had more than 30 champs.\"\n\nOh, and ty Musterpulse.","replies":[]}]}
