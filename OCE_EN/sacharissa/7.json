Taking this example, we have a Xin who is determined to feed in a ranked game and successfully got himself 35 deaths in under an hour. I reported him obviously, but the problem is the trolls keep coming back with in large number. I am almost attempted to just close the game and afk myself so I don&#039;t have to suffer.\n\nI want to know what's RIOT's position on dealing with these people? I seriously doubt the current system  works because these trolls show up in 1 out of 3 ranked games. Now I play yi in ranked game...not to win the game, but to enjoy the feeling of mass murder. Winning is optional for me now. How do you deal with these people? keep playing the game knowing it is a defeat and a waste of time? It surprised me that these people troll and feed without fear as if the punishment system doesn't exist. The fact that these people keep showing up suggests the system may actually non-exist or incredibly ineffective.\n\nP.S. if you are trying to say \"you could have done this\" or \"you could have been more positive\". Well, in that case, I just want to say \"FUK YOU! AND I DON&#039;T APOLOGIZE FOR MY LANGUAGE! THERE ARE FIVE PLAYERS ON EACH TEAM, THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN DO! WHAT MORE DO YOU EXPECT\"","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-05-29T07:14:29.866+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is harder to leave b5 than it is to leave b2","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-29T07:07:14.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"name and shame","replies":[]}]}
