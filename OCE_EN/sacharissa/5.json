I did it to reduce pings, but I have to say I like this server so far. Two things I noticed already though which comes as a surprise\n1) People always comment when I use my grey warwick and medieval twitch skin.\n2) ranked game appears to be easier (but I could be wrong). My vayne is shopping down the hapless enemy team like cakewalk.\n\nSo are grey ww and medieval twitch only available for people like me?  :D I wonder if I can use this opportunity to increase my chance of winning","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-08T06:09:11.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> People always comment when I use my grey warwick and medieval twitch skin.\n\nThey're received through the refer a friend system, which we don't have on OCE. They're less common on OCE than most any other server.\n\n> Ranked game appears to be easier (but I could be wrong).

I don't know what it's really like but think of it being like our gold is equivalent to other servers silver, as an example.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-08T04:57:14.624+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Grey WW and Medieval Twitch are Refer a Friend rewards, Refer a Friend system has not existed on OCE and wont until they implement the new Refer a Friend some Rioters were talking about a while ago.\n\nBunch of people are extremely salty that they didn't RAF people while on NA or EUW.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-02-07T13:49:18.592+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Enjoy our Draft, Dominion and Twisted Treeline...
