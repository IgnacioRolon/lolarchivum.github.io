Does OCE exist when these 2 skins were released?\r\nAnd potentially a bunch of legacy skins perhaps? like spectacular sivir?\r\nHolloween skins like prestigious leblanc and bewitching nidalee?\r\n\r\nAnything else you guys can think of?","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-08T04:51:40.106+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Traditional Karma was given to those who owned Karma before her rework, the same as Traditional Sejuani and Trundle.
