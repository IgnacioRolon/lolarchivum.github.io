It can cut both ways, so if there is a team member who does not want their champion, a generous player may offer them their reroll. Conversely, if a team member does not particularly look forward to playing alongside a certain champion for whatever reason, they may offer their reroll to the team mate in the hope that it is accepted and a new champion is rostered into the team.\r\n\r\nThis may address issues such as when a summoner has 2 rerolls and is given a champion they intend to play. A summoner may offer their reroll to avoid nil reroll points awarded, as they are already at the cap.\r\nThis will also increase fluidity in reroll transactions and flexibility of the reroll function.\r\nLastly it may elicit more thumbs up from team mates for their generous offer, increasing friendly, team work and helpful ratings.\r\n\r\nCould this ever be a feature for ARAM?","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-12-06T10:08:32.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already a feature. \n\nSay I get Tryndamere and want to use your re-roll.
