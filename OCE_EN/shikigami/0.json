I can see that the account you're posting from enlisted and received the 4-win IP boost. \n\nThe boards and enlist page share the sign-in information and it looks you have enlisted on your account with the 'aflyingbrownie' summoner name that  you're using to post here. From looking into your details, it looks like when you log on to the game to play you're actually using a different summoner name.  \n\nIf you log on the the website with the same details that you use to login and play, you should be able to enlist with that account - and future games will be tracked.","replies":[]}]}
