I spend good money on the game too.. probably all up around $300 by now, I put some money aside each week more so just because of the hours of entertainment i receive vs how much I would otherwise pay for entertainment... so a $10/week RP purchase seems like fair donation with some aesthetic benefit to me.\r\n\r\nOne thing that has stricken me as of recent is the abundance of feeders and trolls in Bronze... promos have been fucked up innumerable times, demoted innumerable times, and my LP is currently standing at 0 after being one win away from promos due to 3 sets of intentional feeders and 1 troll jungler....\r\n\r\nI think it&#039;s beyond bullshit that you lose LP after there is a clear uncontrollable mechanism in the game that has forced you to lose the game... there is no mechanism for beating a yasuo that is fed 11 kills at 9 minutes by a &quot;mid or feed&quot; annie... the saddest thing is that the people being trolled are true hearted bronzies who want to have a crack at the game and try to get better and get their ranks up, the people trolling are just playing accounts that can be likened to disposable razors .... they don&#039;t give a fuck about the account, they just derive some sadistic pleasure from ruining your game.\r\n\r\nSo un-enthused and, quite frankly, shocked at the fact that you lose LP when there are intentional feeders on your team. Mind blowing. There&#039;s no safety net for legit players and thats something that makes me really want to reconsider my little $10/week expenditure here. \r\n\r\n{{item:3151}}","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-20T14:00:02.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well at least your not in platinum where half of the players are assholes","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-10-20T14:58:02.061+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"how the actual fuck do people think higher tiers are any worse. any amount of trolls can be in any game at any time. the reason they ARE more likely to be in bronze is because they've continuously lost and sucked and have no motivation, or at least not as much as those in platinum who have won at least what.....55% of their games minimum?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-10-20T23:35:31.907+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"???? How do you think they're any better???? Maybe a different kind of toxicity but still just as bad, if not worse and certainly just as often. I've been through B3 to Gold and it doesn't get any better. From what I hear from friends I play with a lot, Plat is worse then Gold and DV is full of boosters in addition, so maybe don't assume that just cause people theoretically play better there's any less toxicity. A conceited ass will still be a conceited ass whether he's B5 or DV. In fact he'll be worse in Diamond because he'll be lording it over everyone how good he is.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2015-10-21T03:44:45.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for that platinum is the worst division i have had my share of bronze and it sure is nicer than plat","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"MungJuice","date":"2015-10-20T09:35:36.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Last game of the evening after a long day at work. \n \nDay's report is as follows:\n\nFirst game: Mid or Feed Annie\nSecond Game: Trolling Rengar who farmed jungle without ganking on purpose the entire game, went to a lane once to get a double kill then resumed jungle farm\nThird Game: Duo Queue intentional feeding Alistar and Amumu\nFourth Game: Intentionally feeding Diana, who then AFKd at 9 minutes\n\nFrom Bronze 3 to Bronze 4 in a matter of just over an hour.\n\nFuck this game","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-20T10:17:17.258+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Second game Rengar not a troll probably had devourer and realised his life was ruined since he is in bronze so he tried harder to leave bronze.\nThird game Probably a duo having a bad game everyone has them.","replies":[{"poster":"MungJuice","date":"2015-10-20T10:57:15.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No man, when i say intentional feeding, I mean alistar and amumu with ghost and tp who tpd to midlane turret then ran into enemy jungle to give them two free kills and proceeded to walk into mid lane for the whole game.
