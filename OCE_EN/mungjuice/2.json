In ranked sure, but if I&#039;m just wanting to jam a quick game inbetween study I don&#039;t want to call first and have some kid force me out of the lane I called and play something less fun than imagined for the next 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhat if, say, there was a vague map of the rift somewhere on the screen similar to the team builder one, and upon typing in recognized abbreviations or acronyms; e.g:\r\n\r\n* JG\r\n* TOP\r\n* ADC\r\n* SUPP\r\n* MID\r\n\r\nThe correlating lane is immediately highlighted and your name is assigned to it so that there is indisputable evidence that you indeed called that lane first ?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-26T01:26:16.199+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fact is if an asshole want's a role, he'll take it, like this patch, the chat is synced up, the amount of time's I've gotten top but had a GP just take top anyway is ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}
