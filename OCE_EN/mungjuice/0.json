I play plenty of norm games where the teams have less time to prepare and seem so much more coherent, but virtually every single ranked game I have played is filled with people who are abusive, lag to the point of dying in the first 2 minion waves, instalock champs that don&#039;t fit in the lanes they chose, and just in general toxic players who don&#039;t want to win. \r\n\r\nI don&#039;t understand the culture at all and if there&#039;s something I&#039;m missing or a bug I&#039;m experiencing please tell me, because it feels like whenever I play norms I&#039;m paired up with the people I should be getting paired up with in ranked games haha","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-03T03:11:38.941+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People care more about winning when their rank is at stake, so they get frustrated more easily when things dont go their way and are more likely to flame/troll/afk. Its also easier for trolls to get a reaction out of people when they care about winning more which is presumably why people troll in ranked.\n\nJust make liberal use of the mute button and dont let people tilt you. You also dont lose much for the occasional dodge so if you have 2 people instalocking the same role and everyone arguing before the game even starts, you're probably better off taking the -3lp than playing out a game with a 10% chance of winning","replies":[]},{"poster":"Istehz","date":"2015-07-02T09:08:09.775+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked is basically the HELL of League of Legends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ollypayy","date":"2015-07-02T07:23:31.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's a tip:\nstay away from ranked\n...\nfar \nfar\naway","replies":[]},{"poster":"Your Neighbour","date":"2015-07-04T14:40:54.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play a tank and build cinderhulk on volibear","replies":[]},{"poster":"xXLeetRaz0rxX","date":"2015-07-03T02:22:06.437+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ranked matches have always been like that.

Over my last 3-4 seasons of my ranked experience I have found that I enjoy ranked the most when I am not focusing on my team mates actions/behaviours.\n\nIf you can find joy in focusing on improving your own game then you will enjoy ranked a lot more in win and loss (but of course wins are always better). Don't worry about your team mates too much, both your team and your opponents team are populated from the same player base.","replies":[]}]}
