In a way it would speed up some games since if a team is snowballing they would be able to get 7 items faster. If your far behind your basically trying to stall until you catch up in items. With this your not worrying about catching up to that 6 item kha'zix, lee sin, yasuo, zed your worrying about a 7 ITEM kha'zix, lee sin, yasuo, zed. But then you've got champs like Kayle, Vayne and Veigar who would absolutely love a 7th item because then they're even more terrifying late game.\n\nIn the end I just don't see what it adds. I'm betting this guy just has a champ where he wants an extra item for their build","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-07T05:57:17.540+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support life, I always want more items than I can have :( I agree that 7 would be more problematic than it's worth tho.","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-07T06:13:41.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That was one of the things I was going to mention but didn't for length :P\n\nWho knows how adding another item slot would interact with all the actives in the game. Does it make the actives worth more as now you can have more, or less since you can now stack extra AD/AP/Defense? \n\nIt would be a major shake up that I don't think you could accurately predict the effect of.\n\nEdit: Also I feel that, I always want more items on tanks.
