I just graduated in Germany and I am a 19 years old guy. In my free time I used to play League of Legends and reached before I left to Australia Platin 5 on EUW. So my thought was: \" Why not try to find  somebody with the same interests ( LoL ðŸ˜„) via a thread. \" I think it would be fun to just hang out for a few days, play LoL and meet habitants from Australia ( here are just too many backpackers ðŸ˜„)\r\nSo if you have a place where  I can sleep, a spare computer and an interest in meeting new people let me know. \r\nRegards","replies":[{"poster":"Warau","date":"2014-12-04T06:02:29.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yesh indeed I am.","replies":[]}]}
