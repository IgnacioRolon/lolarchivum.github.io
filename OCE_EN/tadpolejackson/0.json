I like watching LCK because it suites my time zone. but it&#039;s really annoying without casters. There&#039;s two people that talk over the game atm but they don&#039;t actually talk about the game so I end up having to mute them. Are they just making their own stream so they can just do silly voice overs etc or are riot short on casters atm?\r\n\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"TadpoleJackson","date":"2016-05-28T10:47:56.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah ok. Ye it is Doa and monty. I didn't know if they were real casters because they spend most of the game talking about random things inside some fantasy world, and the others in different regions  actually talk about the game. The LPL and the NA one.\n\nThanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-05-26T01:51:23.473+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cant tell if joking about hating doa and monte so much or srs about watching some obscure youtube channel who uploads the VODs without the commentary and thought thats just the way it is","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2016-05-25T18:31:16.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LCK's been using DoA and MonteCristo for a while as the English casters. If you are lucky, you might get PapaSmithy to join them. He's pretty knowledgeable and doesn't do the dumb yank jokes like they do. Having said that, you get used to their banter after a while.\nPersonally I like casters like DeMan (keeps it very simple, but entertaining) combined with guys like Jatt, Kobe, Deficio, Quickshot, Krepo and Joe Miller, but some of those guys are not doing the casting anymore. 2014 worlds had the best team on the job.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-05-25T14:44:08.565+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know all the details but I'll try help out anyway. \n\nDoA and MonteCristo, along with the other LCK casters, are contracted by Riot but aren't actually Riot themselves. Due to their popularity it looks like they are more than likely there to stay. From what they said on air today the English version \"piggybacks\" the main broadcast (whatever that means) which most likely means there will be long periods in which they will have to talk and naturally digress when it comes to the actual game, as they did throughout Spring Split. I personally enjoy their banter, especially in 50+ minute games which there will likely be many, but this likewise means you are probably out of luck if you don't.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-05-25T11:55:32.457+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wot","replies":[]}]}
