Some have stories of valour, of redemption, of honor, but not me. I don&rsquo;t know my story now, I am a failure. All that I lived for has betrayed me, and in doing so I have betrayed those who trusted in me. Uristan stands no longer, my family, my town, all like me in ruins.\r\n\r\n\tNo, this isn&rsquo;t it, once again it seems I am too far ahead of myself, this is all a mess; I&rsquo;ll start at the beginning, the very beginning.\r\n\tValoran, a super continent comprised of various cities and areas filled with great champions, was once in peace. Then the Rune Wars struck with the power of a thousand lightning storms. Chaos everywhere, so much death and destruction - a war that Uristan, my home is, getting through, was getting through. Uristan was wonderous, after the council was reformed we lived in peace. \r\nThe home that I had grown up in was the ancient clock tower that had been there as long as anyone could remember, with a height and ominous  feeling that matching its age. It was an obelisk amongst the other, somewhat more petite buildings, made of ancient Shuriman stone from the old civilisation that once thrived there before the prince was betrayed and the city crumbled like the sands it was built upon. Alas yet again I am off track, let us return to the clock tower. The door was intimidating to those who came up to it, being gnarled and stained, with studs the size of small children holding it up. It&rsquo;s ironic that the building would have been thought to scare away the people that lived in it, my family. Not that many people would consider it that, just an old man, a young boy and a cat. Nonetheless, I loved growing up in that city, once people got to know us the clock tower became loved; it was cleaned up, the cogs in the clock room were ridded of grime from centuries of use, the clock was finally polished, and the whole thing became a new landmark. \r\n\r\n\tWithin the rubble in many of the tower&rsquo;s abandoned rooms we found peculiar instruments and books, most of which was discarded as junk, but what I thought of as treasure. The council, after looking at it and deciding that it was not infact an ancient artifact filled with magic, declared that it was mine. How ecstatic I was that day, I showed my friends when they came around - they were only interested for a few minutes, but to me it was an adventure. So between my schooling, playing with friends, and learning how to keep the clock, I played with the curious things. I never knew why I had a natural affinity with those old things.  Now of course I see my bloodline, those were not just any old person&rsquo;s tools as was thought. The name on the books, he did exist, it was just that he had existed so long ago even the myths of him had been forgotten. Aevus, the temporal adept, one of the most powerful beings in existence, the Wizard who had created this province, naming it after his mother, Verena Uristan. He had once used these things for his magic, and had preserved them for me, over an eon later.\r\n\r\n\tNot that this information is useful anymore, now none of it is, how can it be if there are no people to learn it? Regardless I must continue; during the dry season, when the earth was too scorching to be outside for more than 5 minutes, I started reading. I was at an age where I could read competently, perhaps eight. I made it my mission to devour the contents of those ancient crumbling pages that smelt like time. The covers long dead revealed life that I had never known, countless lives this man had lived, experiments, other civilisations, and most importantly, magic. This was what I had always dreamed of, but not quite what I had envisaged. When reading about this time traveler I discovered what appeared to be a book for an apprentice, except that apprentice was me. The book was the last one we found, and was almost discarded because of how it looked, but this was all just a facade. The pages inside where unlike any of the others I had seen, pristine condition, just as they had been written not a second ago. But the most precious thing was my name, the book had a small message on the inside cover: \r\nFrom Aevus to Zilean, Until we met let this guide you, all will be understood soon enough. \r\n\r\n\tThe next month I spent reading that guide, that is what it turned out to be. It took me until about halfway through before I even understood what it was saying, it was not regular magic, but temporal stuff. I realised how lucky I had been that the council had not taken them to the museum - later I realised that it wasn&rsquo;t luck at all. After secluding myself for a week I had a breakthrough, although it was a small victory, it was the one that made me believe. I could almost see myself I thought, a powerful Wizard, protector of the land, bringing justice to all those who sought to harm to the haven. If I really could have seen I would have been horrified, I would probably have left the place to find help right then and there. What I had done was send a pebble back in time, only to bring it back. I sat there with the small stone in my hand and recited the chant like I had done ten dozen times before, but this time it actually dissapeared, it had removed itself from the room as I had from the city. \r\n\r\nSo I thought of it again, and there it was, almost like a dream - which was a possibility I considered heavily. But no this was the first step down the road of becoming the &lsquo;Chronokeeper.&rsquo; This gave me the energy to continue, as every little test and experiment did, eventually I learnt how to send things into the future as well. I learned how to see different temporal paths, move things into different times, and eventually even myself. This infact was the reason it seemed to have only taken me a month to study the book, in reality that was how long it took me to discover I didn&rsquo;t need to waste anymore time, after all I could really do whatever I wanted with it. What I started doing was one of the tricky, sneaky tactics that I abused a lot in order to study so much undercover. I would live the day as per usual, doing jobs for my Father, Zileas, cleaning, going to school but basically everything I now found boring - even playing games I loved with my friends; however at the end of the day I would go to the top most room, my secret one. \r\n\r\nOnce I was prepared I would go back in time to the start of the day studying, while my past self lived out the day. However this did mean that I aged faster, after all I was living one and a half days for everyone who was living one. So after I started becoming a man almost a year ahead of everyone else, I recognised that I had to pace myself. I began a tally, making sure that I never went too far ahead, if I did, I would go on a hunting trip or something like it, then just skip forwards a few days, or however much ahead I was. It wasn&rsquo;t that I minded being older or younger, I loved having that in my control, it was just that I hated seeing everyone else get older, or younger. This would be incredibly important later, but for now I had a hard time even bringing up the topic.\r\n\r\n\tThis was because of the Pre-Rune Civil Wars, where the ancient, wise but strict council was attacked by a young rebellious group who used magic they had found to wreck havoc. They spun the city into chaos, people founded sides, and great destruction was brought down on buildings, and people. Eventually the war came to a standstill, almost all the buildings were destroyed along with countless artifacts, books, and other precious treasures. The rebels were killed, but so was the council, it seemed that in all their wisdom they had never thought to protect the city from the threats lurking within it. After this magic of all sorts was confiscated, there was so little left of it that the books were put into a museum, a building to serve as a record as what life was, and what it had become. The exhibit also displayed the rebuilding of the city, and the reforming of the community. \r\n\r\nEventually new council was formed in the ashes of the old one, one that really listened to the people, and strove to make the place a better one. After everything was reconstructed they declared that magic would be allowed, schools would be built, academies for people to learn at in safe ways, improving the lives of the citizens, and the protection of the city. But by that stage no one could read the tomes and scripts, they all used various unrecognisable languages and characters - and so it became known that magic in Uristan was dead.\r\n\tI kept my magic secret for such a long time, only now I know that infact they would have been accepting far earlier. But nonetheless I did eventually share my secret, my father was the first one I told. Like the rest he was sceptical, but this I knew, I had planned the full confrontation, had seen the different paths it could take. Of course I chose the safest one, the one that lead to us venturing to the council, and me becoming cherished by the people. I became a force for justice in the city, and although there was a lot of hate, there was also a great deal of love. Slight disappointment came when people learnt that I couldn&rsquo;t read so much of the museums&rsquo; ancient papers, and certainly there was no one else who had the ability to learn my &lsquo;style;&rsquo; of course that took a long time. \r\n\r\nEventually I came to deal with the prisoners, and in knowing how much I hated becoming old, I devised several punishments. Simple things like putting people in temporal locks, so that they couldn&rsquo;t do anything, their punishment was coming out of stasis and seeing everyone else older. That was one thing I learnt early on, people like doing things together, laughing, crying, dying; I see that now more than ever. \r\nSoon the punishments became more extreme, once I had improved my skills the council decided that forcing people back in time was going to be the next punishment, only for the worst ones. They would be put back a day, or a week, or even a month, living out the same days they had spent doing crime in jail, only to be let out the day they were sentenced; the worst part was when they saw themselves being let out, that was when they all broke down.\r\n\r\nOverall life was pretty easy, I was one of the many citizens loved by the city, but the city also created a blanket of security. The people believed that they lived in a safe place, and I became ignorant that anything bad could ever happen in a place so incredible. I did several things to ensure the safety of the town, one of those was seeing. This was based off an old legend where magicians would divine possible futures in oil, I didn&rsquo;t need that to help me. When the time came I would go into the top most part of the clocktower, where like a crow&rsquo;s nest I could see the furthest. Next I entered a temporal state of meditation, looking into the possible futures, looking for dangers the lay in them, and the chances and actions that led to them occurring. This made it easy to prevent any troubles, even things as basic as petty crimes were stopped. Simply give a child a loaf of bread, say hello to a passing stranger, even tiny things like kicking a pebble down the road, or coughing to the left.\r\n\r\n\tHaving this amount of security made everyone so kind, it came a point unknown in history, complete peace. But alas this, like all good things, came to an end. This peak created a veil of security over the people, but one that blinded me. I stopped doing seeings so often, most of the petty crime was gone anyway, and I had never seen any outside threats, it was as if we had been forgotten in the rune-wars that were raging elsewhere. So I slowed down to one per month, then every few months, a year, then I forgot about them; this was my crucial mistake. Because I had not warned that it was very possible that dark knights would be raiding, there were no defences prepared, just the basic guards and weapons we had for dealing with foreigners and arresting criminals. It was ironic, although nonetheless coincidental that at the time I finally remembered to do a seeing, we were attacked, actually, razed to the ground.\r\n\r\n\tI had entered a contemplative state when they came, completely decimating the town, killing and capturing everyone. They pillaged everything, the museum, the bank, even the documents held deep within the council building. That was how they knew to leave the clock tower alone, or perhaps they already knew, either way they certainly were prepared for more of a fight then they got. By the time I looked back it was far too late, this was the worst thing that I had ever discovered. The anguish I felt could be likened only to the sea whose depths were unfathomable, and where darkness resided. It took me a long time to resurface, and a longer time to realise what had happened to me. It seemed that while in a temporal state, experiencing such intense emotion had put me into a new state, I became one with time; a condition I named, &lsquo;Chrono-displasia.&rsquo;\r\n\r\nI will never, and can never die, this I know from experience - foolish, but understandable attempts at the time. Furthermore, I do not age anymore, I discovered this after I awoke an elderly man, perhaps it was just the amount of time I spent in stasis, or perhaps it was time showing me that this was as old as I was ever going to get. Regardless I have come to accept these &lsquo;negatives&rsquo; if they could really be looked at like that. The benefit was immense temporal power, it was this that Aevus described as the ascension - also performed in the Shuriman Desert by Kings and the like in order to reach the epitome of power whether it be physical, magical or anything else. Ancient stories from that place tell of incredible things, such as actually becoming the embodiment of arcane power - I am the embodiment of time. \r\n\r\n\tSo what lies ahead for me, I have seen innumerable paths, but which will take place I do not know. I have seen warriors before the rune wars, some of the elders from the old council, and even common folk being able to wield incredible power, things that in all my seeing I have never even come close to discovering. I have also seen a great congregation of champions from all around Valoran. People of ice and of fire, of wind and of stone, perhaps these are the people I need, perhaps I will need both. Either way my plan is to find the best, and travel back in time with them, and decimate the enemy. I don&rsquo;t need to worry about creating paradox&rsquo;s either, I will simply go down a different path that had the same outcome, thus saving my people and still being as powerful as I am. However I need to find if this will even work, for that I must meet Aevus who I think is waiting in the beginning, before any of this fighting, before anything at all. \r\n\r\nFirst I must overcome these emotions, this deep shame I feel, the guilt of a thousand criminals, all the people I ever imprisoned could never has done as much damage to the city, as the city&#039;s destruction has done to my heart. I never saw the job of protector as a burden, but I can see now why I was warned so severely. Like all ways, we see things so clearly in hindsight, luckily for me this doesn&rsquo;t have to be for long.","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T11:01:31.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is nothing in the world better than writing about something you love, and to love what you've written.
