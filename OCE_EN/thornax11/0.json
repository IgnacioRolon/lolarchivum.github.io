Some may say that he doesn&#039;t deserve a re-work, after all, he has positive win rate and has around a %2.5 win rate. \r\nNonetheless, he still has a lot of problems, some of these are:\r\n-\tHis lore could be worked into his kit better. His lore is of a powerful temporal Wisard, whose whole town is destroyed. Because of this, and him not being able to defend - he is incredibly sad. But none of this is shown in his kit. Although I haven&#039;t been able to incorporate this to a great deal, and even if it is never really incorporated before, at least incorporating into quotes could be something to consider.\r\n-\tHis kit is quite boring, his lore is also pretty boring. His lore is extremely vague, and although this leaves room to change, and expand on it, this should be done now. His kit, in being so basic makes him pretty boring to play, only really having one combo: E,Q,W,E,Q, and then chucking in the ult when someone is going to die.\r\n-\tOnly two abilities scale and they scale ridiculously well. This makes building him feel kinda pointless, personally, I find it silly how - if someone wanted to go full talk utility, they could. His slow would still be incredibly powerful, and his stun would be the same, just with less damage. \r\n-       He is currently a very weak support, and even worse as a mid laner, this is because he can&#039;t really do a lot because of his kit.\r\nAlso, note that the ability stats are under the assumption that his base stats remain somewhat the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\nPassive:\tTime in a Bottle\r\n Zilean stores time as Experience. \r\nWhen he has enough Experience to finish an ally&#039;s level, he can right-click them to impart it. Zilean receives as much Experience as he gives. Cannot be used in combat.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\nPassive:\t~~Chronoshift / Chronofreeze~~\tTemporal Tick\t\r\n~~Zilean marks an allied champion (like kindred&rsquo;s passive) with Chronoshift. For 15 seconds if the marked champion would:~~\r\n-\t~~Die instead they are revived (basically ult) regaining half the health that they were on when they were marked. OR~~\r\n-\t~~Be reduced to less than 5% max health instead they enter a stasis (Zhonas) for 2.5 seconds~~\r\n~~Cannot be used in combat. 180 sec cooldown. ~~\r\n\r\nEver fifth spell Zilean casts reduces the cooldown of his other spells by 10 seconds (5 for ultimate)\r\n\r\nThe reason I changed this initially was because I felt Zilean needed to be way stronger, and that his ult didn&rsquo;t serve him justice as a temporal mage. However after thinking about this a bit more I now think actually I was wrong and a passive like that would be far too op, and would be one of the focuses of the champion (which as a passive is not something I really want &ndash; because it would look bad from a development perspective. One of the main reasons I don&rsquo;t really like Zilean&rsquo;s kit currently is because his w really does nothing. Well it is a necessary spell currently, and it does fit the turn back time theme. But it is very weak. Because of this I was going to just rework that spell, but I think having it as a simple passive is much more clean and efficient. I don&rsquo;t like the old passive because it doesn&rsquo;t really suit Zilean; he is supposed to be a temporal mage, and I get the time is experience thing but it feels really weak (even if it&rsquo;s not really). Also by incorporating his w into this instead his kit can easily become much more complex. \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\nQ:\t\tTime Bomb\t\t\r\n Cost: 60/65/70/75/80 Mana \r\nRange: 900\r\nTosses a bomb to target area that sticks to units that come near it (prioritizes Champions). It detonates after 3 seconds, dealing area of effect damage. If a Time Bomb is detonated early by another Time Bomb, it also stuns enemies.\r\nZilean tosses a time-delayed bomb to a location. The bomb sticks to the first unit which comes within a small area around it (prioritizes Champions). After 3 seconds it detonates, dealing 75/115/165/230/300 (+90% Ability Power) magic damage to all surrounding enemies. Placing two bombs on a unit detonates the first bomb early, stunning all enemies in the blast for 1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\nQ:\tTime Bomb\r\nRange:\t900\r\nCost:\t30/35/40/45/50\r\nFirst cast:\t Zilean throws a time bomb projectile that attaches to nearby minions and champions, it explodes after 3 seconds dealing 70/85/100/115/130 + 0.6% A.P. as magic damage.\r\nCost:\t20/25/30/35/40\r\nSecond cast\tZilean throws a time bomb that explodes upon impact, however if the first bomb lands on the second, the first is also set off. The bomb deals, 20/40/60/80/100 + 0.8% A.P. as magic damage. \r\n~~Second bomb also gives AOE stun for 0.5 secs~~\r\n\r\nI still think that the time bomb idea is a good one, and cleverly designed, however it is his most spammed ability &ndash; and uses up a significant amount of mana early, especially when combined with his w for the stun. Although I removed the w for the passive I still think that the double bomb idea is a great one. Because of this I thought he could do a recast that made him burstier. This meant the second bomb will not be wasted simply for a stun (currently happens). Additionally, I removed the stun because it seemed too op (as this is now going to be a cheaper costing, more spam-able ability) and because it means I can incorporate the stun in somewhere else.\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\nW:\tRewind\r\nCost: 35 Mana \r\nRange: Self\r\nZilean can prepare himself for future confrontations, reducing the cooldowns of his other basic abilities.Reduces Zilean&#039;s other basic spell cooldowns by 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\nW:\tTime Is Fluid\r\n~~Zilean shoots a beam of time in a line dealing damage to the first enemy hit, and reducing the cooldown of his other spells by 2 secs.~~\r\nZilean shoots a bolt of temporal essence slowing the first enemy hit by 20/30/40/50/60%, and {That amount}% - 10% for each additional enemy hit, this deals 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 + 0.7% A.P. to the enemy champions hit. \r\n~~This also speeds up the first allied champion by {}% and {}% - 10% for each additional ally hit.~~ Furthermore, if an enemy champion is hit while they have a time bomb on them an AOE stun is created in the bomb&rsquo;s damage area for 1/1.2/1.3/1.4/1.5 secs.\r\n\r\nThe first idea was removed because it doesn&rsquo;t really fit Zilean, and the reset has been incorporated into his passive. So I still wanted the old AOE stun that Zilean has and thought that it would be an interesting mechanic to have the spells interact with each other. Also the first E idea was a bit op, so I basically just nerfed it a bit and put it in here.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\nE:\tTime Warp\r\n Cost: 50 Mana \r\nRange: 700\r\nZilean bends time around any unit, decreasing an enemy&#039;s Movement Speed or increasing an ally&#039;s Movement Speed for a short time.\r\nZilean increases an allied champion&#039;s Movement Speed, or slows an enemy champion, by 40/55/70/85/99% for 2.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nNew:\r\nE:\t~~Velocity Adjustment~~\t\tTemporal Adept\r\n~~Zilean conjures a wall of temporal essence (like Karthus W) that when passed through: speeds allied champs by {}% the boost is reduced by {a}% for each allied champion that passes through it, but is increased by {a}% for each enemy champion that passes through it.~~\r\n\r\nPassive: Zilean gains 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 move speed per level\r\n\tZilean gains stacks of {move speed like static shiv etc.} \r\nActive:\tAt any time Zilean may cast Temporal Adept to consume all current M.S. stacks, he then gains %M.S. equal to half the stacks consumed + 0.5% A.P. However once Zilean reaches 100 stacks, upon activation he grants an A.O.E. (bigger than q range) zone that gives all allied champions in the zone 50+0.5% A.P. Movement speed. \r\n\r\nIf a buff is needed, could consider giving bonus attack speed/damage.\r\nSo I removed the first one because it was kind of OP and its now been shifted into his W, I still really like Zilean&rsquo;s ability to speed up allied champions though as it&rsquo;s something quite unique (I think) to him &ndash; and something he is known for. \r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal:\r\nR:\tChronoshift\r\n Cost: 125/150/175 Mana \r\nRange: 900\r\nZilean places a protective time rune on an allied champion, teleporting the champion back in time if they take lethal damage.\r\nZilean marks himself or an allied champion with a protective time rune for 5 seconds. If the target would take lethal damage, they are instead transported back in time, regaining 600/850/1100 (+200% Ability Power) Health.\r\n\r\nNew: (kinda)\r\nR:\t~~Withdrawal from the Future~~\tChronoshift\r\n~~Passive\t\tZilean marks an enemy champion (again like Kindred) while they are marked they gain a temporal ghost that follows their position 4 seconds ago. Cannot be cast in combat.~~\r\n~~Active\t\tZilean uses temporal magic to teleport the marked champion to their shadow, dealing them {} damage and {}% AP. Zilean must have vision of them. Range 2000~~\r\nZilean marks himself or an allied champion with a protective time rune for 5 seconds. If the target would take lethal damage, they are instead transported back in time, regaining 600/850/1100 (+200% Ability Power) Health, and knocking back all enemy champions 300 units.\r\n\r\nSo yeah I decided to go with the old ultimate because of a couple of things: firstly I changed his passive that has this kinda thing in it. Secondly this spell suits Zilean really well and is something I really like about him. The only problem that I really had with it is that it is pointless half the time, and although it could be argued that this gives him a higher skill ceiling, really it&#039;s just annoying. So I had a couple of ideas, the first being that the target is only targetable by Zilean. This is because a trick that is usually used is to put two bombs on the marked champ. This stuns everyone when the ally revives; so by allowing them to be targetable, this can be done easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, I had a great time thinking of this, even if it doesn&#039;t amount to anything.\r\n{{champion:26}} Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-25T18:25:29.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only thing I think needs changing is Zilean's passive given how apparent the ineffectiveness regardless of its use really is.\n\nThough about his Q being burstier, his base damage on level 5 bombs is 300 with a 0.9 AP ratio.
