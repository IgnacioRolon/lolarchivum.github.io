I&#039;m looking for an  ranked team (** > of Preferably Asians<**).\n\nI&#039;ve arranged the champions I play in Mid & Support in the order of my skill with them and personal enjoyment level.\nPreferred Mid champs: {{champion:34}} {{champion:90}}{{champion:4}}  \nPreferred Support champs:{{champion:267}}{{champion:26}} {{champion:16}}  {{champion:25}}{{champion:53}}  \nPreferred Jungle champs (Still experimenting): {{champion:62}} {{champion:35}} {{champion:113}} {{champion:111}}  \n\n> Requirements:  \n* Be respectful to other team members.\n* Don&#039;t act like 13 y/o&#039;s and actually be older than 13.\n* Can play their respective role.\n* Can play at a decent skill level (At least silver V+)\n* Relaxed  but still try their best every game.\n\nShort summary of me:\n\nI&#039;m 18 and from Australia,  I worked my way up from Bronze 5. I&#039;m a pretty chill guy, I don&#039;t usually lose my temper unless a laner keeps repetitively dying after giving them advice or camping their lane.  As a mid I always ward my lane both sides as well as playing safe early unless I know I can secure a kill, once I&#039;ve won I roam.  As a support I heavily ward, however I may be hesitant to follow you into fights if I think it&#039;s too risky.\n\nIf you are interested in recruiting me, than leave a message of your team name and how your team operates.\n\nMany thanks{{champion:201}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ekrah","date":"2015-04-21T17:25:06.581+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Preferred Support champs:{{champion:267}}\n\nNami isn't a support though?????","replies":[]}]}
