I think people should just wait because they are still trying to find the problem and I think they are very nice for telling us whats actually happening instead of being a secretive company and tell us nothing when the servers are down.","replies":[{"poster":"ButterTits","date":"2017-08-30T02:08:13.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're out of your mind if you think Riot exercises any level of transparency to their consumers.","replies":[{"poster":"Surk","date":"2017-08-30T02:10:12.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ButterTits,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EPYAIhxZ,comment-id=00010000,timestamp=2017-08-30T02:08:13.335+0000)\n>\n> You&#x27;re out of your mind if you think Riot exercises any level of transparency to their consumers.\n\nExplain to me how they aren't transparent?","replies":[{"poster":"ButterTits","date":"2017-08-30T03:31:40.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find recent (the last 2 years) figures surrounding their player base, player behaviour punishments, revenue, pro player decisions, team organisations decisions (especially Tainted Minds) or anything else surrounding the internals of their company and game/s as well as their parent organisation.\n\nThe best we get is a Reddit AMA post saying a whole bunch of vague explanations.
