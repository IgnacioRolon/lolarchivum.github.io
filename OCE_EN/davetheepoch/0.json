Whats the deal? Normal&#039;s are fun so is ARAM, so why all the hate in Ranked? People claiming intentional feeding go away.   \r\n\r\nThe problem as i can see it is i get matched with gold and silver ranked players who are more skilled than myself and think because i died i&#039;m just feeding. Maybe the fact is i&#039;m not OP enough for them to the level that they play on. I thought this season i would give ranked a try but in my opinion i&#039;m just going to give it a miss.\r\n\r\nI thought by now the community would understand that there are players that like myself play this game for fun and enjoyment, we like to ARAM and collect skins and characters. We read the Lore and understand the backstories. We want to experience all aspects of this fantastic game and ranked is a part of that. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up in a ranked match with an unranked player don&#039;t give them hate and negative feedback just ask what they were trying and help them out with their build and what strategy your using so they understand. \r\n\r\nLearning the ranked system is hard. I hope they change the matching and try to match unranked with each other first but i guess we all want to play with the best and be the best.","replies":[]}
