League will probably be dead in 10 years, or a relic of the past with a small nostalgic community, like TF2.\n\nDespite visual and gameplay overhauls, as games and gaming culture evolve and move forward, league will slowly become a dated game. We're getting less new players into the community, more players are leaving, Riot is beginning to pump out new skins at a massively accelerated rate to try to earn money whilst it's still very profitable, we're also seeing league comics as a way for the League of Legends universe to try to branch out and immortalize itself. The boards are dying, the league reddits, whilst still massively populated, are slowing down compared to a few years ago at their peak. We're seeing less new league content creators and streamers, with their communities shrinking.\n\nHowever, whilst league is dying, if I had to put it in the terms of a human, League would be in it's 40s. The peak has passed and the decline has begun to set in, but League of Legends isn't isn't quite yet out of tricks, and it may yet surprise us for a while longer. Whilst some of our friendlists have become more sparse with frequent players, and we begin sorting friends who've been afk for months into cemetery folders, there are still many friends, both old and new, who are still raring to go for the climb each new season.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DCLXVImperator","date":"2019-02-05T19:57:41.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol died in 2014, birthed in 2012, and was never good","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jonius7","date":"2019-02-04T23:59:24.703+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot wants to etch League of Legends more and more into mainstream culture, I don't see League dying for real past 10-15 years. \n\nRealistically, though, the playerbase will be smaller, or you have more people watching LoL but not playing it. The new player experience, however, would cut off much potential for growth, unless Riot change that drastically, which they seem to be trying to figure out how to do.\n\nThe eventual problem of having too many champions is going to be very apparent down the road. Past 150 champions I'd think we have too many champions, and we are at 143 now. In 10-15 years that is going to be 180+. Imagine starting a new game with that many champions to try to learn. But for Riot, a new champion is one of their main ways of \"adding something new\" to the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2019-01-29T04:33:40.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"League still has a good decade or more of life left in it (unless bad management screws it over).\n\nBattle royals will never appeal to a game audience that prefers strategy games.\n\nI would suspect in a decade its audience will be older (many having played for 10-20 years).\n\n\nMOBAs are also very time investment heavy to get into, meaning the current audience is fairly dedicated, unlike an FPS, where its very easy to pick up a new game once you have the core skills.\n\nMOBAs that have features better designed to avoid raging and encourage teamwork (like absence of kill/assist distinctions) are likely to take more of the market as time goes on, especially of new players entering the field.\n\nUsually, when players say a game is dying, they simply mean their friends are now playing something else, even if the games numbers have doubled.  League is a mature game, it wont grow much, but is likely to have decent queue times and playerbase in a decade, even if its half the size it is now (which seems likely).","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-29T10:20:28.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you get that the sheer population is actually shrinking right? people constantly make new accounts and smurfs, so the gross number of 'players' seems higher, but the net population isn't what it used to be.","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2019-01-30T01:03:51.393+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's where his last little bit \" even if its half the size it is now (which seems likely).\" will come into it. \n\nAccounts will shrink but no so much the players for at least another 5 years.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-01-29T01:59:51.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This game will die in 5 years, mobas are done\n\nWith battle Royales just being better overall, plus riot are just running this game into the ground, have been since season 4 there is no way this game will live 10 years.\n\nGame styles come in waves, one year its RPGs. the next its FPS' same with Moba's and Battle Royale","replies":[]}]}
