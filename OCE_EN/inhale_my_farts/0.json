I just wish this was punished more frequently than in game chat punishment.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-07T07:59:20.741+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason you get what is essentially an automated response from support is because player support cannot and will not give you *any* information, implicit or explicit, about another players account. This doesn't mean your report has been ignored, just that your part is done, and there is nothing that support is allowed to tell you beyond \"thank you\".\n\nI can say that typically boosting punishments follow two tiers:\n\n1. 14 day ban + loss of all current and previous ranked rewards.\n2. Permanent ban.\n\nThere may well be nuance to it behind the scenes, but they're not the kind of punishments that get talked about a lot, since you can't convincingly appeal them and can't argue intent.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Spiral Zetsu","date":"2019-10-07T06:52:34.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Why are you trying to get your own friend banned?\n\nIf your friend is less important to you than the colour of a border that doesn't even affect you, in a video game, I don't think you are actually their friend...","replies":[]}]}
