Back in season 5 when pick order was a thing, more often than not if you were last pick you got lumped with the support role. And you either dodged or learnt how to play the role. It's not a hard role to play, but you just have to be thinking about \"SUPPORTING\" your team. You aren't there to get farm or kills or do a bunch of damage. That's not the role. The role requires you to establish vision control, communicate with your team while they are busy and perhaps miss certain things happening, and also peeling for your carries (the ones in your team that are doing the most damage). Damage output is secondary to those things. Even Likkrit builds a sightstone on Brand support, because he knows the role. He might still do a lot of damage, but he still plays his role firstly. \n\nIt's a selfless role and a good skillset to learn. it also teaches you how the game really works. You will understand more about the other roles by playing them, which makes you a better overall player.\n\nMany players try to one trick their way to higher levels, but then they hit a brick wall. An example of this is the NA player Hashshinshin. This guy will not get picked up by a pro team until he actually starts to understand how the game really works. (check LS's videos with IWillDominate on youtube for more explanation). He may be a Jax god, but overall he's a very average player that made it to challenger by playing one role. Perhaps if he played Jungle more due to autofill he also would become a better player.","replies":[]}]}
