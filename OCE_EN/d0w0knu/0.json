Though for feedback I would say the head of anivia could be better animated or for the style to be more closer with that of most league of legends in  game champions and skins. Also the whole skin (including abilities and anivia) or look abit too cartoonish in the game, they don't look very natural on the map if you put it into contrast. Even though this it's still pretty cool and you've done a really good job.","replies":[{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-06-30T11:17:21.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahah, yeah, I noticed too when putting it all together, I worked with the wrong background colour which turned most shades awful. I'm not the type to draw, so I'm pretty content with just expressing the idea, I ultimately didn't mind the flaws in how I did it. Since this is of course my first drawing, I'm hoping myself that I'd improve over time, meaning I'm saving my best ideas for last +.+ Patience is but one tedious task, but necessary in every form of education. {{champion:26}} {{champion:26}} {{champion:26}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-01T02:05:47.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem i see with the skin is how Grey it is, to the point where it somewhat blends into the environment.\n\nAlso when the wings are just straight the skin looks.... odd (E cast animation where the wing is folded.)","replies":[{"poster":"D0W0knu","date":"2015-07-01T02:37:26.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every drawing aside from the topleft are shadow-like sketches, no finelining or colouring, it is only meant to represent Anivia's \"whereabouts\" because the focus is the skills.
