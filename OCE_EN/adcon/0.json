WTF is going on?!?!\r\nI can download anything else just fine, even the mac installer for LoL, but the bloody windows installer just won't download. I've even tried downloading as other regions, no luck. For some odd reason the download will just halt when it reaches 3.5mb of 27mb. I've restarted my computer, disabled firewalls, other browsers blah blah, you name it. Is there any reason this could be happening? \r\nI've only had this problem since yesterday and I've given up, HELP PLS ","replies":[{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-09T13:11:21.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you have tried downloading league from\nhttps://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en/signup/redownload\n\nDo you have the issue downloading it from another computer on the same network?","replies":[{"poster":"Adcon","date":"2014-12-10T03:21:12.645+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, the same problem on two other computers on the same network. I just don't understand why it only blocks this particular download, anything else will download just like normal except for any windows LoL installer.
