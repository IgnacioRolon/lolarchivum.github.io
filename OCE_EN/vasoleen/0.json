I have a new account I&#039;m leveling up with friends and I have 3 boxes..... I have had 4 in total and have had only FIVE key fragments.... Every game I get honoured basically, as I am the support who carries their carry...  I am not spinning tall tales here, I am actually genuinely confused and slightly &quot;what is the deal here lads&quot; in this ridiculous situation....   Honored almost every game, not just by duo&#039;s as I play many games solo.... Something is not mathematically correct and the algorithms must surely be adjusted...  Previously we had far too many key fragments, and now that are almost rarer than chests...   Please address this issue.\n\nThank you in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Canc","date":"2018-01-28T22:42:46.084+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have 11 chests with 0 key atm...\n\ni found i usually can craft 1 key every 2 weeks??? \n\nNot to mention havent heard anyone getting to honour lvl 3 yet","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-26T02:24:35.099+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Later in the season, you'll be honour 5 (unless you're naughty), and be getting more keys than chests.\nJust save them up and it'll sort itself out in time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-26T01:32:53.681+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are tied to the new Honor level ups.\n\nSo be prepared to get a lot less unless you carry every single game singlehandedly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-01-26T04:49:56.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I get a key fragment almost every time I log in, got one each time that I logged in yesterday.\n\nBoxes are far harder to come by, not getting them when I get an S is pure bitch.","replies":[]}]}
