Especially if you get to late game with him.\n\nBut the fun instantly stops when you get to lane against Zed, Yasuo, Talon or any champ who can get fast inside your inner circle of Stars.\nIf that happens you got 3 options.\n\n1.) Flash\n2.) Ult\nand if those 2 are on CD:\n3.) Die\n\nTwo suggestions that wouldnt make him OP and still he had some counterplay to those.\n\n1.) Let him Detonate Q instantly after you cast it.\n\nSo those assasins have to wait for a window when his q is on CD.\n\n2.) Do not draw back his stars when he gets Stunned/Silenced/etc.\n\nHis gameplay designer once stated it doesnt seem right that a big mighty star dragon can hide in brushes and sneak on their prey. So they made his stars visible in brushes, which is indeed annoying but i get the point. At least you cant be directly targeted. \n\nBut then in my opinion its also not right that a stun can stop those mighty stars from orbiting. \n\n\nYour Opinion on this guys?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-04-29T09:44:44.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=xXlikeicareXx,realm=EUW,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=dhnahEER,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-04-29T07:51:18.197+0000)\nBut the fun instantly stops when you get to lane against Zed, Yasuo, Talon \n\n^ Doesn't this always stop the fun? no matter who you are?","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-04-29T08:45:00.857+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"His Q is supposed to be able to insta-detonate (read the champ reveal). its always been a bug that he cant do it.
