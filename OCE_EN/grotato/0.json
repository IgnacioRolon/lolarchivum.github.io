The 4 of us reported him for abuse and stop playing for the day (Sad thing is that our {{champion:11}} got punished for afk&#039;ing). It has been 3 days since that, and we were just put in a game with that horrible person, He wasnt punished at all, and he was just as toxic as last time.\n\nHow has he not been punished at all?\n\nthis isnt the only time this has happened. i have run into people like this all the time, so does the reporting system on Oceanic actually work? or has riot still put off making a working system?","replies":[]}
