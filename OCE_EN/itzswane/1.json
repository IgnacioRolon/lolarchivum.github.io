So i could attach photos of some of it... Its really getting beyond me. I end up losing 2/3&#039;s of my games due to this early toxicity.","replies":[{"poster":"Belrick","date":"2016-06-04T08:45:39.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Frankly i am sick to death of all the troll picks.\nSo many champs are obviously bad picks, off meta or never meta or simply don't fit the team.\n\nThis should not be happening in ranked period. I don't care what people type in chat, it's what they do that frustrates me. Riot needs to start banning toxic players from ranked.","replies":[]}]}
