I&#039;m only posting this here because I&#039;m not even allowed to create a ticket relating to something of the sort.  I play on the OCE server at a silver level and i don&#039;t expect things like &quot;loss Prevented&quot; to exist but i still think i should get some redemption for having to lose 20 LP FREELY.\n\nDue to Naming and Shaming rules i can&#039;t show the name of the player and submit it to tickets because they don&#039;t allow it.\n\nIf somebody would be to as kindly contact me in anyway to tell me if i could deal with this problem or a resolution. \n\nThanks\n- Swane","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-16T00:34:26.901+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nYour best course of action in cases such as these is to use the ingame report feature on the end of game screen.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ItzSwane","date":"2016-10-15T03:36:01.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also, i know this seems stupid with S7 coming up relatively soon but i'm slowly getting sick and tired of this common trend affecting me weekly and there seems to be no FIX yet.
