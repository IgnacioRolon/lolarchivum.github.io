Aram was better, I managed to find a game just shy of 5 minutes. Leaving the only decent queue time in bots, which is pretty boring and grants almost no XP, making the journey to find regular 5v5's a very drab grind fest\r\nAre there no new players on OCE? Or are they all just bots? And if so... could we get an option to opt into getting matched with higher leveled people? I'd rather get wrecked then vs bots for another 300 games...","replies":[{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2019-05-01T10:08:55.364+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The playerbase numbers are low. The number of players that play at a certain time are low.\nThe number of queues is probably one too many.\n\nARAM, Ranked Solo, Ranked Flex, Flavour of the Month Game, Draft Pick, Blind Pick.\n\nIn my opinion delete blind pick. If players want that they can do custom games. Put all the new accounts playing draft and give them access to all summoners and runes at level 1. You want new players to actually understand the game, not make their experience a fiesta. By deleting this queue, other queue times will be lowered as well.","replies":[]}]}
