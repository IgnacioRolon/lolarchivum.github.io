It has returned.","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, after not having a firewall error for the longest time, I've gotten it again for the first time. The problem is, unlike every time I got this last year, I couldn't just reconnect a little later. I was playing premade 4. Me and one friend of mine both got firewall error, both couldn't reconnect, both tried the solution on the forums offered by player support (i believe), and still could not reconnect. I don't understand the issue here and why it would suddenly come up out of nowhere. No matter how many times I attempt to reconnect, nothing. Same goes for my friend. The other 2 people I was playing with had no issue here, and the only similarity at all I can think of between me and the friend sharing this issue is that we're both with Optus, but I don't see why that should be an issue.","replies":[{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2015-03-03T23:51:31.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're investigating an issue that may be giving a firewall error at the moment - check out[ this thread ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/IOuWqG7B-troubleshooting-connection-issues-4032015) for more information.","replies":[]}]}
