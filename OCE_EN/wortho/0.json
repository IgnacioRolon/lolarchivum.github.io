Regardless of this, I reconnected to the game and finished the game to completion (might I add that the game details reflect this correctly and there was no ranked penalty for dodging). \r\n\r\nI noticed a low priority queue for the next game I joined however I thought it might&#039;ve just been for 1 match, turns out it is 5 which equates to roughly an hour and a half of penalised queue time for a game that I completed, would you guys be able to investigate implementing measures which don&#039;t persecute the innocent please?\r\n\r\nCheers.","replies":[{"poster":"nusantara","date":"2016-05-10T05:02:56.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"PS: messy English + grammar.\n\n\nfrom my understanding, the leaver buster system recording our afk time every single games we played .  System Accumulate the afk time . When the time reach/equal to the state of punishment, low prioirty match given. So , leaving or afking in 1 match doesnot make you punish. Cleary you been afk in more than 1 games. The system will give the punishment faster if more player reporting in the end of game. \n\n\n( my experiment - leaver buster , start recording if we afk for 60 second - 180 second )\n(The system will reduce the accumulation time when we finish 1 match and another without afk  )\n\n\nsummary : game start, emergency  - if player afk for 3 min or 5 min, then player comeback ,player continue playing,  player carry the game,  the player team win , - leaverbuster still got you, recorded, and ready to punish the player . \n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}
