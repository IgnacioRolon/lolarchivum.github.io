After the EULA appears and I click &quot;I agree&quot;, it takes another 5-10 Minutes for the second one to appear after that is done, it will just stay on the client not  launching the login screen, this can last anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour.","replies":[{"poster":"Mirashedge SD","date":"2015-04-02T00:27:48.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My computer specs are as follows:\nIntel Core i7-4900MQ CPU @ 2.80 GHz (8 Processors)\n32.0 GB Ram\nWindows 8.1 x64\nNvidia GeForce GTX 780M\nISP: Optus","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-02T06:11:35.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please use the \"Reply\" function of the boards, otherwise I won't get notification of your response.
