I was so excited to try out all of them from Ekko&#039;s {{champion:245}}, to Katarina&#039;s {{champion:55}}, but the one that stuck the most was Ashe&#039;s.{{champion:22}} This new Ashe skin has a great concept but I feel that the skin was rushed or in other words lack of detail. Sure it has the hoody changing particle whenever you are near your towers or in your base. But its a concept similar to the glasses on Neon Vi skin {{champion:254}}. After that, the abilities particles just seem too, monotonous. The concept of changing Ashe&#039;s bird to a drone was a great idea. But then everything is just a blue colored mess. The ult looks dull with just a big arrow of a different color. I know making skins is hard but at least a little more effort would be appreciated. Maybe you can have the ult arrow vary from shades of blue the further it travel. Or that the arrow leaves a trail of ice while traveling. Of course it will not slow any enemies that walk through it as we are talking of a skin, skins cannot give you special buffs.\r\n\r\nBut you understand what I&#039;m saying. This is just my feed back.\r\nIn conclusion the skin has a great character design but the abilities just lack of detail.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for reading. \r\nSummoner Name \r\nCLCBTA\r\na.k.a \r\nChristopher.","replies":[{"poster":"Abyss Feeder","date":"2016-07-13T12:50:15.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree! I really hope riot do read things like this and do alter the pbe skins... I really want to get project ashe but it is quite rusty. Its an ultimate skin!!!! I'd really like to see a more detailed recall animation, cleaner particles (particularly on the hood transition), some more creative effects and just a better quality outcome. Riot want us to buy $18 skins? They've gotta work for it.. {{champion:22}}","replies":[{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-07-13T20:45:11.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's a legendary skin and since it was only just added a day ago, they still have time to fix up anything, but I doubt it will get much changes.","replies":[]}]}]}
