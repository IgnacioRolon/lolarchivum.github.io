I&#039;m currently in my last year of school and I&#039;ll be graduating this year. What I would like to know is, what things or what would you guys recommend for me to start a career in Voice acting. I know you need some decent equipment too to record and I would appreciated if you game me some recommendations. Anybody including the community that would like to help me is welcome to give suggestions!\r\n\r\nThank you once more Riot, and everyone in the comments.","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-01-16T08:13:00.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well 1st of; HOW talented are u?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jason","date":"2018-01-15T15:04:36.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot isn't overly likely to help you ( on the OCE sub anyway ) due to most of their game and cinematic efforts being handled in NA, or being outsourced.\n\nThankfully, I can help.\n\n**Equipment.**\n\nYou don't need to have a pro recording area and sound board to get started. The most basic and inexpensive setup involves your Computer, a Blue Yeti Microphone, and Audacity. As you get more and more into your passions you can upgrade, but honestly you can produce pretty high quality audio with just that.  I've made Ad reads, songs, and character dialogue with such a setup so far.\n\n**Skills.**\n\nYour voice is like a muscle. You can make it stronger with hard exercises, you can make it more adaptable with dexterity exercises, and learn styles and accents with roleplaying exercises. You should try and practice training your voice as many different ways as possible. Learning complex songs ( low barritones, high pitches, long notes, quick rap ) is a great and fun way to practice. You can also benefit from Acting, Drama, Shoutcasting, anything that involves good projection of your voice. Hell, working in customer service was a great thing for me. Talking for 9 hours a day, and needing to be charismatic to a varying audience and being paid for it is a pretty nice setup.\n\n**Early Days.**\n\nThere's thousands of people in Voice Acting, as a hobby, or to be professional. Because honestly, it's just talking. It's not like playing the Violin, or blindfold rubix cube solving. So, there will be a lot of competition. Apply for as many roles as you could see yourself doing. Using public applications sites such as Casting  Call Club, Behind the Voice Actor, or general boards like Reddit or Craigslist. You're unlikely to make any money starting off. Just build on your contacts, profile, and published work.\n\n**Management.**\n\nEventually, if you stick to your guns, you'll start to build a name for yourself. Online personas are easy work, as long as you're not expecting anyone to pay you or take you seriously. If you are, then you need to make sure you start following proper work relation guidelines with your clients and fans, and maintain a healthy social media presence. You can also devise an actual personality to go along with this. Mr. Positive, the edgy one, the expressive one, whatever you identify with.\n\n**And then?**\n\nIf you get to the stage where all of this is useless information, you should be surrounded by peers and colleagues who can show you the way, and help level up your career.\n\nBest of luck, you're going to need it.\n\n~J","replies":[]},{"poster":"KnevDog","date":"2018-01-15T10:13:41.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-15T11:00:11.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knevets,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=mnYnV0Lj,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2018-01-15T10:13:41.528+0000)\n>\n> 2.
