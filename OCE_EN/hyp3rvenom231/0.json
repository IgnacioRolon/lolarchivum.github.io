I have taken a liking towards{{champion:11}}  but i feel I need to explore my boundaries. I bought Jax as reccommended by a friend but i really do not understand how to use him. Riven and Yasuo are interesting picks but i need something to cover my needs in the short-term.\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Wean","date":"2017-02-13T03:01:42.629+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Garen would be one of my top picks.\nAatrox would also be a handy champion.\nYorick, Illaoi, and Darius are good top laners as well.\nSince you are new to League of Legends, I suggest you try Darius, Garen, Aatrox, Fiora,  Irelia, Jax, Jarvan IV.\nI would not recommend you to try Riven or Yasuo at this stage, they are both difficult to use champions. Riven is easier to use than Yasuo, but you may find that she's not easy to master.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-10-12T10:48:54.935+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you need any help, reply to the message, add me in game, I have plenty of tips to share!\nAlso, if you're interested in Yasuo, I'm a Yasuo main :)","replies":[{"poster":"Hyp3rVenom231","date":"2017-02-12T09:03:49.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey bro... lol i was reading this from art a year ago.

So on then you wont to get that lv 3 and e w q that is the most basic combo with jax as his e blocks all basic attacks and allows him to win 90% of top lane match ups. \nBut to tell you the truth he works beter in the jg as wen you get a sated he gets insane with just a {{item:3153}} as he will do % hp damage, ad and ap damage as his ult does I think 100 160 or 80 and then 200 magic damage every 2 hits that mite be off with the magic damage but its close.\nI hope this helped ow and if you do go tryind don't get {{item:3153}} first item get a {{item:3031}} {{item:3046}} then bork aka {{item:3153}} as you will have 90% crit at 20 min if you don't miss cs and get 2 kills makes you insane to deal with.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Torea2","date":"2015-10-11T20:40:15.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Play Darius\n\nHes broken as fuck","replies":[]}]}
