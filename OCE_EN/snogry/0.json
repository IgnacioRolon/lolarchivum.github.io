I&#039;ve got my windows up to date, .net&#039;s all up to date etc, so i ran a dependency walker on lol and it came back with... a lot. I&#039;ve included a link to a list of the dll&#039;s it&#039;s telling me I&#039;m missing, but i find it hard to believe there&#039;s that many missing that weren&#039;t included in the window&#039;s updates or rolled out in the app by Riot themselves. Does anyone know if there&#039;s a way to fix this? Or if there&#039;s maybe had a zip containing all or some of them so I don&#039;t have to go download them one by one (which would take hours) that&#039;d be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRory","replies":[]}
