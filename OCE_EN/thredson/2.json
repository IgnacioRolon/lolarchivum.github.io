I would even go so far as to say that the majority of people who earn it so far have not yet received it. \nI am going on 6 days since I sent the qualifying gifts. \nMany people have said to open a ticket, and am now sitting on 4 days with no response. \nIt seems that the OCE riot team are just lacking. I don't usually like to point the finger, because I know that coding a game, and generating all the fluff can be time consuming etc, but seriously. It's a joke. NA are getting theirs within minutes. we are told to sit tight for three days, at the end of which we still do not get them. \nIt just feels so underwhelming to spend real money so that you can send a gift for a personal reward, and it gets stuck in the cosmos. \n\n490 mystery skin box and 790 mystery skin box are the qualifiers for anyone wondering.","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Grand Wizard","date":"2015-02-18T07:17:40.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Having the same problem.
