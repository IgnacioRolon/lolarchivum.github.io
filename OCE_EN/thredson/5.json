This issue appears to be patch dependent, and came on several patches ago (from memory over a year ago) and has gone away with a couple of patches, only to return. \r\n\r\n//The patch, or whatever, downloads and installs without issue, and I am presented with a &quot;Launch&quot; button etc.\r\nI press &quot;Launch&quot;\r\n... I wait . . . \r\n\r\n_This is usually fairly quick - max ~10 minutes, usually &gt;3 minutes though can take much longer_\r\n\r\nThe first &lt;Accept whatever this is&gt; comes up.\r\n... I press &quot;Agree&quot; or &quot;Accept&quot; \r\n- it disappears.\r\n\r\nI wait for an extended period... **This can (and usually does the first time) take several hours**\r\nThe second &lt;Accept whatever this is&gt; comes up and I press it\r\n\r\n. . .  \r\n\r\nNothing happens usually for several hours if at all.\r\n\r\nI close, what is at this point, the screen with the &quot;Launch&quot; button on it to see if I can expedite the process by restarting it (which tends to work).\r\n_Note: I only do this if there is no response, which usually there is not_\r\n\r\nI re-open LoL and wait for all &quot;scanning files&quot; business to finish, and again press &quot;Launch&quot;\r\n\r\n_This repeats until finally, the &quot;Launch&quot; window closes, the log in window appears, and I am able to enter my user name and password_\r\n\r\n**Once I have gone through this once there is usually not a problem until the next time I have to agree to the SAME whatever agreement** \r\n\r\n1-2 Years ago nothing like this was an issue. It began happening suddenly one patch, and has since stopped just as suddenly, only to begin again.  I have made no changes to my computer aside from regular updates to the OS and graphics. This is becoming increasingly frustrating. After I do this once, opening LoL normally is not an issue. It is having to agree to the teams, and whatever else, that is causing these issues. Reading through all the old work arounds has not helped, as none of them seem to work any longer (you can no longer directly edit config files to change boolean values from 0 to 1 to just have the game work, or navigate to an exe file on your system that bypasses the EULA and opens the login screen). This is the only game I have ever encountered any issue even similar to this. \r\n\r\nOS: 64-bit Windows 7 Professional\r\nRAM: 16GB RAM\r\nCPU: Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.4GHz 3.9GHz\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Passively meaning - I have not been sitting here constantly closing and re-opening LoL, and micromanaging the process, though the process has been going on the whole time.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-01-07T23:31:46.525+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you ensure that you've added League of Legends as an exception to your firewall and antivirus applications?
