As someone who has played the new Swain during all his patches, I strongly believe the only nerf he needs is his Q CD reverted to last patch and here is why.\r\n\r\nSwain&#039;s early game trading is all about landing his E&gt;W&gt;Passive Pull&gt;Q combo which takes skill and can be outplayed. If Swain lands this combo he SHOULD be rewarded with a high burst of damage dealt but should NOT sometimes be able to then throw out another 2-3 Q&#039;s since it&#039;s on such a low CD.\r\n\r\nNerfing Swains Q damage and keeping the current CD will mean that whilst his mid-late will be similar, his early laning will suffer since his E&gt;W&gt;Passive Pull&gt;Q combo will pack way less of a punch.\r\n\r\nReverting the Q CD would ensure that whilst Swain can still land his combo and deal considerable damage, he couldn&#039;t outright then kill you in some scenarios with follow up q&#039;s.\r\n\r\nThis would create a more fair laning phase for opponent as they can then fight back or escape whilst swains abilities are on CD for the next 7 seconds or so.\r\n\r\nWith the nerfs coming to abyssal, Swain will soon not be in a great spot if any of his current damage is nerfed.","replies":[{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-03-19T16:07:15.232+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no","replies":[]}]}
