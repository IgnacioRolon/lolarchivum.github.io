I played a game to test it out but everything was zoomed in as if I had scrolled in all the way so I uninstalled league from my pc. When I reinstalled league it didn&#039;t update or anything. I just logged in after downloading the league exe file (this took like 1 minute.) I went in a custom game and my shop looked different. I can&#039;t quite pinpoint it but the game felt weird and I had all my settings the same. I installed again this time (as I type) I am going through the normal process of downloading league. Why did the game only take 2 mins to reinstall the firs time I did it? Will the game cfg file finally be the normal file after this download?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:04:23.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Ok so I replaced my game cfg file in the league config with a file (had the same name) that was supposed to get rid of my lag issues.\n\nThe config file just adjusts what personal preferences you've set for playing League. There's no way a config file could improve your connection.\n\nWhen you uninstall League, all of its data remains on your machine, including configurations and map data. All that uninstalling does is remove League from your start menu. You need to manually delete the \"Riot Games\" folder to completely uninstall it.\n\nIf you need suggestions on how to improve your connection, check out [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues).","replies":[]}]}
