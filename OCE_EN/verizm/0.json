So in the last 6 months I&#039;ve moved into a new place with 50/10 down/up. For some reason I only lag on league of legends. I manage to play other games with 50 ping or less no problem. I have tried re installing. I even went as far as reinstalling my whole OS. I have tried contacting help but it wasn&#039;t that useful, just generic answers. I have tried hard wired and wireless no difference. And have tried when there is no one else at home. \n\nThe game will start off fine right up until minions spawn. And as soon as they do my ping spikes anywhere from 150-300. And will randomly but often spike for the rest of the game like this. \n\n(Also tried using other computers)\n\nIf anyone has any idea on how to solve this  I'm open to it. \n\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-20T01:38:31.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you do the following for me to help better determine the nature of your issues,\n\n* [Switch to a public DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5)\n* [Download WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/files/WinMTR-v092.zip/download) and run a traceroute to the following IP.
