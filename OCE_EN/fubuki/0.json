One may be crowd control but this goes for anyone, the amount of ways to deal with certain champions is entirely how you look at the situation, instead of wasting your time in typing and possibly being toxic you could be trying to learn from what is happening at the time and how to change the situation into your favour, this is a team game guys you&#039;re not playing by your self you have a team to work against Master Yi; and EVERY other champion.\n\nHe may be extremely easy to use, but he is actually hard to master, there is more to the &quot;Alpha Strike AA~&quot; I&#039;m sure plenty of you have seen Master Yi using his Alpha Strike and Meditations for certain things like attack reset, damage reduction, dodge crowd control, and lots more... \n\nAll I am trying to get across is that everyone gets farm and kills and eventually becomes strong, you can't just pin this on Master Yi, come on guys we&#039;re better than this learn from the experience not everyone is perfect they will die, as long as you work together.\n\n[ Not sure if this made any sense, or you see at as bull sh*t ; but I&#039;ll be very happy if this gets a good response, sorry for the trash I bought to the boards. ]","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-27T16:15:47.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i feel like what makes yi such a cancerous snowball champ is that hes one of the hardest champs to deal with when he gets going. slow resist, 2 AA resets, dmg reduction, AD steroid, but worst of all, takedown ability resets......in melee form.....with a movespeed boost. rito wot wer u thonking","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-27T09:05:00.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I'm sure plenty of you have seen Master Yi using his Alpha Strike and Meditations for certain things like attack reset, damage reduction, dodge crowd control, and lots more...\n\nWhile yes in a pro scene master yi is a champ that requires some skill, in low level play all that you're required to do to win easy games, is Q when CC is coming your way, Auto resetting isn't required until very far up the ladder.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SirArcticWarfare","date":"2016-01-27T06:38:32.381+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but when he snowballs at 10 minutes on a VERY regular Basis, you can see why he is Disliked. you want to blind him ? nope, he has used q.\n\nyou want to slow him, nope, Ultimate.\n\nyou go to stun him. nope q again.\n\nyou finaly get him low, w then he  will Q and AA you all.\n\n\nthe only way to get him, is with timing his q and landing some solid cc, while covered in armor, and burst.\n\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}
