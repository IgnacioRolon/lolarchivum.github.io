Poppy was also peeling for our team as best she could,\r\nYour help is muchly appreciated","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-05-01T19:12:28.616+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi There!\n\n Warmogs IS a tanky item, but its not very cost efficient. Especially when not in combat, as you lose the most valuable part of warmogs which is the health regeneration. This doesn't even activate until you have 3000 hp or more, so by building it this early you will not even be able to make full use of the item. Your money is best spent into items which give GOOD gold efficiency. \n\n> **Gold Value**\n850 _**health **_= 2266.67 **_Gold_**\n200% base health regeneration = 600 Gold\nBase Gold Value = 2866.67 Gold\n> Cost = 2850 Gold\n\nAs you can see theres only 16 gold worth of cost efficiency in the item itself without the passive. I would not reccommend buying it on supports (apart from Soraka) in general as you want to be aiming to make your gold go as far as possible.\n\nSome of the best support items for gold efficiency/tank stats are:\n\n{{item:2303}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3143}} & {{item:3222}} (when active is used)\n\nTry to avoid items like Sunfire Cape and Deadmans Plate on the majority of supports as well, as they have a similar problem with cost efficiency, and as you said yourself, support is about soaking up (or negating) as much enemy damage as possible, so don't worry about buying into these items to try and deal it! \n\nNo doubt there are definitely situations where you can build the above items. Such as Warmogs into an enemy poke comp to be able to regenerate health in between waves. But just as a general rule, keep the above in mind :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"RedPandaFox","date":"2016-05-01T12:08:13.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1, Tank.\n\nI Believe tank Can be whatever you put it.\nBut It mainly is someone who is beefy with Health, MR, AR and Can take a lot of blows before Dying.\nSomeone who has CC and Can initiate and Peel for the squishes.\nBut if you feel the tank in that position was too build Warmogs then Just don't listen too her, Its your Choice.\n\nAnd 2, I cannot say As I cannot see other Key things. Depending on the situation he should peel or CC the Carry.\n\n-RedPandaFox","replies":[]}]}
