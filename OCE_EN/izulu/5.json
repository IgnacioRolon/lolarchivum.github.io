He said it is a bad use of gold and magic pen was unnecessary because the enemy team had low amounts of mr. So why is it okay for rumble to build haunting guise first item(+15 magic pen off the top of my head) and not okay for a mid laner to build magic pen?

So it is still good to buy LW after you already have a haunting guise, as they will be applied in the correct order (if they were applied in the opposite order, the flat pen would be almost meaningless).","replies":[]}]}]}
