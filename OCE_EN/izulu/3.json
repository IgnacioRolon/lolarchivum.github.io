I have been having a terrible time against bards, as a thresh main, he seems to just out-trade me, the clever ones will stay out of my attack range and slow me before I can return an aa. then they heal up with their packs, and constantly stunning me through my own minions. I have read a good counter is Leona because of her cc and all ins, but when I have someone with a weak laning phase as my adc such as a vayne, that&#039;s not really going to be an option is it? Is it worth just picking a high sustain champion against him and not even bother trading? All help is appreciated, many thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"TinVplaysLoL","date":"2015-07-05T12:42:26.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes,they should buff him a bit,he barely hits,and he doesnt do too much if hes not super fed","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-04T19:34:47.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason Leona counters bard is because when bard fucks off to go play chime collecter 2015, you instantly all in their ADC and kill them.\n\nYou have a few more options against a bard, out sustaining him is possible, and with someone like a Vayne depending on the enemy carry could be a good idea (Nami, Soraka are your picks, not Sona in this sort of a matchup.)\n\nThresh would still somewhat Counter a Bard depending on how you play it, as would any pull support (Naut/Blitz) as you just pull either him or the ADC and screw whichever one.\n\nThe main thing to do against a bard is just All in them, and don't stand in your minions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-04T13:13:26.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't played much bard, but Leona does a lot of damage herself in the early game so you'd have kill potential with almost any adc. I imagine blitz would be fairly good too since bard cant escape easily if he gets hooked and isnt super good at helping immediately if his adc gets hooked into your minions. Playing a passive champ and just ignoring him is probably alright too.","replies":[]}]}
