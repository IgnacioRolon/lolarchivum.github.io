I am sure you are all familiar with the situation where you go to mid lane, and your team mate is constantly shoving the wave up to the enemy turret without having any wards down, then you are left sitting there waiting for the counter gank, which doesn&#039;t come, or comes before you get there. You gank top lane, to find a similar situation with the enemy having warded the area. Then bot lane where the lane is frozen in the middle with river thoroughly warded by the enemy. I am constantly left taking the blame for not ganking, even when I am not given ward timers, ward positions, summoner spell or ultimate timers from my team mates. We all know that sometimes the laning phase can simply last 6 minutes or less, where ganks simply don&#039;t happen anymore at all.  \r\n\r\nI want you to also place yourself in the bizarre situation where at three minutes into the game, your mid laner or top laner is killed by a level 2 gank from the enemy jungler, somehow being successful in killing your team mate even though they had both summoners and trinket ready. \r\n\r\nSo my question to all you junglers&#039; out there is; when is it really a junglers&#039; fault that the game is lost? Not in the sense of feeding, but in the sense of not being able to gank,\r\nMany thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-04T17:47:33.285+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is a list:\n1. It is never the junglers fault that you lose lane unless he dies to your lane opponent. If you are getting camped and your jungler does nothing to help, it is still your fault if you die.\n2. Do not sit around waiting for counter gank opportunities, you need to ward the enemy jungle so you can see which lane he is travelling to, if you are close enough to help yoi can set up a counter gank, and if you are tok far away, ping your lane and the location of the enemy jungler.\n3. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GANK THROUGH RIVER. I say this in caps because very few people understand this. River ganking should only be done when enemy is at your tower, or you have hard engage(eg leona support with ashe adc and warwick jungle) .Everyone has experienced a lane gank from the side brush's, and you know how deadly they are and how much it catches you by suprise.\n\nFollow these tips and you will vastly improve your jungle. P.s. this is not champion specific.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-03T22:44:59.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have to adapt to what your lanes are doing. If your lanes are pushing up to tower constantly it opens up for you to invade more and get wards deeper into the enemy jungle as the enemy laner won't be able to collapse on you easily. Pressuring the enemy jungle like this also makes it harder for him to gank your overextended laners and getting deeper vision gives you more info on where he will be so you can time your conterganks better and not waste time standing around when hes not coming. In some cases the enemy may have a stronger jungler who you cant fight 1v1 (though kha is good against most stuff) in which case you cannot play aggressively like this and you have to accept that you will be at a disadvantage early because you picked a weaker champion.\n\nIf they gank at level 2, you should be reacting immediately and taking their other buff every time. There is a reason people dont often gank at level 2, because the risk is usually not worth the reward. Even if the gank is succesful it often puts the jungler behind because they have to back early and miss out on early xp, and if it fails they are very far behind if you punish them properly. \n\nAlso, try to think more about what the enemy jungler likely wants to do next rather than just focusing on yourself and your team. Looking at the map often and noting which direction he leaves a lane in, how much hp he has, when his buffs will be up etc can help you predict when and where to countergank or open up for invade opportunities or objectives and stop you wasting time trying to countergank when hes probably not going to be there. Also bear in mind what you would do might not be the same as what other people will do so you will need to adapt thoughout the game if you notice they are playing super aggressively, or super passively, or focusing very hard on a particular lane.\n\nSometimes theres nothing you can do, like you top laner dies 1v1 before you even have both buffs and just fights and dies every time he gets to lane. Usually though, there's something more you could have done to tip the game in your favour. Like, say your mid laner is not warding and they're clearly getting camped. Telling them to ward and play safe won't cut it most of the time, if they're not warding then YOU should invest an extra 75 or 150g to ward up for them an stay in the area if you know they're gunna take a bad fight or the enemy jungler will be there soon. When thing are going badly, always try to figure out what YOU could have done to make the situation better, instead of immediately just writing it off as bad teammates or bad luck. The first step to improving is figuring out where you went wrong or missed opportunities so you can fix it next time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Unknown101","date":"2015-06-03T15:57:05.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I was mid one game and died twice before 10mins and pushed under turret with wards down and jungler at wolves. When asked for a gank he just told me he dont gank for feeders.\nAt this point i would blame the jungler as it was all set up but he wanted to farm.","replies":[{"poster":"FISTFACE","date":"2015-06-07T13:20:47.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"He probably rage quit.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-03T12:30:51.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If your lanes keep pushing waves up to the enemy towers just don't gank.\nInstead go farm and set up objective control and vision.\n\nAs a jungle main the way I see it is if you're not going to position your lane so a gank is plausible then you don't actually want ganks.","replies":[]}]}
