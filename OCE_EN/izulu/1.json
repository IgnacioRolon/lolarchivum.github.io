His W using heaps of mana and his q being very hard to hit with its short range, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve been able to use it&#039;s stun in laning yet. Using the w to eat enemies is risky in 2v2 fights because it leaves your adc unprotected. However, he excels in team fights, using his w to save carries or to consume enemy&#039;s, the ability to reset fights especially with the speed up that he gets, I have found his ult is most useful for chasing down fleeing enemies. I&#039;ve been building righteous glory just to help him enter a team fight as he doesn&#039;t have any engage. Would love to know what everyone else&#039;s thoughts on Tahm Kench is, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-19T19:40:08.214+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of the 2v2 it obviously depends on who the enemy is and who your ADC is. If your ADC can win a 1v1, just eat the enemy support and let them 1v1 for a few seconds, otherwise you are simply there to make sure your ADC doesn't die.\n\nHis release reminds me a bit of Bards release. Everyone saying \"his laning is sht and he is a \"troll\" champion\". Now look at Bard, he is actually a REALLY strong laner in the right hands people have realised.\n\nTahm is all about setting up ganks. If the ganks don't come, he is pretty bad in lane against ranged supports in my experience. Against another tank like Alisatar/Nautilus/Leona, he can do ok if you are a good Tahm. He also does ok against Blitzcrank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-07-19T14:04:44.578+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"its all about the player TBH\n\nif the player doesn't know how to play him, hes very weak and quite useless.\nif the player does know how to play him, hes godlike.","replies":[]}]}
