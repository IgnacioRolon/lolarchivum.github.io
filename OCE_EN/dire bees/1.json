Please help me improve it!\n\n\n&ldquo;You cannot run from your destiny forever!&rdquo; The Kraken priestess calls out over Bilgewater bay, the great golden icon of her god hefted over her shoulder. Her eyes cast about the waters, waiting for the slightest movement. \n\n&ldquo;You have evaded the test of Nagakaborous for far too long, little minnow!&rdquo; Illaoi continues, already the tentacles emerge from the idol, lazily coiling through the air like smoke on water.\n\nThere are rumours of the small amphibious creature for many weeks, and yet it defies all attempts to be caught, slippery and spirited as it is. They say it is skinned like an eel, with tentacles sprouting from the top of its head, with wide eyes and large frog-like feet. The sailors pay it tithes, some even claim it is a living god, and pray to it for safe passage; Illaoi holds no such adoration. \n\nThis creature will be tested against the might of the Bearded Lady, one way or the other.\n\nSo far the creatures nature has allowed it to dance and duck about the clawing tentacles that sprang forth from the idol to grasp its life force; but Illaoi is patient, she will soon snare him.\n\n&ldquo;If you think running and hiding will save you, think again!&rdquo; Her powerful figure stands tall, the sun illuminating her from behind like an omen sent from the gods themselves. &ldquo;I will chase you out to sea, little guppy! I will hound you until you are too exhausted to slip away, and then you will face the judgement that awaits you!&rdquo; Her voice booms across the water as fisherman and sailors stand and stare, faces stricken with awe and fear.\n\nA dry laugh, in a voice unused to the surface, rasps somewhere above her head; a moment later a blur of movement flashes in the corner of her eye, as something small and blue leaps off the top of a ships mast; splashing neatly into the ocean and, vanishing from sight.\n\nIllaoi smiles, her muscles bunching as she shifts the idol from her shoulder to the wooden dock. It has been so long since she&#039;s had such a challenge. \n\nThis is a very good beginning. \n\n~0~0~0~\n\nTrue to her word, the Kraken Priestess takes to the sea. Her ship is steered by devout followers of the Bearded Lady, while the tentacles of her great god dip beneath the waves, searching for the slippery little minnow.\n\n&ldquo;Come, little one!&rdquo; Her deep and booming voice commands him as he swims just out of reach again and again. &ldquo;Fear is for children!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Why don&#039;t you come in and get me yourself, then?&rdquo; Fizz calls back, mockingly sloshing his tail about above water. \n\nHe dives as the idol reaches for him, his laugh bubbling toward the surface. Nimbly, he darts by another groping tentacle, while jabbing at it tauntingly with his trident. The violent grasping motions of the suckers only spur him to torment the Bearded Lady further. \n\nOnce or twice he has poked his head above the waves and offered helpful instructions.\n\n&ldquo;Move your ship faster!&rdquo; He rasps, poking his head above water once more. &ldquo;I want to get to Noxus before I get old!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;Foolish child!&rdquo; She bellows back, the shining idol held high above her head. The green tendrils flow hungrily from the golden gourd into the water below. &ldquo;You only prolong the inevitable!&rdquo;\n\nHe laughs at her once more, swimming backwards ahead of the ship. For all his daring, he has not set his dragon shark on the ship. Something he has done to countless sailors in the past for crossing him. There is too much risk of his greatest friend getting caught on the tentacles that dangle over the ship like lures.\n\nEveryone knows that the shark, even one of Chompers size, is no match for the octopus.\n\nSo he&#039;ll do the next best thing.\n\nIn the distance he sees the light of the moonstone, glowing from the home of the Marai. His destination is just beyond the bright and protective barrier, where all the deep horrors are kept at bay, clawing through the dark relentlessly in search of food. Monsters of such vile countenance, even the gluttonous River King would not take a bite out of them.\n\nAs he darts through the tangling of seaweed and coral, the large ship shadows him from above, a race of gleeful abandon. He does not stop his pace again until he is at last, above the great rift. \n\nOne last time he breaks the surface of the sea to goad the priestess. \n\n&ldquo;You&#039;re boring.&rdquo; He croaks, as Illaoi&#039;s form appears above him. &ldquo;How about you let me test you?&rdquo; He chortles. &ldquo;If you pass, I&#039;ll think about joining you!&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply he dives straight down, deeper and deeper into the murky depths. \n\nHe darts down, past the schools of fish who scatter terrified in his wake. Down, through the jagged rock and reefs. \n\nA moment later, something large and heavy falls into the sea above him, dropping fast from its weight. The current of water shifts and pulls as it follows behind him, making his heart pound with the joy of the chase.\n\nBut the game changes very quickly, the deeper he goes.\n\nPerhaps it&#039;s the magnitude of the fissure beneath him that pauses his descent. As he gets closer, the great and terrible black pit seems to suck in the light around it, as hungrily as the beasts within. \n\nIt&#039;s his brief hesitation that is his folly.\n\nA green tentacle wraps itself securely around his ankle and yanks, hard. Fizz in return starts a frenzied swim toward the deep dark, frantic to reach the beasts below before the limb wraps around him proper.\n\nThere is a tug, like a fish caught on a line, that jerks him backwards. Then something begins to pull at him from the inside. He glances down in shock as something like a silver shadow of his own foot begins to peel away from his body, pulled by the clinging tentacle.\n\nFizz scrambles in alarm, suddenly very sure he does not want that silver spirit to leave his body. His trident jabs at the green limb furiously and uselessly, while his eyes search for the tentacles source. \n\nAt last he spies the idol, suspended in the water above, tied to the ships anchor. A bubble leaves his mouth in surprise as it begins its slow ascent toward the surface. The ship above reels it in, dragging him and the idol along with it.\n\nHe swims for the anchor, pulling the relentless tentacle along behind him, and stabs at the rope holding the idol, over and over until it pulls free. \n\nIt&#039;s a mistake. The idol is heavy, far heavier than Fizz has anticipated. With it&#039;s weight, he has no choice but to allow it to pull him, heavily and helplessly downward, or lose his spirit to the depths. \n\nHis webbed fingers scramble against the Idols golden face, desperately searching for something to retract the limb from himself. He&#039;s still struggling as he falls through the black, and hits the sandy bottom of the rift. The oppressive blackness around him seems like a blanket to any sound or life, making it impossible to sense any danger. \n\nHe has a brief but poignant moment of utter regret in his life choices. \n\nThe epiphany is short lived, for he notices a tortured pink glow in the black. It&#039;s dim, but only a few meters away, giving a dull light through the bones of old ships and large fish, like a glowing heart in an open rib cage. \n\nHe finds himself entranced by the sight, and the tentacle around his leg, given a moment of stillness, furthers its grip by coiling around his thigh. \n\nFizz pays it no mind, as if in a trance, he reaches down and takes hold of the idols handle, and pulls, dragging the massive weapon along the ocean floor as he approaches the mysterious light. \n\nHe hauls himself and the idol through the mass of bone and rotted wood, until he is only a few feet away from the light source. The tendril around his leg climbs up around his middle, as if trying to hold him back, but his webbed hand has already reached out toward the glow. \n\nA flash of pink lashes out and catches his arm in a grip as tight as the river Kings jaws. \n\nFor a moment, as the pink tendril wraps about his wrist, all he can see is the light, growing brighter and brighter, and then..\n\nA voice, calling him from the dark.\n\nIt speaks of horrible things, of sights beyond the mortal world, of painful, desperate hungers. It speaks of how Fizz can bring the joy of the void to the world.\n\nAll he needs to do is bring the idol a little closer...","replies":[]}
