Me and my friend would like to bring this account up back to a certain elo maybe plat or diamond from a placement \"gold 5\" and that's MMR boosting? As your opinion, whenever we play league, we have to play as the level where the account is at? So I have to play like a gold player when I'm a master right now?  You can't just suspend my account by just throwing out \"extensive investigation\", and abandon all my further action on this account right? I practice so hard to achieve master this season, and what you have said it's just insulting my skill and me myself. \n\nSo I hope that Riot would undo all the things that he have done to this account and return my account as soon as possible.  \"  that was what i said.","replies":[{"poster":"Gol D Maka ","date":"2016-10-26T07:49:06.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sharing accounts? cuz that's what it sounds like.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Congseng Xiaohei","date":"2016-10-26T02:52:17.568+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao","replies":[]}]}
