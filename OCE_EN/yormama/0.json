I lost 19lp for staying at base waiting for remake. \r\nThis is ridiculous. I was not afk. My jungler disconnected. Not me. \r\nThis is horrible and haunting. \r\nRiot please fix it or give back my LP. \r\nI worked so hard to get to 80lp and i lost 20 for remaking a game that&#039;s not even my fault. This is ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-11T00:09:30.225+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry for the late reply.\n\nAnyone marked as AFK during the remake period will cop the loss. In the event your jungler came back or the game didn't remake for some other reason, you would have been behind, which isn't fair to your team who stuck with it. This has always been the case, and was made very clear when remake was first implemented.","replies":[]}]}
