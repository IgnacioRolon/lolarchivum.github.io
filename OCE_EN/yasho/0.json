So in conclusion I am asking if there is any one out there willing to teach me things I do not know and help me improve on the things I do.\r\n\r\nIGN- Yasho","replies":[{"poster":"4fy9bEOt7y","date":"2016-07-20T01:20:25.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find one champion and master them.

(Your kass is great keep using it)\n40 mins, 160 CS - Even KD_\n\nHeim- did poor 240 CS for a 60 min game as heimer?\nNeeds to work on CSing and objectives as heimer.\n\n\"Support\" Zilean has archangels, and abyssal.\nNo sight stone/support items, went full AP.\n\nSome old Kass games have really poor CSing.\n\nChampion roster is weird. You go from mid-support-ADC-top-jungle-mid-top-mid\nYour all over the place so I'm assuming you go Mid then Fill. Which is't bad, but your mid kass is great might wanna go Mid-Top or something.\n\nIn some games your CSing is poor (Not most of your Kass games)\nusually the minimum is 60 CS every 10 mins, the average is 80 CS per 10 mins.\nLike that heimerdinger game you need to work on CSing a bit.\n\nAnd your support builds need a lot of work.\n\nDo what ever is working for you as kass as it seems to work.\nTry focusing on objectives a bit more, kills are great but they don't win games.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasho","date":"2016-07-19T12:07:04.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cool, Thanks for the feedback.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-07-19T07:08:49.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a free coach, I just got back form AVCON.\n\nnow I need to start saying this (Because of reasons)\nI don't tolerate toxic behaviour.\n\nBut When I get home I can take a look.\nlook up \"Helping Others Improve\" on youtube and you should see some of my work.","replies":[]}]}
