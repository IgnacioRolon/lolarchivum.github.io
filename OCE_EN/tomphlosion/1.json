Placements were ok, but in the last few days games have been really unbalanced. Like bronze and diamonds in the same game unbalanced. I&#039;m  not upset or anything but I was wondering  if this because these players are just going through their first  games in this queue or because there isn&#039;t enough players at that time of the morning (like 4-7am). \r\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? Have we heard anything from riot about the viability of the am queue?","replies":[]}
