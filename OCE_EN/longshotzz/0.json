Error with FW1FrontWrapper.dll","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi there,\r\n\r\nI have just come across this really distracting/performance killing issue. This error started yesterday when I tried to shutdown my PC, it did not shutdown/took much to longer than usual to shutdown, so I decided to hold the power button (have in mind that I closed all applications) and it did force shutdown. This morning I got this error: http://imgur.com/a/Nlz5z . The client launched and when I was loading in to a normal game, it kept popping up in loading screen and in game, causing severe frame/lag issues. I kept closing it thinking it was no big deal, until I realised it was not going away. I have tried re-installing the game but I don&#039;t think it has something to do with the client/game. Please help.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-03T09:31:24.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you recently uninstalled any software? It's possible that may be related.\n\nFor now however, you can download the dll file from [this url](http://168.235.67.241/res/FW1FontWrapper_1_1.zip), the zip file contains 2 folders **x64** and **x86**, extract the .dll file from the appropriate folder for your system (32 bit or 64 bit) and then copy this file to **C:\\Windows\\System32**\n\nLet me know if this solves your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"LongshotzZ","date":"2017-01-05T13:24:58.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying, that didn't work, but I had found my solution by dragging a new copy of the file into my League of Legends main directory. Fixed though, thanks again.","replies":[]}]}]}
