I think the Ruby would be ok. The audio is terrible in the series but you should watch  it for good weapon ideas. Some of the were ripped off from games whilst others were completely original. Ruby has a gun-scythe. Not only does the gun turn into a scythe, but the gun can still fire in scythe form. This allows her to not only shoot enemes from afar whilst dealing ones that are close, but the recoil from the gun was used to boost the mechanics of the scythe (she hooked her scythe around the neck of the boss and ran up a vertical cliff using the guns recoil the help her charge forward). \nMaybe you should design the player you know? I have a few creations but they all suck cause they are not original XD","replies":[]}]}
