They get first crack at a new champ and it gets lots of use on the rift. I guess the aim is to sell them though - cant be giving shit away to long time players who have dropped a tonne of cash on the game.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-09T04:30:20.158+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep.","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-23T10:17:40.928+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=HIhBbXoe,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-11-09T04:30:20.158+0000)\n>\n> Yep.\n\nwait, you cant answer in binary for a multiple choice question.\n\nQ: is it (a) or is it (b)\nA: yes.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-11-23T11:17:18.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't a multiple choice question?
