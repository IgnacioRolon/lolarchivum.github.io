My main role is jungle. I would love to join either of the teams dude it will be great to play in a team which is aiming high. I can help the team achieve those aims. My reksai win rate is 64% (62 wins and 34 losses) and I mostly play lee in normals not in ranked due to the fact that he is only strong with certain comps at least in my opinion. I could also point out the things that need improvement or things that they need to try and avoid for example when I play with my friends I always notice those little mistakes that make big difference in their gameplay like riven not AA between Q s etc. I am currently gold 2 and was gold 5 last season. It would be great to be part of any of your team.\n\nThanks for reading.","replies":[]}]}
