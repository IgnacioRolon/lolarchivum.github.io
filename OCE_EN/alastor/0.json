All of his base stats and scaling seem fine but i think his character model needs to be a little Larger.\r\n \r\nPassive: (ACTIVE) Gemcraft- After casting a spell, Taric's next basic attack deals bonus magic damage equal to 5% / 10% / 15% (at levels 1 / 8 / 16) of Taric's Bonus Armor and reduces his abilities' cooldown by 1 second.\r\n\r\n[Q] RANGE: 750 COST: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120 / 140 MANA -COOLDOWN: 18 / 17 / 16 / 15 / 14 \r\nImbue- Taric channels earthen energy to heal a target allied champion for 50 / 90 / 130 / 170 / 210 (+ 20% AP) (+10% bonus health) And Shield Shielding them for 25 / 45 / 65 / 85 /105 (+ 10% AP). As the magic flows through them he is healed for the same amount but does not gain the shield. \r\n\r\n[W] COST: 70 MANA - COOLDOWN: 15 / 14 / 12 / 11 / 10\r\nDazzle- (PASSIVE) Taric reinforces his armor with gemstones, increasing his armor by  5 / 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 (+ 5% armor) while Dazzle is off cool down. He also gains a 450-range aura, increasing his armor and allied champions' armor by 15% of his Bonus armor.\r\n\r\n(ACTIVE) Taric's gem encrusted armor absorbs the light around it for 2.5 seconds then releases it, Stunning (Dazzling) all enemies in a 200 range around him for 1 second.\r\n\r\n[E] Range 450 - COST: 60 MANA - COOLDOWN: 90\r\nRisen Sight (ACTIVE) Taric raises a gem that is invisible to enemies, from the ground in target location granting vision in a range of 550 for 60 Seconds.\r\n\r\n[R] RANGE: 550 - COST: 100 / 150 / 200 MANA - COOLDOWN: 150 / 130 / 110\r\nDeep Earthen Emergence - (ACTIVE) Taric Knocks up nearby enemies, dealing 150 / 200 / 250 (+20% AP) magic damage and rendering them unable to move and attack for 1.5 seconds.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed.\r\nFeed back of any kind is welcome.","replies":[{"poster":"DatEpicPotato","date":"2015-01-23T22:35:33.127+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice ideas, but I gotta admit I am content with the current Taric due to the Righteous Glory item, which finally allows him to catch up to enemies. Besides, the current Taric is an INCREDIBLE fighter, I could easily 1v3 enemies if I built him AD. But as KingDinger said, his cooldowns are indeed far too long, and would be somewhat boring to play.\n\nBesides, this Taric seems a bit more problematic to play, as if you took the problems with Taric and ran in the opposite direction. While Taric lacks mobility and influence in the middle of the teamfight, you took what little \"mobility\" he had (ranged stun), chucked it out and replaced it with a better teamfight if it ever breaks out. I like the ideas, but you need to give him some way to catch up to enemies without actives or summoners, or else you would have to waste a Righteous Glory and a flash just to have a good initiation.\n\nOther than that, nice job :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alastor","date":"2015-01-24T04:19:54.314+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, i kinda based my idea around him being a sustain support that is able to punish people who over extend.\nthanks for the feed back tho","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-23T16:01:06.882+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"too long CDs for the passive CDR to mean anything...\n\nE looks nice in theory.\nW is a nice old W E combo. (or w.e it is...the shatter and stun together) but the 2.5 second charge up makes little sense....unless it absorbs damage, but even then, people see him glow...they walk 2 steps away.\nQ heal AND shield seems misplaced. and no self heal = no top or jungle?\nknock up and 1.5 second stun? whats knock up duration? 2.5 seconds of CC, so its to combo with the W....use WR at same time. then get into position for another 1 sec AOE CC! lol sounds OP.\n\noverall, nice. but separately things dont mesh well.\n\noh and leveling of passive seems poop.\neither do 4 levels at 1 6 11 16 or increase by 1% per lvl or smt. or hell, a flat 15% would be fine, since its bonus armour and he gets that with time/levels/items....","replies":[{"poster":"Alastor","date":"2015-01-24T04:21:08.311+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah like i said the numbers might be abit off, and as for the heal, it still heals him but her isnt granted the shield unless he uses the heal on himself.\nthanks for the feed back.","replies":[]}]}]}
