My friends list is a ghosttown of people who have either just straight up quit after being fed up, or only play a few games a month.\n\nI'll probably be here for a while yet, since I haven't really got the time to be finding and learning a new competitive game to replace league of legends (though Overwatch is beginning to win my favour).\n\nRiot with the constant supply of bot levelled smurfs, your playerbase numbers might be looking fine, but in reality, you're at a precipice.\n\nEven the oceanic league discord is eerily quiet sometimes.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-26T08:40:27.510+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":">Riot with the constant supply of bot levelled smurfs, your playerbase numbers might be looking fine, but in reality, you're at a precipice.\n\nI think they'd have the ability to detect that these aren't all individual players even though they struggle to detect the bots themselves.\n\nBut yes the numbers have dropped, even just general queue times when i play during peak time have increased to stupid amounts, and give me another reason to not bother playing (5 minute queues shouldn't be occurring near 9-10pm.)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-02-27T05:49:29.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only the stoners and WA players are on at that time.

People rage less, and it just feels easier to play a macroplay focused rotational game and just win through good rotations and map pressure.\n\nI can't explain why, but I am adamant that this is the post-midnight ranked experience, and it's great (except when you have an 8am start for back to back 8 till 8 day at uni).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-02-25T23:08:58.640+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fewer people playing during that time period probably","replies":[]}]}
