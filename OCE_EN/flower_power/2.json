The joys of smartcasting.\n\nIt's not really a bug but its really annoying when you're trying to clutch land an E then auto-attack target so if someone jumps in you dont lose aggro (a-click) and you're microscopically out of range so she goes to throw buckler so you have to input E again and then just end up standing there repeatedly trying to throw buckler and cancelling it with E-on target then cancelling your E by trying to throw buckler and 4 seconds later you feel like a retard but it happens all the time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BigMommaFrank","date":"2015-12-12T09:30:40.566+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats nuts yo","replies":[]}]}
