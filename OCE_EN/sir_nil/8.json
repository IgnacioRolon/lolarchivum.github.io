He materialized in the Twisted Treeline because of the amount of dark energy there left over from the previous the civilization. \r\nAnd {{champion:238}} is training a shadow army in order to help the dark spirits take over the world.\r\n\r\nThis could mean 1 thing that there are gonna be new shadow type champions coming out and possibly and entire new faction made up of {{champion:238}}s shadow army and other inhabitants of the box. Riot is known for spoiling new champions in other champions lore.\r\n\r\nBut hey it&#039;s just a theory. (Game Theory please don&#039;t sue me for plagerism for copying that quote)","replies":[]}
