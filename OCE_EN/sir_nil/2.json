(I suggest you read the mount targon thing before this cause there&#039;s a lot of references)\r\n\r\nBasically I believe that all the champions who got their lore reworked (Pantheon Leona Diana) are preparing for a large scale battle and two dragons of sun and moon are going to help them. This is why:\r\n1: Pantheon is a spirit that inhabits a human body to defend the world against dangers and to act as a protector of people, he has appeared before in other body&#039;s but only before some kind of large scale event.\r\n2: When Diana obtained her powers in the lore rework she saw that there was once a tribe called the Lunari which is a tribe that worships the moon. It was prophesied that one day the Lunari and Solari will join together to fight a Great War.\r\n3: when Leona got her powers she realized that she must get to Diana, why that is was never stated, but I think it&#039;s to join her to fight this battle.\r\n4: Aurelion Sol the dragon the was announced means sun dragon in Spanish/Latin, I thought that since there was a sun dragon there usually is a moon dragon too.\r\n5: in the mount targon page there are two empty slots indicating that two new things are missing and will get released.\r\n6: the he has returned teaser means that someone  that has existed before has come back. \r\n\r\nDue to these facts I think that there is some kind of Great War happening probably against Lisandra because of the new voiceover on ARAM, I think Lisandra has somehow revived the frozen watchers and Aurelion Sol, pantheon, Diana, Leona and the moon dragon are going to stop them. The he has returned teaser could either indicate the return of Aurelion Sol or of the frozen watchers.\r\n\r\nAnother theory is that Aurelion Sol and the moon dragon are coming to do battle against each other, this could also be the reason why the Solari hate the Lunari because they thought that if the the Lunari tribe didn&#039;t exist then this battle between sun and moon won&#039;t happen.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s my theory at least.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-02T06:54:40.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-popcorn}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-02T07:44:16.821+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Marauduar on the suns side confirmed!\n\nI stand with SHURIMA!","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-03-02T07:49:17.986+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I stand with {{champion:131}}","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-03-02T07:58:51.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GASP, Spoilers!\n\nBut with that crescent figure, who could blame you!","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Mage Apollyon","date":"2016-03-02T07:53:56.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no but its not bs.\n\nSol are a sect from Mage Knights.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-03-02T07:21:20.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Man I love this fan theory stuff.
