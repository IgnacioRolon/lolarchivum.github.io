So far only the zed and sona teasers have come up and after watching the sona teaser something ticked in me. Why was there a wound where sona's throat is?","url":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/mzygkr5H-how-i-connect-deadeye","image":"http://cdn.leagueoflegends.com/apollo/assets/vb/boards-wallpaper.jpg"},"up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"This is my second  deadeye related post and in this theory I believe deadeye didn&#039;t kill zed and sona but healed them.\r\n\r\nI based this theory off how sakura&#039;s is often represented as rebirth in Japanese culture (at least I think it is) and there was one in zed&#039;s teaser. In the previous post I said how zed may have lost an eye against Shen and this deadeye may have healed him, same with sona who is mute. I don&#039;t have a lot of faith in this theory because it doesn&#039;t explain why he/she is called deadeye, it might be a riot tactic to throw us off the sent but I highly doubt that. If the code didn&#039;t have deadeye in them and maybe had any other name I might&#039;ve believed this theory more. It is completely plausible in every way other then the name. Deadeye might be some kind of ranged far off healer but I highly doubt it since its first off too op and the name dosnt match. You can go check out my other theory which is a lot more plausible and more likely to be true.","replies":[]}
