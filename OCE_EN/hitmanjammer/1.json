Anyways i have previously played on a laptop and that works fine but as i try install league on the H: Drive (Because it&#039;s the storage drive and my c: is a SSD with limited space). I have tried repetitively uninstalling and reinstalling but it (after windows installer) gets about 30% through the League logo and load bar (before the patcher opens) then closes i check the task manager and nothings open so i reopen league and it opens in task manager but does nothing (it stacks in task manager eg. if i open it 3 times after it fails the first time there are 4 tasks that open at the same time). If anyone need bonus details just ask but just wondering if i could receive some help &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3","replies":[{"poster":"Hitmanjammer","date":"2015-09-29T23:31:23.701+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edit: All fixed it was my anti virus {{summoner:3}}","replies":[]}]}
