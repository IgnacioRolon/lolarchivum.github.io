If he successfully marks an enemy with Weaker then he can activate \"W\" again to lower their armor and magic resist for 3 seconds and slowing them by 30% but only for 1.5 seconds\r\nE: (this is an autoattack reset so careful timing can max the damage you deal) After activation his next autoattack deals extra damage breifly stuns the target and amplifies damage dealt to that target by 12-30% depending on champ level\r\nR: He reveals the truth and unleashes his full potential giving him bonus attack damage and movement speed as well as 5% tenacity for 8 seconds as well as increasing damage delt by his abilties\r\n\r\nBest ability combo is:\r\nR (to get bonus ability damage and the other bonuses)\r\nQ (to minion to get the passive and the reset)\r\nQ (this time to champ)\r\nE (to get bonus damage)\r\nW(mark the champs)\r\nW(trigger it to slow)\r\nThen auto til dead if not already or just leave","replies":[{"poster":"MrButter","date":"2014-12-18T10:46:04.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hhhhmmmmm i like it :) the kit is great but i have a reccomendation, his R increases his attack damage twice which is kind of pointless, maybe remove the bonus attack damage to his abilities part? Also that E damage amplification seems a bit OP if your ADC jumps in right after you use it, does it only amplify damage YOU deal or does it amplify your allies as well? Even then it would be a much simpler calculation to amplify the damage dealt by a percentage of their Max Health :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnar Is A Cat","date":"2014-12-18T10:20:29.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you have any comments plz tell me so i can rework and i will check poll in around a days time","replies":[]}]}
