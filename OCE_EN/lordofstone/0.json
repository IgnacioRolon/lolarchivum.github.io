The fucked up thing is, i know i did the mistake of stooping down to their level BUT the punishment was one sided. They only penalised me and they didn't do anything against the other player who was harassing me all game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-03-10T10:30:26.057+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmmmmmmmmm chat log?
