If you&#039;re any melee based champion, you&#039;ve gotta get close to him to fight him right? If you&#039;re gonna be close to him his Q is almost guaranteed to hit you... like a 90% chance of it. The thing he throws has a pretty big radius so its close to impossible to dodge it at melee ranges. Now thats all fine and well but THE FLIPPIN SLOW IT HAS ! That slow is what needs a nerf !! It shouldn&#039;t slow you to the point you might as well be snared. Couple that with Ekko&#039;s passive, he can run circles around you. The kind of burst damage he can throw out is incredible ! \r\n\r\nI used to side with the people that said he doesn&#039;t need a nerf, its easy to outplay him. Which i agree with if you&#039;re trying to stay alive. Keep your distance and dodge skill shots and poke. But when you&#039;re a close range melee champ you can&#039;t do anything. If you get close range that Q burst and slow along with well.. anything ekko wants to do. W you into a stun ? E you for more burst damage? R you for overkill with hp regen? \r\n\r\ntldr; nerf his Q slow so its actually viable to trade melee shots with him. I don&#039;t have any problem with his other abilities on their own. He&#039;s pretty solid beside this slow.","replies":[{"poster":"Hirukotane","date":"2015-06-09T00:01:00.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> me playing vayne \n> walks into mid to keep the minions off tower\n> ekko tower dives me\n> i flash q behind him with a nice condemn into the tower\n> he ults\n> chronoblast does 2600 damage and 1 shots me\n> wtf gg","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-06-09T00:06:37.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I sssseeerrrrriiiiiooooouuuuuussssssllllllyyyyyy doubt it did 2600 damage.
