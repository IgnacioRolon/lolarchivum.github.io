Currently my trinket is changed to \"C\" and my last item slot is \"T\" and the rest is normal 1-5. Everything is smart casted including abilities except the trinket. \n\nAlso what&#039;s the difference between smartcast and quick cast? And yeah why do people put trinket to C ?  I only did it because I saw most streamers using it and thought I might as well make a habit out of it but I still don&#039;t know why it is..\n\nOh yeah, also F is for flash and D is for ignite for me :)","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-07-17T09:54:02.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my trinket is on T. Items are 1-6 for me.\nI always put HP pots on 3, Wards on 1 and \"important actives\" on 2 and 3 (if i have 2 active items).\n\nC is used because you can press it with your thumb easily since most people play with their thumb resting on space bar.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-17T22:13:33.962+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh I don't play with an unlocked screen.

Just tweak your bindings to carry out as much commands at one time as possible.\nFor me, i use quick cast with indicators (smart cast). \n\nReplying about streamer part- \nSmartcast is quick cast with indicators. Quick cast by itself does not have indicators when you use ablities. I use smart cast because you can see where your ablities go without clicking on hud.","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-07-17T22:12:47.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"with indicators? Uhh hmm I watched a few streamers and saw they were quickcasting and it'd show the range for their abilities and I always wondered how to do that without taking quickcast off. Does this mean they're smartcasting? Is this what you're talking about with the range indicators?\n\nI just opened the controls in game and the little lightning arrow under all the abilities, i clicked those on. It doesn't give the range indicators so i guess im quick casting and not smart casting?","replies":[]}]}]}
