I&#039;ve started off using {{champion:62}} in the jungle but after watching some vids on youtube, people say these bruiser-ish champs are not good if you dont know what you&#039;re doing in the jungle due to their lack of sustain and whatnot. \r\n\r\nSince I sorta just clear jungle camps and gank whenever I see it possible, I don&#039;t think i know what im doing most of the time (No clue which camp smite buffs are worth more than others, kinda suck at ganking, I find it hard to time my jungle camps, and I dont know what to do when im counter jungled)\r\n\r\nI wanna know some decent champs I can jungle with, to help me learn these things without worrying too much about sustain or being counter jungled. \r\nI really don&#039;t want to use {{champion:19}} or {{champion:32}} . Those two are on my &quot;NOT TO USE&quot; list simply because they both look really boring. {{champion:5}} looks really interesting to me right now, but im not sure if he&#039;s good as a beginner. \r\n\r\nAlso any general tips for a beginner jungler would be appreciated ! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-18T08:58:16.074+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Play master yi, he is ez to learn and if you master him in the jungle you get accused of being BS and shit but wurf u get 1v5 penta more easily than a kat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-06-18T08:14:45.192+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin Zhao is what I started off with and I'd definitely recommend giving him a try. Hes not the strongest right now but he's a good beginner jungler because he's easy to play and his pre-6 ganks are some of the strongest in the game. I'd also suggest getting rangers trailblazer (purple smite) until youre a bit more experienced since its a bit more forgiving and you dont have to decide between smiting champions and jungle camps","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scatman John","date":"2015-06-18T03:10:07.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Xin Zhao is a great jungler, thats who i started with. You generally want someone who can either support early or attack early, then do good in late game. Nunu is a good starter jungler IMO, since his Q is pretty much a smite (plus a heal). Shaco is also a god jungler, not sure how hard he is to play, but he is really good","replies":[{"poster":"Legends man1","date":"2015-06-18T03:43:26.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ehh from what I know, shaco's extremely high skill cap... every shaco i've seen either ends the game within 20 mins or ends up being completely useless past mid game. \n\nThanks for that, im really leaning on to getting xin zhao, he looks like he has good sustain and easy ganks. Im not too sure how he scales into late game especially if i dont get any kills.","replies":[]}]}]}
