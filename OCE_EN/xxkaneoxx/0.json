Is there anyone else with this problem and if so is there a solution? I can&#039;t find one. It doesn&#039;t prevent me from seeing the screen but it is really distracting.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-06-16T12:37:28.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that's a strange one. Is it localised to League? Like if you alt-tab does it go away or does it remain?\n\nIf it goes away with League, then I'd run a client repair, and if that doesn't work, a clean reinstall with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/224826367-Automated-Troubleshooting-Hextech-Repair-Tool).\n\nIf it doesn't, and honestly probably anyway, I'd recommend first updating your graphics card drivers.\n\nIf none of that works, submit a ticket to Player Support and hopefully they'll be able to  help you further: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]}]}
