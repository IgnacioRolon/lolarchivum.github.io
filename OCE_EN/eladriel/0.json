I am using a 4G Wifi stick, it is receiving full reception and is in the same place I have been using it in for the last few months. As of yesterday (19th of April, 2016) i&#039;ve been unable to successfully log into the game client while connected to my 4g service (This wasn't an issue on the 18th, i was playing matches as per usual on that date and before) I have tried using both my WiFi stick and my Phone&#039;s wireless hotspot (both are with Optus, sadly.) and i&#039;m still unable to log in.\n\nWhen i connect to my home internet (with a different service provider), i&#039;m able to log into the game instantly without any issue, however the connection is shared, it is not stable enough to play a full match on.\n\nThings i have tried:\n- Set public DNS (Followed steps on the [Troubleshooting guide](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5) )\n- Restarted computer\n- Reset 4G WiFi Modem&#039;s settings\n- Repair Client\n- Uninstalling and then reinstalling the client\n- Hoping it will change\n- Using a different computer with the same connection methods (4G WiFi stick & Phone WiFi)\n- Logging in while connected via ethernet and then switching over to wifi connection. Remain disconnected and seemingly isn't able to reconnect (Manually clicking \"Reconnect to chat\"- doesn't connect. Also still have \"Disconnected from PVP.net\" alert showing)\n- Running Tracert to 192.64.169.20, requests time out after a few hops.\n\nIs there anything else i am able to do? becoming very frustrated at this point.\n\nEdit: Pinging the game server is fine, i still get back around 82 ms (The ping i usually play with) so i'm not really sure why i can't connect.","replies":[{"poster":"Eladriel","date":"2016-04-25T12:54:46.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still having the same issue (hanging at logging on)\n\nI purchased a telstra 4g service and im able to connect instantly.

Following that knowledge i sort of haphazardly assumed i was at least reaching the game servers, but somehow not the login server.\n\nWill get in touch with Optus. What sort of extra information should i be giving them? Just my tracert results to 192.64.169.20?\n\nthanks for your help!\n\nedit: after a 40 minute phonecall and a gartantuan effort on my part, i finally was able to have the problem escalated to a network engineer. i should be recieving feedback within 24 hours.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-04-21T23:33:44.507+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Eladriel\n\nLet me know how you go with the network engineer...

They've informed me that this is an ongoing issue and has been happening intermittently since September 2014. Apparently it's got something to do with re-authenticating Optus servers once something has changed on the host's side.\n\nThere's nothing they can do, i've been advised to just wait it out.\n\nPretty poor on optus' side but that's all they're able to do for me apparently.\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Bearded Dragon","date":"2016-04-21T09:19:42.094+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"having the same problem and have tried the same things, also on optus, has anyone found a solution to this\n\nThanks","replies":[]},{"poster":"cl0ne67","date":"2016-04-20T17:32:44.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just here to let you know you're not alone.
