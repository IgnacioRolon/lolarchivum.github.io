She waits for the break of dawn to venture into this ancient natural tomb of thorned vines and ancient plants... Zyra woke to daylight and as she intended, began to saunter towards a veil of vines that had changed their shape from the night before. They had grown into a mesmerizing shape such as an entrance of some sort; she felt captured by its power and was drawn to it.\r\n&ldquo;I feel your power but why so defensive... I am your queen&rdquo; \r\n The jungle did not reply but groaned and without realising she felt her hand being pulled to the surface of a large vine, it thorns curved and new ones expelled piercing her hand. Suddenly, she snapped jolting her hand back to her chest; she was surprised that her own kin turned onto her maybe they had forgotten their true leader or maybe they have grown independent, sell- reliant.\r\nZyra cautious of her footsteps continued into the forest... down the winding jungle path she walked. She heard a purring sound echo in the jungle, deep and strong.\r\n&ldquo;Hear mousy, mousy, mousy... Ha ha ha...&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;The question is... who are you and why have you wondered into my domain&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I am Zyra, The Thorns Embrace ruler of this jungle... the birth mother of this jungle&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;The untamed know no fear...&rdquo;\r\nA feline figure approached from the lush flowering shrub and from behind, it formed into a female body holding a javelin in one hand. She strutted towards zyra, kept her gaze upon her face, she glaced, and began to taunt her.\r\n&ldquo;I am Nidalee the bestial huntress, independent, self-sufficient, and always on the prowl...&rdquo;\r\nZyra kept her ground.\r\n&ldquo;So am I but in another way... with magic!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Ha, your magic is useless here... In the Kumungu jungle&rdquo;\r\nZyra channelled her power through her body even to the very tips of her fingers, and with all her might could not stand to the greater power, the strong primal strength within the jungle. Abruptly, vines tangled around her legs slowly growing up to her throat, Nidalee became full of bliss.\r\n&ldquo;Well, well, well... it seems you have been defied by your own children...&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Wait, wait... help me take back my kingdom&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;My loyalty to you and a high rank in my kingdom&rdquo;\r\nNidalee paused for a slight moment and grinned; &ldquo;I will guide you&rdquo;... swiftly she sliced the vines and freed Zyra from her bondage. The two hiked through the jungle when they came to clearing, Nidalee converses of the reason for why the jungle has forgotten her, why she has lost her connections with the plants. The key was that for Zyra to reclaim her thrown she must consume the magic of the ancient elder tree at the centre of the jungle it was the heart of the jungle, once that was achieved, Zyra would be at full power then on one would be able to stand in her way...\r\nThe tree&rsquo;s rustled, &ldquo;The scent of prey... walks the killer&rsquo;s path&rdquo;, &ldquo;New trophies for my collection... soon...&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;There is another who lurks within this forest it is Rengar the Prides stalker, I will have his head and we will see who has trophies&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;He must be here to take my thrown as king of the jungle, he must have primal power within him!&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go&rdquo;\r\nNidalee and Zyra took to the towering elder tree its branches towered over the tops of the canopy detailed with foliage and beautiful carvings from the roots to the trunk and up the braches. Zyra with her amazement was spellbound, rapidly with all her strength cast two vines that merged with the elder roots. Slowly the power surged from the tree to Zyra&rsquo;s body; vines enwrapped her like a cocoon.  Her body shrouded with luminosity, and beams of light shone through the gapes, could it be Zyra was once more reborn but as a queen.  A large detonation of power expelled from the cocoon exploding creating a vibration that shock the ground.\r\nNidalee was nowhere to be seen. \r\nZyra was queen once more. \r\n&ldquo;I feel the enchantment of the elder tree and can sense the jungle; now I can bend and manipulate the plats to may will. It knows I am queen, I can feel every single root every single stem all a network... It&rsquo;s all mine now&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Did I hear Queen, which must mean you worth more than what I expected? All alone...&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Keep your snout shut, the forest holds many surprises and one of them... Where are your friends? Mine are all around&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;You have a warrior&rsquo;s heart. I think I&rsquo;ll take it...&rdquo;\r\nRengar circled Zyra, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve earned a good death. I&rsquo;ve earned the Kill! Lets fight!&rdquo;\r\nFrom the canopy above, As Rengar leaped towards Zyra Nidalee in her true form a cougar latched on to Rengar and ripped at his throat with her razor sharp teeth blood spat at his mouth, while Zyra coiled the beast tight with grasping roots releasing vine lashers piercing his chest. He released an arm, stabbed Nidalee and tossed her against a tree and tore the vines, and charged at Zyra. The more Rengar tried to grasp at her; a vine would whip out and wrap itself to him pulling him away from her. But with the one-hand throws a bola binding Zyra. She falls to the ground, and the vines release. He began to stager towards Zyra and begins punching her repeatedly blood dripping from her noise, Nidalee pounced at him from behind slashing him again at his back, &ldquo;claw or spear, your end&rsquo;s the same.&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Are you so sure, claw or spear no difference... but I&rsquo;m the cat and you&rsquo;re the mouse&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;I love playing cat and mouse&rdquo;\r\nNidalee and Rengar exchanged fatal slashes to each other wounding each other, but Nidalee was no match for Rengar and limped backwards towards a tree and Renger limped forwards towards her. There blood watering the plants nearby. Zyra released herself from the bola, dashed towards Rengar planting pods surrounding herself, let out grasping roots and deadly bloom to release  beside her vine lashers and thorn spitters, and finally on the rampage grew stranglethorns totally immobilising Rengar in a web of thorned vines. Zyra went over to Nidalee, she returned to her human form, and retreated under the elder tree, after a moment Rengar regained enough consciousness to speak a few words \r\n&ldquo;That was a great fight I give up, you have won your place as queen but my real prize to claim is Kha&rsquo;Zix heart&rdquo; \r\nHe went into unseen predator and retreated far deep into the jungle leaving footsteps behind, the vines released. \r\nZyra and Nidalee both were safe and took their lifeless bodies walking lamely to the edge of a cliff over viewing the summoner rift. staring into the distance.   \r\n\r\n&ldquo;I am coming for you..., Zyra&quot;- Maokai","replies":[{"poster":"shadowspirt","date":"2016-06-26T09:20:17.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"luv this {{champion:143}} {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"AVATAR2000","date":"2016-06-25T11:44:01.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi all fellow summoners hope you enjoy :)","replies":[]}]}
