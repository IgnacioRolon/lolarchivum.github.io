My first suggestion is to do a quick relog. If you still don't have it, submit a ticket to players support (https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) letting them know what the deal is. It's possible some loot items are just being delayed, it's certainly happened before with big releases like this.\n\nSupport likely has a high volume of requests at the moment so be patient, they should get back to you within 48 hours. Don't bump/reply to your ticket until they get back to you (unless you need to give them more info) because it will drop you back to the bottom of the queue.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-06-26T15:05:42.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Missions earn you points, points earn you tiers.
