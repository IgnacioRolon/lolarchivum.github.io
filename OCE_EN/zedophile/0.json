Firstly, I&#039;ve played on OCE since 10 minutes after the release of the server, I remember the wait for rank to be implemented etc etc. I can understand the reasoning behind limiting ranked ques at first with a high influx of players at mixed times etc etc. But now... I mean seriously? I play games at various ELO&#039;s silver to high plat just before 4am and still get ques within a couple of minutes. Clearly demonstrating that people WILL still play at said times. \r\n\r\nFor examples, CS:GO Has 24/7 ranked ques, while being a singular server based game it will only match you with people in your region, sure it&#039;s a bit of wait at 4am-5am for a queue but you still get them, League being a much bigger game than CS:GO should have no problems with being able to keep ranked queues open permanently. That&#039;s just my piece, thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-05-05T04:32:42.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because the server population is too low.\nThis is also why we don't have a permanent queue for Twisted Treeline, or Normal Drafts.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Enzone","date":"2015-05-04T23:44:39.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree I often play ranked games very late at night/early in the morning and I have no troubles.

This is not intended, I am intended to verse other Diamond 5 players. That is why the queues are turned off at 4AM, even though they should in fact be turned off from 3AM - 10AM. Since at 8AM - 10AM I can also get into challanger games or low plat games.","replies":[{"poster":"Zedophile","date":"2015-05-04T22:48:56.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mean, fair enough if even high ELO was disabled.
