You can edit the config file manually and have it reset to the smallest size by following these steps;\n\n* Leave your client open, just not in a match. Find the PersistedSettings.json ***and*** game.cfg files in your Config folder. Find the below settings in each;\n\n> ItemShopResizeHeight=0\nItemShopResizeWidth=289\n\n* Change both numbers in ***each*** file to 0, save and close them. Now start a custom match and see if the window was shrunk down.\n\nYou can also hard reset *all* your settings, and while slightly easier, sucks when you have everything else the way you want it. This way you only reset the shop window size. Let me know if that helps.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"waterpixel","date":"2016-01-24T12:04:49.101+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"damn thank you so much, i really needed it thanks for the help man i appreciate it","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-01-24T18:47:11.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anytime\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/a1b3153b844387ef52d2ac08b68abe10.png","replies":[]}]}]}]}
