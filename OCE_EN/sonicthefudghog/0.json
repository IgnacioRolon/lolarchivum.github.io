If you know someone who hasn't received the \"warning\" punishment(s) before a perma, I'd suggest you tell them to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and attempt to get that sorted (that is, of course, assuming they're not lying or forgetting/misrepresenting relevant information).\n\nThe kind of things that *can* result in a \"straight up perma\" are Third Party Software (such as scripts or bots), chargebacks (which can be reversed once the chargeback itself has been sorted) and security bans (which can be reversed once the account has been secured).","replies":[{"poster":"rand56432","date":"2019-02-20T19:18:57.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot skipped my 25 chat ban for me simply complaining that every game my team and not the enemy is dogshit and asking to ff no harassment or abuse or flaming anyone. riots punishment system is a flawed joke thats why trolls/greafers wont EVER get banned but if you use a bad word or tell someone off you get instafucked","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-02-21T03:47:01.665+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely understand people feel this way about the systems in place, and (to en extent) why they feel this way. So far as gameplay offences go, you wont get any arguments that it *should* be much more efficient than it is, though it's also important to consider that it's a lot harder to figure out the distinction of someone having a bad game and intentionally screwing over their team than it is to figure out that someone is being a complete ass in chat, which is why the chat punishments might *seem* to take precedence (they don't, they're just a hell of a lot easier to deal with, and can primarily be done with the automated systems).\n\nAs for your specific case, I'd recommend you appeal by submitting a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) if you haven't done so already, and you can feel free to start a thread regarding your case, post your chat logs in it and get some feedback from the community and volunteers (you're definitely not obliged to do so, but if you genuinely shouldn't have received that punishment and Support doesn't help it would likely be the *only* way to get help).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-02-08T01:43:12.453+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Complaining about getting let off on a warning???\n\n{{sticker:sg-lux-2}}","replies":[]}]}
