I've done nothing wrong, I wasn't toxic and I'm confused as to why they're reporting me. \n\nIn a game where I got mid, they banned my Lux even though it was shown that I wanted to pick the champion. I was then forced to play Ahri even though I was a bit rusty on her and ended up feeding a bit. Everytime I died, they would ping my death. \n\nI don't know what I've done for someone to hate me so much","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-01-07T05:18:37.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Blank out the name or riot will delete post.","replies":[{"poster":"Peach Yogurt","date":"2018-01-07T05:22:41.148+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2018-01-07T05:25:11.405+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"No name and shame to discourage witch hunts","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-01-07T05:34:46.689+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Some people are just d!cks like that. So long as you're not doing anything wrong, there shouldn't be anything to worry about. Even if you were to get punished, there's always the option to appeal, which should work so long as you didn't break any rules or anything.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-07T09:38:43.386+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Ha","replies":[]}]}]}
