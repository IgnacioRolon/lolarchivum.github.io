Each bundle has a default price which is equivalent to each Champion and Skin involved in the bundle. The in-game shop should take into account any champions and skins from within the bundle that you already own. I am not logged in at the moment so I am unable to verify any info I can give you in regards to this issue. But it is possible that what you own has already been accounted for and the price of 3685 RP is legitimate. Do not forget that the Battlecast skins are fairly pricy in comparison to the skin list. \n\nBut if you have any issues that I wasn't able to help you with, which I believe I haven't please lodge a ticket with SUPPORT.\n\nRegards,\nlols =)","replies":[]}]}
