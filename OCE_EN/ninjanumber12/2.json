I've had this happen with Rek'sai twice \"rek\" doesn't leave me with any results. and yasuo (yas) aswell as a couple of other times. I then try and find them amongst all the other champions and time is running out and I can't see them (unsure if not there or i'm blind, probably the latter but still) and I get so flustered time runs out and I miss a ban. As you can imagine this makes my whole team rage, often causes someone to queue dodge and starts my game off badly, sometimes causing me to go on tilt. Has this happened to anyone else? Should I submit a ticket?\r\n\r\ntldr\r\nSearch bar in champ select not working when I type a champions name in causing me to miss bans. Does this happen to you? Should I ask RIOT to look into it?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-08T05:14:48.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"If the champ doesn't show up, the enemy doesn't own said champ (which is why it can't be banned.)","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-08T06:16:23.597+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This.
