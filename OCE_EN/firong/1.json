Then, he gains rage.  Attack speed and bonus magic damage in auto attack are provided by rage.\r\nIf this meter fills, natheticus will gain double attack speed and double attack speed limit, but half the damage. He also gains CD reduction and mana regeneration in a few seconds.\r\nIn addition, when his ability power reach a point, it will start to provide critical strike chance, dealing more magic damage when he basic attack.\r\n(This is the only champ that has three bars and also a mage that gains attack speed and crit chance.)\r\nQ: The orb of chaos\r\nNatheticus throws an orb at a location, dealing magic damage to the area.\r\nThe enemy in the center will carry this orb, after 1 second it detonates, make enemies near it flee from it and receive an extra damage.\r\nW: Tearing shadows\r\nNatheticus raise his hand, create a wall of void that absorbs enemy projectiles in 1 second. Then, if he    successfully blocked at least 1 projectile, he can send these shadows to a direction, root the first enemy champion it collides with, dealing magic damage continuously. Deals additional damage to shields. \r\nE:Prelude of doom\r\nNatheticus target an enemy, deals a small amount of magic damage on him, then, if this target is  damaged by natheticus in the next few seconds, a blast will set up on him, dealing magic damage (based on how much damage natheticus dealt) to all enemies near by. This effect will be triggered immediately if he is killed.\r\nR: No strings on me!!!!\r\nNatheticus remove all effects on him, and based on his rage, dealing magic damage in a vast area.","replies":[]}
