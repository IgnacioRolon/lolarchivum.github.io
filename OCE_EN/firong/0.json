(Not a pet like old malzahar&#039;s passive)\r\nThis spirit will attack more and more rapidly for the same target, it&#039;s attack can only stack once for Udyr&#039;s passive, and will disappear after a few seconds.\r\nW: Resolute of the tortoise:\r\nUdyr create a wall that stops enemies from dashing through but can walk through normally before a delay. After the delay, it will be considered as a terrain that last for a few seconds.

During the stampede, Udyr  is immune to any crowd control and cant cancel this ability. This charge will be stopped if any allies of Udyr collides with a enemy champion. This enemy will be marked by Udyr&#039;s passive instantly.\r\nAllies can join the stampede by right-clicking on Udyr when he start charging.  Then they will gain the same effects on him.(Including the execution) When he start charging, they will stand behind or aside him.","replies":[{"poster":"FIrong","date":"2017-07-19T23:23:05.613+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sigh why no comments at all","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-07-20T10:42:01.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cause udyr is good anyways","replies":[]},{"poster":"jigglejigglwoosh","date":"2017-07-28T23:59:57.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"why did you think anyone would want to talk about your lame ass champ ideas","replies":[]}]}]}
