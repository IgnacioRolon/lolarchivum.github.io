Though young; it had begun its natural cycle, evaporating any signs of day, bringing forth the starring stars and moonlight: shining as if by magic, assisted by the constellations onto the man aged past his time and the young child. Together around the make-shift hearth burning intently, snapping wood, illuminating the lurking shadows. The man began to tell a tale passed along from his father and his father long ago, &ldquo;On a night much like this, my father and his father tells the tale of a mystery, a warning possibly of long ago&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe Blessed Isles was once a sacred place of beauty, a home to many creatures and plants, home to luscious forest teeming with life although now is in the very distant past for corruption had enveloped into  The Shadow Isles, formerly known as the Blessed Isles is an island known to few, home to many mysterious abominations. Legends tell of the terror awoken by long age conflict between a king and his forgotten empire leaving behind the legacy of eternal suffering.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n&hellip;.. And deep in the depths of the winding, twisted trees, beyond the pitch darkness, through the thicketed fog in the not so mystical place: is a place where none dare traverse to for their and there simply lies, consequently, the unknown. The stench of the rotting dead overarch by countless of the undead, never blown away from the gust of unforgiving winds created by the screams of the tortured, only playing to its dreaded atmosphere. Deafening cries of the tragic souls confined masked by the horrors of ages past, haunt the grounds into what is now the norm, however, permanently is the emotionless sound of a shovel constantly ploughing tormented soil from one spot to another onto the indistinguishable parts of what was once human.\r\n\r\nHe or more preferably by the masses: it, lets out a sigh, a groan of sorts as the dazed imagery of reality shone darkly yet vividly as he recalls the events of nothing piercing its disappointed expectations to the epitome of tragedy that is Yorick,Mori. An enslaved soul? Possible. A ghoul? Maybe. Human? Definitely not. Some believe he was once human, a mortal inexplicitly dragged into the land of the lost, forever a slave to the dark abyss. Few know and fewer understand his existence.\r\n\r\nShrouded in the heart of the Black Mist laid a figure clothed in what can only be described as ragged cloth torn through the rough treatment of his predicament although one cannot be sure. Small in stature, the man wandered as if aimlessly without a soul, without purpose towards where and nowhere.\r\n In the distance green, cursed flames emitted light proportionate to a dying lamp, accompanied by the cries of imprisoned spirits, followed by_ soul-__stirring_ laughter capable of breaking ones soul, solely belonging to a thing beyond insanity. Hidden in the furthest edges of the island, a cavern filled with ~~a dark, secret past~~ webs of thickness beyond compare, home to a being unworthy of _redemption_ from the gods, however most disturbing of all is the bewitching sense of beauty emulating safety in the presence of the beast before the slithering darkness swallows whole into nothingness.  Quite near the cavern, the tides of darkened water flow a natural yet unnatural, ephemeral flow outwards and towards at the same time as if the existentialism of singular direction was non-existent.  \r\n\r\nAllured by the scent or perhaps the presence of a &ldquo;living&rdquo;, his unimpressive height of insignificance, nor his circumstances to the ghoul&rsquo;s desire for the living, as few approached in hopes of clinging onto any form of life. The man seemingly unfazed by the impending creatures continued his aimless walk through the twisting pathways, through the insatiable Black Mist towards a place of alluring mystery.\r\n\r\nFar off in what was once sacred forest, movement began to stir the waiting stillness, among the boundless amounts of corrupted trees, below the canopy of branches, ghostly eyes: a colour between green and blue highlighted itself, while between, laid the unnatural curve of a crooked mouth on a body twisted and torn apart before being attached countless times beyond belief. Earth shaking roots began its twisted advance, heading onwards through the dense woods. Malevolent magic filled with vengeance radiated from the giant; crushing the ruined trees and dead foliage, fending itself against the hungry as it escaped to the distant oceans, leaving behind nothing more than a grand eruption of discoloured water in the shape of a treant.\r\n\r\nViciously gnawing at the man&rsquo;s legs, blood gushed openly allowing more and more blood to be lost to the ghouls. Bite marks scarred his body yet his expression did not suggest even the slightest of the immense pain of being eaten alive, of which hinted the absence of something human. Just constant, cold unyielding movement emitted any form of his existence in the midst of the ravenous ghouls.\r\n\r\nA foul stench reeking of the dismembered: a culmination of many tragedies loomed over the arriving man. Silence with a tint of sentimental attachment lingered faintly before the thousands upon thousands of shabby stone slabs seemingly awoken from their slumber, gradually appearing one after the other, however none without name, none with nothing except the markings of the letters &ldquo;Y.M&rdquo; engraved thoroughly with considerable care. Slowly reaching a crescendo until the emotionless sound of a shovel guided by a non-existent metronome could be heard clearly, constantly shoveling one pile of dirt onto another, creating holes into graveyards but for who or what is perhaps a mystery too ancient to understand. \r\n\r\nAn enigma if not for the fear invoked by its presence, approached the man who continued to be torn apart flesh by flesh. Met only by the towering gaze of dim myrtle eyes defined and contrasted by the darkness due to the hooded clothing. Its giant figure stood hunched back, obstructing the mans&rsquo; progress, though he had not attempted to move anymore. Both in a stand off, stared into nothingness, neither one making the slightest of movements, the presence of the hooded anomaly appeared to merely be nothing to the hunger-ridden monsters. Faded turquoise energy radiated the enchanted shovel in the firm grasp of the shovel bearer drastically travelled through the air, abruptly breaking the silence, connecting side-on to the temple of the man, concocting a recipe of spraying blood of the missing head. The ghouls rushed towards the head far from sight, the body descended lifelessly onto the earth as the shovel dug deep into the tarnished chest of the man, digging deeper and deeper, further and further, gushing out the crimson blood now flowing freely&hellip;.\r\n\r\nA wisp of opaque and transparent mist floated above the top of the shovel, taking the shape of a sphere. Once again the empty sound of a shovel digging, found its way back to the start of its reanimated sequence;always digging. The form of the soul being nothing more than another one among many claimed by the gravedigger for the endless thirst for life of the Shadow Isles.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                                                                                         Epilogue \r\n\r\n&ldquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;And so is the curse of the Yorick Mori family&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nNight hung heavily onto the world, while the moon persisted with its shining lights onto the quiet night. The sound of silent wind hushed the silence as the boy pondered over the meaning of the tale. A voice hints a few incomprehensible words,&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip; I&hellip;&hellip;.. viable&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;yet&hellip;.. .....**rework**.....?&rdquo;, passing as a whisper with the wind as if it were fearful of being heard.\r\n\r\nEnd.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTL;DR Yorick exists.{{champion:83}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}
