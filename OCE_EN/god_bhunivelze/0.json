I may not even try in games where its a group of friends vs a smaller group of friends or just solos. riot says It is suppose to mirror the lobbies so that if there is a duo on one side, it should also be a duo on the other team, that is not the case for me.\r\n\r\nSo if the match making makes it unfair, I make its 4v5.
