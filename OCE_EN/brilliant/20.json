They should easily tell you who called first.

I've noticed that I generally get less problems concerning player behaviour in Normals than I do for Ranked matches as well as have better skilled players matched with me, you can't say the two are similar MMR/ELO,","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-18T04:55:19.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are right.
