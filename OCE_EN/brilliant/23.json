Is it that there seems to be clouds generated from the internal graphics card? Or do you mean that anything viewed on the screen at that angle has a \"cloudy\" quality to it?\n\nIf it's the latter, then there really is nothing you can do about it. It's based off of the screen's viewing angle (the point at which if you view the screen, its visual data cannot be interpreted by human eyes). Theoretically, you can replace the screen, but that will void your warranty and most likely result in your laptop ceasing to function all together. If you haven't deconstructed a laptop before, and put it back together, then it would just *cost* too much to get the equipment you need to do something like that. You'd be better *off* getting a better laptop. Maybe get a gaming-specific laptop to ensure it doesn't happen again?\n\nIf it's the former, then there's hope. It could be an issue related to your graphics driver, which would be purely software. You'd have to download the latest graphics driver's from your vendor's site (which I believe is AMD, though you won't know for sure until you do a dxdiag check) and see if that works it out. Otherwise, it might be something else such as malicious software doing it on purpose to detriment your gameplay (which is the least likely of all, but still possible).\n\nAlternatively, you could just make sure then screen is perfectly parallel to your face. It's not always practical, though.","replies":[]}]}
