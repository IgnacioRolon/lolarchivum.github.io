And what ive noticed is that during the previous meta riot was balancing left right and centre, but currently they make next to no changes, when its clear that tanks are beyond broken at the moment. The reason for this is simple, the current meta enduces more drawn out teamfights, better for esports. This stupidity from Riot to balance their game around esports, which represent less than 0.1% of their player base if costing them players, especially considering all the better alternatives not available to us. Well im off to play Heroes of the Storm, why? Because all my friends have started playing there.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-06-01T13:16:24.666+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone who says tank meta is broken doesn't know how the game works frankly imo.\n\nIf tanks can build both sustain and damage to come after you, why shouldn't you as a squishy be building damage that has sustain attached to them to survive the encounter?\n\nAlso you have Arm Pen, MR Pen, %Hp etc in your itemisations, use them damn it.\n\nYes a few of them are stupid, sure, but tanks meta problem as whole is mostly L2P related imho.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-06-01T16:50:35.281+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know the funny thing is the only people I see who complain about the tank meta are people who have never really played games.\nSo mostly the younger players.\n\nI've been playing LoL since season one, and honestly I mostly hated season three and four and the bullshit that was Assassin Meta.\nDo you know why there was so much \"balancing\" happening during the Assassin Meta? Because Assassins are practically impossible to balance.\nTheir design in LoL, DotA and any MMO is to burst down targets with practically no option for the target to defend itself, how do you balance something like that?\nThe only way is to improve defense options, and give people a reason to play Tank.\n\nIn MMOs the reason to play Tank is because you'll find it easier to find a group for group content, much the same as a Healer. Damage dealer classes are a dime a dozen (or more like a dime a century) so it's rather often you'll find yourself highly wanted for group content if you are a Tank or Healer.\n\nIn MOBAs Tanks offer many things ranging from soaking up damage as the name suggests, to being a primary source of fight initiation or disengage or even stupendous amounts of CC to curb stomp that annoying piece of crap {{champion:55}} (Sorry I mean perfectly respectful and entirely skillful selection).\n\nSomething that I really enjoy in League when I play as a tank is that there are many choices in how to do so.\nSo let's take a look at my favourite tanks!\n\n> \n\n{{champion:33}} Is an unstoppable beast that shines most brightly as a counter pick to a full AD team, especially when that team is AA based. Not only is he able to force an enemy to attack him, doing so causes the enemy to harm themselves. While Rammus' abilities scale off AP his auto attacks pack a whollop thanks to a percentage of his armour adding to his AD, many a game I've played against full AD teams where I've enjoyed playing Rammus to the point I was giggling like a schoolgirl as I had 500 Armour 400 AD and a single AA from the enemy had them chunking 1/3 of their own health thanks to Rammus' W and Thornmail.\n\n{{champion:89}} Now Leona is an interesting champ, I love playing her but I hate playing her as a support.\nSo what do I do? I play her Jungle!\nYou ever face that Leona that fears no man? That goes ham tower diving you even though she only has 1/20 of her health and no mana? She picks up her team a triple kill leading to your team losing two towers.\nWell imagine one of those Leona's but with actual items instead of the lack of items a support has. Not only is the unstoppable she-devil tankier but instead of getting that triple kill for her team she got it for herself.\nLeona rocks that CC like six inch pumps on the run way. She knows your Katarina is fed, but she don't care, she'll stop Katarina's ult before it does one tick of damage, she'll jump on your back lines and pin down your damage dealers while soaking up as much damage as she can to let her team ravage the opening.\n\n{{champion:44}} He's the crowd favourite, the outrageously gorgeous Gem Knight, dazzling your women and imbuing your men!\nWhen I think Tank Support, Taric is that thought, though once again I don't much like playing this one as a support, Top lane is where I love me some shattering action.\nHe's packed with a Heal, an Aura that gives nearby allies a percentage of his maximum armour which can be detonated to reduce enemy's armour, a stun that is absolutely fabulous, a ground shaking ult that blast out tones damage while granting an aura that gives allies AP and AD (double the effect for himself) and above all else his passive is Sheen, but scales off his armour rating!\n{{item:3025}} is the best fashion accessory for this hunk!\nAs a support Taric offers a lot to his Marksman, his heal, his stun, the protective armour aura and when going all in he can reduce the enemy's armour helping his carry to deal more damage. Post level six this can be even more potent with the additional AD and AP aura from the ult.\nAs a top laner I find Taric to be somewhat of a bully, able to force away the enemy by shattering their armour and giving a good love tap with his hammer thanks to his passive.\n\n{{champion:14}} Now what to say about this big guy? Hmm, well I really want him to get a new skin, perhaps Armour of the Fifth Age Sion! Oh baby! Could you imagine this titan of an undead juggernaut in a fluffy pink loincloth? I CAN!\nI never really played Sion before his rework, I didn't much enjoy him, but post rework Sion has rocketed to be one of my favourite champs.\nWith health % runes and Cinderhulk Sion ends up with an amazing amount of health that endlessly scales thanks to his passive on Soul Furnace.\nMeaning that unlike other tanks he can afford to get some items that help with his high vulnerability to being kited.\nOften I enjoy {{item:3153}} and {{item:3078}}  on Sion, but since the rework on {{item:3071}} I have taken to replacing Triforce with it.\nWhen played right Sion will stick to you and not let you go, in team fights he offers armour reduction, and plenty of CC as well as being a glorious damage sponge.\n\n>  \n\nTanks offer a lot in this TEAM based game, and it is very much time that we see TEAM based play again. The last two seasons we've seen very much selfish lone wolf play from the Assassin Meta, every game you'd have an assassin top, mid and jungle on both sides.\nEach of them would look out for just themselves aiming to get the most kills and nothing but.\nWith the Tank Meta we see people focusing on team fights with their TEAM in mind, taking to split pushing more as an option, objective control is more thought of.\nI see the game being played as it SHOULD be played during the Tank Meta, and I am seeing less and less of people thinking that the way to win in a MOBA is buy going 50/0/0 and more thinking you win by getting objectives.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2015-06-01T15:01:24.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love tank meta.
