The last remaining one I think is Riot Benji. Is there a particular reason why riot staff no longer do this?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-23T10:32:14.960+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"As I understand it they always had the choice, and many chose not to if their Riot account was the main account they played on, simply because people treat them differently when they have Riot in their name. It's not the funnest experience to be abused (about stuff you may not be in any way involved with no less) or constantly harassed for free stuff in your leisure time just because of that one little word.\n\nI'm sure there's positives as well but you get the idea why a lot of them would want to leave it out. There's also a few that have Riot attached to social media accounts but not to their game accounts and so on.","replies":[]}]}
