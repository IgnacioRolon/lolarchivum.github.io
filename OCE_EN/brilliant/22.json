Over on [Whirlpool ](https://forums.whirlpool.net.au)it is reported on the Telstra and AussieBroadband boards, with a number of online services affected.  You can also see an uptick of reports on [AussieOutages](http://aussieoutages.com/).  These are a few good tools to check on when weird stuff happens btw!\n\nGiven that many non-gameplay related parts of LoL are in the USA, this would explain what you are seeing.  The status page for Aussie above is the best I've found so far for the issue so I'd recommend keeping an eye on that.","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2018-07-12T13:27:27.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just updating - it looks like things are starting to normal.\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Best Mid WA","date":"2018-07-12T11:20:19.692+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I to am having the same issue, just dodged a Que because i wasn't able to select a champ!
