So someone who wins 2, will be placed in silver. This is waaaaaaaay to easy to be placed in silver, and with the new system, its very difficult for people to be demoted from silver. So what needs to change? for PLACEMENTS WITHOUT EXISTING RANK, start these people off being matched against bronze 1/2, not silver 1/2. Bring back easy demotions from tiers - if someone deserves to be in that tier, they will climb back up to it.","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2015-01-18T04:53:31.611+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"silver is only overpopulated because people spend their time getting out of bronze or getting boosted then rarely play after that","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-18T13:17:32.324+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, all accounts should start bronze 5 mmr and work upwards, you are misrepresenting a bronze 5 player by holding them in divisions silver 5-4 or bronze 1-2... and quite often what happens is, the ones which get placed into silver 5 ruin the games of players which have worked up from bronze 5 to silver 5. Also these high bronze or low silver players trashtalk the bronze 5s because they feel they are better because of their division, but really rito is misrepresenting them by holding them in that particular elo.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-18T04:48:37.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Silver is only overpopulated on OCE I think it may simply be something to do with the total population being too small and messes up the ladder equations.","replies":[]}]}
