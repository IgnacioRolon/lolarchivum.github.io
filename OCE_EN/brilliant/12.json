Rushing a sightstone gave your team a clear (pun intended) advantage and was a reward for going ham early. Considering it has always been a struggle to fill the support role I cannot imagine why on earth you would make these changes. If these changes persist I cannot see myself continuing to main support.","replies":[{"poster":"Joiksu","date":"2018-01-25T17:14:13.073+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Removing the support playmaking items is dumb. Now all supports are the same, ward bots. If Riot need a meta to follow, try season 4. We didn't have broken support items then.

If players are gonna abuse support items then supports pay for it. Imo if they made it so that you can build into the new support items from sightstone and the starter support item this wouldn't be an issue. {{sticker:sg-ahri-2}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-01-25T08:46:40.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"(it's still going to be built, because they didn't really change as much as you think, they just gave it a sightstone, only ADC is going to drop it)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T00:11:29.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Stupid frost queen eve jungle and every mid laner building it","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-25T01:21:59.009+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnddddddddddddddd?????????????????????????????????????????????? you know they can fix this in other ways right","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T01:35:33.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah thatâ€™s part of the update :) making it so jungle camps cancel gold thing but for laners they just need to destroy the items :)","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-01-25T01:41:15.454+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"but how was that even changing the game? a jgler with a support item was a free win for me. ekko with frost queen was a win for me. it was in no way possible a good item.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T02:13:15.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh it was broken lmao\nLearn the meta ","replies":[]},{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2018-01-25T05:16:45.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"It was basically just pretty op in high elo as it was a really good gold source and gold is very important up in diamond and challenger elo","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
