This is only happening on league. I have tried reinstalling league and all.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-12T11:16:37.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Strange. League should only use the same amount of RAM it uses from the start, as it loads *all* of its game data at the start of the game to reduce any frame-lag one might get in game.\n\nA memory leak wouldn't be too far-fetched. You've already repaired and reinstalled, so it wouldn't (likely) be a corrupt file or anything.\n\nWhat OS are you on? Do you use page filing?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2015-03-10T03:11:46.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"dw dude its not like they respond to our post like these at all, try your luck with a support ticket","replies":[{"poster":"Brilliant","date":"2015-03-10T08:58:02.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rioters generally forum lurk a lot, i suspect the correct Rioter to address this issue will stumble across my post soon enough.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-12T11:14:35.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uh...\n\n~~Ignorance is bliss?~~","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Brilliant","date":"2015-03-09T13:30:10.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"My Paged Pool Memory increases while i play, and doesn't decrease after a game, it just continues to increase until it hangs.
