Use that time! Basically just be positive in chat, use phrases other than just \"gj\" \"gg\" \"bl\" \"ty\".\n\nWhen it gets to the end game screen your team will probably think: \n_\"I don't know who to honour, and I don't really care... But Taric talked a lot and was kinda friendly I guess. Sure why not.\"_","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dennyliu","date":"2017-06-15T01:41:14.568+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"i've been honoring{{champion:37}}  support when they do well cuz i can remember them helping me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2017-06-15T00:23:37.039+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"I feel on some level you are right, however if you go well, makes sick plays and get your ADC the most kills, they can't honor themselves so you are almost guaranteed an honor. I guess that everyone else would honour the ADC but if they were toxic or just a bit annoying they probably wont get honoured. however I think the system does break down when people are playing with their friends, I think a lot of people will just honor their friends and leave the people who actually deserve the honor out of the equation. I am not sure if they have implemented a system  like the old one where honors from friends count for less, but I think there should be something like that for those occasions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PrimalAsuna","date":"2017-06-16T05:45:02.835+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since the update dropped  I've gotten most of  my honours when I play support, 2 or 3 per game consistently when I do so.\n\nAdmittedly I'm kind of stingy with my honours, only honouring people I think deserve it eg. the person who rallies the team and gives those select few words of wisdom whether it be encouragement to the top  laner who is 0/5/1 which pulls them up from their tilt or the person actually organising the team by vocalising a plan and communicates everything.\n\nIt might not be the case but maybe in the game you play the people in your team just don't honour anyone?","replies":[]}]}
