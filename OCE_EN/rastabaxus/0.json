Was probably about 9:45pm or so on 8 June.\r\nI then exited the queue to go refresh my water and right at that moment it must have popped, and said &quot;you can&#039;t leave, a match is found&quot; or something like that.\r\nI thought ah well I can grab water in loading screen, so I clicked &quot;Accept&quot;, and 5/10 player icons showed up, then nothing happened and I was returned to the main screen, with the &quot;play&quot; button available at the top.\r\nI assumed that therefore someone hadn&#039;t accepted (only 5/10 showed as accepted, suspicious - only showed my team? enemy team?).\r\nI went to grab a drink of water, thinking all was fine. This was why I was exiting queue in the first place.\r\nI came back to pc and joined queue again, and it said I was already in a game!!! I had NO WARNING of this.\r\nIt was up to me with 35s or so to pick a champ, and at that point someone must have quit because it then dropped me back out to start screen.\r\nAll very strange. I hope nobody lost league points from that.\r\nI&#039;m a developer, business and game, so I&#039;m not ignorant to how complex the client must be. I think there&#039;s a timing interaction issue with the edge case of exiting the queue at the same time it pops (either just before or just after - maybe before the client has been informed the queue has popped but after the &quot;x&quot; is clicked?).\r\nI know this behavior is bad and undesirable for anyone, even if it would be very rare.\r\nI think it&#039;s worth fixing, it may be very rare but that is a serious bug.\r\nThankyou.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-10T07:52:44.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If a red reads this, and something is actually done about it because of it, I'll name my first-born \"Barf Feet\".\n\nGenerally bugs go in the [Report a Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) board.","replies":[]}]}
