Does Riot plan on making any special content for purchase using a large amount of IP for those whom have been dedicated players long term. For me personally I own all the content in the store and can easily buy new champions with the IP i earn between champion releases, so therefore my IP just continues to accrue endlessly and needlessly. I just want some ideas to be brainstormed either here or Riot for what can be done. Thanks for reading and/or replying.","replies":[{"poster":"Sloth Almighty","date":"2016-07-26T21:52:42.002+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wowzers. Here I was thinking of how we can get MORE IP by selling back runes we don't want/use (such as old lower tier runes) even at half the cost, so I can get the ones I want.\nI never gave it a thought for those on the complete opposite end of the scale.\n\nI think a specific banner for the 'seasoned veterans' of the game could work, specific levels each costing a lineal or exponential amount of IP more to obtain the next. Kind of like the stripes a general gets for service/achievements. If it were an exponential amount, then 'conquering the game' (as it were) could truly be improbable. Especially if you don't have a finite level cap, just keep it going up and up for those with ludicrous amounts of IP.\nThen you could come and compare your e-peen with other seasoned vets {{item:1058}} \n\nMaybe each level could grant something a little special too. An extra rune or mastery page, exclusive skins.\n\nAccess to exclusive runes perhaps, like multi fit runes that can be used in any slot.\nSo for example, you could have health regeneration marks (I believe those don't exist).\n\nPerhaps you could have exclusive access to a new mystery tier, things like \"Generals Presence\" where you give off an aura that grants extra hp/dmg/next attack deals reduced dmg for x seconds/etc etc\n\nOther new unique masteries could be things like;\n- reduced recall/tp time by x amount\n- reducing time spent dead\n- instant health/mana regen when on home spawn portal, for when those extra couple of seconds defending your Nexus are crucial\n- \"dragons call\" when you get a ping when ever the dragon takes damage (would reset timer so no continuous pings) would tell you if enemy is doing dragon (maybe one for baron too).\n- ability to call out a field medic every x minutes that insta heals for x amount\n- exclusive use of skills in any map, such as ability to have snowball in summoners rift {{summoner:32}}\n\n\nOther cool wank features could be at a certain Generals Level, whenever you walk out onto your lane, a red carpet could roll out in front of you and disappear after a min or so xD\n\nIm sure some of these masteries mentioned could be seen as an 'unfair advantage', but dont we all get that when starting out. When i was level 10 summoner, i was playing level 20+ summoners who had use of tier 3 runes and twice the amount of available runes etc. I had none of that.\nBut I accepted this as it was a goal to achieve and something seasoned players should have had access too. This would be no different.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Plupadew","date":"2016-06-20T01:36:07.006+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I wish you could get skins bought exclusively with large amounts of IP kind of like Hextech Annie and Soul Stealer Vayne with Hextech.","replies":[{"poster":"Pekelo","date":"2016-06-20T01:48:55.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well that is something I wish Riot to consider among other content.

He is asking for a disposal system that he gets something unique out of, not just something available to the rest of the people which isn&#x27;t really related to IP.\n\nthis is exactly what he is asking for champion mastery is unique, not many people have it and he can buy it with his ip points, he just doesn't realise it. Riot have given him exactly what he wants and he doesn't think its good enough for him\n\n> So while I believe that it is very easy to get champion mastery, (which by the way proves what I was saying correct), you keep changing your mind in the same comment.\n\nno I never pointed out it was easy, I said that it isn't  hard, there is a difference between something being easy, and  something that is not hard. As for the thing about Teemo, that was intended to show that with dedication it isn't hard and applies to the below paragraph about spending his ip.  In saying that, because it isn't that hard and he has so much ip I imagine he has plenty of champions at level 5 already, it would  definitely take less than however many  games of ip earning to get the tokens required to upgrade to level 7 than the ip cost of blue essence, that he just purchased with his 'excessive' ip (oh wait is that a use of his ip, I think it is?) . No I didn't change my mind at any stage, you just saying I changed my mind doesn't mean I did(I will admit the teemo may have seemed like I changed my mind  because the point wasn't fully explained). \n\n\n> &quot;I left links in a previous comment that screenshot my store.

Thanks for the comment.&quot;_\nif he doesn't want to play games that is  his problem. He has his reward for all of his ip, he would definitly have a net loss of ip in playing champions to level 7 mastery and buying the champion shards, as it takes about 3 shards for each level which is 6k ip which he would definitely not make going from level 5 to level 7 since he should have alot of level 5s already.\nif he doesn't want to plat the game, that is his problem. \n\n\ntldr; didn't change my mind at any stage\nyour shit talking of me 'changing my mind' doesn't mean your points are correct, it is just useless ranting by you.\nyes champion mastery is the reward of having a tonne of ip,(doesn't make it a good reward, it just is the reward) \n ------------------if the OP doesn't like it he can go do something else (especially since he claims he doesn't want to play anymore)\n\n\nI will admit however, it is a kind of bad reward for having played so much of the game. Riot should implement something more, but what I have said is correct.","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-22T10:08:16.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never shit talked you, just trying to get you to understand that your comment on this post is clearly fucking not what he asked for, I'm ending this argument because you are just going on and on about champion mastery and it had no relevance in the first place.","replies":[{"poster":"Pekelo","date":"2016-06-23T22:23:32.972+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whilst I agree with you wholeheartedly I can't help to notice you haven't put any ideas forth yourself.
