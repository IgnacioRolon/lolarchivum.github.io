That is not the issue. I havent logged on in 6months. I didn&#039;t even remember having the restriction but after playing 2 games it still says 25 game restriction. Isn&#039;t that number supposed to go down each game so eventually it comes off? I don&#039;t know how much has changed since I played. Maybe its a permanent chat restriction. If so, could you please stop the pop up appearing every time I log in? If it is not permanent then maybe there is a bug there for you to have a look at as to why the amount of games needed to play to lower the restriction is not going down.\r\n\r\nThought it needed mentioning to you :) if you know about this issue/bug then forget I said anything :)\r\n\r\nThank you all\r\nSee you around the games","replies":[{"poster":"You Pick My Hero","date":"2017-05-17T06:18:12.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just got a new notification in the notification bar saying 15 more games.
