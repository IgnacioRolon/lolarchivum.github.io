Everyone wants it!!! On our personal computers at home that noone else uses we all want to have the passwords auto login so we dont have to type everytime.

Especially for a game on which you can spend real money and does not yet have two factor authentication. Roommates happen. Siblings happen. Things happen. You shouldn't be in the habit of leaving free access to your valuables no matter how unlikely you think it is someone is going to be using your home computer. It really isn't that hard just to type in a password.","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-02T11:45:08.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"oh so true, yet when i read the post i thought i want this lol, im on both sides XD","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-02T12:33:03.827+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is an argument for convenience, but when the risk is losing your account to the reward of saving 1-2 seconds every time you login, is it really worth it?","replies":[{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-04-04T09:25:41.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my point was, most people would prefer Nightjar's point, until they think about it for 10 seconds, then they realized how bad an idea it is","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-04T12:45:16.455+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah, I wasn't trying to invalidate your point, just building on it, sorry if it came out wrong :) The question was to demonstrate a point more than aimed at you directly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-02T13:08:06.695+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe make it optional then?\n\nI mean I don't really care much either way but I'm sure a number of people would appreciate the feature, despite its risks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-03T02:30:19.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Except when an account is compromised Riot usually has to deal with the fallout in some manner. If this kind of thing was common then the \"I got compromised\" excuse tends to carry less weight. Riot have no obligation to help people get their accounts back but they do anyway, they're not going to make that non-compulsory job harder for themselves by making it easier to lose your account.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
