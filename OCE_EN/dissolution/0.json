He is very difficult and sometimes people mistake that for weakness because they cant perform as highly as with other champions. But for those who are practiced with him, he is incredibly powerful. He stomps a great many champions in laning phase, and way outshines most mid-laners in the late game.\n\nWith his long dash and wall, he can escape most ganks relatively well. (and if he uses the wall right, can often turn a gank into a kill)\n\nHe isn't popular because he is difficult. and because the most popular champions atm are assassins and fighters, and as a squishy sustained damage dealer, who cant defend himself very well against close-combat champions. Assassins and fighters that can bypass his wall tear him to pieces.\nSo no one wants to play the hardest champ and have to VS a Fizz or Yasuo every game.\n\nThe thing is, people like playing high-skillcap champions, because its a bragging thing, no one likes to think \"I only got that kill became I'm playing an easy champion.\" it's far better to think \"I got that kill with a hard champion because I'm good!\"\nSo people play champions with a high skillcap. But what they ignore, is that they elect to play high-skillcap champions with a low skill floor, (meaning they are easy to play but hard to master). Like Riven/Kat/Yasuo/Zed/Lee etc etc.\n\nSo they can say that they play a 'hard' champion, but without actually putting in the effort. \n\nAzir on the other hand, has a high skillcap, AND a high skill floor, so not only is he hard to master, he is hard to start with as well.\nSo a lot of people think \"Why play him when i could just play Kat? They are still both 'hard' champions. But one is easy, so ill play that one!\"\n\nHe is unpopular because he is difficult, not because he is weak.\nThe champions with a high skill-floor are often underplayed because people cant be bothered putting the effort in to play a champion, when they could get the same result much easier playing a different one.\n\n_____\n\nOne contributing factor is the nerf they gave him a while ago. \nHe was almost 100% pick-or-ban in higher elo. And people weren't happy. _(because as you know, he's fucking annoying to play against)_\nRiot did nothing about it for most of a season, and then once pros were getting really pissed, they nerfed him to get him out of the spotlight.\nThe nerf they gave him was harsh _(and it needed to be)_, and he did drop out of the spotlight quickly, so people made all these videos about how it ruined Azir, and how he was crippled. He wasn't of course, it was just the you-tubers capitalising on a story, like vultures. But that vibe has stuck and so people look at Azir and subconsciously they remember the commotion about him being nerfed, and so assume that he is still crippled.\n\nThey look at his 42% winrate and think \"Man he sucks!\" When actually Riot have explained that Azir is balanced at 42% because he is so difficult that if everyone could play him and instantly get a 50% winrate, then he would be way too powerful in the hands of people who knew how to play him well. \nHe has a 42% winrate because new players play him and get 30% winrates, and Azir mains play him and get 60% winrates, so it all evens out.\nUnlike Garen for example, new Garen players, play him and get a 50% winrate, Garen mains play him and get a 50% winrate. Because he isn't difficult.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** Azir is unpopular because of his difficulty and the stigma around him. Not because he is weak. He doesn't need a buff. Buffing him would unbalance him.\n\n{{champion:268}} ","replies":[]}]}
