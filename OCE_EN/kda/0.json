I feel like people are way too sensitive on this game and the chat use to be one of the best parts of league.

The ban system is built around cry babies and those wrapped up in cotton wool. Say one bad thing that can easily be taken out of context and you've earned yourself a chat ban. Spam emote is fine (happens all the time in pro play) but BM someone over chat even if it's friendly banter is a no go. It only takes one asswipe to take it to heart of offence and report you. Trust me, I've been there. The automated system really is trash.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Skasaha","date":"2017-11-11T00:18:53.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A bit of trash talk is fine, but things like \"ez\" and \"lol noob you suck\" are neither interesting, fun nor conducive to good sportsmanship.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2017-11-10T08:08:27.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ez, noob, so bad, lol you suck is competitive","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-11-10T05:14:10.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dropping the disrespect.\n\nFAP FAP FAP FAP FAP FAP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-10T03:36:47.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I'd say only using your mastery or an Emote is allowed, i wouldn't use chat for that shit.","replies":[]}]}
