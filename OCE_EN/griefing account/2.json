So when all the plats that didn&#039;t use the new que system got their average starting plat rank i was stuck with the bottom %\n\nI understand where you&#039;re coming from , Oh look another player that thinks they belong somewhere if you&#039;re good climb bla bla bla ... if possible I&#039;d greatly appreciate it if i can get my current flex rank reset so i can play my placements again . because by the looks of things if preseason comes ima be thrown in silver ?? Now from a developmental standpoint it\ndoesn&#039;t look right if a mid plat in solo/duo que is in gold/silver ?\n\nJust had a rioter send me this from a ticket i put up ; \nhttp://imgur.com/7bnZIYJ\n\nQuite frankly they need to be fired or removed from their job because anyone who&#039;s actually played league for more then a year knows that ranked only soft resets and you&#039;ll be placed in a division 1-2 lower then where you&#039;re currently at .\n\n&quot;Focus on winning games &quot; however is a punch in the throat however , is this person under the impression that I&#039;m quing up to play ranked and spend 20-60 minutes of my life to lose or something ? Having BRONZE, SILVER ,GOLD players against Gold /Platinum /Diamonds is a fucking JOKE i mean sure if i was vsing people who where in the same elo bracket i&#039;d be fine , but with matchups that i&#039;ve been given the past 10 games it&#039;s near fucking impossible to climb it&#039;s literally luck at this point , Whoever gets the lower elo players tends to lose because at 40 minutes in they&#039;re gonna do something stupid to get caught and throw the game which annoys me even more because i&#039;ve wasted nearly an HOUR just to lose due to one autistic person being qued into a game he/she shouldn&#039;t even be in.\n\n(My thread keeps getting deleted under &quot;Help and support &quot; and keeps re routing me to this section of the forum .. wonder if it&#039;ll get deleted here ... yaay )","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-11-26T04:11:31.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, \n\nSo I am also a plat player, placed in GV when flex first opened. The reset then happened and I still got gold 5. \n\nIf you look a little bit closer, all the people that you are matched with and VS in flex probably have the same ~gold flex rating as you. Hence the matchups the look a little bit weird when you look at the soloq ratings (which are what 3rd party sites are still showing when you look at the active match). \n\nNow, you aren't going to be \"fully reset\" because if you were it wouldn't be fair to literally everyone else thought they were ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ by the reset (a huge portion of players, will also happen again on the 7th). Like Jenny said, best you can do is suck it up and climb the ranks so that when you do get reset again on the 7th, you have a better foundation to stand on. As a plat player playing in ~gold, it shouldn't be that hard. As you said, its mainly a matter of who gets the lowest players on the team. If you are playing solo, its like a 50/50 chance. \n\nFlex queue is about getting your group of buds together and having a good time in competitive play. **You at absolutely no point in this queue _have_ to play with bronze/silver/gold players**. A lot of diamond/plat players got booped into gold/low plat flex ranking. You just have to find them and then flex with them.\n\n>Quite frankly they need to be fired or removed from their job because anyone who's actually played league for more then a year knows that ranked only soft resets and you'll be placed in a division 1-2 lower then where you're currently at .\n\nYou must have been super lucky during past resets because from majority of cases I have seen (myself, my friends, players complaining on the boards) this isn't correct. Challenger/master/diamond players all have to start in platinum, and as a result the whole ladder gets shifted down. For some its only a slight shift, for others, its massive.","replies":[{"poster":"Griefing Account","date":"2016-11-26T05:10:19.498+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well i never got my reset so i wouldn't know :\\ , had a mate place silver 1 then got plat 4 on his reset tho and im like ? thefuck\n\nAnd nope they're all in either bronze - plat  flex que which makes fuck all sense to me.\n\nIt's really hard to climb when you get unranked/ bronze /silvers against golds /plats and diamonds ( if you think im talking out of my ass check my opgg matches >.< literally went on a 20 game losing spree because bronzies think it's cute to throw at 50 minutes :') \n\nPast resets ive went from gold to bronze 3-2 , last season i got placed silver 3ish and made it  back into gold within 2 days tho so it was kinda meh \n\nchals /masters and high diamonds usaully place plat 1 regardless of their rankings had a mate in d4 ( Low diamond ) go 2-8 and got placed plat 2 ? so yeah ..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-11-26T03:42:30.877+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"People actually care about flex queue ranks??","replies":[{"poster":"Griefing Account","date":"2016-11-26T05:02:24.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda .-. , i use it more as a practice que for ranked though , However since the teams im matched against aren't fair it isn't much fun .-.","replies":[]}]}]}
