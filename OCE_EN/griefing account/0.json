I made that game unpleasant ?? they made the game unpleasant by having 10 deaths EACH ! \n\nNo-one is saying you have to be positive, they're saying \"don't be negative\". There is a difference. Literally, all you had to do in that game, was mute all, play the game as normal, ff when it was available and wait for your team to accept the vote.\n\nYou do not get to unilaterally decide when a game is over, hence the vote. You also do not get to go on and on about how bad your team is as if you've never played badly in your life. Expressing your opinion that you can't come back from a bad game is not the same as \"you're all bleeping awful, open\". If you can't make that distinction, then perhaps you should limit your chat to gameplay communication, or just not use it at all.\n\n>By literally any humans standards that's reforming at it's highest level\n\nReforming is not the same as reformed. Theft is a huge step down from murder but it's still illegal. \"I've done worse in the past\" isn't a reasonable argument for getting a valid punishment revoked.\n\n>knowing you wont get season rewards because 4 people inted you and you wanted to go next\n\nYou lost your honour because of the way you reacted to the situation, not because of the situation you found yourself in.\n\n>I didn't ask them why i was punished i asked them to reverse their decision because it wasn't justified there's a huge difference.\n\nExcept the punishment was justified so they can't and won't reverse it, at which point the context they can offer is the why. You obviously disagree with the why, but that does not change the decision, nor the reasons it was made in the first place. The point was, that if you repeat the same arguments/questions, you will get the same responses/answers. That does not mean they were copy-pasted.\n\n>idk why this is such a hard concept for you people to grasp ???\n\nThe thing is I could say the same from the other side of this. I cannot fathom how people feel it is \"nothing wrong\" to persistently belittle people and essentially tell them they are worthless because they did badly in a video game. Clearly, we have very different perspectives on the matter.\n\n>If telling people to go next because their inting is toxic in your eyes\n\nI think you have completely missed the point. These things were not the problem:\n\n1. I think this game is over.\n2. *Starts surrender vote*\n3. We can't come back from this.\n\nThese things *were*:\n\n1. \"Open\", not because it's before you can surrender and your team has agreed, but because it was after the surrender vote that is a vote for a reason got denied and you wanted to make that decision all yourself.\n2. You are literally so worthless you have cost me this game.\n3. You guys are so bad you must be doing this on purpose.\n\n>i die 4times in a rank game and im usually told to kill myself or uninstall or afk in fountain\n\nHow does that make your behaviour okay? If I steal a car from John, that doesn't mean you're now for some reason allowed to steal a bike from Mike. Both of those things are against the rules, and someone else doing something worse (to you or otherwise) does not entitle you to a free pass.\n\n>opening tickets\n\nNot opening tickets, *spamming* tickets.\n\n>hoping i'd bump into a rioter that's human\n\nHave you considered that getting the same response from that many different people might mean something you obviously don't want it to?\n\n>I've got screenshots of my account being perminantly banned and having it overturned with he rioter stating they where \"Blind \" :')\n\nI'm not sure how having a previous punishment revoked/reduced for presumably being a false positive/over-punish has any impact on this punishment.\n\n>i'll just int my face off\n\nAnd again with the threats. Threatening to ruin a bunch of games and get your account actually banned because *you* crossed a line doesn't exactly reflect well on you or inspire the benefit of the doubt.\n\n>Enemy had a sook because we got carried , why ?\n\nFunny, it's almost like the team that stays positive has a better chance than the team that throws each other under the bus and sits there arguing instead of playing.\n\n>at no stage should anyone have 10 deaths in a game at that point their literally inting\n\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251620464/200018062?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251608813/200018062?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251557442/200018062?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251550016/200018062?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251326633/200018062?tab=overview\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/251310146/200018062?tab=overview\n\nAnd that's just in the last two days.
