Issuing commands took half a second longer than they should, resulting in me aiming a skillshot the wrong way because I aim it forward, fire it then click behind myself to walk away, but then the skillshot fires backwards. Pinging had the same effect, took about half a second to choose a ping which resulted in the wrong pings being used. \n\nAnother symptom is that every now and then everything would gain a boost of speed, champions even going through walls and stuff.\n\nThis was happening in my previous games but its gotten progressively worse. It started when I downloaded the most recent patch.\n\nBasically, it was the effects of lag. But, my ping never went above 50 and my FPS remained at a steady rate of 40 - 50 FPS throughout all of my games. I have heard this is called packet loss, but I'm not exactly sure what it is, nor how to fix it, if it can even be fixed. Would someone be able to help me out here?\n\nThanks in advance :)  {{summoner:31}}\n\n~Edit - This problem seems to have fixed itself, not sure how but it did :)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-29T22:55:28.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, packet loss is usually the cause of a high ping. If it was solely that, then you'd find that your ping is erratically going up to near the thousands of milliseconds and back, not just staying steady.\n\nAre you using a VPN by any chance?","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-30T07:04:06.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my ping has been stable, as I said its the delay that is really bugging me.\n\nAnd no, I am not using a VPN.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-31T02:45:17.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you use a wireless mouse?\n\nOh wait, have you recently flushed your DNS?","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"REAPER OF LADYJJ","date":"2015-01-30T16:55:17.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have the same problem, anyone help plz","replies":[]}]}
