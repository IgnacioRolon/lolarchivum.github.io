My account has never been banned, I have never had a chat ban, I don't really play ranked so I can't have had a ranked restriction, and I have well over 10 skins available purchase. Since I'm pretty sure I meet this criterion, will I receive the mystery gift? Or does being put in the low priority queue count as some sort of ban? (I got put into it once). Any answers are appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"RLG Shaky","date":"2015-01-09T12:38:47.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you should get it, you just have to wait, i was just looking though shop when my appeared about 15-20 mins ago, just wait a bit and it will come don't worry about it","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-01-09T12:40:18.126+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, I was a bit confused since all my friends that I play with already recieved theirs a couple hours ago.
