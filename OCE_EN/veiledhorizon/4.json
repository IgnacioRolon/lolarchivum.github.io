This has been going on for the last couple of patches. I have tried running repair, reinstalling, pretty much everything I can think of, and it still keeps happening. Has anyone else had this problem, if so, how did you fix it, because it's frustrating as hell.","replies":[{"poster":"PervySage79","date":"2014-12-16T05:16:42.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, interesting! I wouldn't have thought there would be a lock on the launch button functionality until the pictures have been downloaded. I guess I'm just lucky that the pictures seem to load instantly for me and haven't run into this issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-12-16T05:00:35.668+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You need to wait a bit until all the pictures on the launcher appear, only then the \"Launch\" button work as intended.","replies":[{"poster":"VeiledHorizon","date":"2014-12-16T05:04:01.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks, I knew it would be something simple haha","replies":[]}]}]}
