Takes no damage diving a turret at early levels, and insane burst, and a gap closer that does a mental amount of damage, which can be cast fucking twice, and has an ability to block damage while CCed. Is Riot so blind to how broken Fiora is, or is this intentional so that she is the flavour of next seasons LCS.","replies":[{"poster":"Niji","date":"2015-01-08T06:02:23.688+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are a noob.","replies":[{"poster":"Zximo","date":"2015-01-08T08:00:24.359+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=RainbowWindslash,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=GOA9zxPZ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-08T06:02:23.688+0000)\n>\n> You are a noob.\n\nAnd rainbow there is no need to put down your fellow summoner be cool and good luck in your future games","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-08T20:20:45.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the only time I've been able to legitimately 100% beat a Fiora in lane to the point where she can't just spawn and run to lane then all in kill me with Ult+Ign is when I've picked Jax. 8)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2015-01-08T09:29:26.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea yea, fiora is op \n\nbuff please","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-08T09:18:49.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well they did recently nerf the damage on her ult and they are reworking her.\nSo nope, they have no idea what she is like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Zximo","date":"2015-01-08T07:58:14.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try voli against her i find i rek her with voli gl mate","replies":[]}]}
