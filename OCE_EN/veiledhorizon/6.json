So, I think to myself, I need a break from LoL, so I took up playing CS:GO, (I know, I'm late to the CS:GO party,) and it made me realise something, gaming is supposed to be fun, not stressful and full of toxicity, something which LoL hasn't and has been respectively, for a long time. So long story short, I'm done with LoL, anyone who thinks this game is fun, one day you'll realise as I did, it's not fun hoping for improvements that will never come.\r\n\r\nGoodbye,\r\nVeiledHorizon","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2015-01-21T07:20:18.894+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the fun part, play ranked 5s with some friends that aren't toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-01-21T07:05:49.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is supposed to be fun, hence why you shouldn't climb the ladder simply for the sake of climbing.\n\nIf this game is no longer fun to you then sure, change the game would be a great idea.\n\nJust whatever you do, don't forget to have fun, good luck.","replies":[]}]}
