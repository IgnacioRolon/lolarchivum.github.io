I don&#039;t know how many people this would interest, but I thought I would give it a try. Anyone who likes/mains {{champion:161}}  is welcome, just add me &quot;Dessert Island&quot;. If there is already one set-up somewhere and you wouldn&#039;t mind adding me to that group, then that would be awesome too. \r\n\r\nThe thought is we can gather around and see how everyone likes to play him, use the group to potentially create {{champion:161}}  One-for-all games (when that mode is out,) and of course, show off a tag which will hopefully identify with Vel&#039;Koz! {{champion:161}}","replies":[]}
