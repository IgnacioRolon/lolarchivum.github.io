It's making it unplayable at the moment.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T08:08:20.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That seems like an issue that can be fixed, not something which you just have to work around.\n\nHave you sent in a ticket to support about this yet?","replies":[{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2015-01-22T03:28:25.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True, sorry haha. \nAnd I sent in a network diagnostics log yesterday, so I'm waiting to see if I hear back from that.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-23T09:51:01.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Would seem like a terrible thing to have to constantly check to make sure that nothing's using your internet, especially if it's a problem that can be fixed.\n\nI mean, at some point you're getting pretty fine ping. Why isn't it staying like that?\n\nWait, do you have automatic updates enabled for something? It could be that League starting up is triggering it.","replies":[{"poster":"Raijinshuu","date":"2015-01-25T11:14:13.837+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's fair enough, but I have done so. I've made everyone in their house stop using their phones/turn off computers, and it was still going up to around 800, sometimes up to 2k. \n\nNo automatic updates, either. \n\nI have to admit, it has improved over the last 2 days (a few ARAM games where it would suddenly jump to 2k ping, and then one game where 4 members of my team were all disconnecting at the same time as me, and a few normal games where it would sit at around 80 or so, and just sit at around 200-300 for less than a minute, maybe a few times per game).","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-27T07:15:08.675+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It *could* be server issues.
