However exactly MMR determines players you meet in solo queue and LP gain or lose while league system shows your tier and progress publicly.\n> \n> Everytime you win or lose, your MMR changes accordingly. Amount of MMR gain / lose depends on average MMR of players you faced in ranked game.\n> \n> During a long win streak, MMR starts to outrun your current division / ELO. In this case you would receive up to 40 points per win while lose only about 10-15. Such MMR allows to jump over division, e.g. Gold 5 to Gold 3.
