I like being part of group chats such as &#039;Looking for group&#039; and &#039;lola&#039;, i participate in them regularly. The problem is that in league of legends you can invite players who are not on your friends list. By either typing in there name or by being in a group chat with them and mass inviting people. This is extremely frustrating to see my league client flashing yellow thinking its a message or an invite to a game from a friend, but it turns out to be some random in one of the group chat trying to play a game of aram or hide and seek. My suggestion is to have an option in the settings that allows you to disable game invites from players who are not on your friendslist. I don&#039;t think it would be too hard to implement but it would really be effective and useful.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-31T02:56:22.079+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations\n\nI thought this was already implemented.
