Though, if the hacker attempt to submit a ticket to RIOT pretending to be the owner of that account and requesting a password change then Riot support will treat this serious and begins to ask recovery questions. Sorry I am unable to provide you with the questions but hope I answered your question :D. \n\nBasically, you'll need to answer most of the questions as accurate as possible. Riot will be aware that you might not remember all the details 100% on an account that was for instances created years and years ago.\n\nHeck, I don't even remember what my last RP purchase was.\n\nYou'll just need to be as honest as possible. If you don't remember the answer to one of the questions, just say that. \n\nAs long as Riot is happy with the answers provided, and is confident that you orginally made the account, then you should receive it back in due time.\n\nThey may, however, ask you some other questions if your answers are not adequate, but it's all for your own safety.\n\nPlease encourage your friend to submit a support ticket to RIOT to get his/her account back. Every account is precious xD.","replies":[]}]}
