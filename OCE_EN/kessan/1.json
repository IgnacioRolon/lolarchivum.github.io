(And one leave).\n\nAre you sure you simply didn't forget a game that you lost, or even the leave?\nIf you genuinely believe something occurred that shouldn't have, I would recommend [submitting a ticket](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) to Player Support so they can look into the issue further.","replies":[]}]}
