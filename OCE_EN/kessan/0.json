In terms of escape i have had a lot of trouble getting out of situations i should be able to get out of because the jump can be interrupted mid flight, even in the apex of the jump several feet off the ground i have been knocked up by cho gath... or any form of cc. i honestly think this is the only problem she faces as a champion other than that i think she is great now.\n\nNote: you can also be hit and struck by melee spells and attack from the base of your jump location while jumping.","replies":[{"poster":"Fndrr22dxd","date":"2015-05-03T01:54:09.401+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tristana's W just has a long animation.

Maybe play more games with them to learn how to avoid the things you're having trouble with instead of coming here and complaining that something should change because you cannot be bothered learning how to play around things as simple as Rocket Jump timing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-02T01:31:57.254+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not sure about other cc's but i know that snare's and knock-ups (any displacement) interupt all dashes, that don't specifically say they ignore cc. Not sure about now but you used to be able to be stunned/suppressed during the cast time and still jump away. what you need to do is use your escape earlier or if you know whoever is chasing you has a knock-up or snare, use flash or sidestep their cc then use your rocket jump. Also you should almost never be using your rocket jump to engage because tristana is not melee.","replies":[{"poster":"kessan","date":"2015-05-02T03:21:13.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"rocket jump procs damage on explosive charge with buffed damage so you should actually use it to close ranged kills i used rocket jump to get a penta just two games ago. also i played a game just before and in the apex of the jump half the lane away i got hit by a nidalee swipe attack.. a melee attack while in the air...","replies":[{"poster":"Lauricella3","date":"2015-05-02T03:50:11.728+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe if ur in a ranged 1v1 fight but in any other case you will put yourself in a horrible position if you are exhausted and are unable to secure resets. also all auto attacks are designed so that once it reached a ceratin point in the animation (for ranged projectile appears) it will always deal the damage.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-05-02T03:35:20.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Everyones dashes can be interupted, Tristina's is just the easiest to interupt as it has a huge animation.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akivir","date":"2015-05-02T01:28:42.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Buffing Tristana sounds *perfectly* reasonable","replies":[{"poster":"kessan","date":"2015-05-02T03:24:12.562+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"not a buff, more of a fix. because if ez can flux out of a blitz pull or a grab then how does that make sense to be able to grab trist out of the air?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Twynko","date":"2015-05-02T01:29:36.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"ive heard more reasonable things from your mum","replies":[{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-05-02T03:09:44.078+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lelled a bit","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Twynko","date":"2015-05-02T01:28:28.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"The Problem with tristana is you played her once","replies":[{"poster":"kessan","date":"2015-05-02T03:18:21.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i actually play her alot. hence encountering all the problems that i have had with rocket jump.","replies":[]}]}]}
