But whenever I play with them we usually always have a bot in our team. It is retarded because the bot ints every time and we can't win because one of their players got fed by bot.

Riot have no control over how well they play, they can only remove them. They aren't there to shorten queue times, they're there because players try to *illegally* make some money. Botting isn't something that Riot allows.\n\nThe reason they aren't banned instantly is because they are banned in waves to obfuscate what exact behaviours are being detected. The reason there will always be bots is because creating a new account is easy, free and very accessible. The most Riot can do is make it as unprofitable as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"WhyM3","date":"2019-05-27T20:18:47.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hmmm - maybe Riot needs to add the 'it's a bot' alongside 'intentional feeding' - this latest wave is getting way to prevalent","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-05-28T04:44:11.992+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The 'Cheating' category is used to report bots (among other things).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
