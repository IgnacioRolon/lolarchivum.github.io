If not, feel free to clarify.\n\nAs I understand it, you can use any skin you own. All you need to do is go to the \"profile\" page, where you will find a \"search bar\" in the top right (used to search for other players profiles) and, just beside that, a small cog icon. When clicked, it will open the background selection tab, and allow you to choose what champion/skin to use as your background.","replies":[]}]}
