Make sure you also take into consideration the pick rates of certain build paths when looking at op.gg statistics.  The lower the pick rate, the more inaccurate the associated win rate.\nTry a few different item pathways in bot games to see what pathways fit your playstyle better.  Try at least get 0death legendaries in a couple of bot games to make sure your build won't be too squishy for your champ.","replies":[{"poster":"ChoclatePeanut","date":"2017-11-15T10:35:36.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ok ty :)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-11-15T08:52:47.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Runaans, rageblade, and phantom are not needed, gnar is not an adc lol.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-11-14T20:59:31.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't have a standard build for Gnar, he is such a flexible champion that you can adapt your build very strongly for the specific situation you're in.\nSo there is no 'best' build.\n\nBut runnans is a waste imo, yes it helps you turn into mega gnar faster, but as a Rioter once eloquently put it: _\"It makes you spend more time in a form where it's power is off limits to you.\"_","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2017-11-14T14:17:47.384+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would prefer either Press the Attack or Grasp of the Undying though.\n\nYour build sounds disgusting to be frank. You do not want nor need Runnans, Rageblade or Phantom Dancer.\n\nPeople also discovered on Gnar that building full damage on him is not a great idea which is why you see them build semi-damage items in cleaver/mallet then full tank.\nAlso your build doesnt take into account you will have boots. You always want 5 items plus boots (which you usually build early)\n\nRiot also made a video with a suggestion. Its not that bad, but the new Runes are dictated by your playstyle so you have to experiment usually. You cant just ask \"whats best\".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=946KgF83UlQ","replies":[]}]}
