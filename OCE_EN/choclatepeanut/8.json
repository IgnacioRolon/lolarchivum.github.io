From every game, focus on yourself and how you could've played it better. It doesn't necessarily need to be \"How could I have carried this game?\", but \"How could I have completed my jungle rotations more efficiently?\" is a great place to start. Before learning the macro game (taking objectives, rotations), I'd focus on the micro game. The micro game consists of your mechanics and how you react to your environment immediately; this includes last hitting, controlling your wave, kiting, and the works. Once you get a good handle on these, start looking at other lanes and see how you can start closing out the game by safely and efficiently taking out objectives or forcing fights.","replies":[{"poster":"ChoclatePeanut","date":"2017-11-14T10:48:36.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ty\n\nbut i think iam going to main gnar{{champion:150}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"rougeric87","date":"2017-10-24T09:48:50.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some hints to be better : \n   \n- Don't feed\n- Farm well\n- Don't greed too much\n- Use wards to have vision (it's very important) to avoid ganks\n- Don't try to 1v3, play as a team\n- Don't play Satan {{champion:17}}    !","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T11:50:51.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All great points!
