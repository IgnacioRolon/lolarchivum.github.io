I suggest a system that is harsher on the elo than as it is at present. Surrendering shouldn&#039;t happen in ranked games because no matter how far behind you are there is always a chance to take the game back. Basically, I believe that games in which you surrender should result in a loss in elo double of what you normally would have from a regular loss and double the elo gain if you are on the winning team. This should deter the sourpusses from writing out the game right from the beginning, and at least allowing you to play out the game in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone?","replies":[{"poster":"RageGrace","date":"2015-06-28T03:28:02.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Lol, I can see this working out like this:\n\n\"Hey guys, we can't surrender even though it's 0-27 kill differences.

Penalties should take the form of a learning process, otherwise nothing will change. Something great at low ELO would be an indicator of gold disparity when the surrender vote is cast - you can have no kills but a considerable gold lead. An alternative is simply requiring 5/5 votes in Bronze/Silver to surrender before 30 minutes. This being said, 'sanctions' imposed on lower ELO players will only make the community saltier. The current system is flawed in some instances, but at the moment it's the best we've got.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TouchMyKimchi","date":"2015-06-28T12:59:17.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is silly.\nThere are times when you certainly know the game is GG.\nHaving a penalty for saving 20-30min of your life is nonsense.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-06-28T09:21:57.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its a good idea man. Especially at the low elo, as some guys think its over when we are actaully winning, but they cant see it. I.E. the ememy team is 10 kills ahead, but we have all towers down (except inhib towers) and they just got their 3rd drag etc.. Three wanted to surr, but we came back and won of course.. They wouldn't admit they were wrong and probably did the same thing the next game.","replies":[]}]}
