Even though your probably right about it all, it cant be done through here, just send a support ticket to riot claiming this and provide as much proof as you can. Nothing will get done through here. Only your post disappearing.. You need to put the effort in to get these players done though. It just takes a little more effort then posting on here. If everyone does this it will make the tolling less.","replies":[]}]}
