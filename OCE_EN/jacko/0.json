I&#039;ve just completed my missions, accumulating 150 tokens and bought the God Token to get 2 icons and my load-screen border.\r\nAnyway, my question is this, now that I have unlocked the load-screen border, how do I equip it? I have a gold border from, last season, but I don&#039;t have the god-king Darius border equipped. I don&#039;t know if there is an over-ride where ranked&gt;all other borders, if I get at the end of the event, or if I am just out of the loop on where to equip it. If anyone has an answer, that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJacko","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-06-29T07:16:26.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In order to use the VS event borders you need to be using the associated skin. The same holds true for all other skin-based borders. It's also important to note that skin-based borders are separate from ranked borders, so if you have both, both will show up.","replies":[{"poster":"Jacko","date":"2018-06-29T10:54:22.095+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For-real? That's a shame. Have to spend money to use a border :(. If I had known that, I wouldn't have got gone for it an instead spent it on 10 key shards.","replies":[]}]}]}
