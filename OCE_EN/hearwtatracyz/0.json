That's a recipe for disaster...\n\nIt's the start of the season, everyone is hyped and jumps straight into ranked thinking \"This time I'll get placed in gold for sure!!!\"\nSo you're mixed in with very high elo people who because of the reset aren't up where they should be yet, as well as all the terrible players who accidentally got higher than they should.  As well as all the people who don't even play ranked, just jumping in to do their promos in the hope that this time they get gold.\n\nSoon enough,  the terrible players will fall down to where they should be, the good players will rise above you, and the people who only play to see if they get gold, get ranked in bronze and stop playing ranked until next season.  Thats when you should start playing ranked, you are far more likely to get a balanced matchup.\n\nObviously to each their own, but if you're relying on your own skill to rank up, It boggles my mind that you'd play now when you know all these players are likely to be in your tier because of the reset.  Too many wild cards.  It's an unessecary risk?\n\nWait until it all quietens down and the game has time to segregate out all the players again.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-11T23:09:28.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"On the off chance this ISN'T bait, waiting it out will give you only boosters, boosted accounts, paid for accounts, afkers, hardcore inters, and any other type of troll you can imagine. \n\nGetting in early least gives you an even chance of having smurfs on your team.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2020-01-12T02:32:31.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> On the off chance this ISN'T bait, waiting it out will give you only boosters, boosted accounts, paid for accounts, afkers, hardcore inters, and any other type of troll you can imagine.\n\nWhy?\n\n> Getting in early least gives you an even chance of having smurfs on your team.\n\nJust as likely to get it on the enemy team.\nEither way, it's still taking the game out of your own hands.
