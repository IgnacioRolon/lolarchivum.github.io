I tried my best :p\r\n\r\nFor eons, Runeterrans have struggled to explain a phenomenon hidden within the deepest depths of their perceptive constitution - the sensation that intense heat initially feels cold. Despite this bizarre trait holding seemingly no adaptive or evolutionary benefit, its presence in all races has puzzled even the most intelligent scientific institutions. Although some individuals have also recorded the opposite effect of intense cold initially feeling hot, no one thus far has been able to comprehend the reason for their occurrences. Instead, they have been left unexplained, titled only as the theories of paradoxical heat and paradoxical cold. \r\n\r\nBut to determine their true origins, we must dive into the crevasses of time so as to recall the battle that the rest of the world forgot.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nStars are the cocktails of plasma and fervent flame, their spirits fueled by a desire to consume. They are a creation built in Aurelion Sol&rsquo;s likeness - their cores forged from the collapse of interstellar clouds, and moulded so that their golden tendrils grasp at the endless expanse around them. When Sol forged Runeterra out of the ashes of a dying star, he had imagined its cosmic radiance to burn brighter than all the other constellations around it, but the planet has long since cooled into a formation of earth and ocean. Its once molten surface is now a place for life to prosper - ranging from the slums of Zaun, which contaminate the land with their chemical plagues, to the battered ships of Bilgewater which fester the Blue Flame Archipelago. Dissatisfied with the advancement of his creation, Sol has returned once again to the chunk of rock orbiting a G-type star, to revert it back to its origins of rock and magma.\r\n\r\nThe sky splits open - thousands of swirling nebulae and scintillating stars shatter into fragments of waxy dust, their pieces smouldering and coalescing until they form a solid shape. From within the cloak of asteroid debris, a figure rises, shrouded in the remnants of fractured galaxies. Ashes sift through golden talons as an expanding plume of fire lights up the night sky, reflecting off the glossy armour adorning his grey chest and shoulders. The final bout of flame leaving his jaws reveals a resplendent crown, its spirals accentuating the regality of the horns they rest under - thick and imperial like obsidian oak.\r\n\r\nChuckling softly, he snaps his claws, and the world beneath falls under an oblivion of ash. \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAn avalanche crashes down the mountaintops of Freljord, its path unimpeded by the protrusions of harshly cut rock. From beneath the craggy terrain, the guardian awakens from her age old slumber. Shaking off the remnants of the Freljordian curse, the runes binding her dissipate as she stretches out her frost encrusted wings. She preens the velvet of her tail as her horn regains its glow, illuminating the cavern with a sombre azure. The lofty ceiling is adorned with coarse stalagmites, their wet surfaces reflecting the dim light, but there is something further above which piques her attention. An echo of something ancient yet foreign causes an exhilaration to creep through her veins of cobalt ice. She cannot resist the instinct which has binded her to this land - to protect her home with wing and talon.\r\n\r\nRaising her slate-grey beak, she beats her wings and takes into flight, breaking through the compact earth and into the bitter tundra above. \r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe heavy odour of charcoal lingers in the air, accruing with every rise and fall of Sol&rsquo;s leathery chest as smoke billows from his nostrils. He surveys the environment with piercing amber eyes, tracing over the snow capped mountains as their summits gradually blanket themselves in a thin film of oily soot. He flicks his claw downwards in one sharp motion, rupturing the jagged rock below. As lava wells in its centre, he clenches his fist, causing pillars of flame to burst upwards, spraying globules of molten rock in every direction. But his amusement quickly dissipates as the fissure is swiftly sheltered by a thick sheet of navy ice - its surface smooth and unyielding like polished quartz.\r\n\r\n&quot;The wind will howl, the stone will crumble and the world will freeze beneath my wings!&quot;\r\n\r\nA shrill cry echoes through the mountain range, causing the ashen snow atop the precipices to cascade down, their inky trails serpentining along cracks of ice like tendrils of shadow. The trees below cower in fear as the blackness gushes towards them, the corrupted essence gradually morphing their limbs into twisted and withered twigs.\r\n\r\n&quot;Let me freeze the fury in their blood!&quot;\r\n\r\nHidden in the murky smog, Sol tracks the silhouette of the creature as it darts across his vision, rising and swooping with the currents of air. It hovers in circles over him, casing the smoking realm below in fractals of midnight frost with every beat of its wings. Amused, he forms a shard of obsidian in his palm, its glassy surface bathed in the soft light of stars. Grasping it between his thumb and first claw, he blows - a blast of embers cuts through the smoke, and shoots the fragment of rock at the unidentifiable figure.\r\n\r\nA sizzling sound is heard as the shape recoils, one wing flapping frantically as the other slumps at its side uselessly. Quickly losing altitude, it begins to plummet through the ash and smoke. The steel-blue blur parts the thick clouds as it gains speed, spiralling down uncontrollably as a tendril of smoke escapes Sol&rsquo;s smirking jaws. He sees her.\r\n\r\n_Wretched ice._\r\n\r\nHe sees the remnants of a dead star, its frozen core devoid of the breath of cosmic creation. Its existence marks the death of a celestial; without Sol&rsquo;s blessing, stars return to a husk of lifeless frost, their souls asphyxiated of zeal and passion. \r\n\r\nAnd thus, the ice guardian must be eradicated with the rest of the planet, so as to remove the plague of a burnt out sun. \r\n\r\nHe moves closer to the area of impact, levitating slightly above the fissures fracturing the ice until he is a few metres away from her wounded body. Her velvet tail is spangled around her in a mass of purple, lit dimly by the broken horn on her beak. \r\n\r\nHe tilts his head imperiously to one side before opening his cavernous mouth, releasing a beam of fire as she raises a barrier of dark ice in weak defence. The flames burst through, force shattering the opaque wall as shards of ice ricochet off the ground and embed themselves into Sol&rsquo;s body. When the beam of fire reaches Anivia&rsquo;s silvery frame, she is purified from the dark essence and returned to an egg. Her final cries mingle with Sol&rsquo;s harsh laughter as it reverberates through the thick clouds of smoke.\r\n\r\nBut as the ashen shroud clears, and he views the sight before him, his heart changes. Perhaps it was the shards of ice that had lodged in his core - but he felt his wrathful passion cool, dimming until it was nothing but a smouldering pile of cinders. The guardian had left an egg - its surface the chaotic black of the universe, speckled with the silvery glints of galaxies. He remembers forging his first constellation of stars, investing life with each breath as he gave them the power to burn brightly for millenia to come. But he also remembers watching in anguish, the death of his first creation, before it brilliantly rebirthed itself in its next stage of life. As the remnants of frost flow into his body, he realises that the planet should not be returned to its primordial self - for those that are living within, like the universe, are constantly grasping at the opportunities around them in their struggle to survive. \r\n\r\nHe exhales a small puff of steam in catharsis. Calling out to the soul of the star named Runeterra, he sheathes the rivers of lava and covers the ashen debris with a thick blanket of snow. As he drifts away to create another galaxy, he looks back at the quiet world, taking in its vast expanse of cities, each with their unique designs and developments. Each region glitters in pride of its own achievements as they all stand together under the same sky.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The stars look very different today.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nLegend dictates that this battle has left some fragments of Anivia in Sol, as a gift of mercy when in wrath, and Sol has in turn bequeathed his warmth to Anivia, as a reminder of passion in enacting one&rsquo;s duty. Now, the singed terrain is once again buried in fluffy snow, and no evidence remains of the battle except the puzzling effects of paradoxical heat and cold. But nothing in the universe is ever infinite, for as the stars in the sky inevitably meet their end - the evil in Anivia is slowly creeping back as the flame within her fizzle out, and Sol&rsquo;s uncontrollable wrath is rising once more as the ice in his core melts.","replies":[{"poster":"ZÅ“ X Lulu Hentai","date":"2018-10-02T02:08:45.272+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Beeig fan","replies":[{"poster":"Zaxiadus","date":"2018-10-02T08:00:11.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:sg-kiko}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AriaOwl","date":"2018-10-02T07:52:08.194+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love it !","replies":[{"poster":"Zaxiadus","date":"2018-10-02T07:53:27.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:zombie-nunu-hearts}}","replies":[]}]}]}
