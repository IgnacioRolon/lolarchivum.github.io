I live in Australia Gold Coast. I dont know about you but I recently built a gaming computer on a low budget as I do not earn enough. My full computer cost me $760. \nThat included: \n- 21\" Moniter (Full HD 1080p)\n- Intel i3 processor\n- Graphics Card (not the best but it ran LOL at highest settings).\n- Motherboard\n- 2x 4Gb RAM\n- DVD Drive\n- HDD 500Gb\n\nSo I do not know your budget but honestly look at a gaming computer for gaming. It is the best and cheapest option.\nNot going against Laptops. This is my 2 cents of opinion.\n\nThanks guys\nEnjoy\n\nI am here if you need help.\nAndyTheEskimo","replies":[]},{"poster":"TiimeToDiie","date":"2015-10-26T03:15:33.234+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply,\nare you saying that the better the graphics card the less likely it would overheat?\ndo you have any recommendations for a good Graphics card or a Processor that would handle LoL well?\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Coldie","date":"2015-10-26T03:46:03.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Laptops generally have higher heat as their fans are smaller/less powerful. Also laptops aren't really build for gaming so the graphics card generally has a lot of workload when rendering games. \n\nWhat's your budget for a new laptop first and perhaps we can work from there.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
