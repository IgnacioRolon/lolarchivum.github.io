I tend to only play ARAM due to time constraints and find that rift lasts too long.\r\n\r\nObviously keep in mind that player skill is always an issue I think that the penalty of dying in ARAM early game needs to be harder. Too many players will dive or snowball dive for a kill only for themselves to get killed. Although I know getting to gold from the kill is good I do think that with harsher time penalties or even maybe losing the gold if you die within 5 secs of a kill that it would make the game more objective based i.e. instead of getting that kill and dying yourself get a few shots on the turret and get out.\r\n\r\nmaybe I&#039;m just a whiny bitch but I figured as a 1500 game plus player of ARAM there must be others out there who see this too\r\n\r\n{{summoner:32}} {{summoner:32}} {{summoner:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-09-01T01:51:51.910+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trading 1 for 1 on aram is often good, especially if you are already low or have a lot of unspent gold. It always irks me seeing teammates burning flashes to escape on a couple hundred hp only to stand around being useless for the next several minutes because they are too low to do anything, or playing super far back on a poke champion when they have no mana and 3k unspent gold and no items. Dying late game after you've won a teamfight can also be beneficial if you have no way to heal up, otherwise you will be at a significant disadvantage for next fight.","replies":[{"poster":"Brielene","date":"2015-09-01T23:57:15.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"although you make good points the mana issue is always more so about what someone bought first. If your a heavy range poker and don't buy a mana item to start then your asking to be useless 2 mins into the game. aram is about sustained pressure its a tug of war.\n\nstill my point remains that there needs to be more loss for dying early game","replies":[]}]}]}
