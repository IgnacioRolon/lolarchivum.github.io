If you are level 30 or above you get 350 straight up Blue Essence per level.\n\nI only said this because I felt it would be unnecessary to have Blue Essence per game, due to the fact that the shards and chest contains Blue Essence as well, plus that if you have a shard with a champion you already own, you can disenchant it to get Blue Essence.\n\nAt the moment I should say that the Blue Essence system still needs to improve, even with the missions that grants you Blue Essence when you complete them, it is not good enough, unless if Riot bring in missions that grants us Blue Essence at least once per fortnight/once per month, and the amount of Blue Essence must be enough (like at least 3000 Blue Essence for completing all the missions).\n\nFeel free to share your feedback on this.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-20T23:31:35.097+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"its stupid u should be able to refund champs in for less blue at any time like starting champ u dont want or something u unlocked out of abox but want tor efunda later. also u should be able to smelt down stuff like lvl 6 tokens (farmable) for blue if u dont awnt, should be choice\n\nwhy im forced to have some crappy unpacked emote auto added to my clean account instead of being able to smelt down smh","replies":[{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-20T23:45:50.206+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Smelting down tokens would be abusable. I could just decide not to rank up to Level 7 on my one-trick, and then just farm the Level 7 tokens (which would probably be worth more than the Level 6 ones) since I'm getting S ranks almost every game.\n\nIf they're ~500 BE to sell, 10 games could get me ~5k BE + the level-up BE + any missions, which just makes earning BE even less of a challenge.","replies":[{"poster":"Hellopolite","date":"2018-07-21T00:18:16.688+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"nothing wrong with that","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"TTL Rem","date":"2018-07-20T23:47:58.104+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"At the moment, it's about 5-10 games (depending on wins) to level up, with a minimum of 900 BE. This is more BE per game than what you made in the old system (assuming you weren't using IP boosts). Using XP Boosts would level up you faster than this ESPECIALLY with FWotD.\n\nSo I highly doubt people are struggling to grind for BE. It's just like being paid more fortnightly instead of less weekly at work (even more so since you earning BE faster than you did IP).\n\nThe actual bad thing about this system is if you are 100 BE away from something, then you either need to get 2 FWotDs or level up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-07-20T23:02:49.754+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Agreed.

Sure, you may get an Ashe and a Garen shard, but then you would get 720 BE on top of that. If this isn't happening, then send a bug report to Riot (since when it was first introduced, there were instances of players only earning 90 BE).","replies":[]}]}]}
