Ive been doing alot of researching about the bans and it says on the boards that it goes 10 game chat restriction then 25 then 2 week then Perma bans, and if you dont get a punishment 3 months after you punishment it goes down a tier meaning I should be getting my 10 game chat restriction again or atleast moving on to the next punishment, the 25 game chat restriction, Ive sent tickets to riot concerning this but all I get is why I received it but they haven&#039;t answered why they skipped it, this is quite heartbreaking because you would think that a game like League of Legends would have a proper ban system and abide their ban rules?\r\nCan anyone please help me concerning this, or if this has happened to you.\r\nI accidentally posted this on the NA boards so I am reposting on the OCE boards where my region is on.\r\nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-05-22T08:43:42.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It depends on the severity of the actions.
