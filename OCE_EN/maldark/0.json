Darius). But if the order is something like what I&#039;ve described above, doesn&#039;t that mean that Armour Reduction is skewing the effectiveness of the new Bonus Armour Penetration? Since once reduced, there&#039;s less bonus armour to cut through compared to the Champion&#039;s base value.\r\n\r\nJust something I&#039;ve been pondering any help is appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-21T02:19:26.940+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically how it works is don't buy armour anymore because it has the consistency of warm butter in this AD meta.","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-21T05:30:37.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"basically this guy probs mains adc and doesnt like the last whisper changes so dont listen to him hahaha","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-21T06:16:40.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Adc is the only position i don't play hahaha xD well done.\n\nits obvious tho, armour does shit all compared to what it used to.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-21T05:36:57.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Armor reduction, flat\n    Armor reduction, percentage\n    Armor penetration, percentage\n    Armor penetration, flat \n\nhttp://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Armor_penetration\n\nbonus armour pen i guess would be above total %armour pen\n\ni swear i also thought it was %reduction over flat reduction","replies":[]}]}
