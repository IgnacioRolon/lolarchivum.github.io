The Krug buff will activate even if that auto-attack would kill the jungle creep. This means you&#039;re not achieving optimal damage negation from it.\r\n\r\nIn some cases if you&#039;re paying careful attention you can juggle your autos between creeps to not waste the buff. But if it&#039;s the last creep in the camp, you don&#039;t have a choice, you have to use it and walk off to the next camp with the buff counter reset to zero.\r\n\r\nSurely they could do a small QoL change here to help us Junglers out. Damage negation is so important, especially if you&#039;re playing someone with less than stellar sustain.\r\n\r\nThere&#039;s even a kind of precedent for this change. I remember when Lucian first came out they changed his passive so that the second auto wouldn&#039;t be wasted on an already dead creep, there has to be a way to detect and change this.","replies":[]}
