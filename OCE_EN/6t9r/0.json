Is this your first offense? I see this as punishable due to the kind of language used by yourself. One thing you need to keep in mind is how you use your words to get your message across. Failed a gank to your top lane? Politely say \"next time I ping, e in with me and we got this :)\".\n\nDon't be so quick to go on the defensive (or offensive) because that just puts you in a bad position (such as being punished for your behaviour). Regardless of what the other teammates said or done, the way you acted, or reacted, are not acceptable. You need to remember to keep your cool when playing.\n\nAs far as the type of punishment this deserves, in my opinion it deserves the next level of punishment. The levels look like this;\n10 game chat restriction\n25 game chat restriction\n14 day account ban\nPermanent account ban\n\nIf this is your first offense, 10 game chat restriction. If you have recently received a 25 game chat restriction, then this deserves a 14 day account ban.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Reported4Verbal","date":"2016-02-12T12:48:46.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Summoner,\n\nI know how you feel! be sure to use the mute feature, it's one of my favourites :p\nThe report feature is also a favourite of mine as it let;s the developers of the game (riot) know that they have some players who are being negative and they can punish them accordingly. \n\nHope i helped :3\n~Reported4Verbal~ OCE~  Always Happy To Help! :)\nARAM Main!

I'd say this would have been the deciding factor in what caused you to be reported.\nPunishments can vary from 10 or 25 day chat restrictions, to a 2 week or permanent suspension of your account. The punishment will depend on how many strikes are already against your account.","replies":[{"poster":"6T9R","date":"2016-02-11T06:02:57.319+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you have done if you had the power to chat restrict or ban?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SqueakierEel","date":"2016-02-10T11:42:46.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm going to follow on with what Sailor Jupitor said,\nIf you had no prior strikes it should be a warning\nIf you've been warned a multi day chat restriction \nand if after that you've continued to act this way it would turn into a time based ban","replies":[{"poster":"6T9R","date":"2016-02-11T06:01:41.915+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"What would you have done if you had the power to chat restrict or ban?","replies":[]}]}]}
