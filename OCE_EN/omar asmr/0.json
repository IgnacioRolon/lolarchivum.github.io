I've had previous experience on playing P2P (Pay 2 Play) leagues on Cyber Gaming (CGa). I am comfortable playing against plats/diamonds as I've played many scrims and customs games with mates. I am willing to trial after work if necessary or weekends as I am free most of the day. Add (Sacrifice x).\n\nThanks. :D","replies":[{"poster":"GREAT OCE GAME ","date":"2014-12-11T08:31:30.585+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"lol","replies":[{"poster":"Omar ASMR","date":"2014-12-11T09:12:53.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Something funny?","replies":[]}]}]}
