Another big part of being a successful support is **knowing when to roam** (to help get mid lane ahead) and when to **call objectives/rotations**, especially in low elo where everyone is a bit iffy on the communiction. \n\nYour warding seems A+ from a numbers perspective, maybe a little excessive. It really depends on where you are placing them, and if your placement is gold efficient (e.g, a pink must stay for 4 minutes to be worth). \nIf you would like, fill out a[ rift kit ward map](http://riftkit.net) for me (maybe one for early game, mid game, late game). Add me in client and link me to the maps and I can get a challenger support main to go over them with me and give you feedback. ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2016-03-07T05:30:21.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a different question then: what is a good kill participation percentage for a support? :)","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-03-07T06:10:07.987+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Depends on a number of things.\n\n* **How many kills were scored in the mid/top lane and jungle while you were in the botlane?** Obviously you aren't going to be able to get 100% (you can, it just requires a fast paced game with no early kills). Sometimes if your other laners are stomping so hard the enemy team might open mid or afk so you can't get all the kills. \n* **How long did laning phase last?** - Shorter the laning phase, more time to roam with team and help with kills. \n* **What kind of team comp you running?**- Team comps with assassins make it harder to get a high kill participation, especially if your assassins are roaming about trying to make picks while the rest of your team pushes an objective. \n* ** Probably a bunch more factors that i cant think of right now**\n\nTL;DR: Depending on a bunch of factors, I would say at least 50%, anything above 60+ is super good.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-29T04:38:18.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol @ potatoes","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-03-05T22:04:25.085+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"0/0/100","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-02-29T12:52:46.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I place an average of 34 wards a game\n\nWhat's the average game time? this stat is relatively useless regardless, but knowing your Wards Per Minute is a better indication, and knowing where to place wards is better then an excess of wards.\n\n>and have a KDA of 2.2/6.6/17.1\n\nKDA is generally a poor stat to use as a support, because sometimes you don't need to be in assists to be helping (depends on game state) as a general rule of thumb though a KDA of 3+ is generally good and means you're probably going to climb at some point, KDA of between 2-3 is mediocre, and anything below 2 means you're not doing enough (EDIT: no singed, you're an exception).\n\n\n\nHaving looked at your stats, holy crap that is a lot of pinks for silver, make sure you're placing them in the right places, because that is way too many (10+ in 30+ minute games, that's a pink every 3 minutes and 750 gold gone.), and this also means your warding is actually really high for these games, (Are these in the right positions? because you're placing about 1 a minute and they last 2.5 minutes)","replies":[{"poster":"HardcorePsycho","date":"2016-03-05T10:49:29.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I usually try and move the pinks around, if we're going agro I like to place them in the more forward areas on the enemies side, or if we're setting up for drake I'll move them to drake/baron I just generally move my pinks around or replace them if they get taken. I always buy 2 pinks when I back, just to make sure I have them on hand when we move areas. If me and adc move to top side, I usually move a pink to just behind red on enemies side, stuff like that. And then place my wards appropriately for where we're located, I place so many because I generally find unless I have 2 or more friends playing with me, nobody really wards to get good coverage. \n\nLike if my midlaner is dying, but botlane is fine, I'll generally ward for the midlaner, or even the toplaner at times when I roam, it saves me having to deal with the \"ONLY SUPPORTS ARE MEANT TO WARD\" argument.
