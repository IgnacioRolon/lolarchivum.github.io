My screen will freeze at that moment, I can see health/mana bar but cant see the model of champ, I can see a full ping bar at top and move my mouse, but my screen just freezed while other players experience a normal start of game (I checked it when I duo with my friend).\r\n\r\nI have tried reinstall and even scanning but the problem still exist. Now all I can do is ctrl+Alt+Del to call out the manager screen, end every program ran by leage of legends and restart the game (the problem will not exist during the whole game until I start another new game).\r\n\r\nbtw, it seems the problem only exist in new Summoner's Rift map so I guess the problem may related with the \"champion pop up animation\" at the beginning of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-13T23:46:47.501+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By any chance does this only happen when you play Yasuo?","replies":[]}]}
