It can't be that hard to add in a toggle for it to be displayed or not, like how you can select which border you want or which clash banner is displayed.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-23T11:52:35.453+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"There are reasons it isn't displayed publicly. I'm sure they *could* make it a player toggle, but even so there are ways to abuse that information.\n\nSure it means those who are H5 get to show it off, but what if you choose to hide your honour level? Are people going to assume that means you're toxic?\n\nThere are other ways to show off your Honour achievements (like the ward skins, limited skins and chromas) that can't really be abused in such a way. The Honour system itself is also designed much more as a \"compete against yourself\" type system rather than ranked which is a \"compete against others\".","replies":[{"poster":"Zarel","date":"2019-09-28T14:09:03.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand and agree with that, but then if they are not going to show honor then why have a slot for it when you look at other player's profiles? Its probably because you see it on your own profile, but its just another ultimately insignificant thing for me to be bothered about :/","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-09-29T09:33:16.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would imagine they want to keep profiles looking consistent so you can quickly and efficiently read and recognise what you came for. It does leave that awkward, essentially empty space though.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2019-09-22T23:40:30.281+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well on that note, i feel like i have problems my boarder not sticking.

As with any online game, connection and PC configuration are a factor that can never be 100% accounted for. \n\nFor such issues, you need to be troubleshooting your client/connection yourself, but generally, you shouldn't be concerned unless something is happening more than once or twice.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-09-24T02:04:18.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because of this:\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/d0579eb35acddbb7b4cd046e540e6a50.png","replies":[]}]}
