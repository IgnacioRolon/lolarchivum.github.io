Over all i like it, unique and being about Kai'sa (assuming all of them are) is really cool, although IMO verse 1 doesnt really get Kai'sa's character across. But, all in all a good Stanza and very much look forward to see whether you make Stanzas for Kassadin","replies":[{"poster":"Cycloniclaw","date":"2018-03-09T05:40:40.024+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the feedback, I wrote more stanzas, please read them too if you would not mind. Initially the poem is more of a third person narrative, so I might separate it into 2 stanzas instead in my final piece.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cycloniclaw","date":"2018-03-07T14:19:41.161+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here is the rest of my poem:\nA veil of darkness strikes me\nAs I first enter this reality \nThen an eerie light and chitters fill the air\nDeeper I delve into the monstrosities’ lair\nArmed with naught but that of the fallen I seek\nFor my daughter Kaisa I shall in this world havoc wreak \nIt matters no more who I am or who I may come to be\nWithin the void in order to truly see\nOne must be detached from what may be deemed reality\nAs time here does not simply move constantly\nRather it paces itself according to where you may be\nNeither do the dimensions of distance and depth\nWhat may seem like a minor crack could very well be an abysmal cleft\nWhile stalactites to the eye when reached \nCould be no larger than the teeth of a leech \n\nTraversing this dimension with purpose clear\nI had abandoned many things, including my fear\nI walk on whilst warping through the fabric of this very space\nWhich I know from my mind I may never erase\nIn my dreams I see my daughter still\nYearning to once more hear her laughter shrill\nIf only I had been there I could have saved\nMy old life that calls to me in a tantalising wave\nYet these are not but illusions to lower my guard\nWhile safeguarding my humanity of which I still held a shard\n\nHundreds of adversaries had I fell\nWithout pause I continue to quell\nWhen we will be reunited I will never know\nBut I shall never surrender to this foe\nFor the prophet of the void must pay\nEven if it reaches my dying days\nEvolved have the myriad forms that preyed on me\nBut I too had grown with lessons learnt\nMy blade slicing through carapaces cleanly burnt\nSometimes I utter \nAs I wonder \n‘Kaisa my child how may you be?\nYour face I wish to once more see.’\nThough perhaps the only thing I want more is to be\nWith all of the few who made my family\nYet for now when I stare into the abyss I can only see\nThe one known as Kassadin staring back at me","replies":[]}]}
