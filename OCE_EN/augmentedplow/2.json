Entered a game expected the biggest lost with my Vladimir friend, with an ad Ahri bot, A trolling Darius and a blitz. We decided to fight it out to the end, never giving up, and romped the competition after 33 minutes. I myself could never climb, was always blaming teammates and hated solo/duo queue. After this game and the ones that followed, I&#039;ve turned my attitude around, observing and playing the game differently, which has inevitably lead to a 9 win streak. I think what I&#039;m trying to say here is, never give up, find that champion that suits your play-style and, never flame at other people for doing bad. Its unhealthy and will NOT win you games. \r\n\r\nFrom,\r\n\r\nA Ranked Player with a Dream\r\n\r\n{{champion:32}}{{champion:8}}{{champion:32}}{{champion:8}}{{champion:32}}{{champion:8}}{{champion:32}}{{champion:8}}{{champion:32}}","replies":[{"poster":"Kenjishin","date":"2015-06-23T04:51:14.671+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have seen ad fizz, but what the hell is an AD Arhi?","replies":[{"poster":"Contrakt","date":"2015-06-23T05:21:41.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Kenjishin,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=pg3E0Kpq,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2015-06-23T04:51:14.671+0000)\n>\n> I have seen ad fizz, but what the hell is an AD Arhi?\n\nshit\nKappa","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-23T04:43:17.006+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"#InspirationalSpeechSimulator2015","replies":[]}]}
