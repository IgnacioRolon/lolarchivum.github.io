How many games have you played in a row, without any reconnect issues? \r\n\r\nAlso, if a Mod reads this, Can I get leaverbuster for not connecting to a Bot (co-op vs intermediate AI) game? Otherwise I&#039;d be willing to test a few games in that mode, since I can still play a bunch of champs and not risk the leaverbuster. Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-05-07T02:50:32.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No more issues dude.
