At 06:00 Sydney Time (19:00 UTC), the servers will be shut down and all games currently in progress will end in a draw and stats will not be recorded. We estimate the battlegrounds will be unavailable for 3 hours.\r\n\r\nsydney is only 1 hour ahead of brisbane, meaning 11.30pm tuesday in brisbane would be 12.30am wednesday in sydney.\r\n\r\ni feel like ranked que went down 4 hours earlier than it was scheduled.\r\n\r\nso that's my little rant of annoyance, as i lost the last 3 hours i had planned to play and was only 1 win away from acheiving my goal of reaching GOLD.\r\n\r\nsadface\r\n\r\np.s yes i know there was days, weeks, months to play TFT ranked, but there was also other things going on in the game and community and in life in general, plus trying to learn the game to be confident enough to play ranked and also keep up with the metas etc.\r\n\r\nbut saying that ranked ends on a certain day and time and then cutting it short isn't ideal for the player, you've given us a time so we know what we have to work with, which is awesome to have that knowledge, but then it gets taken away from you, and any progress u made seems like a massive waste of time that you've invested. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-11-05T15:51:14.833+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The ranked season for TFT ended tonight at midnight server time (11 Brisbane time). I'm not entirely sure why they ended the season before the other queues went down for maintenance, but I would imagine it's to keep it consistent with ranked seasons ending at midnight (and it falls on a patch day for other reasons) and also potentially stop the maintenance from interfering with a season end level event.\n\n>TFT - Ranked Season and Beta Pass 3 end Tuesday night at Midnight.
