Consider the number of people that have never had this issue, it is more often than not specific to your setup and circumstances.\n\nIssues like these are typically caused by local client instability (often caused by copied installs, patching errors that were never addressed etc.) or net instability (dcs during the patching process and the like).","replies":[{"poster":"The Billy Within","date":"2018-11-20T09:55:42.317+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you recommend reinstalling with every goddamn patch that gets released?

Second, no. One bad patch often cascades into later patches, like a domino effect, one bad patch can affect you for many, but if you fix the problem in it's entirety, which a clean reinstall will do in most such circumstances, then it goes away forever.\n\nFunny how I've literally never had a bad patch with League, but I have with Overwatch, does that mean Overwatch is shit and unstable? No, it means something happened with my net and/or PC while it was patching that caused issues.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"The V Kazikage","date":"2018-07-20T12:54:50.028+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yall need to rework nunu guys.
