I think it's a good idea, it's time we stop putting restrictions to things that reel in money in order to uplift that restriction. We can live with more rune pages like how League is free to play and Overwatch costs a couple of dollars. Why?","replies":[{"poster":"RozettaRose","date":"2018-10-10T16:47:22.637+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd love to be able to have more rune pages. Its annoying when you are rushing to do your runes in the last 10 seconds and then they don't save -.-","replies":[]}]}
