Meaning you have to do 5 games in total in Low Priority. Even though you were never the cause of it in the first place? I have probably spent over 10 hours waiting for the 20 minute wait for Low Priority Que accumulative. There needs to be a new function setup inside the leaver buster system to stop this. :|","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-07-08T00:44:38.925+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Hirukaz,\n\nIt sucks to get disconnected from the internet mid game (I know, I've had it happen to me too!).  Everyone occasionally has the odd issue, and leaver buster is designed to keep this in mind.  It will only put players who *consistently* disconnect from games into low priority queues.\n\nIt may seem harsh, but keep in mind that when you disconnect from a game, it doesn't just suck for you, it sucks for everyone on your team and it is certainly no fault of theirs.  \n\nWhile random connection issues like this may seem like it is not your fault, you are responsible for keeping your internet connection stable and if you have an unstable connection, then it is something that you should fix so that you do not have to leave games unnecessarily. \n\nI'd suggest as a next step you read up on our [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) article on our support site.  You could also try talking to your ISP to see if there are any settings at their end that can be tweaked to help with stability.\n\nHope that helps clear things up.\n\nMindstar","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hyde","date":"2015-07-07T22:18:52.439+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you use wifi? or cable to connect your internet? I used to use wifi and sometimes it would just randomly disconnect but ever since I started using a cable it never disconnected and my ping is not only lower but much much more stable. However I use a different ISP to you so maybe it is just a problem with them :/ also don't forget to turn off wifi on your laptop so it doesn't do something weird and use it instead of the cable.","replies":[]}]}
