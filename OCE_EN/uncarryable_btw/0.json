The thing is that you start to run into limits with the report system itself.\n\nCurrently the fastest report system we have is the [Instant Feedback system](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/207489286-Instant-Feedback-System-FAQ-), but even that takes 15 minutes to properly review each case. Ranked champion select only takes around 4 minutes, so as you can imagine there might be some concerns with time limits. There's obviously other issues as well, like the system being abused... etc.\n\nI'm not saying we should throw in towel and hand this one over to the trolls, there's some very smart engineers at **Riot** who can probably find a decent solution to champion select reporting. But it's important to acknowledge that this issue doesn't have a clear cut and easy solution.","replies":[]}]}]}
