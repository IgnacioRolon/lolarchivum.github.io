There isn't any auto locking or arguing over who called what lane first and that translates into less rage in game. If they remove the Blind Pick game option even for a while just as a trial I think alot of games would run alot smoother and with everyone useing it the wait times would be minimal.\r\n\r\nAm I the only one who prefers Team Builder over Blind Pick?","replies":[{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2014-12-05T14:59:35.035+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"if its only a trial then yeah sure. But not forever because it forces the players into strictly meta positions and roles and that's not cool.","replies":[{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2014-12-06T00:54:18.573+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"No it doesn't. You can play however you want once the match begins. If you want to play non-meta, play tb with friends and do whatever you want!\n\nWhat would be the point of a trial if it couldn't eventually lead to an entire replacement? There'd be none.","replies":[{"poster":"Vexus","date":"2014-12-06T04:50:54.163+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"because an entire replacement would be just dumb.

So removing blind pick would cripple and diversity in champion picks in normal games where you are meant to have fun in. People would see there is (for example only not implying that it is bad) zyra wanting to go mid lane then kicking her because its not 'meta'. That goes with a whole lot of other situations as well. such as people that want to try something different like putting your adc mid lane (hello s2) but would then again be kicked from the team building match making lobby. Yes you have the argument that you should do it with your friends but this is solo Q for a reason, you may not have friends to do this with. What now? make your own team and hope that everyone who joins doesn't just quit it the second they realize that you are trying something off 'meta'? anyway not to have a go at you or anything but it is unreasonable to remove blind pick indefinitely.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-10T09:38:30.212+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think I would be even more annoyed if I got into game with someone that said they were going Tank Zac and then they go AD Zac. \n\nBut that's just me","replies":[{"poster":"Reverse Kanga","date":"2014-12-11T07:43:10.282+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"That could happen in Blind Pick just as easily as it could in Team Builder..","replies":[{"poster":"Faelaren","date":"2014-12-11T09:56:13.731+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I see the difference as if I promised you cake and gave you a rock you would be more mad than if I just gave you a rock","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Goldendo 2","date":"2014-12-08T11:45:03.689+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"%%%% no.

Cause You're above comment is irrelevant as there is no Draft Normal game mode.. only Ranked Draft mode. Team builder is closer to Draft pick anyway the only difference is you don't know who you will be playing and there is no chance to counter pick. The chance to decide on team comp is the same. \n\nBut thanks for your sage insight all the same.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ArcticHorizon","date":"2014-12-06T01:00:06.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to agree.
