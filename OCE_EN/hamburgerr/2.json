Unfortunately, there are alot of things that Riot's visual team are working on right now, especially working on Taric's new model. Riot have been slowly moving through updating champions though and I'm sure Jarvan is soon to be updated when they get around too it.  As mentioned down below though,      a champions visuals does not directly impact gameplay and I feel the recent buffs for Jarvan were more important then changing his looks. I hope this helped though.\n\nYours sincerely, \nTalwyn","replies":[{"poster":"Hamburgerr","date":"2016-03-27T10:04:32.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed.

Of course not, you could look like a Missingno and still play the same.\n\nBut CAN it make a difference? Of course, you feel better and therefore play better.\n\nRiot needs to update a few visuals, but will they? Probably not, it is not important in game.","replies":[]}]}
