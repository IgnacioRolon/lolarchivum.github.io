Unless a serious fix is made this season just wont be worth playing, it would be good if more bans were implemented to get rid of more than 3 overpowered champions a game. The mastery system changes are nice but are too strong with some champions,  Thunderlords for alot of champions makes them broken. The game is turning into something that requires less skill to play as it becomes easier and easier to win games. This game has been one of my most played games in the past few years and it's sad to see it come to this.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-17T04:22:24.390+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lol","replies":[]}]}
