I&#039;d like to thank AR Urf for that as it has to be the most unenjoyable custom gamemode that I have played in all my years of playing League. I know a few of you would be wondering why that is the case and some I hope agreeing with me. The fact is, AR Urf is not fair, it&#039;s not ok to have to vs 5 of the best champions when your team has mediocre champions. In saying that those mediocre champions may have the potential to be strong but against many champions such as Garen or Eve they fall way short. This means you are stuck in a game for at least 15 minutes having the worst time of your life. \n\nNow it&#039;s not the fact that it&#039;s all random, i&#039;m for that, but the fact that all champions are available can definitely lead to something that is somewhat rage inducing. Not all champions that are extremely over powered are constantly seen, such as Karthus whom I have not seen thus far. I know someone will say about counterbuilding against their team so you don&#039;t die, but if you were going to do that I think i&#039;d rather just play a normal game. Generally doing meta things in a gamemode like URF is a sure way to fall asleep.\n\nAtleast add some form of banning to AR Urf.\n\nThe linked video is by MagikarpUsedFly briefly touches on some of things I have mentioned in this.\n\nEdit: Warning, video may contain language that some viewers may find offensive.","replies":[{"poster":"Early Feed Strat","date":"2017-03-04T03:13:41.091+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Warning, video may contain language that some viewers may find offensive.","replies":[{"poster":"Known","date":"2017-03-04T03:51:16.994+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Omega Kai,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=1AQ7WsF1,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2017-03-04T03:13:41.091+0000)\n>\n> Warning, video may contain language that some viewers may find offensive.\n\nI will edit that.

While I like the concept of people not repeatedly playing the same champions, it just doesn't seem to work in game. \n\nPeople will just use there re-rolls until they get an OP champion, and if they're unlucky enough to get stuck with a champion who just isnt viable in URF, then they're about to have the worst 15 minutes of League they've ever experienced.\n\nBut what's worse, is the inability to ban champions. It's simply infuriating not being able to ban champions in a game mode like URF, where there are obvious outliers, on both ends of the scale. There are champions so ridiculously OP they will 1v5 you at all stages of the game, and you have no hope of winning, and there are champions who are so underpowered that the player is just staring at a black and white screen for the majority of the game.\n\nI would choose URF over AR-URF any day.","replies":[]}]}
