Although the clips are saved as webm files which aren&#039;t compatible with Premiere Pro, this led me to search for a converter, most of which are scams or poor quality at best. I was wondering why the recordings are saved as webm files and not something useful such as an mp4 file etc. I would be wondering if this would be changed or added in as an option in the future.\r\n\r\nThanks","replies":[{"poster":"Kürama","date":"2016-12-19T06:42:56.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try utilizing [VLC Media Player.](http://www.videolan.org/)","replies":[{"poster":"Known","date":"2016-12-19T07:00:56.064+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rineyy,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=WXrykuNV,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-19T06:42:56.663+0000)\n>\n> Try utilizing [VLC Media Player.](http://www.videolan.org/)\n\nWhat can VLC do for me exactly?
