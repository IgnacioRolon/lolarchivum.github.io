It is simply a change for chanegs sake. It offers no more insight into the game and in actual fact makes it harder than it should be to simply find a stat. The fact is, sure bring out a new UI but at least allow people to have the option to keep the old one. I think that you&#039;ll find most people would keep the old one because they don&#039;t need to get a magnifying glass to read some numbers. I mean hey, good job familiarising everyone with the game now though.","replies":[]}
