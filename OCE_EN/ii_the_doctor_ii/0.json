Dota is far more technical and makes you aware of the fine details of gameplay and positioning. The lack of character contrast in Dota makes you more keen eyed at approaching enemies that exit FOW. Also the lack of cd indication also makes you peek more at your abilities in the middle of a fight to judge whether you should run/back-off to wait for cd to come off. I think the spoonfeeding interface makes people a bit \"soft\" on their skills but yeah Dota is good for training (what I mean is Warcraft Dota...my comp is too toast for Dota 2). Though I still reckon LOL is more fun ability-wise.","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomHacker","date":"2015-10-06T17:47:00.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Playing League after playing Dota makes you crappier at Dota though.  You play league as if you were playing unfair mode in dota at ranked and then you get so spoonfed in league with mana regen, lower skill cd, less mana to cast spells, having free wards, having to tp back for free, walking to tower in 30 seconds, free flash if you fked up, free heal if you fked up, vision uphill, bigger hitboxes, smaller minion hitboxes that you could literally push a nidalee spear through them, hug tower and still get experience without getting harassed and without enemy denying minions.\n\nOverall, just play the game that you like better IMHO, or do it like me when you want more mechanics, more challenge and be competitive, play Dota 2 and when you feel like getting easy wins to feel good, play league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-12-09T10:21:03.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"never touched it \n\n{{champion:79}} {{champion:79}} {{champion:79}}","replies":[]}]}
