It either kept scanning files for \"Calculating differences\" or stopped at \"Updating League of Legends\" with 269MB left.\n\nHeres the methods I had already tried:\n1.Add 8.8.8.8 and 4.4.4.4 into my DNS server in internet settings\n\n2.Deleted the following files in league content and make it re-update\nreleasemanifest (Contents/LOL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.0.168/)\nS_OK (Contents/LOL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.0.168/)\nlol.properties (Contents/LOL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.0.168/deploy/bin/)\nLolClient (Contents/LOL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.0.168/deploy/bin/)\nMETA-INF (Contents/LOL/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/0.0.0.168/deploy/bin/)\n\n**I don't have the file \"Log\".\n\n3.Repair\n\n4.Re-install (5 times)\n\nI would like to know what I can do to fix this problem, I want that DJ {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} {{champion:37}} so badly.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-28T09:38:13.867+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yo, I had that same problem too, though I'm on the OCE server. Apparently what some people claim to be happening there is that it's \"Applying the patches\", whereupon it doesn't need to download at that point, and just waiting some more should fix it. I find this to be nonsense because there's a specific message which comes up saying \"Applying patches\" when it's actually applying patches.\n\nA solution I found for this is to refresh your internet connection, ie. disconnect your internet, wait ten seconds and then reconnect it, every time it happens. After a minute of derping it should start downloading again.\n\nFor future reference, bumping doesn't work on the boards. It worked on the forums, but not the boards.\n\nBest of luck!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Debonair Gray","date":"2015-02-27T14:19:16.196+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump!","replies":[]}]}
