Replying to a ticket or creating a new ticket before receiving a response will drop you back to the bottom of the queue.\n2. If you were referred specifically to the player behaviour team, they are a much smaller (and much more specialised) team and can take significantly longer to respond as a result. A week is still a long time in that scenario, but not unheard of if they have a high ticket volume.","replies":[]}]}
