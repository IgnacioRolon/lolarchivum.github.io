Predominantly play Ekko, Nidalee, Vel&#039;koz, and Orianna but I can manage a fairly wide variety of picks reasonably well. I&#039;m relatively active, playing 2-3 hours on average per day but often more. Feel free to message me in game if you have a spot free. \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\n\r\nSummoner name: RevolvingElk","replies":[{"poster":"PapaHuggey","date":"2015-09-27T10:32:06.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sent you a friend request. :)","replies":[]}]}
