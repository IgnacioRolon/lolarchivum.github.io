I am able to log in and join the cue however once the game actually begins I can't connect or reconnect to the game. Then it says 'cannot connect to the server and this could be temporary network problem. Would you like to retry to connect to the server?'. I've lost my last rank game since I couldn't connect and its there as I left the game. I had no problem playing leagues until this moment so I tried again with normal game this time. Nek minute.. It's happening again! Is this only me and my computer or others experiencing the same thing? I don't expect you to cover my lost game however I would love you to answer and so I can play some leagues again! Thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-15T02:58:08.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What's your average ping?","replies":[{"poster":"Kasyu","date":"2015-01-15T12:57:49.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Around about 10~11.

Then, if that doesn't work, try setting your DNS to Google's Public DNS. If you need help with that, just ask.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
