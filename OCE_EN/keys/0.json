I believe this has stopped me from getting tokens towards rank 7, however I cant be sure because I never saw which rank I got. I thought something was suspicious after my 8/1/6 game on Syndra however I couldn&#039;t be sure. However last game I was 21/3/17 and I didn&#039;t get a token. Thoughts?\n\n(Summoner name: Keys - OCE)\n\nEDIT: the game was ranked on summoners rift as well so I should be able to get tokens.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-12T02:49:21.284+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhen you say you crash _after_ the end game screen, at what point during the play cycle are you referring to?","replies":[{"poster":"Keys","date":"2016-10-12T06:12:19.477+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We had won the game, the victory animation had completed, then I clicked continue, the game closed and then the screen with the stats never opened.

Perhaps you're just not achieving an S or higher rank?","replies":[{"poster":"Keys","date":"2016-10-12T13:46:03.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No I haven't tried that yet, I actually wasn't aware that was there, thank you. Also yes that's what I thought I may just have not been eligible for the rank, although I have had friends receive S and greater for less kills, more deaths and less CS so I assumed it was a glitch, thanks for the help hopefully the client repair fixes the issue.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-10-16T00:25:03.997+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How'd you go?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
