Also will I receive a penalty because of this, I don&#039;t feel as if it&#039;s my fault at all that I&#039;m unable to enter game for the first 10-15 mins. Has anyone else run into this before?\n\nEDIT: Now the update is complete and it's telling me my username/password in incorrect. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT2: I restarted client again and now it's updating again...","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-26T09:24:23.309+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAre you still experiencing this issue?","replies":[]}]}
