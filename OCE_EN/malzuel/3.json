As you are probably aware the Oceanic server does not have Twisted Treeline 3&#039;s available 24/7 like summoners rift, nor does It even offer the option of Ranked 3&#039;s which other servers have available. By not providing the Oceanic server with constant Treeline nor even providing the Ranked option this is definitely negatively effecting your player base and support since I have had many friends who I play league with just come to play now for the Twisted Treeline 3&#039;s. Since I  know it would be  hard to establish these servers, It would be great if we could even get an extra day of Twisted Treeline or even a full 24 hour day and to do with the  Ranked 3&#039;s just having during one of the Treeline Periods a week as a trial would be fantastic.","replies":[{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2015-12-21T09:53:40.050+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would support a permanent TT map mode for now, not Ranked.\n\nWe need to see what the TT games are going to be like with a permanent mode, currently on the weekends it is just shit, you get those weekend only players who really have no idea what they are doing and make the games really low quality, or you get those who come with a party just for this mode to get some free and easy wins.\n\nIf Rito let us play this map mode all the time maybe the game quality will increase with players getting more experience on this mode and able to learn to form real strategies and whatnot. Than if it all goes well and you don't continually get one sided games I would be happy to advocate a Ranked mode.\n\nToo risky at the moment for Ranked, but goo to see more players wanting to get a permanent mode of this map.","replies":[{"poster":"Malzuel","date":"2015-12-21T12:55:16.072+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I totally respect that ranked 3's would be a risk for reward from riot right now, and I also agree with your statement of putting 3's up everyday.

Surely the server population has continued to grow? If not isn't it a whole server issue rather than a queue issue? Pehaps there needs to be more promotion for the server? I know the SEA server population in't very big but perhaps it is cutting in to the population who would otherwise play OCE.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-12-21T22:58:01.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twisted Treeline was the perfect game mode for when you want a short fast game, where you can actually pick your own champ, and you're not limited by the meta of: I'm top so i have to be a bruiser, Im bot so i have to be ADC.\n\ngames were almost non-toxic because no one cared as much as they do in 5s and were just fun, i miss it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BakedPotatoGod","date":"2015-12-21T15:55:14.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Never knew OCE didnt have TT :c","replies":[]}]}
