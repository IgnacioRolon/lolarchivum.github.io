I never had this problem before 5.2, before it i always had a stable 60 fps on high settings but now I'm getting random fps drops even when i turn down the settings. Is this happening to anyone else or is it just me?","replies":[{"poster":"SparklyKitten","date":"2015-02-03T10:12:50.986+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm having the same issues.
