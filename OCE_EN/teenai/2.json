AD is meh. The downfall and the reason he isn't played a heap in his current state is that he is too easy to shut down, he has no escape (except {{summoner:4}}) and has low mobility. He is a situational pick.\n\nhe needs to be up close to deal damage. he gets bullied down too hard from kite and ranged especially. \n\nI'm looking forward to seeing the rework on him hopefully it will put him in a great spot in the meta again.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2019-05-24T10:01:13.109+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In reference to why he goes AP, because his scalings are stupid high, as for why no one plays him, because he's garbage in almost all bar niche matches","replies":[]}]}
