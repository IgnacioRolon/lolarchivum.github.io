It sounds kind of obvious but that's because it is. \n\nYou earn honour progress with neutral behaviour, but slower than you do with positive behaviour. Negative behaviour, even if it doesn't result in punishment, will prevent you from earning honour for that game. Punishments will drop your honour to either 1 or 0 (depending on the severity of the punishment) and lock progress for the duration.\n\nProgress isn't shown explicitly to prevent abuse of the system (people being negative until they are at risk of dropping a level, then playing a few positive games to drag it back up, then going right back to being negative, etc), so checkpoints are your progress indicator. The average player will gain a checkpoint once every 3-4 weeks.\n\nIt may feel slow, but that's because it's not a short term goal, it's meant to be a season long achievement (and fair warning, your honour level will be reset upon commencement of Season 9).\n\nMore details: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/115008474148-Honor-FAQ","replies":[]}]}
