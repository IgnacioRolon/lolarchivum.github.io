However there are a ton of places that you can learn these things from players that play at a very high level playing nocturne and see what they do. \n\n[To get you started here a vod from Svenskeren's stream when he played nocturne just over a month ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wh9btcIwg)\n\n[Another vod that I found is a challenger player called Valkrin also playing Nocturne here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKaVieKC3V0)\n\nWhen you are watching these vods the first thing that you want to watch is their runes and masteries. This will give you a good starting set to go for when playing nocturne to make sure you are set up optimally both for clearing the jungle and for the game.\n\nThe next thing that you want to look out for is how they clear the jungle specifically. Have a look at what they do, what path they take, and when they use abilities. Once you have that down test it out in a custom game by yourself and mimic what they do to see if it improves upon how you clear the jungle.\n\nOther than that a quick tip I can give you is when you are using your Q when clearing the jungle, keep in mind that the trail that it leaves will be viable to enemies, even if it has gone through a wall. So when you are taking the wraiths for example, you don't want to aim it in a way that will tell the enemy mid laner that you are near mid. This will make ganking them a lot harder and tell the enemy team your location.\n\nI hope that this helps if there is any other questions I can answer for you let me know and good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-26T14:50:18.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Better solution. Don't play nocturne, he has been rather shit since they introduced bloodrazor, the only thing he is good for any more is building shiv,, but if he doesn't crit the proc he doesn't do anything, he doesn't have any burst or sustained damage at the moment and it getting potential buffs in 7.2, play him then.","replies":[]}]}
