Basics mechanics are things such as positioning, csing, trading, taking objectives and rotating around the map. Bronze is the elo that to climb out it you need to increase your basic mechanics and make them consistent.  \n\nWith this in mind pick a mechanic that you feel you really need to improve on to climb, and go into your next games focusing on making sure you do that well until it becomes natural.\n\n---\nThe next thing I would like to note on is the champions that you play. Majority of the champions that you play such as Azir are very mechanic dependent and have a lot of mechanics that are unqiue to them such as his soldiers. \n\nNow to climb out of the elo that you are in you are going to want to focus on mechanics that you can transfer globally to all mechanics, so playing these champions can sometimes impact how fast you learn those. While its not impossible and by all means you really enjoy those champions I would stick to them, but if you are struggling with getting better at your basic mechanics, I would recommend trying some different champions.\n\nThings such as:\n\n* Malphite for Top Lane (Garen is a brilliant choice which I noticed you already played.\n* Zac and the current state of Warwick for Jungle\n* Mid lane Annie and Orianna\n* ADC I would go with Ashe or Miss Fortune\n* And for support Leona or Soraka\n\n_Thought I would note on all roles here just in case you get auto filled and don't know what to play._\n\n---\n\nThe other thing that I would recommend is make sure that you are always playing to improve. Often I find that I climb the best when I am playing to learn rather to climb. This helps me go into games a lot more positively and keeps me going in games that aren't going so well because it can be good to learn to play when behind and make comebacks.\n\nEvery game try to think of something that you learned from it, and have something in specific that you want to practice while playing the next game, if its the case of getting better at mechanic, try focusing on it for the next 10-20 games for example. However don't let to control all your actions, do put a bit more focus on it, but not too much to the point where it negatively impacts your gameplay. \n\n---\n\nI hope this helps, if there are any other questions I can answer or any other way I can help let me know. Good luck in your games!\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
