The three who could turn into different creatures. The problem is that their are only 3 of them, so you couldn&#039;t 5v5 with them. So I created two more so that it could be a theme&#039;d team.\r\nhere&#039;s my first idea:\r\n\r\nEurika, Caller of Storms\r\nElectric support/mage\r\nfocuses on crowd control\r\npassive ability: gain in speed and atk speed.\r\nthen her spells:\r\n1) shock-not much damage but stuns/mount-takes teammate onto back and protects him\r\n2)magnetism trap-makes trap that when triggered, sucks all minions into single spot/charge-bull rush&#039;s in a line, knocking back minions\r\n3)energize-heightens speed and atk speed of teammate, also small heal/lightning cloud-creates cloud to hide in, gives increase to evasiveness\r\n4) ultimate ability: Storm Calling- turns Eurika into a StormHorse, giving large boost in speed and atk speed\r\n\r\nHere is my second idea:\r\n\r\nLasna, Hunter of the Night Pack\r\nghost marksman/assassin\r\nFocuses on basic mid-range archery and dodge\r\npassive ability: every 5 shots fired, she summons a spirit wolf who enhanced her 6th shot and then disappears.\r\nthen her spells:\r\n1) wolf shot- shoots a empowered arrow/bite-basic bite atk\r\n2)wolf trap- makes a trap that stuns and harms foes/claws- attacks twice with empowered claws\r\n3)wolf circle- creates a spirit that stays next to champion and does damage to enemies who come near/Wolf Spirit- makes you invisible, but cannot move\r\n4)ultimate ability: Wolf Howl- changes champion into a wolf and calls a group of any neutral minions to her aid on the map","replies":[{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-04-25T23:59:55.515+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nidalee, elise, jayce, gnar, shyvana? there are only 3?????????????????????????????????","replies":[{"poster":"MrGoldDucky666","date":"2015-04-26T01:57:20.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gnar only gets bigger with rage and Jayce transforms his weapon.
