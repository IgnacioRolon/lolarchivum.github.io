Poppy is also a very good anti-tank/bruiser champion. You would want to avoid extended fights against her, try poking her down with Q \nbefore hard engaging. \n\nShen is a strong champion, and your passive only block 1 of his 3 enhanced autos, when he engages on you, you should stun him as soon as he uses his W, and try to waste as much of his time as you can, until his W ends. He is at his weakest once it is down, you can hard engage him then. \n\nHope this is of some help.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shdwzone","date":"2016-12-15T23:29:25.737+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:31}} He wants to jump on you, q your feet, it'll knock him up after the stun, and you'll recover and can walk away.\nYou think he want's to jump on you, silence and walk away.\nHe wants to just sit and farm, your E gives free poke. Even if he blocks one of your AA's, the e damage goes through.\nas long as you don't let him all in you at levels 2 and 3, you should be able to sustain enough in lane to overcome his bully factor, he'll go OOM trying to poke you out.\n{{champion:48}} Trundle's AA reset on Q (and AD steal) makes trading with him very hard. His passive sustain also makes it hard for pantheon to lower him enough to burst him down since Trundle can heal from every minion, even if he's not getting the killing blow on it.\n\nOther like {{champion:58}} {{champion:86}} {{champion:39}} {{champion:54}}  can be a pain also but it depends on there lv of play.

If you know u will reach late game, focus on Black Cleaver and go full tank.\n2) buildpath Youmus, Blackcleaver, Hextrinker/Banshee\n3) Your decision making must be on point, dont force ur ult/situation\n4) your not looking to KILL your top laner 24/7 ( if you can awesome) but more so looking to roam mid counter jg and possible back ulit bot or if playing in a team and going Flash TP and roaming when u can.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-12-16T02:00:32.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"Not yasuo","replies":[]}]}
