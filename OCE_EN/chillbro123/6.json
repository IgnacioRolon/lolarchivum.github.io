This might seem smart but it's really not. \n\n If you flash as soon as you're in danger, the jungler will back off and you won't take any damage, you can still stay in lane and continue to farm.\n\n But if you wait for the last second before flashing or don't flash at all, the jungler will get heaps of damage off on you and you will be forced to back. You also risk dying if you miscalculate his damage.\n\nIt's obviously not going to be this black and white in every situation, but generally it's a good idea to flash as soon as you're in danger. \n\n\nAlso, people shouldn't be insulting/flaming you for mistakes, especially when you're a beginner, that's really BM... :( You should mute them and then report it afterwards in the post-game lobby.","replies":[{"poster":"LetsTwitch","date":"2016-12-28T09:02:07.246+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Important to keep in mind is will flashing get you away.\n\nSave flash for Malphite ult or Lee sin Q because if you don't both of these champs will easily catch up to you.\n\nIt's pretty common for Lee Sin to use his W+E to get right on top of you before Q'ing, as most people will burn flash then rather than using it to dodge Q. Ultimately it comes down to if you think you can actually time it right and the situation","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-12-28T23:03:08.235+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't remember people being that skilled when I was level 18, most Lee Sin's would initiate ganks with Q from almost max range at that level. But yeah you're right, in many cases it's more optimal to either dodge the gap closer with flash or flash right after they land it (e.g. Vi R).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-12-28T19:25:24.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is so much better. You should usually hold flash until the enemy uses their gapcloser or to dodge cc or a high damage ability, and sometimes you can just walk out of a low elo gank more often than you'd think, especially since very few people in low elo can freeze a wave and very few low elo junglers will go through tribush or from behind. Not to mention if you just flash early, the enemy might consider towerdiving you, whereas if you still have your flash, it's alot more risky for them and generally not worth risking. Also some ganks it's not even worth flashing since you'll die regardless and you should safe flash for later when you can use it to get a kill back or when it may actually save your life.\n\nTry to get a feel for the distance of flash and which key it feels more comfortable on. But if you're really not confident, try to flash as soon as the enemy jungler or laner is in range to attack you, since holding onto your flash is kinda pointless once you get cced or burst down.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ChillBro123","date":"2016-12-29T03:50:36.054+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey THX some specific examples why people are flaming me is\n1.

You will know what kind of combo the enemies would try to lock you down with and how to deal with and negate them, you will know how to quickly plan and actionise your escape by combing your available and disposable skills/spells without being locked down and killed, and you will know how long you could most likely run without burning Flash and the chances of survival based on that, by mostly reflex. Usually when you've played against certain match-ups, you're less likely to make the same Flash mistakes as before, and the chances would get low and lower every time you've met the same or similar match-up and/or scenarios.\n\nSo really, in the end of your day, just take your time, there really isn't much trick in this besides experience as far as I know.\n\n.....................\n\nThe most tricky aspect is when you're using Flash as part of your dueling tactics, such as setting up instances and burning Flash strategically to kill your laning opponents in order to gain lane control early or Flash'ing away from teamfight only to come back as a reserve force clean-up, this one varies from champions to champions, so here I say 1 step at a time and get what I've mentioned above first.\n\n.....................\n\nAlso, if you're not too conformable using Flash, you could try running with Ghost. They are interchangeable with perks of each own making them work better on different champs and/or different players. What's more is that Ghost is also pretty good for training in-game danger sense and strategic retreat as it's not as instant as Flash since you just run faster as opposed to accessing short-distance teleportation, making one require to run-away and burn their escapes earlier than they would need to with Flash in tight situations. The good news is that it's on a vastly shorter CD (in comparison to Flash anyway) which makes it more spammable and more encouraging to experimentation, and it lasts for a while (10 seconds) making it quite ideal for sustained dueling and long chases unlike Flash that's usually better in regards to being the \"oh shit\" plan B and a buffer for surprise tactics. As I've mentioned, different champions (and maybe players) might find either one of them more suitable for themselves, so you might want to experiment with your champions as well.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gimble","date":"2016-12-28T08:33:28.819+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basic\n1.
