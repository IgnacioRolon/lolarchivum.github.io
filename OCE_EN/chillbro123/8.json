When you wards are down play passive when they are up play aggressive. Ask the jungle to help by warding on side of river for you early game. They should be able to unless they are planning on hard counter jungling. If you opponent had strong cc and so does the enemy jungler just be safe. No one can escape double lockdown ganks, they are just bad luck and bad champion placement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cakemeisting","date":"2016-12-01T02:49:11.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Go back to youtube and watch the mid lane streams from worlds, I think they were called \"player experience streams\" or \"mid lane matchups\". You'll get a lot of insight there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"gravityhacker","date":"2016-11-30T10:24:15.824+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"For the laner i am not sure, but they may play way more agressive than they normally did. You need to watch how they play against you and analyse when they start to act strangely. Are they pushing the wave? or are they letting you push? etc are they trying to trade with you more than they normally did? \n\n\nFor reading a jungler \n\nYou need to understand how a jungler thinks, which can be hard for non junglers.  As a jungler our goal is not to win lanes for the laners but win the game, so what is the easiest way to do that? that is what a good jungler must be thinking of all game. \nSo for a jungler what ganks look easiest? is your enemy mid laner full health under their own tower because your mid has pushed lane? can't gank that lane, too risky and unlikely to give reward. What about top lane? looks like the enemy top laner is around the middle of the lane but has more minions than our top laner so is likely to push to tower, so what do we do? we gank top or clear our top side jungle until the gank looks easier. This is a very basic way of reading a junglers movements.  and also you need to watch the map/what buffs the jungler has so you can best guess where he will gank.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-11-29T21:43:49.424+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well at bronze/silver.\n\nUsually the enemy stops attacking the minions, and tries to last hit the minions, making you push the lane.\n\nOr they just suddenly engage on you even when they are at a disadvantage, so that you think you can kill them and dont run. Then the jungle comes in and RIP.","replies":[]}]}
