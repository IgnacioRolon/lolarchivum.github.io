You will see different ways of ganking, might not always be a safe way of ganking. But can work out for the best. Welcome to the game on the otherhand :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"The Wanak King","date":"2016-11-07T06:24:26.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://imgur.com/a/0kUyK\n\nIf youre on Blue side thats what you will want to do, when you Gank, With the Pink dot is better Gank Green is if you need to get there ASAP.. its sort of hard to explain you will need to try it in game to know .. The reason you do that is so you can limit the amount of escape their team has. Amumu in my opinion is better for ganking because of Q  then ULT, if you land Q and theres more than 2 people Ult and watch who cried (im punny :3)\n\nEdit: if youre on opposite side just flip the picture around you wanna gank from the shrub on red team  :) ","replies":[]}]}
