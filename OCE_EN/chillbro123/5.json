So he plays support singed and gets banned by his teamates. but the fact that riot agreed with this is just plain rude. I mean what has he done wrong.He clearly says in every game exactly what he is going to do and yet he still gets banned. I do not see a viable reason to ban him. If he doesnt want to play the meta thats fine, theres no rule telling you you have to play the meta.I can understand why people are getting angry but just because he isnt playing how you want him to isnt a reason he should be banned. this is my opinion only plz write your opinions below","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-11-25T06:25:47.256+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"I addressed this at length here: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/WRN3RIzk-game-rules?comment=0000\n\nI am curious though, the original reddit post said 2mil mastery points, the video you linked says 3, and you yourself are saying 6.

The important thing in this scenario is \"team consent\". Basically, if you want to perform any given strategy (whether it's off-META, on-META or somewhere in between) you need the consent of *at least* one other person, and even then it's a bit iffy. Generally, try to have majority support before doing something your team mates don't agree with, and when you don't have majority support try to make some kind of compromise. In a situation where you have 4 people all saying that they don't want to be part of your suggested strategy, it would be both report-able and punishable for you to continue with that particular strategy.","replies":[]}]}]}
