In mid it facilitates wave clear with a little spellvamp spread about and down bot it can help zone and procs frost queen without much effort / skill.  Also because I am noob i prefer to max the non skillshot damage cause it is harder to miss with w üòÅ\n\nJust my preference though.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-24T07:53:20.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In mid I'd say yeah, defs max W first since it's a primary source of damage, in fact if you can keep enemies in it it does way more damage than the Q so unless you have no cc on your team you excepted I would defs max W first in mid.\n\nIn bot however, I see your point, but to play Morgana well I don't believe it is an effective strategy. Can it work? Sure. Is it sufficient if you just want to play Morg for fun and not in a competitive/serious capacity? Sure. There's nothing wrong with your reasoning and no true 'correct' way to play League, but allow me to elaborate.\n\nThat said, your main three points were 1. Zoning, 2. Gold (Frosty procs) and 3. Reliability.\n\nTo your first and second points, the W functions in both these capacities anyway. Sure the zoning is weaker and less threatening, but if they stand in it it's still a considerable amount of damage at low levels so the enemy would be foolish to ignore it entirely, so ti still serves as one extra thing they have to consider. \n\nAs for Frosty or Thunderlords procs they function the same whether you have points in W or not. I suppose you could argue the value of that CD but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't make much difference.\n\nAs to the third point, especially if you buy a Rylai's the W is very reliable in the sense that you are almost guaranteed to hit an enemy with it. However, it is also very UNreliable in the sense that without the Q you are only likely to get 1-2 ticks of damage on any one enemy out of your W, which is practically nothing even if you are building full AP in mid lane. The Q by comparison does many times more significant damage with a single tick, and as far as skillshots go is actually very reliable. WIthout the Q, the W is fairly worthless outside of hectic cc filled teamfights (i.e late game).\n\nThe Q has one of the largest hitboxes and longest range of skillshots in League, especially so once you discount ultimate abilities. So there are three big factors in it's reliability. 1. Max Range, 2. Movement Abilities and 3. Obstacles. 1 and 2 apply to the W as well, though the W does have a slightly longer range than the Q, so 3 is our major reliability factor here, and this is where your reasoning becomes important in laning. \n\nObviously the biggest obstacle for Morg's Q is minions. Hitting the wrong champion with the Q might not be the best outcome but it's hardly a bad one. Maxing the W is one option but this is where effective zoning and positioning should come in instead. \n\nAssuming you don't have communication with your ADC you have to do this yourself but with Morg it's really not that hard. You simply put the W down on one side of the lane and stand on the other. They have to make a choice, to either stand in the W or risk the threat of the Q. Obviously this only works while your W is active but whichever they choose you have solid opportunities to whittle down their health, even if you don't use the Q and only use autos and it's threat, in the early game you're still going to be taking significant chunks of your enemy adc or support's health.\n\nIf you max the W first, then the snare time on the Q is quite short, and it lacks a lot of it's threat. The damage on the W might be scary but they have to actually stand in it to face that. In lane and through mid game you benefit far more from using the W solely as zoning pressure and using your levelled Q with it's super scary duration to force them into your adc/teams DPS.\n___\nThat...ended up being a lot longer than I meant it to be.\n\ntl;dr The Q is generally speaking more reliable than the W in all aspects of supporting anyway blah blah comparisons blah blah my opinion enjoy.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-12-24T03:16:26.666+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I main morgana as one of my supports if thresh/braum doesn't cut it for the comp.\n\nLevel Q first.\n\n---\nThis is handy because you should always level up CC first, in case of an invade, or if your invading.\nEvery time you level it up, its snare time goes up.\n\nso level order should be-\nQ-E-W\nMax Q first followed by E (to increase black shield strength)\nLevel up R when you can.\n--\n\nItems should be frost support item first.\nFollowed by a sightstone / Boots.\nThen max Frost into frost queens claim.\nGreat for engaging/Dis-engaging fights.\n\nTry and get a Zonyas after that, this will allow you to R, and Zonyas to hopefully get at least a 3 man snare.\nUpgrade to either Magic pen boots - Or merc treds if they have alot more magic dmg.\n\nA banshies veil works great, you get MR - HP and HP regen.\nThis will also allow you to walk into fights blocking abilities (Every 35 seconds)\n\nIf the enemy team doesn't have any assassins or doesn't do dmg.\nFeel free to go more AP, I.E Haunting guise/Liandry's Torment.\n\nAbysal can work, if they have more then 2-3 AP champs.\n\nRedemption also really good right now, and a frozen heart works great.\n\nGet frozen heart after zonyas or after redemption.\nIt offers armor, mana, an atk speed slow for the enemy, and 20% CDR.\n\nThe last item you should get will be an upgraded sightstone, Ruby crystal.\n\nDon't forget to swap our your yellow trinket to a sweeper after you get a sightstone.\nBy level 9-12 you should have it upgraded.\n\nI think I have  a video on this somewhere.\n\n--\n\nRunes-\n\nIf you want to go tank-\n3 Armor yellows -scaling you are VSing an ADC bot lane after all.\n6 Yellow health seals.\n9 MR per level blues.\n9 flat armor reds.\n1 quint of flat armor\n2 quints of movespeed.

Level Q first and then depending on what you're going up against either E or W,  i.e if i'm going up against say a sona support i would go E second otherwise W second,\n2. Max Q first then E second, then either W or R\n3. Items i go full ap, i upgrade my spell thiefs edge to t2, buy holy grail because of the shield heal first and then rabadons, boots of penetration, mormellos and i then get crystal scepter. usually i sell the t2 spell thiefs edge and buy a luden's echo or a void staff. Not specifically in that order but grail is a first item always or as the second item.\n4. I don't buy any sightstone item because i personally believe between you and the adc with the 2 wards and buy a control ward you have 6 wards in total, that is plenty enough if you and the adc work together. It shouldn't be relied on only the support, everyone should be placing wards down.\n5. I go for the Q+W combo and with crystal scepter this can slow the enemies down a lot with enough time for you or an ally to kill the enemy champion. I also personally try and secure the kill whenever i can but this does not mean i steal the kills from the ADC. Say like your ADC is Jhin and his reloading but the enemy Sona is on low enough health and is escaping, that's when i come in and try to kill her with the Q or W, if flash is up flash and ult. It all really depends on the fight that is happening.\n\nThat's how i play morgana and i have carried the game a few times before and achieved a lot of S ranks with this.\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-12-25T11:30:55.926+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1.

You really have to realise just how valuable it is, and just how vulnerable you are without it. Sure the black shield is a super strong disengage for you or your adc, but if a jungler with any kind of CC is coming in you're going to want that binding as well, and both are on a long ass cd.\n\nSo keep your river/tri warded, try to keep eyes on the jungler and only play aggressive with the binding if you either a. know you can hit it or b. aren't going to face a catastrophic gank if you miss is.\n\nObviously that advice applies to all supports, but most other supports have some other skill to play aggressive or defensive with as well (Janna has tornado or zephyr, Nami has bubble and bouncy wave, Thresh has hook and flay and so on and so forth).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slowdownn","date":"2016-12-24T02:40:19.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"As Morgana, u just need to land your Q!","replies":[]}]}
