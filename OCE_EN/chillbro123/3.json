I have never had any REAL trouble Pre 6 except against one guy... This guy {{champion:86}} . I find it hard to harass this guy when he&#039;s taking cs because every time i do he runs up to me with decisive strike(When I have passive up) and uses judgement. In Addition If I&#039;m not harassing him every second his passive heals him up to full health.Once i reach 6 i do great maybe even get 2 kills. I just need help in the laning phase","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-12-11T06:13:46.443+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mained Garen for a couple of years when I started League back in 2011 and I usually lost to Panth, these days he is still a solid counter to Garen.\n\nIn short I think Pantheon wins if he is the aggressor, and Garen's only recourse is to aggressively push in, clearing your minions while trying to trade smart (short fights in lane where you try to deal more damage to the enemy than they are able to do back). But this heavily exposes him to ganks from your jungler which Pantheon uses well with his targetted stun to lock down the enemy for the kill.\n\n\nWhen fighting Garen, you do need to play around his Q - Decisive Strike's silence, as Pantheon relies heavily on his spells to deal damage. Try this while you have almost equal or more minions than him in lane:\n\n1. wait for Garen to use his Q and keep your distance but don't run too far, eventually he will likely use it on a minion or let the spell time out\n2. when his Q is on cooldown and assuming you still have a similar or higher amount of minions, hit him with your W - Aegis of Zeonia and E - Heartseeker Strike then immediately back off by running through your minions\n3. if he chases you through your minions while using his E - Judgement (spin) he will be slowed and should be unable to catch up to you without his Q\n4. when he backs off, chuck a Q - Spear Shot at him\n\nThis should win you every trade, but be careful for enemy ganks while performing this.\n\n\nAlso, you can try to hit him with Q before you stun him with W as it has a short cooldown and will be ready for use again while you're running away, so you could hit him with it twice while performing this trade. But if you Q first you might scare him off before you can stun him with W, this will come down to how scared the Garen player chooses to play and something you'll have to figure out about them while in lane.\n\nAdditionally, since all of your damage in this combo comes from spells you will not take enemy minion aggro (they won't attack you) as only basic attacks or spells like Garens Q (which just alter his basic attack) trigger minion aggro.\n\nGaren's passive healing at levels 1 to 10 has a 9 second cooldown after being attacked by a champion, so you can keep it turned off by throwing a spear every 8-9 seconds when you're not trading. Just be aware of your mana costs and try not to let your mana get below 150 unless you're going all in to kill him or you're clearing the wave with E so you can go back, as you won't have enough to cast all of your spells.\n\nI'm not the best at trading in lane, but I hope my experience of getting my butt kicked by Pantheons helps you here. :)","replies":[{"poster":"ChillBro123","date":"2016-12-11T11:32:14.436+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you For your info, It was very informative. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wess","date":"2016-12-11T09:40:05.879+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is crazy informative, have you written guides for champs before?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-12-12T01:53:29.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!

The moment u jump in, Garen can cast his spin right b4 you hit him. You can try using ur E but that's gonna cost you a portion of ur HP. If you don't run, he can AA you once to get rid of ur passive and then Q to chase and hit you.\nYou spear (Q) also wont do much dmg if he enable his (W) and build Armor.\n\n The only solution to fight Garen that i can think of is to out sustain him and farm CS, build tons of armor and hp regen, try asking ur jgler to gank. He won't get killed anyway but atleast make him go back home so he lose his farms.\n\nA smart Garen will not chase you but will use his W to increase his armor when you throw a spear to him and will spin when you stun. He cannont kill you in a trade but you will lose tons of cs and fall behind.\n\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhen you learn to play someone, you also need to learn who can counter your counters. \nThat's the best strategy so far.\n\nhope that's help","replies":[]}]}
