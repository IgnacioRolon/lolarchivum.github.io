Your main focus will be to front line and PEEL. Get your cc off on as many people as you can and you'll win most team fights. Another great tank is volibear who functions as a bodyguard, you want to front line and make sure no one dives past and if they do you can flip them away. Earlier in the game though you have really strong damage as voli, but its important to know when to transition from a meaty assasin to the bodyguard. \n\nAnother good one is of course mundo, but mundo is literally just a wall, you can't really do much for your team if the enemy is ahead. If you're into support, braum is a great tank too. A popular pick in high elo is poppy, your passive is great for building value in fights and tanking lots of damage and your ult can make 5v5s into 4v5s. Malphite is a great tank for teams lacking ap and the enemy team has a lot of AD. J4 is tank thats more on the damage side. Best tank jungler though IMO is amumu. \n\nIt mainly depends on your playstyle. If you play jungle i suggest amumu, naut, voli. If support i suggest braum/alistar. For top, naughtalis/mundo/malphtite","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-06T12:55:50.032+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"might I add a few picks to that list:\n\n{{champion:113}} \nSejuani is a great teamfight champion with decent damage, mobility, tankiness and tons of cc. She's good for initiating, peeling, catching and chasing, and she's very well rounded. She's a bit weak early but come midgame you'll be invaluable to your team and lategame you're nigh unkillable.\n{{item:1413}} {{item:3742}}{{item:3065}}{{item:3025}}{{item:3800}}  {{item:3111}} \n\n{{champion:31}}\n When building as a tank, you become a meaty monster that can peel really well against assassins with a big aoe silence and offers some decent pick and teamfight potential with his long ass knockup and slowing q. He's got a decent, though mana hungry laning phase, tank stats, true damage, a second smite, sustain, waveclear and poke. When building like this it's important to understand you won't do well against anyone with lifesteal but on the plus side cho'gath is extemely good at freezing and laning like that, so it'll be a fairly irritating laning phase for your opponent unless they try to be really aggressive and towerdive you and that usually won't end well for them. Lategame you just walk around and laugh at the enemy trying to harm you.\nJungle:      {{item:1401}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3025}} {{item:3009}} \nTop:      {{item:3027}} {{item:3110}}  {{item:3068}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3111}}\n\n{{champion:89}} \nPraise the stun. When it comes to offensive/defensive peel there isn't much better than leona. She lacks sustain and she does rely on her adc to trigger her passive like braum but when it comes to tankiness in early kill lanes, outside of an ulting alistair, nothing comes close and moving into lategame teamfights, her ult can be devastating, as well as the surprising amount of followup damage she can offer beyond the initiation. 3 very long stuns and a slow, if you want to feel that you are making 'the plays' and carrying the team, she's one of the best tank supports out there.\nSup: {{item:2303}} {{item:3190}} {{item:3800}} {{item:3110}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3111}} ","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GameJack4213","date":"2016-11-06T08:19:09.458+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, how you want to play is a major point. Because anyone could just go up to you and use a bunch of combos and thrash you pretty hard. Darius is most likely to be the easiest and the best tank that fit for beginner. His passive is the most broken thing that makes him good. So you can just go up and drain until the enemies are dead. Malphite is also pretty good at tanking (so do Dr. mundo). Maybe he isn't that good at lane phase, But he's incredibly good at late game and team fight. Your passive gives you shield and your Seismic Shard & ult controls the game. I agree with DragonOverlord that Amumu is actually the best control jungler in league.  His Bandage Toss and ult deals damage and do a lot of stuns. Also good at late game team fight. Sighed could also be perform well in the game. But one thing that you need to watch out for is that always run and use poison damage to annoy your opponent. >: )","replies":[{"poster":"ChillBro123","date":"2016-11-06T08:44:27.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I played darius in the starter rotations and find him good for my playstyle i will buy him thx","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-11-06T08:12:22.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:33}} \n\n{{summoner:6}} \n\n{{item:3001}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3075}} {{item:3065}} {{item:1401}} {{item:3117}} \n\nRolling around at the speed of sound","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChillBro123","date":"2016-11-06T08:36:50.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the suggestions i will try them","replies":[]}]}
