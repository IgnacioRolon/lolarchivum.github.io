Back in bronze and silver, these champs are considered broken and i remember seeing plenty of them fed in my games when i was low. But now that im in plat, I&#039;ve yet to win a game with xin or yi on my team or lose when they&#039;re on the enemy team. Even on the rare occassion they get fed, they end up throwing because they think they can 1 v 5. Does anyone agree with me or is it just bad luck from my matchmaking?","replies":[{"poster":"NIghtshadowb","date":"2017-10-30T01:32:24.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's me, Trashy feeding hardstuck boosted animal. \nIn lower elos, players usually can't deal with master yi and xin zhao because of the lack of coordination with their teams. \nAlso in low elo, they have a lack of understanding of team comps and champion weaknesses. These confusion tiers allow for them to snowball and stomp games\nIn higher elo, most players have better understanding of champion weaknesses. They understand they need combination CC to counter master yi and xinzhao, so these champs are much harder to bring to higher elo. However, i have seen games where these champs still stomp. \nA main reason for this, is because of player ego, (Especially in platinum). They understand that Master yi gets countered by CC, however, these players refuse to pick these counter picking champs and want to go their yasuos or fioras or rivens or zeds and spam their level 7s, hoping that they would reach front page of reddit with their amazing plays.\nI think you are just dealing with a normal day of ranked games, where every game is a challenge to try not to tilt you","replies":[]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-10-20T05:49:30.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yi isn't OP. It's just that no one in Bronze knows how to deal with him. In fact, I love it when I see a Yi on the enemy team, because it's basically a free win. \n\nThey literally all do the same thing: run at you, Q, and hit you. I just start my charm, then they Q, hit him with my charm when his Q finishes, and one-shot him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"kaeota","date":"2017-10-20T01:55:01.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Neither; while these champs aren't really 'pro-tier' I can assure you they're not trash - you actually answered the question of why and didn't know it:\n\"because they think they can 1 v 5\"\n\nIn Bronze, a GOOD Yi / Xin player can 1 v 5, in gold it's less possible, on any champ. The problem isn't the champions, it's the players. Likewise, they're broken in Bronze because no one knows how to deal with them (what, save my CC for AFTER Yi presses Q? Don't try to burst him through his heal?).\n\n**n.b.
