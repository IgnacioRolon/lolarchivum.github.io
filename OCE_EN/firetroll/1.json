Sometimes matches are totally one sided when you look up the op.gg you&#039;ll see a team of diamonds and plats versing a team of bronzes and silvers (comparison of their solo queue rank). Which has led to some people treating flex as just normal draft a place to learn a new role or champion.\r\nI assumed that because a lots of high ranking solo queue players haven&#039;t played enough flex games that they haven&#039;t climbed to where they belong which is what is causing this disparity ingame. I had accepted that this is just the way things are in OCE Flex Queue.\r\nWhat is frustrating is that I&#039;m unable to play with my solo/duo queue partner in flex queue. We are both Gold 2 in solo/duo but he is Plat 5 in flex and I&#039;m only Silver 3 which under the current limitations stops us from playing together.\r\nThe issue with the current limitations is that even though we are unable to queue together we could very easily still end up in the same game. I spectated a recent flex queue game of my duo partner while waiting for him so we could play solo queue and noticed a game similar to the one described above, almost all plats versing almost all silvers (solo queue rank). Curiosity got the better of me and I looked at the flex rank of all the players in the game, there was a range of players from bronze to platinum.\r\nRiot stops me from queuing with someone that is more than a division away but doesn&#039;t stop games from forming with players more than a full division away. Most likely this comes down to lack of players playing flex queue at any given time so they want people in games not sitting in queue for hours but if that&#039;s the case please relax the limitations. The player base of flex queue in OCE isn&#039;t large enough to ensure the quality of games that the queue limitations are designed to enforce.\r\nTLDR: Flex Queue games in OCE will match bronze (flex rank) vs plat (flex rank) but still won&#039;t let you queue up with someone more than 1 Tier away. Riot should consider relaxing the limitations in Flex Queue due to the lack of player base in OCE.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T05:04:08.987+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you've played both queues reasonably evenly, or have only played flex, then you won't really see those problems. These matchmaking issues arise when people who don't normally play flex are playing flex since their rank won't be accurate to their MMR, since MMR adjusts much more quickly than rank does.\n\nFor the same reason, SIlvers vsing Plats can be perfectly legitimate. Those silvers likely are higher skill than silver, but just don't play flex to raise that rank, and those Plats could have had a bad losing streak and tanked their mmr to silver levels. Rank itself is only a guide, and while such matchups should be reasonably rare, they will be more common in flex since it's the least popular of the two ranked queues and people's ranks won't be totally accurate to their MMR.\n\nIt's one of the bigger drawbacks to having such a small server with two ranked queues.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-06T08:13:17.920+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I went 8-2 in placements, got Bronze 5 0 LP in FlexQ, and am matched against Golds/Plats. If my MMR were higher, I wouldn't have been placed in Bronze 5 0 LP. \n\nHow would you explain that? (Actual question, not a snarky response)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T08:18:51.556+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could be that their mmr was lower which was why you were placed with them. But placement mmr only has a small impact on your placement rank anyway. More what it does is adjust your mmr in relation to last season to determine how much LP you will earn in this season once you start playing ranked. If you have improved from last season then you will gain more LP and climb faster and visa versa. \n\nAt least, that's how it works to the best of my understanding. Placement rank is pretty much always 1-2 tiers (at least) below your last season rank, regardless of where your mmr actually sits. Since you ended last season in Bronze 5, you were placed in B5 this season, but if you were vsing golds and plats in placements, then probably in your subsequent games you'd be earning more LP for winning until you caught up a bit and your mmr adjusted.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-06T08:20:52.358+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay :) Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T08:31:35.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's only my best guess, I don't pretend to know the exact details because noone outside of Riot does, but we do know for sure that your placement rank will pretty much always be a little below your end of last season rank, regardless of how your placements matches went.","replies":[{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-06T08:38:55.415+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay.

Solo was also based on dynamic rank this season because there was no solo in season 6.

Maybe change the limitation to be based on MMR rather than rank? But they probably wouldn't do that because they don't want people to know what their MMR is.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-09-06T08:11:55.860+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems unlikely they will make things different between OCE and other regions (non-Riot run regions excepted of course), but shrinking the party eligibility might help. It also might not of course, I don't think it's the parties causing problems but more just the playtime in flex, and further limiting who you can play with might only serve to decrease the population of flex queue too much and cause more problems than it fixes.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Akkordian Zoeve","date":"2017-09-06T08:15:50.159+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with this.
