I&#039;m assuming a lot of players, due to various commitments, struggle to play during the week and can only play weekends. it&#039;s unreasonable to gate off a reward that other regions have access to either via an always open queue or are given it for 50 ranked wins if their region doesn&#039;t have the game mode available.\r\n\r\nPlease allow OCE players to earn the TT graves chroma via the 50 ranked wins!","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-10-09T06:55:27.029+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the problem is, that there are only really 2 options for them.\n\n1. Make Graves easier to get in OCE TT than in the rest of the world.\n\n2. Treat OCE as a region that doesn't have ranked TT, and so miss out entirely on a Chroma for Graves. _(just like we missed out on the ranked icon for TT a couple of years back)_\n\nOption 1 will be seen as unfair by the rest of the world, because it devalues their chroma. \nOption 2 is stink for OCE players because obviously thats unfair.\n\nSo what can you do? \nYou're truly stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nLittle Witch Eve makes a good point, and I agree with it!\nBut the fact that Riot hasn't enabled it on weekends already probably means that they don't think the queue would be healthy enough to survive, OR it would take players way from other queues and so disadvantage those games.\n\nNo matter what you do in this situation, someone will always lose and Riot will get the aggro. \nEither it's the rest of the world getting mad because almost everyone in OCE gets a chroma for Graves easy, or its OCE getting mad because almost no one gets a chroma for Graves, or its OCE getting mad because all their other queues are falling apart because TT is up for too long. \n\nNo matter what happens here Riot takes flak from someone, and disadvantaging OCE is the lesser of two evils.\n\nBut you know what would solve this problem once and for all?\n\n**DONT HAVE A F*CKING LIMITED EDITION BRAGGING RIGHTS SKIN THAT CAUSES TOXICITY IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! **\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-11T01:07:15.850+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":2,"body":"You've also got to consider the players who have played TT ranked all year to get gold.

I'm also happy to answer any questions here too!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-11T04:20:11.020+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"TT is basically a smaller SR, with no wards, and more defined team strengths and weaknesses due to the smaller team comps. I made a [post](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/4yOAaYev?comment=00010000) on the nuances of TT a while ago that briefly mentions this.\n\nMy best tip is to carefully consider if and when you need to recall or push. Because your team and the map are so small, having one player back in base or losing a skirmish (even with no deaths) means a huge loss in pressure that can see you quickly losing (or gaining, if you're on the winning side) multiple turrets.\n\nTry to time your backs with your team so that you're all on the map at the same time to make a play, but only when you know the enemy isn't likely to push down one of your lanes.\nDon't invade if either of your other teammates are back in base as you'll quickly find yourself outnumbered, unless you are super fed or the enemy has been pushed out of their jungle.\n\nAlso remember to use your trinket rather than facechecking brush. (trinket can also spot traps and invisible champions)\n\nEDIT: Oh also, treat the middle section of the map like another lane that needs to be controlled. Try to maintain vision there every now and then by having the jungler briefly check it or sit there if there are no camps or viable ganks. This will prevent most ganks.\nAnd Vilemaw pit is just another gank path for top lane. Almost no one expects it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SulkyJoe","date":"2017-10-17T14:38:18.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you at least make TT ranked the entire times it's up now, so we don't have half the games being TT norms where it doesn't even count.

If a player has real world commitments for the next 4 weeks on Thursdays and Fridays there's no way to get that chroma. \n\nIf they had mentioned it earlier in the season that there would be an extra reward for ranked TT I would have started the grind earlier like I did with flex queue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2017-10-10T08:00:08.379+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"who the fuck plays graves anymore","replies":[]}]}
