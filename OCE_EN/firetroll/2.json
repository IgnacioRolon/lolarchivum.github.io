Very few players will make the highest threshold since we set it at a level that rewards the top 10-15%...and you'd be surprised at exactly how much people play and buy runes.   I'm not comfortable with posting the details of your account on this board, so if you'd like for someone to tell you how many hours you've played, and double-check that your transfer data went through correctly, your best bet is to send in a ticket with player support.\n\nHope you're enjoying the new runes in the meanwhile though!","replies":[{"poster":"XXXYX","date":"2017-11-07T10:06:09.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hi Django UnJaned ï¼Œ\n\n  i have similar enquires with firetroll, is that i had like 1x rune pages before, but wen i log in i have seen any reward at all, not sure if you could kindly have a look at that for me as well :( i paid and transfered to multiple regions for several times, not sure if that would be the reason? \n\nThank you so mcuh","replies":[{"poster":"Django UnJaned","date":"2017-11-07T23:39:45.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey XXXYX,  you don't get your rewards on log-in, but from completing the preseason reward missions (play a matchmade game, win or lose).  You'll get all of your rewards granted except your BE.

You can check them out by doing either of the following:\n1. Click on the notification button (under the X For closing your client and above your friend's list) and open up any of the gifting events. You should see a pop-up with the epics you received.\n2.
