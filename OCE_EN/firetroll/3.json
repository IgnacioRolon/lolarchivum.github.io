Until today I wasn&#039;t even aware that we had ranked TT enabled. \r\n\r\nCan OCE please be considered as a region without ranked TT? I&#039;m assuming a lot of players, due to various commitments, struggle to play during the week and can only play weekends. it&#039;s unreasonable to gate off a reward that other regions have access to either via an always open queue or are given it for 50 ranked wins if their region doesn&#039;t have the game mode available. \r\n\r\nPlease allow OCE players to earn the TT graves chroma via the 50 ranked wins!","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2017-10-24T21:52:32.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While I can empathise with you that you didn't know that Ranked Flex 3v3 wasn't enabled on the Oceania server, there have been a good number of folks on Oceania who have been playing it for the entire season and to remove the ranked rewards from this queue and to put it on Summoner's Rift queues would not only be a slap in the face to these players, but it'd also (1) take a hit to Riot's trust with players and (2) leave a negative Ranked Flex 3v3 experience with a lot of players. I hope that makes sense, but please feel free to ask any questions you may have!","replies":[]}]}
