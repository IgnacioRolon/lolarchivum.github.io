How is it that I&#039;m full pen plus LDR and i STILL CAN&#039;T SCRATCH THEM but noooooooooooooo the full tanks gets to annihilate me cause I have less health then them. I was even fed an still got bum blasted by the tank, PLUS I HAD PEEL SO HOORAY? \r\n\r\nJust seriously unimpressed that you can just build &quot;sunfire&quot; an other DEFENSIVE items and thats game nice an sealed up for the win cause don&#039;t worry you&#039;ll never die and you can kill anyone. I&#039;ve never had a problem with frozen mallet or rylies i think their fine but jesus so sick of tanks that in a defensive build destroy me and my team regardless off the skill or positioning I have.\r\n\r\nThis ISN&#039;T fun by any means. I hope season 7 changes this garbage up an that LW is a decent item again to deal with tanks. \r\n(btw i had yomu,duskblade,maw an LDR an still couldnt scratch the tank. But destroyed squishy balanced right???)","replies":[{"poster":"nimnael","date":"2016-10-17T17:31:19.120+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Mine isn't really a complain about tanks dealing damage but I find \"weird\" a full ap champions like cho and malphite dealing so much damage while still being so tanky. Would be like seeing an assassin full tank and still be able to kill everyone except tanks. Luckily I don't see it that often anymore but there's been a time where I always had a full ap cho either in my team or in the enemy one. Cho gat is the one that always made me thought like there's something wrong with him cause in late game I could see a full ap cho with 3k+ good armor/mr still 100-20(and some cases100-0) with a rotation almost anyone,just full tanks surviving.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-09-14T23:48:46.811+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some tanks like Shen (Who is a tank killer) are fine because all of his damage is % damage, which means he can kill a tank with ease, **but** it takes no less time to kill a squishy either, meaning unlike talks like volibear and Cho, he cant burst you down instantly. and it gives both him and his enemy the to counterplay.\n\nBut most of the other tanks are just basically assassins that you can't kill, and its bloody annoying...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2016-09-14T01:08:39.226+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"buy a black cleaver/git gud","replies":[{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-14T08:50:23.308+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or as an adc get mortal reminder + get good is getting a bit old, more like learn from your games and be better than before","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Łæoña","date":"2016-09-13T19:25:07.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah it is very annoying that they can do so much while you try to burn through their health.
