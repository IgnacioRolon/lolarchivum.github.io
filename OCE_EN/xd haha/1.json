Like how does that work, is the remaining 0.5 seconds meant just to scare people away as a zoning tool or something? Also unless the ult is kept on top of someone it&#039;s really inaccurate to know when it will zap you/the enemy. How do viktor mains deal with this? Do they borrow their zhonya&#039;s psychological internal clock, reduce it by 0.5 seconds, with no indicators, then know exactly when it&#039;ll hit?!?!?\n\nEdit apparently there is an indicator, just tested this. Yeah, there is.
