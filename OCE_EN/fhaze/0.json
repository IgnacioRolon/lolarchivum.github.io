I have come up with a suggestion / idea and actually sent a ticket to riot, read by (Riot games player support) Spine Splitter. He / she told me to post here, any ways my idea is to add IP/EXP Boosts to the gifting centre. I think this would be a great idea for the following reason(s):\r\n\r\nLol there's pretty much only 1 reason or 2 but;\r\n\r\n1. If you are smurfing on a new account you can gift yourself and make the journey to getting level 30 and buying those champs / runes that you need quicker and easier so you don't have to spend as much time doing it.\r\n\r\n2. Also helping out your friends that are trying to level up or need some quick IP , you can always gift them.\r\n\r\nComment below and tell me what you think because I believe we could make this happen sooner or later down the road, and something that I have suggested or just someone from the LoL community has suggested and it being taken into consideration and then being in the game would personally I think be an amazing thing like seeing something you asked for in a game.\r\n\r\nAgain I hope you guys like the sound of it, mainly for the smurfing part as for myself I have 2 accounts, this one being my main and my other one containing over 10,000RP , me not wanting / needing skins I would much prefer to send myself IP boosts for 50 wins or so and just save up for the runes and new champs I would like to buy.\r\n\r\nHappy new years to everyone , good luck with all your games and thank you for reading my discussion I really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-07T06:01:19.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly, I thought you could already do this. I'm all for it, if that's the case.\n\nI'm don't like smurfs at all, though. They ruin the health of the game (do you remember the time where a low level player was always a greenie?). This seems like something that would counter-act that; smurfs would get to level 30 a lot quicker, and it's a lot of hassle to get RP for another account when you already have RP on your own.\n\nNot too sure why you were told to post here though, seems a bit irrelevant to help and support. I'd put it on player creations.\n\nAnyway, solid idea.","replies":[{"poster":"Fhaze","date":"2015-01-09T08:55:15.996+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Who would think ^ Thanks for your reply mate, and as I said it was my first time posting every in forums so it was actually my own fault as to posting in Help & Support.
