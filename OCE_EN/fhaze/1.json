I have come up with a suggestion / idea and actually sent a ticket to riot, read by (Riot games player support) Spine Splitter. He / she told me to post here, any ways my idea is to add IP/EXP Boosts to the gifting centre. I think this would be a great idea for the following reason(s):\r\n\r\nLol there's pretty much only 1 reason or 2 but;\r\n\r\nIf you are smurfing on a new account you can gift yourself and make the journey to getting level 30 and buying those champs / runes that you need quicker and easier so you don't have to spend as much time doing it.\r\n\r\nAlso helping out your friends that are trying to level up or need some quick IP , you can always gift them.\r\n\r\nComment below and tell me what you think because I believe we could make this happen sooner or later down the road, and something that I have suggested or just someone from the LoL community has suggested and it being taken into consideration and then being in the game would personally I think be an amazing thing like seeing something you asked for in a game.\r\n\r\nAgain I hope you guys like the sound of it, mainly for the smurfing part as for myself I have 2 accounts, this one being my main and my other one containing over 10,000RP , me not wanting / needing skins I would much prefer to send myself IP boosts for 50 wins or so and just save up for the runes and new champs I would like to buy.\r\n\r\nHappy new years to everyone , good luck with all your games and thank you for reading my discussion I really appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Fhaze","date":"2015-01-10T02:05:31.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also now that on the 23rd all throughout to the 27th the IP and EXP Boosts are 50% off on sale, this would make it the most perfect oppertunity, as well as tier 3 runes being 30% off i honestly don't think there will or would be a more perfect chance for my idea to come into play. \n\nHere is the link to the sales information: http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/prepare-2015-season-kickoff-sale","replies":[]}]}
