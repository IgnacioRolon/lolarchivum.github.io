I know how to ward, deny creeps, position, zone and would say that I know how to play mid good. I just can&#039;t wrap my mind around what I&#039;m doing wrong. Any tips for me?","replies":[{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-07-04T04:39:34.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your cs is extremely low, even in the games you're winning. You also probably need to get a better understanding of when people can kill you so you know when to back off. Focus on farming well without dying and you will see a dramatic improvement in your strength mid-game. Worry about killing/denying your enemy once you can already farm well yourself.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-07-03T12:32:39.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your ranked team has a plat and a gold, so your getting matched with Goldish players, and you may be good as a mid laner in bronze, that doesn't mean your a good mid laner in gold.","replies":[{"poster":"Utarzi","date":"2015-07-03T13:08:15.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But even in bronze I suck.","replies":[{"poster":"noogai","date":"2015-07-03T15:00:07.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Aye, let us know what midlaners you play, and we can advise you of common matchups, build-paths and itemization mistakes.\n\nThe rest is mechanics, good sir.
