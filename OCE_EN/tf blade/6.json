This is unfair in my opinion because of how difficult and slow it is to get your honor level back up.\r\n\r\nI was banned for two weeks On September 6 after achieving honor level 5 and as a result, had my honor level reduced to 0, since then, I have been averaging 1-2 honors a game and have only reached Honor level 0, checkpoint 2. Meaning if I was to keep this up, I would need to be banned around 5 months before the end of the season if I was to even consider being eligible for the end of season rewards. This season I climbed from Gold 4 to Plat 1 and I am unable to show off my achievement all because some people got butthurt because I called them out for playing badly. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the system that they had in 2017 was better as the requirement for getting your ranked rewards was to not be banned after a certain date. Because if someone was to get banned at the time that the date that was set, there was a certainty that regardless, honor level 2 would be unachievable.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why this system is flawed, is because the revamped Honor System was introduced as a way to _reward_  players for being positive players in the league community and not as a way to _punish_ players for acting up.\r\n\r\nYes, I believe that it is justified that players with low honor levels cannot receive free hextech rewards such as key fragments, but this is because those are bonus rewards for being honorable and is an incentive for players to get their honor level back up. Ranked rewards are different, as they are meant to be a showcase of skill and not whether or not somebody said something that someone else didn't like.\r\n\r\nThe goal of making this post is to at least get the message out there that, as a long-time player, I believe this is unfair and should be relooked at by Riot. Hopefully, someone hears me and something can be done about this.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-10-25T05:28:45.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Assuming this ISN'T bait;\n\n>This is unfair in my opinion because of how difficult and slow it is to get your honor level back up.\n\n\"It is difficult to not be a crappy person\"\nIt is insane how easy it is to level up honor levels. I took a 2-3 month break not long after hitting honor 5 this season and that was 2 months ago. \nBefore then, I went from level 3, checkpoint 0 in the span of I would have to say 3 months. \nIn the 2 months of being back, i've gotten 5 honor 5 orbs. (all trash rewards though)\n\n>to reward players for being positive players in the league community and not as a way to punish players for acting up.\n\nIt hinders trashy people, also you have the instant feedback system (which is busted), before then you had the tribunal. \nDid you only start this year? \n\n>Ranked rewards are different, as they are meant to be a showcase of skill and not whether or not somebody said something that someone else didn't like.\n\nWhat skill?\nMost accounts that make the minimum requirement are paid for or boosted accounts. \nThe rest of that sentence is irrelevant. \n\n>long-time player\nYour post indicates you only started this year, thats not a long time.","replies":[{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-10-25T07:48:15.632+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It takes 3-5 months to get honor level 2, getting to honor level one alone takes 2-3 months","replies":[]}]}]}
