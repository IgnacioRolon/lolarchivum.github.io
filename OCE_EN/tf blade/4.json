Which requires alot of context that i&#039;ll give in this post. I&#039;ll begin by stating that in the second, third and fourth lines were not consecutive, they each had a toxic line from our jg (evelynn) that made me say stuff like &quot;fuck off&quot;. In between she said decided to say I was &quot;0/3&quot; and I told her to fuck off because its not like she was trying to help me in the first place. Now where I said &quot;I&#039;m inting&quot; was taken the wrong way. I was not literally &#039;inting&#039; I said it because it looked like I was basically inting with a score like that (WHICH I WASNT). Eve throughout the game was doing shit like spamming my death timer every time I died to obviously tilt me (which she did). One thing you might also point out is where I said &quot;cao ni ma&quot;. This wasnt out of the blue, this Vayne was spamming chat with asian (not sure which, probably chinese) and then finally our eve and vayne both dc&#039;d after we lost a team fight. I dont know why I was chat restricted and would like a proper explanation.","replies":[{"poster":"Brickk","date":"2017-11-24T07:53:18.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"toxic IMO.
