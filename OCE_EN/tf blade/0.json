So even if OP wasn't the *most recent* person to report the player in question, they should (or should have) still receive(d) a notification of the punishment, when it actually happens (if relatively soon).\n\nThat said, if the player in question were going to get punished off that behaviour, I don't see any reason why an IFS notification wouldn't have already come through for OP, as it would generally tend to happen as soon as 15 minutes after the report is submitted, and (based on information provided) they were exhibiting extremely toxic behaviours that should *definitely* cause an escalation of punishment.\n\n*To Overburn*: I'd definitely recommend submitting a ticket via [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us) about this, if you haven't already. Explain the situation as best you can and provide as much relevant information as you can (screenshots/video of the players behaviour would probably help, if available). If that goes nowhere, I can definitely see about getting one of the OCE Rioters directly involved to look at what's happened behind the scenes, check for anything that's gone wrong along the normal processes.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2017-11-29T05:41:31.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Got my reponse! It doesnt even feel like im getting responded to by a human anymore.

We will look into it and take the appropriate measures, although we cannot often take direct actions from tickets submitted by players. Also, never forget to use the report system, as it helps us track down the culprits and make them meet the famous Noxian Guillotine faster! Keep on doing a good work!\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, or need help with anything else, do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nBest regards!\n\nWillbert \nRiot Games Player Support\"\n\nFucking stupid. Why have a feature to report somebody even though you say \"Although we cannot often take direct actions from tickets submitted by players.\" Are you fucking serious? They are going to let some guy off who said all this shit even though they are very tight on their chat?

It's fairly typical of Support, and while I can understand it does make their jobs a bit easier, it's definitely a crappy experience for the players. I honestly don't understand why they don't just take the extra couple of minutes to write out an actual response, as at least that way people will get a small indication that there is *some* level of care for the players.\n\nI'm honestly not sure what to make of it from the response they've given you (hopefully they'll act on it and do something, but don't hold your breath). You could try to continue pursuing the issue with them (you might actually get a written response that way), but again you wouldn't receive anything from them about whether the issue was addressed (at best, you would actually get the in-client notification that a player you reported was punished).\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you want to say and/or ask.","replies":[{"poster":"TF Blade","date":"2017-11-29T06:29:09.505+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not much to say to be honest, With the current state that this game is in im really finding it hard to properly enjoy the game.
