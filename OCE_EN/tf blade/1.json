No orders match the information provided.\" I have tried this numerous times and still have had no success in logging in. The order number is (((hidden))). Hopefully you are able to help me out here.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-14T10:13:34.548+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Generally, they reply within 48 hours, but some of the specific teams are much smaller and so can take longer to respond (the specialised player behaviour is one example of this, merch may well be the same).\n\nI would recommend just being patient (given that it's not a time-sensitive issue) for another day or two. If you have still not received a response then, bump your ticket (by replying to it) just *once* and then wait for a response from there.","replies":[]}]}
