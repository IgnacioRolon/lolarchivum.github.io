Rather, they focus on toxicity too much, and not what causes it. So as long as I&#039;m kind to people in chat, I can potentially ruin a lot of people&#039;s games and just say &quot;sorry guys, I&#039;m trying my best :(&quot; and get off scot free. That&#039;s intensely stupid riot. At least I know I can run it down mid and make sure every one in the game gets reported after calling me a %%%% several times, because that&#039;s offensive, and offensive language has no place in a game!!! Whereas cheating, scripting, feeding, griefing. All of those are perfectly fine. ESPECIALLY if you&#039;re lower elo, because it&#039;s so dynamic down there xd. I doubt this game will last longer than 2-3 more years at this rate.","replies":[{"poster":"HOLEE IT KINDRED","date":"2017-09-26T15:12:33.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Down vote this all you like.
