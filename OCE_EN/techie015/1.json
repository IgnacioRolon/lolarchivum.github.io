Today I went and viewed the game stats and found that the Warwick (who complained so much that I took jungle, so I swapped champs with him; I was Nasus) and Vayne (who decided to support) aren't even ranked yet and out of their placement games have a win/loss of 1/11 between them. The other teams lowest person was a B1 the rest S3's and a S2, our team two S4's and a S3. I thought Riot had fixed this sort of stuff like come on, give us not 1 but 2 players that have absolutely no idea what they are doing against players that are higher ranked than us... I just don't get it\n\nHas anyone else had this kind of thing happen? I was thinking maybe because it's pre-season something changed in the way queues are made","replies":[]}
