But from all the S ranks I have earn with Thresh while having him at level 5 mastery already. I have not once gotten a token for this achievement. I&#039;m starting to feel all my efforts to continually earn consistent amount of S- or Higher rank is becoming useless. Anyway to resolve this issue cause I tried everything and it seems I has become impossible to earn the Mastery 6 Token. Any solution to provide? I have Thresh at Mastery Level 5: Guardian with 31307 Total Champion Points. I have at least earned a minimum of 11 rank of S- or higher. What can I do at this point?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-07-12T07:10:24.223+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are two things I can immediately think of that would prevent you from earning tokens.\n\n**Have you had a recent punishment (chat restriction, ban etc)? **\nIf you are ineligible for loot because of this it tells you at the end of each game to the best of my knowledge so I doubt this is your issue.\n\n**Are you earning the S grades in Summoner's Rift normal or ranked modes? **\nOther gamemodes like RGM Queue, ARAM and TT won't give you mastery tokens (i.e you can only earn up to mastery 5 on other gamemodes).\n\nIf neither fits then your best bet is to [submit a support](http://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can help you out.","replies":[]}]}
