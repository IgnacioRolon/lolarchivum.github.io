I understand your frustration at people because they are not playing exactly how you would like them to play like, but that&#039;s life if a player is having a difficult time don&#039;t criticize them, encourage them, help them out, roam or gank them. They don&#039;t need someone typing to them that they are &quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;trash&quot;, and &quot;cancer&quot;. Just because someone isn&#039;t having their best game yelling at them won&#039;t help. If they aren&#039;t ganking you, be nice, I know for sure if someone calls me &quot;a trash jungler&quot; in all chat, and then beg me for a gank, I am for sure not going to come help you. Saying something like &quot;Hey jg, could you please gank me when possible :)&quot; is much better. \r\n\r\nOverall, this was a bit of a rant, but please, please, please, stop saying stuff like this to people and then the next game when you see a teammate doing the exact same as you were doing you say the community is trash.\r\n\r\nPlease stop. Let&#039;s make this community better.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-01T00:17:28.002+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back in season 2, on NA server (before OCE existed), I had an account banned for 256 years.

I was being very rude in almost every game, but only towards people who were mean to my mates and myself. Gave me a scare, and now I try my best to be the nicest I can be.\n\nHowever, like you said, most the time you can be so kind to everyone, but in the end, your team can easily forget and not a single person honour you (even if you carry). I feel like the honour system still doesn't work.","replies":[]}]}]}
