XD\r\n\r\n**Champion**: Harute, The Feared Bezerker \r\n**Lanes/Role**: Tank, Fighter \r\n**Lore**: Harute wasn&#039;t as feared and dangerous as he is today. Before, when he was a child in Ionia, he was happy, kind, and a gentle boy. Until one fateful day. Caught in the middle of the war between Noxius and Demacia, his village was the battlefield ending many lives of his people. Him and his big brother were caught by Noxian forces. After years of torturing for information they decided for them to be executed.\r\nBoth feeling scared of dying, the executioner gave them a chance knowing that they will not make it to the exit. In a desperate attempt to escape, Harute stalled the executioner long enough for his big brother to escape, when it was his turn to vanish he wasn&rsquo;t so lucky: losing an arm and severe blood loss.\r\nBoth barely making it out alive they enter the slums on Noxus territory. With the amount of blood loss from his severed arm, it was most likely he wouldn&#039;t make it. As he breathed his last breath, his brother called out for help, but no one listened. However, a Witch of the Black Rose made him a deal, saving his life for the cost of his brother&#039;s freedom. He accepted knowing that this will save his life. The witch gave Harute a set of armor. After putting it on, Harute fainted. Waking up and shocked to see his arm again, Harute had started to feel complete. What he didn&rsquo;t know was that the armor was defected and it slowly drove him insane. Challenging anyone who got in his way, he joined the rift to see if there was anyone that could put an end to his madness.\r\n&#039;He&#039;s an enemy feared by all who face him, those who survive are severely traumatized &lsquo;~Frightened Noxian General\r\n\r\n**Base Stats**:\r\nHealth- 650 (+75 per level)\r\nFury- 100 \r\nHealth Regen- 8 (+0.25 per level)\r\nFury Regen- 2.5 per second\r\nAttack Damage- 69 (+5 per level)\r\nAbility Power- 2 (+0.5 per level)\r\nAttack Speed- 0.8\r\nCrit Chance- 5%\r\nMovement Speed- 355\r\nArmor- 35 (75 when lvl 18)\r\nMagic Resist- 20 (+2.4 per level)\r\n\r\n**What Makes this Champion Unique?**\r\nWell, I talked to my friends about this and they thought it was good however they included another so now I got two options and both are really good so I&#039;ll get right to it... please choose one that you think is better (look below)\r\n**Option 1:**\r\nThat all of his moves contains a passive when maxed out (except R, which is gained already when reaching lvl 6)\r\nGeneral Passive: Honed Blade- Every 4th AA will deal additional damage based on 5% of enemy&rsquo;s maximum health \r\nQ- Each AA will cause a stack known as &#039;Chaotic fury&#039; which gives him an additional 2 attack damage (max stacks 5)\r\nW- When the fury bar is full he gains increased movement speed\r\nE- He gains an increase of armor and magic resist based on how much enemy champions he hits with this move (+5 per champ) for a limited time\r\nR- If he successfully Qs an enemy Champion he will absorb their passive (*note this will only work if possible, such as Vayne&#039;s W, or Pantheon&#039;s E, or Jax&#039;s R, Etc.) for a limited time (probably only for 10s).\r\n\r\n**Option 2:**\r\nPassive: Soul Eater-When he kills minions, monsters, or champions he gains souls in which he gains stacks soon benefitting him after reaching a certain amount.\r\n(Minions/Monsters=1, Large minions/Large monsters/ Enemy Champions=2)\r\n100- Consumes less fury when using W as well as increase regen of it\r\n200- Q will now have a longer range with an additional 0.5 duration to the enemy \r\n300- R will now have a slight increase on its range\r\n400- An increase of base stats by 10% (too much?

Also knocking them back and pressing Q will make you rush towards your blade and deal 5% damage on next AA, also if this hits the enemy near a wall or something that will cause collision will cause them to be stunned.\r\nW: Dark Armor Shroud, Cost=5 fury per second, Cool Down=3s\r\nToggle on- releases dark particles from the armor which deals 30 Ability power to nearby enemies (+5% of ap) \r\nToggle off- Regens 2.5 fury per second (AA will increase regen from 2.5 to 5 per second)\r\nE: Devastating Cleave, Cost= no cost, Cool Down=15s, Range=650\r\nHe charges a heavy 180 degrees side swing left or right depending on location of cursor (left side=right swing, right side=left swing) dealing 100 damage (+0 physical damage) however if the enemy hits a wall it deals an extra 100 damage as well as applying a 30% slow and 5% damage reduction.\r\nR: Chaos Breaker, Cost=50 fury, Cool down=105s, Range=400\r\nHe splits his giant broad sword in half to make 2 blades giving a slightly longer AA range, empowers Q so that he can do it twice, and gains an increase of attack speed +50% (maxing this out will be put almost up to the maximum attack speed limit). However decreases the maximum damage output by 10% (the faster you AA the decrease damage output is increased).\r\n\r\n**Sayings when being selected in Champ select:**\r\n&#039;This world will be covered with bodies soaked in a river of blood.&#039;\r\n**Sayings when heading to Destination:**\r\n&#039;Give me a worthy opponent&#039;\r\n&#039;Is there a challenger there?&#039;\r\n&#039;You can run, but you can&#039;t hide brother&#039;\r\n&#039;My sword is getting thirsty&#039; \r\n**Sayings when heading to Attack:**\r\n&#039;All that will be left is blood dripping down my blade&#039;\r\n(Loud manic-like screaming)\r\n&#039;All must perish&#039;\r\n&#039;Only the strong survive&#039;\r\n**Joke1:**\r\n&#039;I had my arm cut off, and no I&rsquo;m not all-right...&#039;\r\n**Joke2/taunt:**\r\n&#039;Let me kill you, so you can be a part of me&#039;\r\n&#039;I&#039;m not satisfied, bring in more warriors&#039;\r\n**Dance:**\r\nSplits his sword in half and starts juggling \r\n**Laugh:**\r\nManiac type laughter which may echo\r\n**Hidden Taunts:**\r\n&#039;Ahh... finally a challenger approaches&#039;\r\nOnly when there is an enemy Fiora, Pantheon, Aatrox, Xererath, Jax or Draven.\r\n**Recall:**\r\nWhen recalling his armor slowly opens and shows some souls getting out of the armor/ out of him","replies":[{"poster":"Ned FIanders","date":"2015-04-24T20:46:15.230+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"the img on the right does look like nightmare from soul calibre, that wasn't my intentions\"\nBull fucking shit mate.
