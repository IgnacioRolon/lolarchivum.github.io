The free window will open on January 23, 2015 and run through February 8, 2015.

OCE struggles to maintain its queues due to a lack of players, letting people transfer to NA for free would make the experience worse for everyone on OCE while doing nothing to improve NA.\n\nMoreover, I don't even agree that toxicity is higher in OCE. The grass is always greener on the other side. Toxicity exists on all servers, it's the nature of the game. Sure, I can agree that people on OCE are more vulgar in terms of their choice of words, but I've had far more negative experiences on NA than on OCE personally.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-01-16T04:38:09.157+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shouldn't this be stickied?","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-01-16T06:55:42.088+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, yes it should.

I've been getting constant disconnects the last weeks that I've been playing. I got 2 low priority queues for these ridiculous network issues already.\n\nThere is literally zero reasons for anyone to join over from NA to Oceania. It's like a dead wasteland over here.

No server can be worse than Oceania.\nOn Latin America they got an active community there and it's not just annoying Brazilians as one might expect. Even Northeast EU and Turkey servers are far superior to this one in every aspect, which is ridiculous in the case of the Turkey server since it's newer than the Oceania one.\n\nJust take this as a friendly tip from a fellow gamer, Oceania server is the worst of places to be in to play League of Legends.
