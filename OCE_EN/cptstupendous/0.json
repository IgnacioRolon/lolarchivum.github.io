We had some discussions with the skins team to do this for Oceania, but it soon became clear this would take a long time and we didn&#039;t want to hold up the launch, so we unlocked Pool Party Ziggs as a bonus for coming over to the new OCE server.\n\nWe messed up soon after that by saying that a server skin would also come out.\n\nWe went through an exhaustive process of coming up with ideas internally and reading every single boards/Reddit/social media post we could find. These ideas were then workshopped and taken through the standard skins criteria.\n\nWhat made this process so challenging was trying to come up with an idea that represents all of Oceania, while also making sure it resonates with players no matter where they live.  Themes like Dropbears, Ned Kelly, Kangaroos, Kiwis, and hundreds of others were where we went initially (we even started concepting on some of these). But the issue is that it would really only represent one of the countries that make up OCE and we needed something that represented everything. This took way too long and that sux. \n\nThere was also an expectation that this skin would be available for free. We really should have clarified this earlier for everyone. Because we already offered a free Pool Party Ziggs for everyone who transferred before 13 July 2013, we&rsquo;re not going to unlock another free skin.  \n\nWhat will be happening is the regionally inspired skin will be discounted to 50% off only in OCE with all funds raised in the first two weeks from OCE going to charity. The type of charity will be chosen by a vote and be between:\n\n* Environmental \n* Animal Rights\n* Humanitarian Relief Efforts\n* Medical Services/Research\n\nThere will be more information about this process in upcoming posts after the skin hits PBE, but we wanted to share this news with you now.\n\nIf you have any questions about any of this please ask them below.","replies":[{"poster":"GingerbeardMan","date":"2015-09-29T05:44:37.104+0000","up_votes":425,"down_votes":15,"body":"Donating to charity is a good thing, but the fact that we have to pay for the skin at all still rubs me the wrong way. \nAlso the whole \"not wanting to set a precedent for giving away multiple free skins\", I'm sorry, but that's a flat out lie since it's already been established that Riot will in fact do that. \nPeople that transferred to the Russian server got **three** free skins/champions, Volibear (Northern Storm), Caitlyn (Arctic Warfare), and of course Sejuani (Bear Cavalry). \nThis was **the same year**, that Oceania launched. I think we're entitled to at least ask for the server skin to be free since we've been waiting for over two years.","replies":[{"poster":"Sephyre3","date":"2015-09-30T06:53:00.634+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":64,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nYou’re correct that other regions have gotten different offers. I hear you that it's frustrating when one region gets something that another doesn't. We really should have announced this way earlier. By not saying anything we let the belief that this was free exist and that sux.\n\nWhat we are doing is making Cosmic Reaver Kassadin and the champion available with a 50% discount for 2 weeks with the funds raised in OCE during the sale period being donated to charity.\n\nAs mentioned we could have done a lot of things better on this, and we will take that feedback to heart moving forward.","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirage","date":"2015-09-30T09:06:42.169+0000","up_votes":89,"down_votes":3,"body":"Actually don't think announcing it earlier would've done anything. \n\nFor starters, this skin is 2 years late so we were hoping that 2 years of developing a server skin would actually represent the server. Instead, we got what seems to be a cool looking Kassadin skin with a last minute recall animation slapped on to just say \"hey it's oce related now\".\n\nI still can't believe this was the design chosen over 2 years. There were so many other concepts like a Rugby themed skin (which is heavily popular in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa etc.) that could've actually represented our server and on first glance by anyone in the region could've been actually identified as an OCEANIC skin.\n\nWhen Thailanders see the Muay Thai Lee Sin skin, that's actually a skin they see on first glance and go \"hey, that's our server skin\".\n\nWhen Latin Americans see Ghost Bridge Morgana, they can identify it from a childhood fairy tale that was told.\n\nShow this skin to your average Oceanic player and I can guarantee you that a very small percentage of them will identify it with our server skin. It's just a very poor design.\n\nOn top of this, you guys actually have the nerve to charge our own \"server\" skin to your own players where EVERY OTHER SERVER has gotten their one for free (and multiple ones at that, so the Ziggs debate is useless in my opinion).\n\nI mentioned this before but I've spent quite a bit of money on this game (well over $1000AUD) so the cost doesn't affect me at all. I just think it is a poor bloody performance and an embarrassment to even call this the Oceanic skin after 2 years of development.\n\nYou say you don't want to set a precedent but you already have and you are clearly bending it to a playerbase that has waited YEARS for their skin. I'm sorry, but in all honesty this shows that this skin was one that was already in planning for awhile with the full intention of being released for 1350 RP but with the Oceanic theme slapped on at the end.\n\nYou can say all you want about a 50% discount and charity, but we're only getting a 300 RP discount compared to OTHER servers (the skin will be 975 at release and we're getting it for 675 for 2 weeks ONLY).\n\nHonestly I'm really disappointed, if you guys want to keep reinforcing that this is the best result you came up with after 2 years, I personally will not buy this skin or anymore RP in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"IS0lat1ON","date":"2015-09-30T12:16:25.317+0000","up_votes":44,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dear god this so much. Similar boat here too mate (too afraid to think how much I have spent).\n\nThe skin has absolutely no identifiable feature that says \"That skin represents the Oceania server\" which DOESN'T look like it was an afterthought. In all seriousness, take out the southern cross {{champion:38}}  weapon and you are left with a regular {{champion:38}}  skin with no immediately identifiable feature.\n\nThe entire thing smells very bad imo, it seems like they knew they had backed themselves into a corner by stating we would get a free server skin, only to want to retract that statement immediately, but waiting 2 years (waiting for it to blow over as much as possible) before giving us an \"afterthought\" paid skin where profits go to charity thereby dividing the angry mob into \"selfish and heartless\" people who are still unhappy (<sarcasm> cause they must hate charities, that is definitely the reason <sarcasm>) vs everyone else.\n\nTo top it all off, until I got to this thread I didn't really care about the skin. In fact, I had seen this skin shown in the PBE 29/9 update, saw the skin (at the time I didn't care for it that much just as anyone has skins they love as soon as they see them and others you show indifference) and didn't even realise it was related to this. Isn't it appalling that at first glance we couldn't even identify with our own server skin.\n\nPoor form by Riot, very disappointed with this skin and the extensive manipulation.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Saintphoenix","date":"2015-09-29T07:33:06.317+0000","up_votes":55,"down_votes":3,"body":"I'm not complaining at all but i upvoted just so maybe a Rioter will reply to this and see what they say, i am curious","replies":[]},{"poster":"James Moriarty","date":"2015-09-29T21:51:47.003+0000","up_votes":43,"down_votes":2,"body":"I love how Riot has completely ignored this comment....While they're replied to a few others on this thread. \nGotta love Riot employees.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Raginghawk23","date":"2015-09-29T11:42:30.421+0000","up_votes":11,"down_votes":2,"body":"There is a point to this we should be given the server skin for free seeing as it is for our server and also how Russia got 3 free skins so I just hope Riot makes this free just for OCE but the charity Idea is a good compromise if when we bought the skin we chose where our money went instead of a single source","replies":[{"poster":"I am llluminati","date":"2015-09-29T22:19:41.648+0000","up_votes":25,"down_votes":1,"body":"The charity idea is good but I believe another use for Riot telling people that they're donating to charity (apart for obviously helping people) could be that it could help to lessen the \"blow\" on us that the skin is not free and that it's unfair for us because it makes us sympathize.
