Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday will each see 2x BO3 games. You can check out the full schedule [here](http://oce.lolesports.com/schedule).\r\n\r\nThroughout the week we&#039;re going to be testing out the new stream theatre. It&#039;s in beta at the moment, so let us know how it goes. Does it add to the viewing experience? Can you see yourself using it? Simply visit [watch.lolesports.com](http://watch.lolesports.com) from 6pm AEST and you&#039;ll get to take a look at the beta stream theatre. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help with this and happy esporting!","replies":[{"poster":"akamrboone","date":"2016-02-29T07:01:44.834+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Incredibly happy about this.

The various buttons and tab respond to mouseovers/click without any sort of issue. Fonts and images are all displayed correctly even when re-sizing the page. The Stats and Schedule box relocates to under the video feed and back as well. Everything is easy to read without having to take your eye off of the game. And finally, both the pop out and hide buttons seem to be working fine. The only thing I see is that some of the player photos are not loading, but I am just assuming that it because there's no photo available for those players. (at the moment Sharp's photo is mia)\n\nAll in all I do not see anything that looks broken in any way.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-03-01T09:03:02.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome feedback thank you! yes we're currently missing some pictures unfortunately.\n\nThank you so much!","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-03-21T07:25:15.753+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Pikachoochoo","date":"2016-03-21T07:26:58.576+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He sent me rage mail for upsetting her.
