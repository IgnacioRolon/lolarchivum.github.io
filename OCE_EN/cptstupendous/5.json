Have a read and if there's any additional questions ask away!\n\n1.\t**Why is Riot building a merch store?**\nWe love League and realize that creating a store full of high-quality items that resonate with League of Legends helps all of us deepen our connection with the game and its universe. The store will hopefully provide players with another outlet to engage with League but with physical products.    \n\n2.\t**Why is the store launching as a beta?**\nLaunching in beta gives us the opportunity to interact with players faster as they experience an initial version of the store and the merch within. This will allow us to learn, adapt, and evolve in order to deliver a more comprehensive merch experience that players deserve. Initial feedback is critically important as we work to build the right catalogue and make the store an unforgettable experience.  \n\n3.\t**What can you expect out of the beta?**\nLike any beta, the store will be a work in progress. The site is still under development, and while you can dive in and shop around right now, there are tons of things we plan to do in order to make the merch experience better. Expect to see real-time changes along the way as we evolve the site and product catalogue. \n\n\nNow that we covered a few items surrounding the beta, let’s talk about some of the merch that’ll be available and what the initial experience will be like when the Store Beta launches.\n\n4.\t**What product categories will be available during beta?**\nWe’ll have a variety of merch including clothing, collectibles, art, and accessories. Over time we’ll be explore new products within these categories and potentially even some spiffy new categories. \n\n5.\t**Will all players have access to the same products?**\nMaking sure that at launch players can pick up the same merch is important to us, so we’re rolling out every region’s store with the same initial items \n\n6.\t**What happens if an item sells out, will it be refreshed?** \nOne of the major benefits of beta is that it helps us learn which items you really love. This ultimately helps us create merch that raises the bar on awesome. We can’t promise that every item will be available in unlimited amounts, but we’ll continue to bring in new merch as often as possible over the coming months.\n\n7.\t**If my region’s store sells out of an item can I buy the same item from another region?**\nAt this time, each website only delivers to a players dedicated geographical region. \n\n\nRight now we don’t have a concrete timeline for how long beta will last, but we’re going to remain in beta as it takes to build a merch store experience that hopefully gives League players around the world the experience they’ve been waiting for. We’ll continually make changes as the site grows, both in-store and behind the curtain, so keep an eye out as the experience evolves. \n\nWe can’t wait to see what you think of the Riot Games Merch Store as we all take this first step in a journey towards leveling up League and Riot merch worldwide.\n\nHere's a taste of some of the cool stuff you'll be able to get your hands on\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-12-04T07:13:38.304+0000","up_votes":12,"down_votes":1,"body":"I can't wait for them to sell body pillows of champs.","replies":[{"poster":"Nekonatic","date":"2014-12-11T07:58:40.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Umm ...

Having an OCE merch store would probably mean the store is located domestically and shipping prices would be fair.\n\nI also hope the price of merchandise is fair as well.

Here is what I wrote:\n(and here is the link: http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/Iv4FJvh5-ideas-for-the-league-of-legends-merchandise-store )\n\nHey guys, I contacted Riot Support for this and they suggested me to see how much 'attention' I would get from saying what I originally wanted to, but I decided to try start a thread of what us players would like to see in the League of Legends Merchandise Store which has been talked about on Surr@20.\nSo, the League of Legends Merchandise Store is quite self explanatory, a store of League of Legends Merchandise.\n\nSo, my original thought I handed to Riot Support was that Riot could try to 'make' Gunpla-like sets for the more mechanical themed skins such as:\nMecha Kha'Zix (or anything else in the Mecha Series)\nFull Metal Jayce (or anything else in the Full Metal Series)\nBattlecast Prime Cho'Gath (or anything else in the Battlecast Series)\n\nSo what is \"Gunpla\"?\nGunpla is basically the Japanese toy/model sets of Gundam robots from the anime Gundam. I honestly think having toy/model build-able sets like these in League of Legends would be absolutely amazing, since the models tend to be higher quality than just some immovable figurines which Riot are planning to sell anyway.\n\nAnyway, I've attached a few pictures of what 'Gunpla' is in the links section and I honestly reckon that the most high priority skin goes to Mecha Kha'Zix. Just imagine a Mecha Kha'Zix model/toy in the 'fashion' of the Gunpla sets. Amazing.\n\nhttp://cdn.hobbylink.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/img_5497.jpg?d78934\n\nhttp://otakurevolution.com/storyimgs/gunpla/HandPaintedMKII.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2014-12-06T09:35:36.711+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the idea, have you tried to post it [here ](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2oa0w0/merch_ideas/)as well?

We wanted these hoodies to not only look and feel great, but also last a long time. We also understand the need to have multiple price points in the store across our categories and will be building out the assortment over time to reflect that goal. We’ll been adding items that are less expensive, as well as items that more expensive as we build out the store.\n\nAlso, just so you have an idea from someone who bought the hoodie, here a review found on reddit:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2op0ie/review_thresh_hoodie/\n\nHope this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-12-15T22:40:19.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Awesome, Thanks Mirk!\nI was completely unaware of the 'glow in the dark' aspect of the hoody.
