We have been exploring potential sites and toured our first one last week.\r\n\r\nWe have been working with a marine biologist and a company that specialises in artificial reef creation to identify the most suitable sites. They are all uniquely different, because the ocean is an amazingly diverse place, so they all have different requirements that impacts the design.\r\n\r\nAs you know this is a slow process, so we can&#039;t say it will be happening soon, but progress is steady and we will keep you updated as we go!\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please fire them off, but there is a lot we can&rsquo;t decide on until we find the site.\r\n\r\ngg,\r\n\r\nCptStupendous","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-02T06:02:20.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What locations are you considering so far?","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-04-02T07:35:38.206+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anywhere in Oceania is on the table, as long as it's going to be good for the environment.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WeakboyLuvLadies","date":"2015-04-03T22:15:48.391+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Keep up the great work, great things take time.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dancing Blades","date":"2015-04-02T06:26:05.095+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you make a \"process-like\" video?
