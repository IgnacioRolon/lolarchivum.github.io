When we launched League of Legends we picked up some off-the-shelf forum software because we had no idea how big the forums and LoL were going to get. I think it was certainly the right choice at the time but over the long run there have been some pretty significant limitations that stem from that choice.\n\n* **It’s difficult to integrate into the rest of the League of Legends experience.** Remember how long we had those question mark icons? We've been plagued with account authentication issues, etc.\n\n* **It’s extremely challenging to technically scale.** It wasn't built to handle tens of thousands of concurrent readers and tens of thousands of daily posts. Forums going down whenever NA has stability issues, etc.\n\n* **It’s extremely challenging to extend.** Doing seemingly easy things like adding search that “every other forum has” would involve months of hacky engineering work and is still not incredibly reliable. The time-cost of any given feature that we’re building on this technology is a fraction of what the same work would have been on the classic forums.\n\n* **It wasn't built to handle moderation at scale.** The toolset that allows large teams of 24x7 moderators to effectively collaborate just really didn't exist in the software. And it shouldn't have because we were using it in a way that it wasn't intended to be used.\n\nBuilding our own Boards platform - while a significant effort – goes a long way towards making the future better. It allows us to build forward-looking features and functionality, and lets us experiment to find the best types of community experiences.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2014-11-26T03:43:59.067+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah but old forum had most of the stuff better than this new one.\n\nTbh if you just add the new features like the champ/item/summoner's spell icons and easier picture attachments etc onto the old forum, it is the best forum experience you guys are looking for.\n\nAlso old forum doesn't kill off fun little threads like GD Tier List.\n\nI like how on the Board you can jump between different regions without making smurfs but that's kinda it sadly.","replies":[{"poster":"FauxSho","date":"2014-11-26T04:23:06.087+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Tbh if you just add the new features like the champ/item/summoner's spell icons and easier picture attachments etc onto the old forum, it is the best forum experience you guys are looking for.\n> \n> Also old forum doesn't kill off fun little threads like GD Tier List.\n> \n> I like how on the Board you can jump between different regions without making smurfs but that's kinda it sadly.\n\nI feel like you missed the entire point of the post marauder made.\nOn the old format, it was MUCH HARDER to add those small features you mentioned due to how it was designed to be used originally.\nSo the 'small things' that you think are small, really aren't small additions.\n\nJust like the launcher, we wanted all this fancy stuff, but in reality it just wasn't going to happen with the restrictions that were layed out when it was first designed. Hence the new launcher/patcher.\n\nThe old forum doesn't kill off fun little threads like GD Tier list?\nIn all honesty that never belonged on General Discussion, so is a moot point in my opinion.\n\nIf the thread here is popular enough it will stick around.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2014-11-26T04:02:28.216+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":3,"body":"One of the reasons we moved away from the old forum was because it was so hard too add features to\n> It’s extremely challenging to extend.
