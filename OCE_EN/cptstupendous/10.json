We still have our very own corner of the Internet dedicated to Oceanic Players talking about all the things.\r\n\r\nI know change can be frustrating, but I ask that everyone gives Boards a chance. There's some neat functionality here that will lead to a better experience for all. At some point the old forums will be made read only, but don't worry we won't be deleting the content, there's some pretty cool stuff there.\r\n\r\nWe've created boards for various topics and hope to grow those over time as more people join in on the conversation. Boards have specific discussion points, so check out the guidelines on the left as well as the universal rules.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and enjoy!","replies":[{"poster":"Norin","date":"2014-12-14T09:59:55.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I seriously need to ask, how on earth do i use attachments?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2014-11-18T23:02:27.394+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"15 days ago?\n\nBtw, cant post Threads in News Hour.
