In the last update we mentioned that we had found a suitable site. Well we&rsquo;ve now lodged applications with the relevant government agencies! There&rsquo;s no exact timeline or guarantee of approval, but we&rsquo;ll keep you posted.\n\nNow that the paperwork is in we&rsquo;re working with a marine structural engineering company and a 3D artist to design the reef itself. We want the reef to have a positive impact on the environment, as well as look cool.\n\nIf/when the application is approved we&rsquo;ll announce the location of the reef. Until then we&rsquo;ll keep pushing this along. All in all, we&rsquo;re in good shape!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bRzODGW.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2015-09-15T08:08:53.446+0000","up_votes":6,"down_votes":0,"body":"With your position changing from Community to eSports, has it been hard keeping this project \"Afloat\"?\n\nI'll show myself out.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-09-16T02:43:34.163+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha, that's terrible!\n\nThis project has been challenging yet fun.
