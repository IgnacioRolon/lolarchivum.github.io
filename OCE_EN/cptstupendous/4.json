I&rsquo;m going to leave this stickied until the next update, so everyone has a clear understanding of how the reef is progressing. \n\nThe graphic below outlines the broad steps we need to go through before the reef is ready. It&rsquo;s impossible to commit to time frames, because a lot depends on iteration and working with various partners including government agencies.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/m46kayX.jpg\n\nThe good news is, we&rsquo;ve found a suitable site! We&rsquo;re not ready to talk about where it is just yet, because we need to check a few permit boxes first. The site meets all the criteria though, so fingers crossed!\n\nWe&rsquo;re not sure exactly how long the permit process will take. It&rsquo;s super important we make sure your efforts have a positive impact on the environment, and that will take time. Once we&rsquo;re done with the permits we&rsquo;ll design the reef, then work with our partners to build it, then deploy it to its permanent home.\n\nIf you have any questions about the process then let us know in the comments below!\n\n{{champion:111}} ","replies":[{"poster":"Jonnerstv","date":"2015-06-30T05:57:30.462+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"What exactly are you doing?","replies":[{"poster":"Maya Normousbutt","date":"2015-06-30T06:39:49.223+0000","up_votes":14,"down_votes":0,"body":"We raised enough points to have a LoL themed artificial reef built in the ocean somewhere to celebrate ocean week","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"CÃ¸xy","date":"2015-06-30T03:41:12.554+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":1,"body":"where is going to be placed? and will there be a event when it is finish?","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2015-06-30T05:11:32.267+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"We're hoping to be able to give more detailed information on the location with next update.\n\nWhen the reef is finished and in place we'll definitely want to do something so everyone can enjoy the moment,  but we don't know what yet.
