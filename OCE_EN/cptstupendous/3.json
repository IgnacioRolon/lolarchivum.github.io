To fund that, we had to scale down our Grand Final presence.**\n\nHello Esports Fans!\n\nThe Riot Oceania team has been preparing for the 2017 season of the OPL and I want to give you all a preview of some upcoming changes to the league. I&rsquo;m also going to share with you some of the philosophies that have gone into those decisions.\n\nOver the past couple of years we have focused our attention on building the OPL into a stable league and we think we are in a good place with room for growth. \n\nThe major component of next year&rsquo;s strategy is all about you, the OPL fans. We believe that fandom is born from emotionally connecting viewers and players and this is where we see the biggest opportunity. In the past, regular season games have been played online by the OPL players from their homes, which didn&rsquo;t allow for all of the emotional moments and post-game comments to shine through from the pro players.\n\nSo starting next year we will be hosting all of the OPL games from our Studio here in Sydney. \n\nWe also recognise that Sydney is an expensive place to live (or to travel to during &ldquo;game day&rdquo;) and overall the management of clubs is becoming more expensive. While our long term vision is for clubs to be financially independent thanks to the support of sponsors and other revenue streams (merchandising, membership&hellip;), in the short term, to boost the growth of the ecosystem, we are going to increase the minimum guaranteed pro player payments and introduce a club co-payment model to give clubs access to more funding for things like gaming houses and coaches.\n\nAs you can imagine this will all come with an increase in costs, therefore we made the hard decision to scale down the size of our Grand Final . As part of our vision to create strong clubs supported by legions of passionate fans, we think it makes more sense to invest our resources improving the week-to-week experience, rather than over investing in a single event at the end of the season.\n\n\nWe&rsquo;re throwing our support behind the OPL clubs. But they need YOUR support as well. The best thing you can do for the OPL and your club is support them. Watch their games, engage with their content, bring your friends, argue with your mate who supports &lsquo;that other club&rsquo;. Get involved.\n\n**F.A.Q.**\n\nQ: Will you have live audience at the studio in Sydney?\nA: Initially there will not be a live studio audience for the games. This is because we&rsquo;re focusing on transitioning the league to having players on-site for 20 weeks of the regular season and finals. It&rsquo;s definitely something that we will continually evaluate in the future.\n\nQ: Is the &lsquo;stadium&rsquo; Grand Final &ldquo;gone&rdquo; for good or will you bring it back in 2018/2019?\nA: A &lsquo;stadium&rsquo; Grand Final is still something we want to have because it creates lasting memories fans hold forever so it&rsquo;s not gone forever. We&rsquo;ll announce plans for the Split 2 Grand Final next year.\n\nQ: What changes are being made to OPL player compensation?\nA: We&rsquo;re increasing the minimum guaranteed pro player payments and introducing a co-payment scheme to give clubs access to more funding for things like gaming houses and support staff. The Summoner Icon revenue sharing with the clubs will remain the same (50%), but we won&rsquo;t be introducing an additional minimum guarantee outside of the co-payment system**","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2016-09-27T05:10:13.508+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have two questions.\n\n1. The players are receiving increased payments and other benefits in 2017. Will this bring the teams average payments be enough to financially support themselves to make League of Legends their occupation and priority, or will teams still need to seek out alternative funding ( sponsorships, part-time work, content monetization ect. )\n\n2. If Riot's financial plans change from player endorsement and support back to live events and viewership support, will we likely end up seeing a large shift in the teams presence? Are teams that aren't in the top 3 going to have enough options of revenue to survive financially in the circuit?\n\nI'm excited and curious to see change, but also kind of scared.\n\nTo the future!","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-09-27T06:38:36.640+0000","up_votes":7,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Jason!\n\nYour first question is relative and one of perspective. Will any OPL players be buying their first boat next year? No. However, we do believe the new stipend is enough to live of, lifestyle depending.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by the first part of your second question. For the second part yes I believe so.

I understand there are restrictions across Riot based leagues but what about 3rd party leagues or events either online or at LAN (offline respectively).\n\nIf I wanted to host a 'grass roots' tournament or a new league that is outside of the Riot eco-system how does it impact the players, can they still compete in Riot leagues and is there any funding or support for the grass roots community such as one off events or new leagues targeted at the up-and-coming players within the community.\n\nPlaying at LAN is totally different and unique experience than playing from home. There are opportunities not only for the players but for people who would like to enter into the broadcasting scene as a commentator or host that can potentially be given at these LAN events. Building your underlying 'grass roots' scene is just as important as your pro scene. Giving these teams the LAN experience helps them understand what is required of them when they start to step up and grow as players.\n\n**Sidebar**: Back when Riot first entered the OCE region there was a lot of work put into building on top of the already established leagues hosted by various websites/companies (CG,ACL,etc) With the adoption of the LCS ruleset (from what I understand) that scene has died completely. Yes, I understand things are more established now for the pro scene but never forget where you came from and who helped you get there. I think there is a large community you're missing out on with too much focus on the pro scene and building into this 'closed' eco-system. \n\nPossibly a new topic or email if required as to not take this off-topic ;)","replies":[{"poster":"Gaslight","date":"2016-09-29T19:45:24.793+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can help answer that. From what I know, OPL players can't compete in third-party events (online or LAN), however OCS and OOL players can. There was a team in Melbourne that played in many LANs which included 3 OCS players (Fesh, Pabu, General). \n\nI believe OPL players are able to play in tournaments, but they must get approval from Riot. \n\nAs for support, Riot will give out RP prizes depending on how many teams, but they won't fund tournaments. That's up to the organizers.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Umi","date":"2016-09-27T06:54:38.942+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, \n\nJust two questions:\n\n1) What's the rough % increase in player salary from 2016 vs 2017?\n2) What type of figures can clubs expect to see from the co-payment scheme?

For a potentially 6 hour event **plus** player interaction, Atlus dunking, and everything else, $25 was an incredibly cheap price.\n\nAnother idea would be to hold it in Sydney again to minimise travel costs for teams, talent and equipment.\n\nI don't know if any of these are practical / in line with what Riot as a whole want to do, but I really enjoyed the event in Brisbane and it would be a bit of a pity to not have it happen next year.","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-11-01T01:49:47.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We looked at it very closely.
