How to make my team haul ass?","subforum":"Gameplay & Strategy","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"One of the biggest issues I am finding so far at lower elo is the stage where:\r\n\r\n*- You have a dragon or two*\r\n\r\n*- You have destroyed all enemy 1st turrets.*\r\n\r\n*- You push mid lane to the inhib turret*\r\n\r\n*- Now your team sits there procrastinating and poking away at champs not doing damage on the turret (or very little dmg)*\r\n\r\n**.....not realizing that the enemy is just re-gaining HP and buying items (returning stronger) and just waiting for your team to be whittle down enough for a counter-offensive with a shut-down or two.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI try to encourage the team to redirect their focus to another lane (so that when it comes to base-pushing you can split the enemies defence by hitting 2 inhib turrets)\r\n\r\nBut it hardly ever works. \r\nMost players get cocky and sit there until they get shut-down.\r\n\r\nRinse and repeat and a could-be-won game becomes a throw.\r\n\r\n**TLDR:**\r\nHow the hell do you get 5 random players to work cohesively and focus on logical objectives in one of the most egocentric, younger demographic-filled and toxic games ever created?\r\nWords and pings dont work.\r\nMaybe a GP orange can cure me of this scuuuuurvy.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-02-07T14:15:05.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Back ping * 3 and move away.\n\nFact is if they can't understand that it's a bad situation, not much you can do to convince them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-02-07T08:36:28.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you are sitting mid getting nothing done.

Yes agreed it happens a fair bit but NEVER DIVE IF IT'S 5V5 AND THEY HAVE MORE THEN HALF HP EACH, if its 3v5 and you have a **** ton of CC its fine and they are low.\n3. Try rotating or pushing out other lanes, and clearing camps and baron etc.\n4. Try getting someone to split that can 1v2 and get a kill so you can get tower play and keep your lane pressured but don't pressure to hard.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-07T07:30:45.844+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The amount of times I have gotten %%%% for splitting as a support because my team has sat there being stupid...\n... then gotten praise for getting a tower.\n\nSplitpush Soraka OP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-02-07T07:08:04.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried leading by example?
