(Definitely not hardcore Elo-climbing..but still playing ranked every now and then.)\r\n\r\nAny **objective** info regarding the game&#039;s status/player-base?\r\nObjective info such as; _&quot;Riot has dropped the ball a lot and cares mainly for cash-grabs with skins releases and has avoided crippling game issues for 6 months..&quot;. _\r\nOr, _&quot;Man, they have done some great updates and the game is thriving!&quot;_  etc.\r\n\r\nNot that I want this to turn into a massive flame-fest because I mention the following game; but I am looking into DOTA 2 as well. I would prefer to play LoL though (if it hasn&#039;t been ruined) since I understand the mechanics a lot more and it would be easier to get back into. Also, the faster combat/turn ratios are ideal to me.\r\n\r\nThanks ladies and gents! All the best.","replies":[]}
