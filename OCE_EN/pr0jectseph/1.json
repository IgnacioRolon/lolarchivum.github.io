Nothing negative occurs. No warnings received. Normal routine game from a casual, non-competitive gamer.\n\n**2.** Two days later I can&#039;t log in to LoL website or client. &quot;Password or username is incorrect.&quot;. Note, this seemed to be common within the last week due to a patch.\n\n**3.** I change password multiple times (assuming account security may be an issue) ---Though I have never shared my details.\n\n**4.** Still cant log in to Client or LoL website.\n\n**5.** Open a support ticket. Provide info.\n\n**6. **A day later, receive request for more personal info to help with resolution. I provide it.\n\n**7. **Another day later (today) I receive another request for more info.\n\n**8. **Same day (today) I am banned. Though I am somehow now able to log into the website/client.\n\nHow could I have undertaken ANY action to warrant a ban when I cannot even play?! \nAnd if you think someone else has access to the account then you are wrong. Even match history shows my last match as being a week ago. Which was my last match. So nobody else could be playing on my behalf.\n\nIf you can&#039;t see a problem here, then ..well, I would be speechless. It&#039;s obvious the system has screwed up somewhere here.\n\nAny decent suggestions for me part from lodging a support ticket?\n\n--edit--\n(Also, I understand this isn't the area to talk about this stuff as a part of forum etiquette. However, I am wondering if this does seem a little odd to other people. And if there was any helpful advice for me. Thanks!)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-05-28T05:13:43.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nAs Antiweapon pointed out, during account recovery Player Support will usually place a suspension on the account to prevent any unauthorised activity occurring, this will be lifted once the account has been recovered.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Antiweapon","date":"2017-05-27T12:06:06.152+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its most likely that your account was banned because of suspicious activity. It could be that someone was trying to get into your account and was banned as a preventative measure. \n\nThe length of the ban tells you what the ban was for, the year 2100 meaning it was banned as a preventative measure. Ticket to support should get you your account back.","replies":[]}]}
