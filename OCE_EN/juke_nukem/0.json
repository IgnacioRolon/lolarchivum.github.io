The cat survived by hunting the rats and mice that inhabited the walls\nalongside him. This cat had made the prison his home for the last two years, and every day he would explore a new room or corridor, uncovering the prison&#039;s secrets. One day, while exploring some old cells he&#039;d never come across before, he hears a muttering behind a large iron doored cell.\nOverwhelmed with curiosity he looks for a way inside, soon finding one through a small hole in the cell wall.\n\nSilently as only a cat can, slowly he walks into the cell. Its so dark not even he can see. Closer to the muttering noise the cat creeps until\nhe is looking face to face into eyes that glowed with madness. Afraid for his life the cat ran but in his panic didn&#039;t remember the way he had came.\nCringing on the other side of the cell the cat looked up and into those eyes again, seeing this time a sadness as well. The creature with the bright eyes, was coming closer, fearing the worst the cat closed his eyes.\n\nOne year they remained together in that cell, sharing the food the guards slipped through the door, and finding a small comfort in one anothers company. The cat heard all his new friends tales, all his desires, all his hatreds. Unaware that he too was slowly being changed by the creature\nhe resided with.\n\nThe iron door is pushed abruptly open, waking the two in the cell from their sleep. guards fill the doorway and one enters the room, picking the cats friend up by his neck and taking him away. For the first time after a year the cat see&#039;s his companion for the first time, a yordle.\nChasing after his friend the feline hero lets out a hiss and leaps onto the guard carrying the yordle, raking his claws across his face. Bellowing in anger and pain the guard peels the cat from himself and flings him back down the hallway. Time enough for the yordle to break free, looking up in time the cat see&#039;s his friend take the sword from the guards scabbard and run him through the stomach. The two guards left drew their swords and chased the yordle towards the cat. Sooty never before having had a friend, stands bewteen them. Ready to sacrifice his own life.\nClosing his eyes he lets out the most menacing howl he can muster.\nAn eternity seems to pass in those few seconds.\nEyes slowly opening reveal the two guards. Dying. They had both fell, both landing on their swords..\n\nThe league had heard rumors of a cat as black as soot, misfortune becoming to anyone that would harm it. Now after many years they know the rumors to be true. Sooty showed up on the doorstep of the Halls of Justice one evening, seemingly searching for something or someone.\nGiving the cat a bed and his own bowl, he now accompanies them on the fields of justice.\n\nI imagine this champ to be challenging to play. As a melee support you will need to build for some surviveabilty because your a puny cat and will die easy, but too tanky and passive wont have the damage to reflect on others. and seeing a veiger ult himself to death or nidalee spear backfire would be awesome and puts you on an edge gameplay wise making you a very interesting little shield.\n\nAbilities\n\nCURSE OF SOOTY!! passive ...... until a better name i used.. :D\n\nAny damaging ability , Auto attack that brings sooty below 50%  hp is reciprocated to the enemy champion for 50% of damage delt.\nIt would be on a cooldown.\n\nBREAK A LEG or HOPSCOTCH! &quot;Q&#039; or better name. \n\nCracks slowly spread outwards from Sooty until x radius, if an enemy steps onto a crack they will fall and stun themselves for 1 / 1.5 secs.. amount of time.\n\nPossibly could be a targeted spell also, just unsure if it would be too strong like that E.g targeting someone on the opposing team and none of their team mates could get very close to them,.\n\n\nMysterious stranger.....? lol &quot;w&quot;               Or make a W a gap closer / dash????\n\nw is a banshees veil basically. blocks 1 ability\n\nSUPERSTITION!! &quot;E&quot;\n\nEnemy champ believes dark forces are out get them.......\nmakes all non friendly / neutral monsters within &quot;x&quot; range of target enemy champion attack and focus the target for &quot;x&quot; amount of time. \nI think this ability would be very fun.\nGetting a creep wave to focus someone for a few seconds\n\nHYSTERIA! &quot;R&quot; ultimate\n\nMakes all enemy champs within range have recurring visions of their death, fearing them for 1 sec every 4 secs over 16 secs or something like that. long CD or a Dot ending in a fear... dunno\n\n\nI would really like to hear your opinions on my idea whether it be good or bad, any improvements / etc \nand if you like the concept and would enjoy playing a champion like this.\n\n\n\n\nDon&#039;t forget to review!!\n\nPLEASE leave a comment,\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Juke Nukem","date":"2016-08-12T06:14:15.890+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Edited.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-08-07T12:51:01.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"NIce post and ideas. The overall concept of the champion is great. Some really cool creativity in there. The only criticism I would say is that you can't give a champion too many stuns, fears or anything of the like. Although Leona is a good example of a Riot creation that worked and was made some what balanced, it is still hard to balance a champion that has a kit heavily directed in 1 direction. Obviously \"sooty\" would be a lock down utility. So maybe give her the ability to buff, shield or damage directly. Lulu is a good example.","replies":[{"poster":"Juke Nukem","date":"2016-08-12T06:02:17.745+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey thanks for your reply :D\nI agree with you, could possibly change the blind to a buff to do the same thing but you have to use it defensively e.g cast on an ally and and they block next ability, same as a banshee's.\nThanks for the input i like it ^^","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Juke Nukem","date":"2016-08-07T11:45:53.296+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juke Nukem","date":"2016-07-02T22:37:38.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"bump","replies":[]},{"poster":"Juke Nukem","date":"2016-06-20T05:39:02.136+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks Catspeare :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Catspeare","date":"2016-06-18T01:48:46.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice.
