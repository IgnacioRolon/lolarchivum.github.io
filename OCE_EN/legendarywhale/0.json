It might be because of the internet or the client itself (I&#039;m not sure which), either way, I&#039;ve been disconnecting during the loading stage and it&#039;s resulting in quite a few remakes. I really don&#039;t want to get banned, so how do I fix this? Is the game too heavy to run on my computer and is there any way I can prevent/fix that? What are some things I can do beforehand so I don&#039;t always cause a remake? \r\n\r\n{{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2018-05-18T11:08:36.612+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"try looking through these FAQs: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/sections/115002165887\n\nI'm having similar issues although not as bad.\n\nWhen a game starts its like LoL is sucking every ounce of power out of my PC to launch the game and I have an extremely good PC.\nI don't know what they did, but its been pretty taxing for 2-3 weeks.\n\nAlso today i've had huge FPS drops and i'm not alone.\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209010626-Frame-Skipping-on-High-End-PCs\n\nEither LoL is broken or maybe a graphics card update broke something with LoL.","replies":[]}]}
