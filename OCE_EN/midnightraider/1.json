I tested using my other account and before anything happens, it redirects to a typical survey/enter competition, where they ask for your phone number and the fees cost typically ridiculous amounts (so much for &#039;free RP&#039; haha). Sounds like a scam right?\r\n\r\nHowever, it has a functioning chat room system, where many were posting of their success. Sure, there were one or two bots that accused you of spamming when you ask a question or say something like &#039;it doesn&#039;t work&#039; (tested multiple times, the bot messages repeat themselves), but there seemed to be multiple individuals claiming it worked, they had personalised messages, and said stuff off topic to the website such as &#039;anyone up for a game / Skype&#039; or asking questions like me along the lines of &#039;can someone help me with the verification?&#039; and &#039;how long does it take to do?&#039;. After a while of looking through the chat logs, maybe around 40-50% of the messages are repeated/from bots. But just the sheer amount of personalised messages is very uncharacteristic of a typical scam website.\r\n\r\n**Overall, is there any way to find out how authentic this website is?** \r\nFrom the looks of it, its either one hell of a well orchestrated scam (I think its most likely that) or a legitimately working website.\r\nEither way, you should stay away from providing any personal info to this website.\r\n---\r\nBTW I HAVE NOT USED IT ON MY MAIN ACCOUNT and have not redeemed any &#039;free RP&#039;, so I don&#039;t believe I have broken any of Riot&#039;s rules and policy regarding the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-04T03:19:05.591+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> **Overall, is there any way to find out how authentic this website is?**\n\nActually, there is. If it isn't an official Riot Games website (leageoflegends.com, riotgames.com or lolesports.com [I think that covers it]), chances are it's some kind of scam and will either cause you to lose the account or plant a virus on your computer.\n\nSince you *have* visited the link, I'd recommend running an antivirus scan ASAP.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ShareX","date":"2017-11-04T01:21:34.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Looking at the page source it looks like that the whole page was a frame from another website (rphelper.helpingpeopleonedayatatime.online).\n\nits 100% fake btw","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-04T01:07:51.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, it's fake","replies":[]}]}
