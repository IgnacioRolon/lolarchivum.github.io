This happened twice in the last 4 games or so (usually losing focus because of the long waiting times), so I&#039;ve copped a 30 min queue block. I&#039;m wondering why Riot considers this a queue dodge even when I have selected the champs and all, as I honestly feel like they should reduce the punishments when it is unintentional or accidental like this.","replies":[]}
