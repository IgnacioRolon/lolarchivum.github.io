You need to improve yourself, and  I can give you some tips to work on.\n\n1. Farming. This is the absolute number 1 skill that a player needs. If you are in lane, you must at the very least be able to hit 100 cs before 20 minutes, and thats at the very least. In gold they often hit 100 at around 12-14 minutes if they are the ADC. As a general rule of thumb, 18 CS= 1 kill. If you can farm well, you dont need to get kills, and you can make a comeback even if you are 0-4. Farming is extremely important, I can't stress how important it is. There are many guides on how to farm effectively, so I'll let you look them up.\n\n2. Warding. Vision is extremely important in this game. If you ever watch the pros play, they are always constantly warding and clearing the enemy wards, because vision is so important. Get used to using your trinket at the very least, and if you want to improve even more, buy wards when you can as well.\n\n3. Map awareness. What use is having wards if you don't look at the map? Get used to looking at the map often. This lets you spot incoming ganks, as well as other reasons (see tip 4)\n\n4. Objective control (this ties in with map awareness). If 4 enemy champions are bot, and 1 mid, and you are the top laner? Push a tower. If the enemy are top, and you are the jungler? Take dragon or push bot tower. Objective control is what wins games. I've won so many games where the enemy were ahead in kills because they would roam as a 5 man group, but they wouldn't push towers, they wouldn't clear either jungles, they wouldnt take baron or dragon, whilst my team would see that all 5 were top and would push mid and bot or take drag. \n\n5. Communication. DO NOT RAGE. THIS IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. Yes, there are players in gold, plat, diamond who rage. However, raging is never helpful, no matter how much you want to. It's not constructive. It makes you all stand around wasting time (where you could be farming or grabbing objectives) typing. However, there is more to communication than just not raging. Pinging is extremely important. If your lane is missing, and you spot them roaming mid; Ping the hell outta that %%%%. If you spot the enemy jungler running past a ward, ping it. Ping to say you're moving top if you're gunna push. Ping to tell them to back off. \nFinally, tell your team mates what your plans are, and discuss what your team plan should be. Don't spend too much time on this, but its important nevertheless.\n\n6. Knowing when to fight. This is a tricky one because it mainly comes from experience. As a general rule of thumb, if your team is behind, try not to teamfight. Instead try to catch an enemy player, then teamfight as a 5v4. Again, another general rule of thumb is that if your team is ahead, try to force the teamfight by pressuring objectives. For example, group as a 5 man team and push the hell outta mid, or pressure dragon, ect. \nIn reality, however, its often not that simple. This is because that if you're behind, your team might be comprised of late game champions and the enemy team early game champions, and if its late game, even if you're behind, you should probably try force a fight. Or if you're ahead, maybe their team has better teamfight than you (maybe they have more aoe lockdown champions like Amumu or malphite and yasuo), you might want to just pressure the enemy by splitting up and contesting multiple objectives. But this one really comes from experience. \n\nThat's all the advice I can give you for now. Good luck, I hope you can improve, and have fun. Oh, and the advice I always get for climbing ELO is spamming the hell outta one champion. \n\nEdit: looked up your league profile. You probably shouldn't use the new champ in ranked for a while either.","replies":[{"poster":"AceSlayer","date":"2014-12-24T07:27:11.885+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the advice i'll take it all onboard & try to improve myself the best i can.\nBut why do you say not to use the new champ in ranked?","replies":[{"poster":"Mr Mercury","date":"2015-01-04T13:54:11.253+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because typically you aren't good enough with that Champion to play them in ranked. When you play ranked, you typically use very few champions. Play a champion for a few months before trying them in ranked. This helps you settle builds, strategies, and know how to act in different circumstances (how to use your advantage if you're ahead, or how to get back if you're behind)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-12-24T04:55:57.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you want to get \"carried\"?
