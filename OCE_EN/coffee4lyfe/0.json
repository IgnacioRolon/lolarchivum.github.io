You are given the same treatment as everyone else, the amount of money or time you spend on the game is irrelevant. You broke the rules, either more than once or very severely to have been issued a 14 day ban, and these are the consequences you have to face for that. Take it as a lesson and try to be better in future.","replies":[{"poster":"Coffee4Lyfe","date":"2017-01-01T20:47:32.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well ive had a few chat restrictions and thats all,  i was medium toxic in 3 games, like saying 'wtf' everytime i died and saying 'you're garbage' in all chat but dont think its worth a 2 week suspension","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-02T04:50:32.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The punishments issued in this manner follow tiers, those being 10 game chat restriction, 25 game chat restriction, 14 day ban and then, and was mentioned in your reform card the next punishment is permanent suspension of your account.\n\nYou can, with consistent good behaviour over a long enough period of time get your account back into good standing. For the average player with a 10 game chat restriction this will take about 3 months. Being on a 14 day ban it will take a lot longer, and ANY negative behaviour in the meantime, whether you are punished for it or not, will only extend that time.\n\nIn cases like these it is not so much a matter of severity (sever behaviours will skip punishment tiers) as it is consistency. You have been consistently negative, despite being warned twice previously in the form of your chat restrictions. \n\nThis 14 day ban is your third and final warning, and is meant to be some time away from the game for you to reflect on your behaviour and resolve to make it better. I will be very clear, just as the reform card was, if you continue this behaviour once your 14 day ban ends your account WILL be permanently suspended.","replies":[{"poster":"Coffee4Lyfe","date":"2017-01-02T09:56:10.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"the thing is ive seen the leaverbuster say to me 'good job on improving your behavior', 1 week later they send me a suspension?!?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-02T13:13:52.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LeaverBuster is a separate system, so it's \"good job\" refers only to your AFK/leaving behaviour.

They dont care about the player base any more than they can make a buck off you and so they changed the xp for new accounts causing more smurfing and to increase overall spending on the game. They dont just temp ban people from ranked, which is where almost all of the raging happens. \nHalf of the player base is toxic and the other half are over sensitive whingers. \nI got told I was being toxic in an aram for civilly pointing out that our sej was building pure ap and hiding at the back and trying to just ks by last second diving and saying that wasnt good teamwork and suggesting some tanky items and peel. So trying to promote teamwork is toxic and 2 people, the sej and another player said they would report me for being toxic. \nWait for the ban to be over, mute everyone in every game you play, stay out of flex where you often get ganged up on by duos and trios and never put more money into the f2p game would be my advice.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-01-02T01:55:51.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont worry, NZ $ arent worth all that much anyway with trump at the wheel.","replies":[]}]}
