Different coloured central stones (plain and fancy colours, dragons eye, sparkling diamond, demonic black with red cracks etc)\r\n2. Bigger or different style &quot;wings&quot; either side (or no wings).\r\n3. New animations when you flash it (Sparks, Glowing, Butterflies, Fire etc.)\r\n4. Sound effects when you flash it (Champion taunt, laugh, death etc.)\r\n\r\nYou would have to get an S+ (maybe too strict, but its gotta be hard to get) and already be level 7 mastery to get a token.\r\nEach customisation would vary in cost, the more extravagant costing  more.\r\nEach &#039;Collectable&#039; Mastery Customisation would be &#039;Unlocked&#039; for _that particular champion_.\r\nOnce you have unlocked a few you can mix and match as you like.\r\n\r\nI think this would add a bit more depth to the mastery system and make your ~~BM~~ **Mastery Flair** more unique (so you aren&#039;t like every other level 7 Yasuo). You could also align it to go with your favourite skin!\r\n\r\nFeedback would be really appreciated (especially if you think of more aspects we could change), and if you like the idea and are good and making effects and such maybe post a couple examples?","replies":[{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2016-11-26T02:33:03.196+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Seems like a really cool idea, hopefully rito notices the oceania server for once in a while","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2016-11-28T02:17:21.449+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or maybe have a coloured laurel (based on rank) that appears on your emote after you hit mastery 7 with a leaf for every S+ you've gotten upto a maximum of say 12, at which point the laurel gains some sparkly effect or something.\n\nThis sort of emote would also be very useful at giving information to your teammates about your skills with your champion and how good of a player you are. and would also make you feel better when you get matched against say a diamond yasou main in normals who just crushes you since when he spams his emote, you can be just like, okay I see I wasn't going to win this anyway, no point in getting mad.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ZeVexKryor","date":"2016-11-27T23:05:16.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That is a cool Idea, you might want to go over NA or EUW and post it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olliynx","date":"2016-11-26T11:22:29.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This would be awesome! :D","replies":[]}]}
