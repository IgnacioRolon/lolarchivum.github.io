Will let you all know once I get that confirmation.\n\nAs for the issue itself, it has happened somewhat recently (during the Odyssey event) and was dealt with in a timely fashion then, and I would expect the same to come from this instance. To be clear, it's probably best to wait it out rather than attempting to re-install the game (at this point) as that will likely not help the issue for a lot of people. Attempting to repair and/or restarting the client would be better options as you wont have to re-download the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-09T05:38:28.691+0000","up_votes":10,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just got a response from Riot Gehirn, and they're aware of the issue and working towards a fix.\n\nI'll let you all know when there's more info.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-09T05:54:51.186+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I haven't received word from the Rioters yet, so the issue *may* still be present.
