This mad the game extremely frustrating as when I walked over the normal map I was bombarded with her e and poisoned. It made me lose lane as I was playing yauso and was moving around the lane a lot with my e. Can you pls disable the champ and fix the bug as it will be detrimental to those facing this champion. The person I also versed commented on it just being em when my whole team couldn't see it making em believe that they were abusing the bug. So look into this a little please.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-03-24T03:14:54.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a problem based on what graphics card you use, and only seems to happen when the Cassiopeia is not sharing the exact same data with you ie. they're on the enemy team.\n\nI had this too for a while.
