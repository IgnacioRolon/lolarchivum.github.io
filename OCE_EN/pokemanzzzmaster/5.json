Except instead of stacks he could have his life steal come from ever champion and minion he hits and the life-steal bonus decreases the more champions and minions he hits. I might get backlash for even suggesting it but it sounds fun to me and vlad isn&#039;t the most complex champion but this way he&#039;s not a complete faceroll of a champ.

His early game is rather awful, and since his q's a single target ability and it makes no sense to drain the life out of a whole line of people, he'd be trash. Like, how do you poke if they're behind minions? His Q is his lifeline. Without it, he is nothing. Plus, it doesn't make sense from a more logical perspective, having to aim in a direction which you plan on draining blood from. Would his Q move instantaneously, would it become a projectile? Would it do more damage?\n\nAlso, Vlad isn't a faceroll champion. In teamfights, maybe, but he does require a bit of thought.  Making him only able to hit two things at once or something with it, but have to aim, would totally ruin him. Like, when you think about it, you don't really choose a specific line that you're aiming, you choose a specific person. He drains their blood, not shoots some object to drain their blood.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-17T15:58:45.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah that'll make it so vlad is a 0.0004% pick, you're a genious riot hire this guy please","replies":[]}]}
