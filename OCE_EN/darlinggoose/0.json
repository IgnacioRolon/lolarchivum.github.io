Is there any way to contend the leaver buster or do you just have to take the punishment for a terrible laptop/wifi? And does anyone else have this problem?","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2016-01-19T15:21:32.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will be others but the solution is to take a break for 15 minutes every hour and do something else so you don't strain your eyes like the safety manual says.","replies":[]}]}
