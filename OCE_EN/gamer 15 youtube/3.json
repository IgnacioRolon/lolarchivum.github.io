I cannot say I got trolls in the lobby but I had Shaco Jungle, Nasus Mid, Yasuo ADC, and Vel'koz Support. Sure, all of them are good champions but I was not sure how they would do in their respective roles cause it was just silver and I thought that was going to risk my promos so I dodged that queue and then it ended my promos. I am so disappointed, we don't lose LP if we dodge in ranked games then why do we have to lose promos which is even more important, this is so frustrating.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-10-12T09:19:02.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do actually lose LP in addition to the normal queue lockout.
