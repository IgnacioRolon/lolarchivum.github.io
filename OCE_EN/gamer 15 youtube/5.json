I have been a hard stuck silver 4 for a long time now. I play Jhin, Tristana, Jinx, Miss Fortune, and Ashe. I normally play jhin when support is a mage, Tristana when support is a tank with an engaging ability, Jinx when I am against Ezreal or Draven, Miss Fortune almost always when the support is Yuumi.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a Morgana or lux main cause the are flexible and also can partly make plays when I am not there and need to save tower or something. I know how to play all lanes so I will be fine even when I get auto-filled. \r\n\r\nI believe communication is the key to winning so would be nice if you use voice, if you don't, pings work as well.\r\n\r\nThank you and meet you on the Rift\r\nItsuki/Gamer 15","replies":[]}
