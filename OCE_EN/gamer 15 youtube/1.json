I started out bad, but I thought I would be okay (I just took a wrong ability) and in-game my sup was doing very bad. Our lane was pressured into 3v2 and 4v3 situations very often and then Lulu just gave up supporting and asked our top {{champion:54}}  to support. He accepted, but he because he got top he wanted to take a little of my farm, I was just happy the support changed and the game went on and after another gank from the enemy team {{champion:54}}  went back top and  {{champion:117}} came back to support (*after a couple of deaths*) she says she got auto-filled and she gave up and the end game scores of me and Lulu are 3/9/8 and 0/12/10 respectively.\r\n\r\nSo, I wanted to ask what you guys think about auto-fills in a ranked game. If someone who doesn&#039;t play a lane gets that lane then he will almost be forced to play because no one wants to give up their mid.\r\n\r\nIf you want a link to this match,\r\nhttps://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-details/OC1/217637424/202013484?tab=overview\r\n\r\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-bummed}}","replies":[{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-09-05T03:46:23.317+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's all about Queue times.

Auto-fill doesn't exist because people like it, it exists because the alternative is something people want even less, so a better question would be something along the lines of \"would you rather auto-fill or 30 minute queues?\".\n\nRemoving auto-fill, or even allowing players to select a role they do not want to play (which was tested a while back) results in queue times *skyrocketing*. It's not just a small increase. Especially in high elo the tests resulted in queue times often triple or more what they are now. This effect is compounded on servers with low populations like OCE.\n\nThe trouble comes *largely* from the lack of people selecting the support role, and the solution isn't playing around with autofill or queue times it's making the support role more widely desirable to play, since at present there's only a few specific kinds of people who enjoy it, and not enough people who will learn it because the team needs it either.\n\nAs for people trolling or not caring when they get autofilled, next seasons ranked changes are supposed to help mitigate that behaviour.
