So if you have a champion or skin idea you want them to notice, it has to be god damn amazing, have full concept drawings and be basically ready for production straight off the boards. In other words, don't expect too much.\n\nIf they ever do use your idea though, chances are they wont tell you anyway until it's released. This happened with Bard, Rek'Sai and a few others.","replies":[{"poster":"oOWOOHOo","date":"2015-10-04T10:06:48.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Oh.
