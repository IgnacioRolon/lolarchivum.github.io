Apart from Bard or maybe {{champion:90}}&#039;s ult kinda looks like one, but none can kinda manipulate the positioning of and enemy or maybe even allied champ.\r\n\r\nNayl&#039;o- The void keeper\r\n\r\nPassive: Havent thought of one sadly :(\r\n\r\nQ: Void Cross\r\nNayl&#039;o Sends out a ranged attack like a Vel&#039;koz w but two of them and without the second part. These two Void lines cross over each other depending on where you aim it, like a heimer q. It would do 80/100/130/170/210+(70% of AP)\r\n\r\nThis one is nice\r\n\r\nW: Void Portal\r\nNayl&#039;o Inflicts a enemy champ or allied champ with A void portal\r\nEnemy: after two seconds the void portal above the head will implode dragging surrounding enemies towards them and dealing 40/50/60/80/100 Magic damage to all affected ( like an Oriana Ult).\r\n\r\nIf the Ability is reactivated the Enemy can be teleported up to 400 units away from their current position, no damage is dealt though a small slow maybe.\r\n\r\nAlly: The same thing happens except no damage is dealt to the ally. And it can also be reactivated.\r\n\r\nE: Punishing slap thing\r\nTwo void creatures appear from the ground through a portal next to each other.They act like a sort of meat grinder and push the enemy through the gap Dealing 50/70/100/120/160\r\n(im not sure if this makes sense, but i know how it works in my head so it can be reworded im just horrible at explaining XD)\r\n\r\nUlt:No ult\r\n\r\nI know there are some important components missing but they can be fixed once the right person gets to it, this is just an idea and i hope it sparks something in the brain of some champion designer out there Haha.\r\nPlease ask questions if you have one.","replies":[{"poster":"Smelly Sandwich","date":"2016-06-26T05:14:15.223+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Love the name of the E :^ )","replies":[{"poster":"Ocelotelot","date":"2017-08-29T12:31:03.490+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"same","replies":[]}]}]}
