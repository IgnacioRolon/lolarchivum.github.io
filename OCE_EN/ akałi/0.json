like at all why is it even on there.\r\n\r\nGame 1\r\nIn-Game\r\nAkałi: too slow\r\nAkałi: i pinged at the moment of needing help, not 5 minutes before\r\nAkałi: btw youre gonna need to actually pay attention to top now, its a 2 kill lead darius\r\nAkałi: if hes not controlled he will snowball into 1v9 material\r\nAkałi: i was just farming\r\nAkałi: its a darius\r\nAkałi: walk up e w q\r\nAkałi: instant trade thats forced and he wins it\r\nAkałi: and now hes holding lane away from my tower so not only is he ahead in kills, hes gonna get a cs lead\r\nAkałi: do i need to make my case for why i should get a gank any more clear?\r\nAkałi: one q half healthed me\r\nAkałi: still waiting on that gank\r\nAkałi: alright ill raise the odds\r\nAkałi: if i dont recieve a gank within the next 2 minutes, ill assume you want top to fall\r\nAkałi: so ill just open\r\nAkałi: why make it take longer than it has to, cut out the middle man\r\nAkałi: see\r\nAkałi: was that so fucking hard\r\nAkałi: boo hoo im a jungle i wanna do my camps i cant do a 5 second gank\r\nAkałi: as you can see, hes not very good, hes just darius\r\nAkałi: so i dont see why kha has such a hard on for ignoring top\r\nAkałi: its a zero risk gank\r\nAkałi: fuck it im just opening top, i mliterally getting like 1 cs a minute laning against him and kha is still focusing bot side\r\nAkałi: stfu mate\r\nAkałi: why would i help kha\r\nAkałi: hes dead to me\r\nAkałi: awwww poor kha cant do your blue side now that tops down?\r\nAkałi: maybe you should give more of a shit about top lane then\r\nAkałi: Like ill be completely honest with you, i dont expect ganks, i go into every lane planning to get zero ganks\r\nAkałi: so if i ask for ganks\r\nAkałi: theres a fucking reason\r\nAkałi: imagine thinking id help him\r\nAkałi: thats some special k brain right there\r\nAkałi: hes doing good because hes thrown us under the fucking bus to get there\r\nAkałi: i have zero doubt\r\nAkałi: if i went in to help\r\nAkałi: hed fucking leg it and leave me to die\r\nAkałi: so again\r\nAkałi: why would i help\r\nAkałi: how did you feed that retard\r\nAkałi: youre really not quite grasping the concept that im not on your team are you\r\nAkałi: this is a 1v4v9\r\nAkałi: if you wanted me to help you, shouldve helped me\r\nAkałi: see kha this is why you dont hoard all the kills and you use your role to support the team instead\r\nAkałi: because once they figure out how to kill you, the entire plan falls apart\r\nAkałi: nothing im doing is reportable\r\nAkałi: no im bitching i outright told kha, if i dont get a gank soon this darius will hard carry, this lane is not winnable in the current state\r\nAkałi: and look, i was right\r\nAkałi: i mean, am i wrong though\r\nAkałi: Whether you find me annoying or not, tell me darius is not the biggest threat on their team\r\nAkałi: if you didnt need me enough to make sure top doesnt fall\r\nAkałi: you shouldnt need me now\r\nAkałi: ive done nothing reportable, ive still been trying to win i just accepted that not a single one of you is willing to do something that benefits me\r\nAkałi: so i made the tactical decision to not group with you\r\nAkałi: because i know for a fact you will throw me under the bus to save yourself\r\nAkałi: if you cant read plain english youre no hope\r\nAkałi: if you think im bullshitting the one time ive interracted with you kha in the last 15 minutes\r\nAkałi: was you ksing me\r\nAkałi: which funnily enough was your first kill in about 20 minutes\r\nAkałi: so that begs the question\r\nAkałi: how did you first 6\r\nAkałi: ]\r\nGame 2\r\nIn-Game\r\nAkałi: nice map awareness\r\nAkałi: yep it was high enoughj\r\nAkałi: fuckwit\r\nAkałi: bro\r\nAkałi: you had enough hp\r\nAkałi: youre actually fucking

many great fucking people die every die, but retards like you get to tick on\r\nAkałi: yeah its called being triggered youre alive\r\nAkałi: i actually legitemately fucking hate retards\r\nAkałi: with a passion\r\nAkałi: youre retarded\r\nAkałi: hence the hate\r\nAkałi: nope\r\nAkałi: if you cant tell by now this isnt my first account\r\nAkałi: i couldnt give less of a shit\r\nAkałi: you existing however\r\nAkałi: thats fucking infuriating\r\nAkałi: im saying it because youre a retard?\r\nAkałi: how is that hard to grasp\r\nAkałi: oh right\r\nAkałi: just because the truth hurts doesnt make it any less true my dude\r\nAkałi: i feel bad for you, youre too fucking retarded to function\r\nAkałi: Like let me put into context for you\r\nAkałi: this is a video game, that there are 13 year olds who can reach challenger\r\nAkałi: and you fail at basic fucking logic\r\nAkałi: youre literally retarded\r\nAkałi: yeah because unlike you\r\nAkałi: im actually doing things\r\nAkałi: all youve done all game is run away and try to protect your kda\r\nAkałi: a literal meaningless number\r\nAkałi: and you wonder why youre hardstuck\r\nAkałi: r e t a r d\r\nAkałi: go for it\r\nGame 3\r\nIn-Game\r\nAkałi: open your eyes\r\nAkałi: how did you lose bot that hard\r\nAkałi: tops gonna go down unless i get a gank like, now pretty much\r\nAkałi: this is game\r\nAkałi: jg is ignoring the nasus threat\r\nAkałi: hes 100% gonna 1v9 us at this rate\r\nAkałi: youre actually fucking retarded\r\nAkałi: im losing lane because its a nasus and i literally got zero ganks\r\nAkałi: you dont win against nasus, you survive\r\nAkałi: i didnt say it was\r\nAkałi: but it is his job to stop nasus from literally winning the game for them\r\nAkałi: because ill repeat myself\r\nAkałi: you dont win against a nasus\r\nAkałi: you survive\r\nAkałi: and thresh just learned that lesson\r\nAkałi: you dont beat nasus\r\nAkałi: you just try not to die\r\nAkałi: im going to let him take as many structures as he wants till someone comes\r\nAkałi: hes not 1v1able\r\nAkałi: go 1v1 him then\r\nAkałi: talk big walk the fucking walk\r\nAkałi: hes got one kill from me, one from him flashing in thresh\r\nAkałi: you spastic\r\nAkałi: cool\r\nAkałi: so why didnt the jungler come?\r\nAkałi: if you acknowledge that him being allowed to exist in lane is a problem\r\nAkałi: why did we let him exist\r\nAkałi: no jg = gg*\r\nAkałi: ftfy","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-09T12:39:51.017+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Since you specifically asked for feedback on game 1,

not on your team are you\nAkałi: this is a 1v4v9\nAkałi: if you wanted me to help you, shouldve helped me\n\nNow generally speaking, that entire log was negative, but I've singled out the parts of most relevance.\n\nFirstly, you are giving your team an ultimatum: \"Play how I want, or I will intentionally detriment the team\". It should be pretty clear why this isn't ok.\n\nYou are also unilaterally trying to decide how the game should be played. Clearly, the Kha at least disagreed with your assessment. Nobody is wrong in that scenario, there is more than one way to play any single game of League to victory. You as a single player, do not get to decide the course of a team game unless you have previously been established as a shot caller.\n\nFor example, if a lane is losing there are generally at least two perfectly valid options for dealing with that as a jungler. Help the lane get back on its feet OR go and snowball another lane instead while your losing teammate plays safely. Neither is right or wrong.\n\nYour response to your team *disagreeing* with you, was first to insult them, and then to threaten them. Hopefully, you can understand how such behaviour is both out of proportion and plain not okay.\n\nClearly, this single instance of behaviour was not quite enough to push you over the edge into a punishment, hence why you have a 3-game reform card. It is the games combined that resulted in your punishment.\n\n___\n\nAs for you overall punishment, in each of the three logs you called people 'retards' and 'spastic' more than once, say that various people's lives aren't worth living and are generally demeaning and insulting in just about every single line of text you type. Again, it should be pretty clear why this isn't okay. \n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter who started it if you are actively continuing it. To be clear, defending yourself is fine, but firing back is not, and someone simply *disagreeing* with you, is not a licence to spout vitriol at them.","replies":[{"poster":" Akałi","date":"2020-02-09T12:46:17.769+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Eh see i understand the whole firing back thing, but i also disagree with the idea of \"say a naughty word get a sentence\" well sentencing.\n\nIf people dont want to see the word retard, turn the profanity filter on (or better yet dont turn it off since its defaulted to on)\n\nAlso just dont do stupid shit and you wont get called stupid\n\nI understand riots logic, i just think its wrong, so i wont bother going further there.\n\nBut in regards to your \"theres more than one way to win a league of legends game\"\n\nWhat the kha was doing was objectively wrong.\n\nAnd i didnt give them an ultimatum, i told them outright the truth of what will happen, i didnt have a choice in opening, my choices were try and defend top and feed my ass off because he was already snowballing his lane to the point he could kill under tower solo, or leave top, i wasnt getting farm there anyway so i was literally better off roaming and trying to pick up scraps/help other lanes.\n\nWhat also occured is that kha did the opposite of your other scenario, he didnt snowball bot, he let bot die and ks'd them, he snowballed himself.\n\nWhich backfired greatly when he went from 6/1 to 6/8 in the midgame because he just wasnt a very good player but had decided to vacuum up all our gold.\n\nAnd lastly, this is id estimate like mid silver? my accounts still in that stage of 30 lp wins in bronze where i see the occasional gold player.\n\nSo they are literally too stupid to be told what to do, you either force them to do what they need to, or flip a coin and pray to whatever god you worship that they engage their 2 remaining brain cells and do the right thing.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2020-02-09T13:06:42.887+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's not about the words, it's about how you're using them. Saying \"fuck\" because you died is very different from saying \"fuck you, you fuck\". Same word, very different effect.\n\nWhile there are certain words that can be considered negative all on their own (e.g slurs), this isn't *particularly* the case here. Though it worth noting that this strays squarely into hate speech territory:\n\n>Akałi: fuck i hate that people like you get to continue living\nAkałi: so many great fucking people die every die, but retards like you get to tick on\nAkałi: yeah its called being triggered youre alive\nAkałi: i actually legitemately fucking hate retards\n\n___\nTo me personally, it seems your biggest barrier is perspective. Specifically your inability to view these situations from anyone but your owns.\n\nPerhaps you didn't mean it as an ultimatum, but to anyone else who doesn't get to hear your thoughts, there isn't any other reasonable way to read that.\n\nI'm sure in your eyes there was only a single right course of action, but in a game with so many variables, there will *always* be someone with a different view on that. That doesn't make either of you wrong. What makes you wrong, is trying to force a course of action on your team, then insulting and threatening them when they don't follow through.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people are *far* less likely to respond positively to any call or observation you may make if you do so in a negative way. I know I personally will pretty much immediately dismiss and mute anyone who's being negative. Doesn't matter if they have a valid point, because I'm now either ignoring chat or have them muted entirely.\n\nThe other thing I feel is poignant to mention, is that how someone *plays in a video game*, has absolutely **zero** bearing on how much value their *literal life* has. Even so much as bringing such a thing into the argument basically guarantees that *you* will be dismissed as (at best) the nonsensical one.\n___\n\nYou can't win every game, so don't expect to. Don't expect everyone to be playing perfectly all that time because that's physically impossible for anyone. Understand that everyone plays differently and that someone's call or opinion differing from your own doesn't automatically make it wrong.","replies":[{"poster":" Akałi","date":"2020-02-09T13:11:18.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I dont expect people to play perfectly.\n\nI expect them to not go 0/12 and play like they turned their monitor off.\n\nIm only silver, there is no feasible excuse for me to be that much better than them.\n\nOr to put it another way, i only expect people to play to the same standards i hold myself, if i did the stupid shit they do id personally just quit the game because id decide im too garbage to play ranked, and thats what tilts me, they literally go through the thought process of \"geeze im trash, let me subject 9 other people to this torture\" i cant respect someone who willingly decides to ruin 9 other peoples lives for half an hour at a time.

You consciously made the decision to ruin these people's games because they played a way you didn't like/had a bad game/made a bad call/got tilted etc etc.\n\nDoes that not make you equally in the wrong even by your own standards?\n\nIn fact, you went so far as to not only suggest that someone's time playing this game was worthless, but that their time *living* was worthless.

Many players will label someone a troll simply for playing differently than them or disagreeing with them. By that definition of troll of course barely any trolls get punished because the vast majority of those players *aren't actually trolling*.\n\nI'm not saying they don't exist. Because they do, but people are by and large *far* too quick to label someone a troll. We all fall into the trap from time to time but letting it corrupt our perspective to the point where basically everyone is a troll, hurts us more than anything. We are the ones who play every single game with ourselves, other people only play one game in many.\n\n___\n\nAt the end of the day, put it this way. Whether or not you agree with the rules that Riot enforces, you *have* agreed to follow them in order to play the game. Not following them results unsurprisingly in losing the ability to play the game to its full capacity and eventually at all.\n\nIt seems that you know where the line is, even if you don't agree with its placement. That is enough to protect you from punishment so long as you act (or don't as the case me be) on that knowledge.\n\nI would certainly encourage you to try to view things from other people's perspective. If mid is having a hard lane, they're going to struggle to roam, no matter how much top needs it. If the jungler has been auto-filled, they aren't going to be as on top of the ganking as someone who really knows how to play it.\n\nYou win team games by playing to your strengths *and* covering for the weaknesses in your teammates (while they cover yours).","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2020-02-09T21:51:21.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Akałi: youre actually fucking retarded\nAkałi: you spastic\n\nYou cannot say such things.
