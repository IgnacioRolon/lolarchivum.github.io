The whole time I had been using youtube and skype and had 0 problems with connectivity with both of those, however league being as buggy as it is, really wanted to make my match a living hell. There were no problems in champion select with exception of a troll who kept feeding and such and who was just toxic, as is most of the league community, however when the loading screen appeared, oh it was just glorious. I had to reconnect to the match about 4 times (with closing and re opening my league client) just to load into the match, upon entering the match, i was \"disconnected from the server\" about once every 30 seconds and had to constantly \"reconnect\". I was just wondering if anybody else has been having this issue, and if so, if there was any way to fix the disconnections to game even though the problem is not related to your personal internet.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-25T07:44:56.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The problem isn't your internet, it's the way you're connected to it.\n\nI don't know what Riot have done, but they changed some settings in the game and the way it connects, now numerous people are having issues with it.
