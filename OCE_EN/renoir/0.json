Diana is from neither The Shadow Isles or Ionia, so unless Riot decides to throw the whole BM lore out the window I highly doubt Diana will be getting a BM skin. That said, she may get something similar.\n\nI agree it'd be a cool skin on her, but there's more to  the skin themes than just looks, they all have their own lore.","replies":[{"poster":"Renoir","date":"2017-01-29T04:14:43.380+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"BLOOD MOON DIANA IS A THING NOW I WAS RIGHT :D","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-29T08:29:42.606+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am very surprised indeed!
