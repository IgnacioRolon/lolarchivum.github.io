Try checking your purchase history (it shows what you get from chests) to see if there is anything there.","replies":[{"poster":"Stinkyjox","date":"2017-03-14T19:57:57.461+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahhh,\n\nYep, its in there.

They're working on a fix for that atm but it's only when you get an icon + essence that the notification isn't playing properly so it's not something that comes up too often.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
