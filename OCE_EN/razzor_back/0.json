Not entirely sure what to do after that fails too, hence I've made this post.\r\nThe issue I was making a ticket for was that after the latest windows update the game wont launch after champ select, I've tried force re-patching, reinstalling, getting permissions, turning off my firewall, turning off other background applications and checked for corrupted files.\r\n Obviously this is a super common issue, I've seen countless posts about it and I've tried a number of solutions, at this point I'm hoping a support member might see this but if not should I try making a ticket under a different type of issue and explain why it has the wrong type? Was it just the 'tech issues' page that is busted?","replies":[{"poster":"Nofeelingz","date":"2020-02-14T09:12:34.208+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just in case if you have bitdefender installed it has a new update which stops league matches from launching.
