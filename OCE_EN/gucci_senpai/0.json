I lost my first promo and went to bed. \r\nI woke up today, lost my 2nd promo making me unsuccessful in my promotion series and I was demoted all the way to Bronze  I?\r\n\r\nSurely this is a bug!? The &quot;you have been unsuccessful in your promotions&quot; popup in the post-game lobby was gibberish code. \r\n\r\nOr is this normal?

There was a new patch ([patch 8.24)](https://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-824-notes) put in overnight which should have removed division V from all tiers and moved everyone in a division V to division IV. But it seems like a strange interaction may have occurred because you were in a promo series.\n\nGet in touch with Riot [here](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and let them know what happened. They should be able to confirm what happened and fix the issue if necessary.\n\nGood luck! :)","replies":[{"poster":"Gucci Senpai","date":"2018-12-05T02:02:00.583+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the informative response. \nI've submitted my ticket to Riot and will be sure to share the outcome.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Gucci Senpai","date":"2018-12-05T09:37:55.082+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Update.\nWhere I am currently sitting with my ticket: \n\n_\"I understand your confusion but it looks like this was caused by the new update and the addition of Iron and removing the 5th division from every rank.

This is not exclusive to promotions - it seems that your very first loss in the new Silver tier will demote you straight back to Bronze 1 :/  (At least that's what happened to me).
