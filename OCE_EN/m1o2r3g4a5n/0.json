If the passive like this, I think draven is not worth 6300 ip. it&#039;s better to change a little bit or change the passive. do you guys agree this? compare the old passive of draven, the passive we use now is much worse than that one.","replies":[{"poster":"íce","date":"2016-05-08T10:39:20.027+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Note; you've also got his passive wrong.

What i find annoying is the fact that it's useless in games where i don't ever get a kill (e.g. top and mid feed, and I'm bot vs safe enemies) though these games aren't too common for me","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-05-08T05:38:00.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because the old one was broken.
