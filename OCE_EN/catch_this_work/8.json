I am looking for the chance to go into professional play and I want to do it this season. I may only be Diamond V, but if you watch me in game my mechanics are spot on. I&#039;m not bragging or being cocky when I say this, I&#039;m telling the cold hard truth. I practice ~3 hours a day in customs games perfecting my champion techs and striving to bring my selected champs to perfection. Don&#039;t believe me? I mastered the new Kat in 3 games (EVERY single tech) and I mastered Riven within 3 games of seriously playing her (after I understood mechanics properly, as one year prior I didn&#039;t take this game seriously) and I well and truly picked up Lucian and learnt all his combos within one game of playing him.\r\nIf that&#039;s the case, why is he asking for people to hold his hand? To which I will answer, because OCE is toxic and teams don&#039;t adapt to suit my needs and vice versa, they look to berrate me for one mistake and they tell me to kill myself if I fail. I&#039;m sick and tired of this, and I want a team that is positive, can bring out the best in me and support my gameplay.\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s the part where players will either laugh at me or just say seriously &quot;no, not happening&quot;, I want to play on a professional team IMMEDIATELY. I do not wish to wait, and I do not wish to go through a trial process. Trust me, I&#039;ve played enough rank 5s to know that trial processes suck and you never play to the best of your ability since the team is used to a previous player. Yes, I very much asking a team to bench a player if possible so as for me to make my entrance.\r\nOnto the part which to most high end &quot;managers&quot; of teams require. Here goes -sigh-. I play mid, top and ADC, my most fluent champs are all aggressive, though I have certain tech champs I can use, and I adapt my playstyle accordingly if I know my team has my back (in other words non solo-q mentality). I&#039;ve left school so I have free time from here on out ALWAYS, I have coms&#039;, I can record, I have a high end PC build so you don&#039;t have to worry about situational FPS lag on my end, I evolve as a player whenever I encounter something and I use my sheer mechanics to outplay or overwhelm my opponent (usually the latter).\r\n\r\nLets get one thing out of the way, and it&#039;s something that will cause people to not take me seriously, MY TEAMS ARE HOLDING ME BACK! Don&#039;t believe me? Fine, then how about you see what I&#039;m like in game when I have a proper teammate behind me, tell me that I don&#039;t perfect my champions. This is a long shot, but if I played seriously and consistently in ranked without getting shitty teams and a tilt the size of Mount Everest I well and truly think I could make top 10 of this server. It sounds cocky, but I can and will do it, even if it means sacrificing my mental health,** I don&#039;t care. **\r\n\r\nAs for the teams that actually know me, I&#039;ve changed. I&#039;m no longer that situational player you once belittled and held back, I&#039;m the sort of player now who is mechanically superior to you, though you still probably beat me with a team since synergy is a factor, that and your in-game knowledge is probably higher than mine. God, I sound cocky, probably am, if you take this a joke, you&#039;re probably right, I&#039;m just saying all this because this game is all I have to live by, the moment I fail at this game for good I&#039;m ending my life.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been talking myself up for awhile now, I suppose it&#039;s only fitting I tell you my downfalls. I&#039;m very easily tilted, I take insults literally and seriously to the point where I wish to inflict harm, I get overwhelmed by people who synergise together and my champ pool, though pretty widespread (I can play all champs in the game bar Azir) has a huge skill difference in terms of my better champs, which are Vayne, Lucian, Katarina, Riven, Ashe and tech. pick, Vel&#039;koz+Twitch. If I play any other champion you will notice that I don&#039;t play as well as those above champions since I don&#039;t feel comfortable going aggressive on any other champion. If you want my honest opinion that&#039;s probably another reason why I&#039;m being held back, though this is to a lesser extent.\r\n\r\nChamps I refuse to play are as follows: All supports (since my mindset doesn&#039;t function for a support champion), Azir, Aurelion Sol (still very iffy about him), Taliyah (I don&#039;t play the playstyle that she requires and I&#039;m clunky on her).\r\nChamps that I have difficulty with playing are: Kassadin, Illaoi, Corki, Draven and Jayce (to his full potential).\r\n\r\nAlso, ignore my ranked winrate stat., I barely play it enough to make an impact to it, hence why it&#039;s average. After all that you&#039;re probably thinking, &quot;god this guy is full of himself&quot;, I&#039;m not, this is a cry for help. I feel like I&#039;m stuck and I can&#039;t breath, every day is painful for me. If I had a team I got along with and could play with my life would be turned on its head and I might actually smile again and understand the concept of fun, since that doesn&#039;t exist for me anymore. \r\nHow off-topic, I&#039;m now discussing my mental health, better wrap this up.\r\nLook, I&#039;m in dire need of people who are serious about playing this game and/or the opportunity to play on a high end team, but not as a Sub player. As mentioned before, yes, I am Diamond V. But how much of a figurative number will you take literally? That is the key question. I&#039;ll use the analogy of money, a person might be dirt poor, but they themselves can change the world, moreso than those with more money, this is basic philosophy. \r\n\r\nIf you&#039;ve read all this, I have nothing else to say but a warm thank you, you&#039;re the kind of person who actually gives a damn, or you&#039;re just using it as a means to have a joke and laugh at me. Either way you read it, so thank you. If you&#039;re well and truly interested to see what I&#039;m like, add:\r\n&quot;Lovesick&quot;. When I say I want to go into professional play I&#039;m not kidding or having a dream, I know I can do it and I also know that I can and will overpower each and every single player if I set my mind to it. \r\nTo conclude, here are any other details you require:\r\n \r\nLanguage: Only english\r\nAge: 17\r\nLanes (in order of preference): Mid-&gt;ADC-&gt;Top\r\nComs&#039;: Discord, Teamspeak, Skype\r\nAvailability: From now on, always, until the age of 19-23\r\nAbility to travel: Yes to all locations\r\n\r\nand finally a self included detail, I&#039;m a very deep thinker, and I analyse EVERYTHING if need be. I will even do this to the point of insanity, hence why I treat human life so casually. How this is useful in game, you can just guess that for yourself.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\n(God, what a dark sort of request to join a team/play with other players, oh well, can&#039;t be helped)","replies":[{"poster":"LD WiseMan","date":"2016-12-06T11:35:51.880+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, just wanted to start this off by saying I completely understand where you're coming from, I'm not as high of a rank which may affect how you view this comment altogether but that's fine. I have put so much time into this game and it means so much to me, I've played in a few teams so far and I've also had problems with toxic teams that only look to put players down for mistakes, currently i'm putting together people that I know will have a better attitude despite the skill gap (not saying I'm hugely better than the people I play with) but if you are willing to look to the long term rather than the short term, you might find investing in something small like us though in terms skill may not be the best decision but I can guarantee as the captain I am completely serious about this game. Hopefully my rank (Plat 5) and my teams general rank (gold) will not completely scare you away and you may give us a chance to prove though we may not challenge you mechanically we may have the mindset and environment you're looking for. Also we are looking preferably for a top laner if that would be possible!\n In any case,\n- Best Regards ~ WiseMan","replies":[{"poster":"LD WiseMan","date":"2016-12-06T11:40:28.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also please don't take this offensively XD I know it may seem a bit stupid someone like me from what might seem like so far below you asking for a chance but it is what it is.

I cannot elaborate any further as I'm good at each position in my own way, though if I had to choose I'd probably say ADC if the team is consistent and I feel safe on it, Mid lane if I have free reign over my champion pool (to an extent anyway) and top lane simply as a fill position if needed (or if the jungler is so solid to the point where I can trust him with my everything in game).\nI don't learn one set position for the time being, I learn champions which interest me. However, I tend to disregard this when playing on a team and I look to hone set champions by the coach/manager, so long as they fit even a bit of my playstyle, with the exceptions listed above (who are all mid laners said above).\nPrimarily though, I am a carry orientated, win-more kind of player. If I get ahead I generally stay ahead and look for means of dominating the game, if I get behind I HAVE to rely on my teammates. Though I have been looking to improve on this mindset for awhile now, and I'll continue to try.\nYou'll also notice that my favourite champions are all flashy, in your face kind of champions, so already you probably know a lot about me already.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zerkz","date":"2016-12-02T01:24:06.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Intense bro","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-12-02T03:26:17.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just feel very strongly about this game now, as it's no longer a game anymore to me, it's a means to a possible future.
