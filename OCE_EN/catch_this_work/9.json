I&#039;ll save you the trouble of looking me up.\r\nMid lane, my best champs include: Talon, Kat, Zed, Orianna, Vlad, Lux and Yas (situational)\r\nJungle, my best champs include: Rengar (situational), Yi, Volibear, Vi, Lee, Gragas and Kha&#039;zix\r\n\r\nWhile I still have a couple of meta champions to perfect such as Elise, Nid, Lulu, Leblanc I&#039;m still more than willing to put in the time to dedicate myself to a team. All I need is a team that is non-casual yet still friendly. Anyhow, thank you for reading this, consider me if you may.","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2016-03-21T00:49:34.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thinking about this, wouldn't it be better to introduce your real name over your summoner name?
