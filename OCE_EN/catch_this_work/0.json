While this may be rather silly to say, I well and truly feel like if I can get past Plat elo and enter into D3+ I will be able to climb my way to challenger and I honestly think that I will fare well there, since clearly players like &quot;nights&quot; can  (they&#039;re not bad, but I feel like I'm on par, if not situationally better than they are).\n\nOh well, I guess this is too much and this is OCE so it's unlikely that anyone will be nice enough to do so.  But hey, if someone is happy to do so then please, by all means add me (username same as on here). I would prefer I jungle main since I myself am a mid laner.","replies":[]}
