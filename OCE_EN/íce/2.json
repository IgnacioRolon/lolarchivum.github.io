That only happens if your connection is cut as you're connecting, ie. you pull out the plug or something.\n\nBut obviously that's not the case. By chance, it could be a software on your computer that's doing it. Have you tried seeing if your internet entirely cuts out as the game tries to connect?\n\nIf you've confirmed that your internet is fine as you're connecting, then look over [this page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) and troubleshoot. Remember that some need you to restart your computer. If you're having trouble with anything on their, just tell me and I can help you with it.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]},{"poster":"íce","date":"2015-04-09T04:55:20.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i don't think it's related to patches. or u might not have the same problem as me @mattithias have u tried playing on another wifi? it works for me on another 1; sadly this only happens on my wifi....\ni havn't changed anything with my modem router","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-09T10:31:46.232+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Use 'Reply' on his comment or he won't get notification of it.","replies":[{"poster":"íce","date":"2015-04-10T03:31:26.153+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"aha, lol. thx anyways :P","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mattithias","date":"2015-04-08T12:13:57.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've been having the same problem as well since yesterday.
