Let me just start by saying I don't think I should be in much higher then Silver 1-Gold 4 at my current state, but I certainly don't feel like I am being matched with players of my skill level. \n\nThe reason being; In elo hell there is a massive disparity between skill levels at the same elo. I see some players who have over 250 games on a character and play that character extremely well into almost any match-up. Basically, when they get ahead they carry hard, but they also meet similar skilled people and don't carry other games. Then, I see unranked people and others with 1200 elo and less then 50 games who get rick rolled by almost anyone no matter the matchup.\n\nNow, just imagine going into a game, in the top lane is someone with 250 games on Riven fighting a 0 game Mord with about 15 ranked games. I can tell you now, Riven is going to be 6-0 before she even hits level 6. Now, imagine that you are on ole m8 Mord's team and your Ezreal in the bottom lane who has also been matched against a fairly average set of opponents and you are 5-0 before level 6. Even if you where 7-0, that Riven up there on 6-0 is still going to carry the game harder then you could ever hope to on squishy little Ez or any other ADC without proper peel.\n\n**Solution:** Maybe number of ranked games played should come into consideration when match making (Possibly limited to Bronze and Silver games). People with similar amount of ranked games played should be grouped together. From what I can see in my brief 5 minute submission to this forum, this would have a positive effect. \n\nBasically luck will be less of an influence on keeping you in \"elo hell\". If match making were to take into account number of ranked games played, you will more likely be matched with people of your skill level. On the other hand, people with less matches will more then likely not have much experience and will certainly lose to a team of experienced players. Eventually the experienced players will all move out of 'Elo Hell' and the newbies can have fun playing each other and learning. \n\nI guess I would have thought the point of all this was to make sure people of similar skill are all grouped together and newbies are protected. In the current situation they are not protected and get abused all the time for feeding someone who is much more experienced then they are in elo hell. So if we can let the experienced players climb then there won't be this weird mix of experienced players with non-experienced. \n\nThe only real negative I can see is that all you need to do to climb out of elo hell is play lots of games. But, you should have improved over all these games, and I certainly think it would be a fairer system then lucking your way out of elo hell.\n\nAnyway, that's my 2c, back to the grind I guess. What are your thoughts?\n\nTLDR; In bronze and silver you should be grouped with players that have a similar number of ranked (or even total) games played to you.

If i do bad, that's fine, I accept that. But more often then not I win my lane, I also push fast after a kill and go roam to feed others. Mate, i have fed more people then i can count multiple kills in there lane from my roam and they STILL LOSE because of the skill disparity. Or they throw later from roaming too far without vision, all things that come from experience in ranked.\n\nThere will be a number of people who never get teams good enough for LONG enough to get out of there without just using kat, akali or fiora to hyper carry. All I am suggesting is what seems like a better way to actually measure someones ability (as a team member) in matchmaking and match them with the appropriate team mates.","replies":[{"poster":"Geldour","date":"2014-12-13T05:38:09.418+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find it interesting the you say \"if i do bad i accept that\" yet, you do not accept when someone else has a bad game, but they have to accept it when you have a bad game.\n\n\nthink about ways YOU can help the team win.\n\n* track and ping red/blue enemy buffs when they are about to come up\n* ward even though you are not support with green AND pinks\n* Keep an eye on dragon/baron timer and make sure to tell the team 1min before it spawns ( 2mins before if people are wanting to fight and risk been dead when the dragon spawns)\n* keep an eye on ALL LANES not just you lane, is top getting owned and mid owning??? a simple suggestion to lane swap never hurts.\n* winning bot lane and you killed there tower?? send the support to top lane with a simple \"GJ support, can you help out top now for a bit bud\" \n* call mias. not just for your lane either. \n* build FOR THE SITUATION. do not build the same thing every game. \n\nyea yea yea, i know you are going to say you already do all that, but its a lie and until you accept that you can not progress. \n\nOh, and accepting that you have room to improve is a GOOD THING not a bad thing. \n\njust trying to help you man. \n\nAll the best on the battlefields!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2014-12-12T07:12:59.622+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> So, I have spent a lot of time in elo hell.","replies":[]}]}
