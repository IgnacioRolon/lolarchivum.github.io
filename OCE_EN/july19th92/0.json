If they didn't, they wouldn't tell us anything at all. We wouldn't get cool lore teasers or extra fun content. We wouldn't get free to earn content like mastery chests.\n\nSecond, you will have received and email about it. Did you check your spam folder? Are you sure which email is associated with your account? Did you perhaps use an old or off email when you created?\n\nThird, Riot DOES NOT ban without reason. Without warning, sometimes, for cases like sever hate speech/death threats or scripting/third party use, but NEVER without reason. If you really believe the ban has been made in error then you can appeal it to support.\n\nFinally, rare is it that a ticket will fall through the cracks, someone will pretty much always get back to you within 2-3 days. However, responding to the ticket or creating a new one before a support person get back to you will bump you back to the bottom of the queue, so if you want a timely response, don't do that. If you get a generic response back it is because you are on tier one support, bump the ticket and it will usually be escalated to someone better equipped to help you.\n\nIf you post your reform card here then we can look into it for you, there will be a reason for the ban stated within.","replies":[{"poster":"Im Bjergsen","date":"2016-03-30T00:11:52.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes, riot permanently suspended account without any reason too so pls help me","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Im Bjergsen","date":"2016-03-30T00:07:46.931+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"riot just permanently suspended my account without any reason said to check emails for info and there is nothing in email, so whats going on with riot","replies":[]}]}
