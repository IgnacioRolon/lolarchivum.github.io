Imho I see this as a healtheir way to do it so you can do it knowing your more likely to receive that skin for donger, than another nasus skin you wont use.\r\n\r\nwanna see what other peoples opinion on it is\r\nCheers","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-26T06:48:41.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that removes like half the fun of it. and what if you get a better skin than the one you already own.","replies":[{"poster":"Iku","date":"2015-05-26T06:56:11.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not like remove the chance of getting a skin for a champ you already own, but 4/4 this weekend was a bit rough","replies":[{"poster":"ShuffledPancake","date":"2015-05-26T08:26:19.933+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Iku,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E4YPQAEg,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-05-26T06:56:11.841+0000)\n>\n> Not like remove the chance of getting a skin for a champ you already own, but 4/4 this weekend was a bit rough\n\nhe was saying what if you had a champ with a skin, but had a bad one wanting a better one FOR that champ?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
