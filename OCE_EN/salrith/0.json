I&#039;m finding myself, that playing adc, is basically a 1 v 2  match up, for the most part. Which kind of is disappointing, in some cases (Being mid Silver)\r\n\r\nAnyways I&#039;ve picked up a few champions, in the role of adc, and i&#039;m looking at improving my own skills, when it becomes a one sided game.\r\n\r\nTrist / Kog / Twitch / Jhin / Varus / Sivir / Cait &amp; Lucian\r\n\r\nIn addition, I actually want to learn Kalista, but I feel she isn&#039;t in a good spot currently.\r\n\r\nA few things I have issues with.\r\n\r\nPositioning in lane, is probably my main issue...\r\nManaging the waves per cs.\r\nI sit around 60 - 80 per 10 minutes, which I think is okay, but can be improved obviously.\r\n\r\nPersonal note: I&#039;m looking for coaching, free or will pay either or should be awesome.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-03T21:30:52.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can coach you :D","replies":[{"poster":"Salrith","date":"2017-12-04T00:09:47.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've added you, hope that's okay.","replies":[{"poster":"SOOM","date":"2017-12-04T00:40:19.013+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just msg me whenever :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2017-12-04T08:14:41.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Salrith,realm=OCE,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=qoiqQ1tI,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-12-04T00:09:47.620+0000)\n>\n> I&#x27;ve added you, hope that&#x27;s okay.\n\nI will be happy to give you some input as well, maybe duo with you on my smurf for practice as well.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
