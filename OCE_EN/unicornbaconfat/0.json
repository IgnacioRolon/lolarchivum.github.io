It was a bit hard to tell because the minimap icon for targeting didn&#039;t seem significantly different between that and the Rift Scuttler (shifting the location of the target icon on the minimap relative to the Rift Scuttler&#039;s target would be a worthwhile change for clarity).\r\n\r\nAs I could not tell which was the target, I killed both the Rift Scuttler and the Rift Herald, however, the hunted icon persisted, and not until I later killed Baron did it disappear. As such, it might be possible for the Wolf portion of Kindred&#039;s passive can target Baron before he&#039;s actually spawned on the map, which obviously is a problem if it is the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Acheron","date":"2016-04-11T09:31:03.020+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yea it isnt worded very well, but it isnt a bug, its a game mechanic to prevent people AFK farming on Kindred. you hit 6 and it marks Baron. after 7 (or after 6 im not too sure on this) it stops. Lambs marks still work perfectly fine its just Wolfs. Rito need to word it better. \nbut yea highly unlikely but yes it does happen and no its not a bug. just worded very poorly.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Acheron","date":"2016-03-28T05:04:59.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"only does it if you hit 6 stacks before baron spawns, which in a pvp game is quite unlikely. after 7 stacks wolfs marks dont work so its not a bug.","replies":[{"poster":"UnicornBaconFat","date":"2016-04-05T01:09:33.773+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\"WOLF - ENEMY MONSTERS: Wolf periodically selects a random monster camp within the enemy's jungle or Rift Scuttler Rift Scuttler, excluding epic monsters, and highlights the camp to both teams, starting at 2:30.
