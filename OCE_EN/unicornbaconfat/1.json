I believe that every time it&#039;s happened, I&#039;ve come out of an ARAM, but I haven&#039;t played much SR recently to know if it&#039;s an issue specific to ARAM.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be happening (or not happening) is that, now, on the home page in the client, I click on the profile button and nothing happens. The store button seems to work just fine, as do the help and options buttons.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat of a non-issue from a legitimate requirement to play standpoint, but is something that probably does need addressing as a bugfix post 5.9 deploy.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T00:47:59.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In patch 5.8, I believe, is when they introduced the reworked profile page. It may be that your computer is not really liking that.

As such, I didn't really see the necessity in repairing my client. I just thought it was worth pointing it out as a bug.\n\nThat said, I'm on Windows 7 with both an Intel HD 4000 and NVIDIA Quadro K2000M (yay laptops)","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-16T03:03:38.555+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"laptops op\n\nI'm not exactly understanding this now. If you can't access your runes/mastery pages/item sets, that would have a severe handicap on your game-play. What exactly can and can't you do on your profile? Could you upload some screenshots?\n\nOf course this is just out of curiosity, so if you can't be bothered, no worries.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
