Her ult falls under a disengage tool but I&#039;m sort of... not confused but unsure as to when is the correct time to use it, as it has numerous uses and I try and be as flexible as possible with it. Obviously there is no fixed time to use it, as every game and situation is different, I&#039;m just asking for what you all think are the best situations to use it in? I just sometimes find myself being a saviour for both teams if I blow their assassin of my ad but also their adc who is about to get ravaged by my team :p","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-03-31T07:13:55.409+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">I just sometimes find myself being a saviour for both teams if I blow their assassin of my ad but also their adc who is about to get ravaged by my team :p\n\nRemember this isn't a bad thing, you basically reset the fight with more health on your team over theirs.\n\nIt can also be used to split the enemy team up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-31T01:38:53.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess use it to knock off assassins and push the tanks away, or when you team gets blow up by aoe, you can also use it aggressively to split up their team or knock their adc into your team","replies":[{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-31T03:44:00.470+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most adcs aren't going to be stupid enough to go anywhere near a Janna but sometimes they do just go derp mode so they're a free kill :p I do try and use it to split their team sometimes, it can have mixed results as I mentioned but most of the time it's worth it.","replies":[]}]}]}
