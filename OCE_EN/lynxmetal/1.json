Just had a game where a full-tank Warwick was still taking around 1/2-2/3s of a squishies health with just his ult, most of the time you don&#039;t have enough time to actually do anything to get away after so you die pretty much immediately after. Prior to that it was a Gnar casually towerdiving full hp assassins, tanking all of their damage and the tower&#039;s, and still getting away with hp to spare. \r\nThe past two months of League have legitimately just felt like League of Hecajuani. It just feels like every tank can build just a sliver of damage and still just absolutely destroy  pretty much anyone they touch and be unkillable themselves. Playing Adc is so incredibly frustrating until you get to late-game and even then it&#039;s infuriating. Early to mid game it just feels like I just get killed constantly even if play I safe, the tanks just force their way to me and I get pummeled , and without any Armour Pen you can&#039;t really do jack about it. Laning is a nightmare as well, as a fair number of these tanks have huge engage ranges, Sej can Q, flash, and ult, Jarvan can EQ, flash, and ult,  Hecarim&#039;s tend to carry Teleport and his speed means he can just charge up the lane and you can&#039;t really do much to stop him when he ults.\r\nAdcs like Siv and Jinx seem to have just fallen out of the meta since they don&#039;t have very much mobility or escape mechs, or any natural tank-busting abilities.\r\nOn top of that, them all being tanks the towers aren&#039;t really much of a deterrent.\r\nI don&#039;t even understand why people play it, I mained Vi last season and have only played a couple of meta games with her a while back but it is so freaking dull. There&#039;s not really much of an adrenaline rush or anything, if I caught an ad out of position after I had Thorn, Mallet and Cinder then they would die and there was nothing they could do about it. If they stood and fought they would kill themselves on my Thorn, if they ran I had my Q, Ult, and Mallet, I didn&#039;t get ANY satisfaction out of it though. It&#039;s pretty much never a close fight or even a risky one.\r\n The assassin meta could be annoying if someone like Fizz or Talon got out of control but it&#039;s not like they were virtually indestructible, you can lock them down and hammer them until they die, which doesn&#039;t tend to take very long. With a fed tank you waste abilities trying to kill and peel the irritating git because he just sits on top of your Apc/adc and just slows/cc&#039;s/or just butchers them in a few seconds. \r\nI&#039;m genuinely curious. Does anyone out there actually find this meta fun or satisfying? At least the assassins actually require thought and balls to play, the tanks all seem to be a &#039;no risk high reward&#039; playstyle.\r\nSorry in advance for any spelling or punctuation errors, it&#039;s 3 40am here {{summoner:3}}","replies":[{"poster":"DiamondAries","date":"2015-05-28T04:36:10.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love how you are rambling on about tanks/bruisers tower diving for kills, when in the assassin meta the assassins could 1-shot you under tower **without even risking one shot from the tower.** \n\nAlso you didn't mention Vi in your list of BS bruisers.

If you get killed against damage building tanks while running as 0 defense assassins or adc you would only have yourself to blame for your subpar item building.\n\n> At least the assassins actually require thought and balls to play, the tanks all seem to be a 'no risk high reward' playstyle.\n\nNo man, you have it wrong. You're right, some assassins are high risk high reward, that would be like say Yi or Shaco. But the assassins that got famous and spammed across the board back then were the no risk high reward ones like LB, Zed and to some lesser degree, Lee Sin.\n\nNot to mention, tanks and bruisers are designed to dive people, that's their purpose. Just like how assassins are meant to 1 shot people, the reason why many people were biatching about assassin meta was due to some of them 1 shotting people while remaining completely safe while doing so, names are mentioned above.\n\nWe have so many anti-tank items in this game, just use them.\n\nTank meta is actually the healthiest of all types of meta, why? Because this game doesn't have anti-penetration itemisations, while having half the game shop filled with silver bullets that kill tanks like flies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-05-27T04:32:31.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:69}} and {{champion:61}} love it!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Viktor AU","date":"2015-05-27T02:54:54.325+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love it as viktor.
