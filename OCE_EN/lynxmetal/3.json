The only successful ones before that seem to have been Recon Satan and Arclight Vayne. I saw one Arcanist Ziggs and one Blood Moon Zilean before that I think. Maybe a couple of people with the Guardian of the Sands skin line but they didn&#039;t last. The Jayce skin seemed to be pretty popular as I saw that fairly often after it came out, but the rest of them, barely anything or nothing. Are people actually starting to get a bit smarter with their Riot Points now? it seemed before that whenever a new skin came out people would mindlessly buy it because it looked cool but then you get in game and find out they&#039;ve never actually played the champ, so after realizing they hate the champ the skin is just confined to the digital shelf and seldom used again. When the Marauder skins and Warden skins came out they were everywhere, most games I was in 90% of the time had at least one of the four skins in them. It doesn&#039;t seem to help that champions like Ziggs and Zilean don&#039;t really seem to be that popular at the moment.\r\nI guess this is more just a question of if any of you guys have been noticing the lack of fresh skins in your games, or if it&#039;s just me. \r\nAlso I&#039;m not sure if this has anything to do with it, but the old Championship skins seem to be &quot;On Sale&quot; everytime I go into the store, and there seems to be a lot more sales for skins and all that stuff, is this just Riot being thirsty or what?...\r\nThanks for reading :)","replies":[{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-05-22T04:32:43.204+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have totally noticed this too. I was just thinking when the recent Irelia, Lee Sin and Tyrndamere skins were revealed two being 750RP I was like \"The splash art is good...but i wouldn't buy it.\" And so i have felt for previous skins too. 750RP skins put me off too aha, like I just love 975+ cause of the cool recall animations and whatever else lol. I guess it doesn't help they keep bringing skins out for characters I personally don't like or play (You can't please everyone of course) but it doesn't even make me wanna buy or try the character just because it looks good o . o I rarely do that anyways, but if a skin looks just so amazing I might start playing them for it (Did that with Poro Rider Sej now she's one of my main junglers! xD) Also the SSW and Card skins all coulda been hella better, I like the look of the card skins definitely, all fancy and stuff c: But uh...chuck in a cool animations and what not, they really could of have made them better to be honest.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Mr Sinister NZ","date":"2015-05-22T04:01:26.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gir (Invader Zim) skin for Gnar should be made.
