Our top reconnected, died 6 times then disconnected again which was useful.\r\nIf it&#039;s ranked, I can understand why you wouldn&#039;t want to surrender, but if it&#039;s normals why drag it out and waste everyone&#039;s time on games that you have no chance of winning?","replies":[{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-04-17T01:46:12.035+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said in the post that I could understand in ranked, in norms it's beyond me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2015-04-14T07:49:35.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you are playing ranked, there is a point in not surrendering, did you know if you /ff in a ranked game, the overall lp you will lose is increased by around 5-10","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2015-04-14T03:37:41.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I did my best to give up quitting.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-04-14T03:01:07.677+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your a quitter.\n\nYOUR GOTTA BAYLIEVE","replies":[]}]}
