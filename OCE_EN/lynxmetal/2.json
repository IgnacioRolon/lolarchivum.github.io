He has very good lane and combat sustain, good cc, good dueling potential, good escape mechanisms and his passive is one of the most broken in the game in my opinion, and I can't think of any team composition he wouldn't fit into.  If anyone can enlighten me as to why he is so loathed I would be very grateful. \r\nThanks :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-03-24T23:03:17.995+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"he's useless as a tank and squishy as a bruiser","replies":[{"poster":"Lynxmetal","date":"2015-03-25T00:06:15.772+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How so? His Q is ok for initiation, not the best but it's alright, obviously there are better champs than him for initiation but he makes up for it with his dueling strength, and if he's on the front line attracting cooldowns then he's doing a decent job of soaking up damage, he's not the kind of champ you can easily ignore and he doesn't die quickly if you build him correctly, he can't be a solo tank I don't think, he doesn't have abilities like Malphite or Rammus that scale off of tank stats to ensure you still sting in teamfights. You wouldn't build him full-tank because he doesn't have the hard cc or natural damage that makes him still useful. Off-tank is pretty much the only option on him.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"minimuslim","date":"2015-03-25T13:15:44.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He falls off hard, damage-wise, late game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Chalze","date":"2015-03-25T08:34:51.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"He's go the fighter syndrome.\n\nBuild damage and you'll get killed too easily.\nBuild tank and you own't deal damage.\n\nThen you get those shtheads like Udyr and Vi who are tankier than Aatrox and deal maybe 7x the damage...\n\nBut then again, Aatrox is getting a buff next patch to make him more mechanically useful by giving him more Blood Well for each enemy hit by R which makes him able to gain a ton of attack speed as you initiate into a fight which really then brings out Aatrox's strong point: sustain & sustained damage.\n\nI'm sure to play more of him soon :) {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}} {{champion:266}}","replies":[{"poster":"Matutinus","date":"2015-03-25T09:18:50.052+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yep, they nerfed the damage on his W and E awhile ago and that really hurt him. the E nerf was kind of needed, lane aatrox was too strong, but if they revert the damage nerfs on his W he should be ok.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ace Access ","date":"2015-03-25T05:07:22.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its because he doesn't have much damage mitigation early game","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-03-25T02:50:37.845+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because you need skill to play yasuo well, got skill, gg\n\n+ its very hard to properly build aatrox situational for most games","replies":[]},{"poster":"Yuriklatura","date":"2015-03-25T01:47:57.511+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Other champions do his job better.
