In some situations it's great, warding behind your buff whilst you do it at early levels, or dropping it at jungle entrances at early levels, and/or the enemy jungle exits AT EARLY LEVELS. You're probably noticing a pattern here, obviously it's still useful late-game but early is when I find I am most reliant and grateful for it. Just because this is a trend that I am seeing constantly ever since Riot implemented the new trinket. This is mainly directed at top and mid laners, but bot is not exempt. The pattern I'm seeing is that people constantly seem to think that their trinket ward substitutes for buying actual wards. It's incredibly frustrating when I see top or mid constantly getting ganked and they're still just using their trinket to ward. I've seriously lost count of the amount of times I've had the same goddamn conversation with tops and mids after they've gotten ganked for the third time in fifteen minutes. \r\n\"Top you should probs ward\"\r\n\"I am warding *insert generic insult*\"\r\n\"You hav'nt bought a single ward all game\"\r\n\"I'm using trinket every time it's up\"\r\nAnd if I'm jungling and I point it out the answer is always something along the lines of \"gank then fkn noob\", I've seriously given up trying to reason with this logic and normally just answer with \"The shitty little trinket doesn't count as warding\". Is anyone else finding this in their games? In regards to top and mid seeming to think they're indestructible because they have a trinket ward?","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-03-26T00:53:41.661+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Top and Mid laners should be good enough to get a double kill from the 2v1 situations of being ganked.

If people arn't sure how to ward, or don't see the value of them then I seriously wonder if they play the game with their eyes closed, it's a level of stupid that just makes them more of a burden than an asset.

I always try  as much as possible to be a positive asset to my team, if someone asks a question that's considered common knowledge but maybe they're new or out of the loop then I will try and be as helpful as possible and give them pointers and tips on where they might be going wrong. If someone new wants to play with me and ask for advice and guidance then I am 100% down for it.  We were all new once, but if someone is just going to either ignore the advice I give them or are too stubborn to accept their mistakes and try and learn from them then I'm not sure how I'm supposed to think of them as anything else than a siege minion. On top of that because it's not uncommon to see people on BOTH TEAMS saying \"first time ... ?\" as a taunt or attempt to irritate people if they're not doing  well, so you can see why it's such a delicate question to ask, as it's often misinterpreted as an insult, and for some reason if people get the slightest impression they're either being told what to do or being talked down to, even if it's completely imagined, then they just lash out.\nTo answer your question. \nWhen warding I think that the \"long-term\" situations far outnumber the \"short-term\" situations but I'll try and explain my thoughts. As I mentioned in my original post, I use it very often when I'm jungling by dropping it behind my buffs to make sure if the enemy jungler decides to invade then I have time to get out and ping for assistance. Or if I'm bot lane and the enemy support keeps running in and out of the brush and they have a gap closing cc ability (Thresh, Blitz, etc) then it's good to see where they are so you can prepare to juke it if needed. \nI'll use the example of warding Dragon when you're playing support in answering your question on what I think are \"long-term\" purposes.\nIf you drop your trinket on it, then you only have vision on it for one minute, depending what champion you're playing, whom you're against, what side you're on and how good your vision is bot then you're potentially risking getting caught out of position and dying if you're constantly going back to trinket it. On top of that you're leaving your ad in lane on their own, so there is the risk of them dying as well if they don't play safe until you come back. \nYou're still going to have to go back a minute later to drop another ward, which I don't think is an efficient use of your time, as you miss gold/experience, it's far easier to just put a proper ward on it, that way regardless of if you're forced out of lane or die thirty seconds later you still have plenty of time to get back down and keep vision on it. If it's only me warding then I obviously move wards depending on the movements of the enemy team and what's happening in the game, but that's a bit of a different story from the point I'm getting at.","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-28T05:45:03.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay so in regards to players who don't know things, just because someone doesn't know something obvious, doesn't mean they are new! Things that are obvious need to be constantly discussed as part of team strategy, I feel if it were talked about more games would be more fun and more people would be positive.\n\nAlso just a general suggestion; any wards on lanes esp top I feel, are just a beneficial to you as they are the laner. In fact I would argue they are more important to you. If you see the jungler top, it means you can 4 man gank bot, just gank mid or bot, or try for a dragon. You can also use the information steal enemy buffs, invade with deep wards on bot side jungle and help decide your jungle route for the next 30s-1min. With all these benefits why not just ward for your non-warding laners? At least that way you have information and your top will know to run backwards.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-26T06:10:43.442+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ask them to upgrade it as soon as they can if they don't intend on switching it out.
