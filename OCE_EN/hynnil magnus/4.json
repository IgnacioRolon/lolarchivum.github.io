I can deal with longer queues in dynamic queue. But the amount of people still failing to choose bans or no locking in still seems to happen 4 out 5 times I queue. This is what is making Queue times so long because we are continuously reentering queue&#039;s.\n\nJust wanted to add because the queue times are a little longer on OCE it is less forgiving than it is on larger severs where the queue time is very short.\n\nCan&#039;t we introduce harsher penalties for wasting peoples time like this?","replies":[{"poster":"The Way of Le","date":"2016-02-22T00:55:28.918+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So you saying you to have a bigger penalties for dodging or falling lock in. Are you srs, dodging in solo que happen all the time and sometime people dodge for good reason. *eg you got a support teemo will you dodge? * Got a toxic player started flaming before the game even started will you dodge? you got a Bad team comp you know even you play the game you know you going to lose will you Dodge? Or do you rather LOL auto pick on champion for the guy falling to lock in even tho he going to afk in game for like 5 mins or so. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Ji2SjgVSA       Here give you the inside why Dodging can be good.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-02-22T00:40:16.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sometimes dodging a champ select is legit.\nI mean, I don't wanna play a game with 4 other people who have started ripping each other to shreds while still in champ select. I also don't want to play in a game with someone who says \"quick game, end at 20 or ff coz i have to go to work/school\". One time I even dodged because there was an earthquake during champ select and I knew my internet would be sh♥tty.\n\nPeople dodging for the hell of it, is another thing all together, but what can you do. Just watch youtube or go on tumblr during the whole process.\n\nOn the topic of locking in bans/picks, Riot has implemented a pop-up that explicitly states that you need to lock them in or it will count as a dodge and you will suffer the penalty. Its still gonna take a while for people to actually get this through their skulls.","replies":[]}]}
