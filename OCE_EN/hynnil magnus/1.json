It is so common that it feels like theres one in every second game.\r\nIf they aren&#039;t afking in the fountain. They are simply selling all their items and running at the enemy and dying. This ruins the game for 4 other people each game it happens. Bronze is hellish enough to get your team to work together to climb out of bronze without having to deal with people purposely trolling.\r\nThe question stands that if the problem isn&#039;t dropping but infact getting worse are riots punishments for this sort of behavior big enough?\r\nWhy is there not a warning followed by a permanent ban for this?\r\nI had  a guy say in chat that he had bought his account the other day to purposely grieve people in games. Running the same builds and tele/smite in every game no matter what role he played. Then proceeded to feed in every game and his game history showed this. But he said yeah if riot bans me I will just buy another account. Although the whole team reported him his account is probably still active.","replies":[{"poster":"Hynnil Magnus","date":"2017-03-04T23:53:01.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah they are animals!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-03-04T23:49:44.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Bronze is still better than silver. \n\nAnd pretty sure they are still called griefers not http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/new-monster/images/8/87/Griever.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150328235851.","replies":[]}]}
