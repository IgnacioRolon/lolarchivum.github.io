I think its a positive step. I think having some control over your role will encourage more people to play ranked. I think dynamic queue achieves a better vision for how the game is supposed to be played, as a team. As a new player i found it confusing that there was a solo queue in a team game that was emphasized. \n\nBottom line as humans we hate change. But i think people will slowly come around to the idea. I know for my other 2 friends and i summoners rift has become more appealing since we can now group together.","replies":[{"poster":"GunflameSmurf","date":"2016-01-20T21:39:56.808+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hate playing not. This makes it so much better.\n\nIn game I can tell my allies that I like playing \"top/mid/jg\" and sometimes we switch lanes.  No fighting.","replies":[]}]}
