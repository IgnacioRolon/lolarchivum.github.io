I am new to league of legends, I have come over from Dota 2. My good friend persuaded me to try league, reluctantly, I conformed. He made my account due to my laziness, using my email. obviously due to him making the account, he knew the password but because he is my good friend, I trusted him to not do anything bad on my account. Sadly, this was not the case. After many purchases, close to $80 all up, it has all gone to waste because of my friend being toxic :( \nFrom playing years of Dota and never being suspended in anyway for toxicity, this made me quite confused, the logs that were shown were definitely not said by me. I confronted my friend, and he admitted to getting my account perma banned. The say I purchased RP to by new heroes, clearly, I was quite disappointed with him. I&#039;m 19 and a university student with very financially troubled parents and recently I have acquired a train ticket :/ Of course it is silly of me to get one, but having very little income and ability to pay this due to my financial position, I am asking riot to please consider refunding this money. The ticket is $110, and may not seem like much to most people, but to me this is a substantial amount of money that I cannot just get from anywhere. The $80 would help out with me being able to pay this fine substantially. I am not so annoyed with the ban of the actual account because I can always make a new one but the fact that I spent so much money on the game and to have to gone to waste in this manner is very disheartening. Please consider this request and contact me at my email ~ *removed* ~ Thanks you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-27T13:24:14.111+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please don't post personal info on boards, it's never a good idea.\n\nThat aside, your best bet is going to be to go through support (link below). That said, being refunded for something like this is unlikely. You accepted the responsibility of securing that account, and obviously it sucks that someone you though was a friend would do that to you, but ultimately that's on them not on Riot. You'd probably have better luck telling your friend to give you the $80. \n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-29T08:31:02.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lmao, and you call them a 'friend'.","replies":[]}]}
