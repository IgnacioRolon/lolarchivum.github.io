I would honestly love for this thread to go viral so someone at riot views it and starts asking the real questions. \r\n\r\nHow can we better these systems, how can we improve the penalising system to be able to detect patterns in inting players, instead of just brushing over it because the player has said \"I'm trying my best\" when clearly he is getting bested in whatever the position he has chosen, and starts inting, giving free kills, setting back others by taking farm or taking jungle camps. This happens too often and honestly, it's really tiring to have to play with people that actively int, and the system only sets a reprimand for a player that is being toxic through chat. I highly doubt that the system actually analyses the matches and sees a trolling or inting pattern. \r\n\r\nThat being said when are we actually going to get a system that works efficiently, not only through chat but thorough analysis of the game to see who is actively inting or trolling. Personally i have had many matches with these types of players and reporting them saying \"there is a pattern\" just doesnt cut it. I do it to vent but i know that the system doesnt pick up on it, and if it does, it works horribly bad.\r\n\r\nSo riot instead of releasing skins here and there to quite literally keep making money, why dont you guys fix these two systems, which effect all of the players trying to climb and achieve a high rank. Im sure there are more things to fix with the game, but these two in my opinion are the most notorious. \r\n\r\nThen you guys can go back to making skins, which btw a few that have come out are pretty cool, i have to admit. BUT i would like to be able to play a match with players who want the same thing as me, to climb and to get better, and getting trolling or inting people because they are losing lane, or dont know how to play a position allegedly, or get camped and start feeding in other lanes really doesnt help at all. \r\n\r\nit really sucks fellas, the season is coming to an end, worlds is on, and people like tyler1 and imaqtpie have been asking for these things for a while...why oh why do i feel as if none really cares?\r\n\r\nFellas at riot. I would like to hear a response. And im not calling you out aggressively at all, ive been playing this game for 5 years because i like it, and have struggled a lot to get a good rank, and 60% of it is because of the reasons i have mentioned above.\r\n\r\ni dunno maybe my words will get carried into the wind or a rioters ears....hopefully option 2\r\n\r\nHave a great end of season \r\nCalmYoTits signing off","replies":[]}
