As soon as clash starts the servers and spiking upwards of 500ms?\r\nInclusively a few days before, the server is working horribly, even the stability of the client is in general bad.\r\nIs it possible, just maybe u know, if you have a spare minute or two, stop messing around with TFT or releasing skins? And actually fix these problems, because apparently, I'm not the only one thats having them. Tbh its really annoying being in a team fight and the game spiking that hard. I'm not downloading anything no1 else is on my internet, its on cable. So please don't tell me to do the typical check for lag spikes. I fix pcs for a living and all other games run with a stable 60 ms no problem. What's going on???","replies":[{"poster":"Zearea","date":"2019-09-09T06:43:59.131+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the same is happening to my games and I am 90% of the time around 30ms and now its pinging around the 300-500s. On a slightly unrelated note my actual client when I am locking in a champion lags out badly and becomes increasingly worse over time until restarted. It would not surprise me that a lot of the dodging is happening because someone isn't able to lock in their champions and try to restart their clients. The five minute penalty still applies by the way. \n\nWhat is going on Riot?","replies":[{"poster":"CalmYoTits","date":"2019-09-09T06:47:05.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've had this happen to me on countless occasions. mostly on ranked matches. 5-minute penalty and loss of lp.\nWe all enjoy the game and thats why we play it, inclusively put money into it. but seriously fellas come on. They be {{summoner:4}} away from the real issues.","replies":[]}]}]}
