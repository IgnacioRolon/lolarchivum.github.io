It's not fair on the positive/neutral players to have spots taken away from them just because the \"negative\" players want to participate in Clash.\n\nThe issue could be solved with some changes to how the Clash system works, by having two distinct Clash \"modes\", one which is restricted to Honour 2+ and gives rewards, and another that is open to everyone that gives no rewards. That way, people participate in the \"mode\" they choose, and no one has spots \"taken away\" from them. Personally, I would have no issues with such a system.\n\n*However*, as far as the currently implemented version of Clash, it does make sense to restrict it, as it acts as both a deterrent for negative behaviour, and a reward for positive behaviour.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Smurf Du√≤","date":"2018-05-17T22:21:49.532+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree, I'm gonna be forced to play on a smurf account just to play clash as leveling honor up to level 2 on my main account is going to take way too long as I've already been reset twice to honor 0 so I've basically given up on trying to get it and will just play clash on a smurf account seeing as thats my only logical answer","replies":[]},{"poster":"Stillborn","date":"2018-05-23T17:18:50.883+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because why encourage toxicity?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Eskidon","date":"2018-05-17T12:56:10.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Was interested in the idea; however, I have friend who like to give others 'strong advice' when in games sometimes.
