Grammar ^-^","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-09-08T21:17:03.860+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Actually I think the grammar is correct, _(albeit confusingly worded)_.\n\nAs it states, \"without\" then a _semi colon_ indicating a list, and the list is: Marksmen, Mage, Utility.  Then each of those has a semi colon, which indicates both a list and a new sentence, the sentence then goes on to say \"No Jinx, Ezreal, MF.\"\n\nSo there are 3 sentences, each separated by semicolons, and each semicolon only connects the current sentence to the next, it has no relation to the one after.\n\nIt doesn't read: Without: Marksman: No jinx. Mage: No Ahri _(which is how it looks like, and is incorrect)_\nIt actually reads: Without: Marksmen, Mage, Utility: No Jinx, Ahri, Poppy. _(which is correct grammar, I think)_\n\n\nSo in terms of grammar, it is _\"Without: Marksmen.\"_ and _\"Marksmen: No Jinx\"_  as seperate sentences. They don't read directly into each other, they are separated by the 'marksman' and the sentences are divided by semicolons. So I think technically the grammar is correct, as the double negative is not in adjoining sentences.\n\nIt could be written better, but as a rule, I don't believe it is incorrect.\nOf course I am no expert though.","replies":[{"poster":"Auryx","date":"2017-09-14T03:40:10.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ah, The English language such a beauty..","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-09-08T04:46:54.453+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think its meant to just explain which champions arent allowed\n\ni.e. win a game without marksman: No Jinx, ezreal or MF","replies":[{"poster":"Auryx","date":"2017-09-08T07:48:37.386+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand what it was trying to get at but I just feel like one of the two words should be removed, I doubt this bugs anyone else but me. :/","replies":[]}]}]}
