We of course chat and try to convince each other to dodge to see what happens, two of my teammates dodge and nothing happens, it says they have left the lobby but it doesn&#039;t kick us out. Here I am waiting in lobby for an hour in hopes the game starts with just me and I get some free lp, eventually I dodge and lose 2 lp. Just a weird thing that happened to me and maybe happened to you too?","replies":[]}
