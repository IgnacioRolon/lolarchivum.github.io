Honestly, just a small thing that bugs me a lot.","replies":[{"poster":"Donut Panic","date":"2017-09-16T05:15:51.376+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was thinking the same thing, I kind of feel like there is no point in getting masteries on champs anymore since I can't really show off without using this giant mastery thing lol","replies":[]}]}
