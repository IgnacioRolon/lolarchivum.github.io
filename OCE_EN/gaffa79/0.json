This is why \"learning the game\" is a thing. While I incline to agree that the barrier to entry isn't the best and that the state of the overall balance isn't great, but it isn't because the game is not catering to new players.\n\nSecondly, no match-based game besides like say the very niche ones, has active moderators lurking in every game because that's impossible with 10s of millions of games being played everyday in LoL. So Riot makes the player self-regulate to an extent, which is the after-match report function, use them.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-01-25T06:52:51.591+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah but I mean, unlocking runes and masteries, and the cost of a full rune set kinda means that unless the newbie is like some innate pro, they're generally going to be stomped by some silver player with runes and masteries and a keystone and go like 0-14 in lane.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-25T06:55:46.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nightjar,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=AE1ZnTKE,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T06:52:51.591+0000)\n>\n> yeah but I mean, unlocking runes and masteries, and the cost of a full rune set kinda means that unless the newbie is like some innate pro, they&#x27;re generally going to be stomped by some silver player with runes and masteries and a keystone and go like 0-14 in lane.\n\nRunes makes rather minimal amount of impact besides early game really. But I agree that masteries is really problematic atm.\n\nBut yeah as I've said, barrier to entry isn't that great, which getting your first couple set of runes and lvling to 30 both cover.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey Max","date":"2017-01-25T09:55:00.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"But the early game is when people get fed, and if u lose ur lane, ur rly behind and therefore a new player won't know how to bounce back from that, will tilt, and give up on the game.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-01-25T10:14:14.075+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Monkey Max,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=AE1ZnTKE,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-01-25T09:55:00.244+0000)\n>\n> But the early game is when people get fed, and if u lose ur lane, ur rly behind and therefore a new player won&#x27;t know how to bounce back from that, will tilt, and give up on the game.\n\nYeah but there has to be a winner somehow.\n\nThe point of having gold and in-game experience (as in champion going from lvl 1 to 18 in a game) is so that snowball is a fundamental part of the game, and early winner most likely will win harder leading to the winner of the match unless 1) they've made a mistake and got overturned in some way or 2) the run out of juice, as in, their comp is more early game oriented and the enemy team has stalled them enough to reach their preferred game-phase.\n\nAssuming there is no major balance issues going on, new players would still be challenged to cope with snowballs and trying to bounce back from being snowballed. It's a part of the gameplay loop and a integral learning process.\n\nThat said, I do feel kinda bad for the players who'd just joined in this season, because the current level of snowball is pretty hectic with this season's Mastery/Keystones being especially vicious when it comes to snowballing. But still.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-01-25T05:58:04.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try playing vs intermediate bots when you start out.

A lot of people don't like the levelling process to 30, but it's needed. If you can learn the game and do decent without having to rely on a full mastery page and rune page you'll probably do fairly well once you do get them. A lot of the new accounts though are at the mercy of smurfs. Which are really experienced players making new accounts to play at lower divisions to practice for their higher division accounts. Once the game figures out you're actually a fresh new player with no idea what you're doing you'll be paired with similar people. The games learning curve isn't that high, as long as you don't stoop down to everyone elses level and just focus on your own play. I know this probably sounds weird coming from someone who played since s3 and is only silver but I'm just a casual.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2017-01-25T11:13:02.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's definitely not the easiest game to pick up. A few things that help are playing other RTS games like Age of Empires or Warcraft or Starcraft. The mouse and keyboard control scheme is the same.\n\n@NightJar Definitely runes and masteries help. But we have made all tier 2 runes 1 IP so you can get pretty much on equal terms with a very small IP investment. We've also made a few core tier 3 runes half price.\n\nThe best thing to do is to join a community and ask for a buddy to show you the ropes. There is a lot of information to learn not just with 100+ champions 400+ abilities and all those items and stats. But also meta and general game decision making.\n\nA really great community is Summoners Society they have a discord and facebook group. Or you can ask one of the local instructors and see what help they can provide.\n\nSummoners Society\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/SummonersSocietyOCE/\n\nInstructors\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-strategy/RaWrI4Hi-introducing-the-instructors\n\nAnother great resource is;\n\nwww.probuilds.net for general item builds, runes and mastery set ups.\n\nGL man!","replies":[]}]}
