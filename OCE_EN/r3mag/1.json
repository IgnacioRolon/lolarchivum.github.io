Currently our club consists of about 10 members and our discord currently has about 30. Main reason were looking to post this is to meet more people and have some fun. There's no discrimination when comes to ranking etc as we play with people ranging from iron all the way up to diamond atm. We all play the game together however we want to trying different builds, helping each other with learning champions, picking off meta comps to even picking troll comps (like all supports or even movement speed comps) all in the name of having fun. Some of us (me included) also like to play ranked so if that's your thing as well and looking for flex or duos with poeple as it can be something we can look into together.\n\nAs Ive said above were looking to expand the community to meet more people. Only thing we ask is no bullying people or anything of that sort, we understand people can get tilted as we do as well sometimes which is fine just not picking on people so they dont want to play anymore. So by all means if this is something your interested in being apart of add me on league client and well get you set up in the club and if need discord link for server I can provide. Later on if we get an influx of people wanting to join I'll update this board with other Officers of the club people can get in contact with. \n\nOn a couple of side notes, We also play Team fight Tactics normal and ranked so if people are into that we can oblige, Name atm for our club is Tilt Free Zone, if majority of people don't like the name later on we can put up a vote to have it changed And also as a side note ill be getting into streaming to play league and other games so if want to check that out links will be in discord.\n\nThank you for your time and hope to see you on the rift. :)","replies":[{"poster":"depresssion","date":"2020-02-13T11:14:00.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"can you add me, and invite me to discord pls!!{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kutosotuk","date":"2019-11-01T04:56:51.347+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll happily join if you are still looking","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChiwawaNinja","date":"2019-09-25T00:30:55.031+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:86}} Still looking for new people?
