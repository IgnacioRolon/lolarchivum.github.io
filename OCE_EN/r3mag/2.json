In my own personal opinion a change i would like to see is that each duplicate item that is  put onto a champion either gives diminished returns or just flat out can not equip.\r\n\r\nToo many games ive seen were certain champions with certain items get too much power from 2 of the same item and gives too much of a lead for certain games. As said above would like to get some peoples opinions on the subject or even other ideas to give the game more balance and enrich the playing experience of Teamfight Tactics.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.","replies":[{"poster":"Stahri Night","date":"2019-10-17T12:04:11.043+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"TL;DR\nStacking items brings risks that balance out the stacking, and there are counters to everything that you can transition into if you are having a hard time against one thing, balancing how the item stacking mechanic works.\n\nHeres the full thing:\nBy items, I'm going to go ahead and assume you are referring to finished items, such as Rapidfire Cannon and Thieves Gloves.\n\nThere are obviously many items that stack in the game, such as Ionic Spark and Stattik Shiv, but at the same time, many whose affects do not, such as GA and Class Changing items (Yuumi/Aatrox etc.) Again, going with the assumption that you want to nerf either the effect they give, or the stat buffs they give, so I will give my thoughts for both.\n\nIt is my belief that nerfing the effects of stacked items should not be a thing, nor a problem for the current state of the game's meta. The idea of stacking items means that, whilst you may be able to stack \"OP\" items on a single champion, you sacrifice one of three crucial item slots for any other items. As an example, a Draven with double Bloodthirsters and Guinsoos would have a significant amount of lifesteal, making it near impossible for him to die in a 1v1, even up to a 3v1 scenario, but also increases the chances of being cc locked and killed due to the lack of Trap Claw, or being purely one shot by an assassin due to the lack of Phantom Dancer or GA. There are many other scenarios for this, as the item and champion combinations are endless, but again, this is merely one idea. The tradeoff of one core item for stacking synergies was made with the intent to be equal, and if you look at both high and low elo play, this is apparent where Brawlers may stack Ionic Sparks, which is one of my favourite comps, but they will inevitably end up losing to comps focused on auto attacking, like Rangers focused on a Vayne carry, due to their lack of spell usage, which Ionic Spark counters. Each item has an opposite item, to reference Newton's Laws, and these balance each other out, creating a balanced state of item effects.\n\nAs for pure stat buffs, this again comes with tradeoffs. By stacking only attack speed or attack damage on a carry, you lose those precious defensive stats that may come in clutch, making the difference between a 4th and 5th place, i.e. a win or loss. I understand that there are clearly some broken combinations, as there were in the past, but these were all pushed out of the meta by buffs to their counters, or nerfs to their synergies entirely, as Riot does their best to shake up the meta each patch. That small power spike that may come from 2, or even 3 Giant Slayers of AD and AS would easily be countered by something that dodges the damage, such as Yordles or Shen ultimate, and the damage may even become insignificant if hypothetical carry with said items gets killed instantly, either due to poor positioning or pure luck. Stacking AP items would be the same, as you may have a Cho'Gath with 3 Deathcaps, but you are against the now-popular Dragons and Guardians comp, which boasts high armor and magic resistance. With there being apparent counters to everything once you gain that game knowledge through your own experience, and through APPROVED third party applications, such as Blitz or TFTactics, I believe that stat nerfs are unnecessary once you gain the ability to transition to counter anything that is utterly destroying you. \n\nOf course, there is no \"perfect team comp\" that perfectly counters everything, so you will inevitably be beaten by your counters, but you will also be the one beating those that you counter, which brings about both the strategic and luck components of TFT. Since everything can be countered by other things, it seems unneeded that nerfs come into stacked items due to the risks that it brings along with it mentioned above. \n\nAgain, in my own opinion, the game seems well balanced to the point where the meta shifts every comp, as it did in the last patch from everyone spamming Wild Assassins into Guardians or Knights. Sure, there are clearly the stronger and weaker comps, but looking back at Riot's patch history since the release of TFT, they seem to be buffing what is underpowered, and nerfing what is overpowered, both directly and indirectly. Sure, whilst stacking items may give crazy buffs to a single champion, those buffs also come with the risk of not having core items which could drastically change the outcome of a single round, if not the whole game. I'd say the items in TFT are in a solid place right now, and don't need any significant remodelling, but you never know, Riot may surprise everyone as they have done before and change how they work entirely.\n\nLong read, I know, but hopefully this shined some light onto other perspectives of the game and why the current item situation is \"balanced\"","replies":[]}]}
