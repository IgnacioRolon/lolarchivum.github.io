They get matched with high bronze players, I assume because the matchmaking just splits the difference, but they queue as &quot;fill&quot; and no matter which role they get, they will both go toplane leaving at least 1 lane or jungle unattended. I have had them 2 games in a row (reported by the entire team both times) and just had to dodge to get out of being locked in with them for a third. I want to know, why there is no action being taken on players such as this, and why, if i report someone who is obviously not playing the game correctly, I am getting matched with them game after game? If this continually happens to me and the culprits have no punishment, why shouldn&#039;t I do it? Looks fun enough, enraging the whole team, to the amusement of yourself and not being reprimanded at all. It&#039;s no wonder this server, and bronze elo in particular is so bitter and toxic. For those who read this before the moderators sensor the names:\r\nBronze 5 - SkyCladNatsu\r\nSilver 3 - Serah Farron\r\nStay safe friends.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-31T01:04:06.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi summoner,\n\n**The Boards are not the right place to report things like this**\nAlso, can you please remove the link as [there is a strict no name and shame policy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules). \n\n>In cases like this, be sure to send in a support ticket to Riot detailing exactly what happened, and any evidence you may have.\n\n>Please keep in mind that player support is busy and it may take a lil while for them to get back to you (almost always reply within a week).
