The option is designed to remove any performance influence the new client has for people playing on low-spec machines, but if you aren't one of those people, there's no reason to have the option on, and it will ofc slow down post game since the client has to relaunch every time.","replies":[{"poster":"lightbarer","date":"2017-05-26T14:40:38.937+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have close client selected still no difference","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-26T19:01:17.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nono as in you should turn that option off. Having that option enabled means that the client has to relaunch every time you leave game, which takes a while.
