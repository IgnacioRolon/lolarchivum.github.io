It seems to crop up more if you have other applications accessing the internet running in the background though, so try to close all other programs whilst using league, including, steam, battle.net, skype, discord, ect.. It makes it a little smoother, though still not optimal.","replies":[{"poster":"Twø ßrothers","date":"2017-02-16T02:51:36.300+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trouble is i have nothing else open, i have played this game since season 3 and i havent seen this before, and ive used skype/discord/soundcloud music streams while playing constantly without this issue, game was running fine yesterday with music stream going too so im not sure :/ im going to do some tech stuff to my rig and modem now and restart and see if theres any difference fingers crossed","replies":[]}]}]}
