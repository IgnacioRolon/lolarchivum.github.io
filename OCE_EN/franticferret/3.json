Anyway, I&#039;m thinking of taking some mates from Church for a camping trip over to Moreton island, where we&#039;ll snorkle and check out the reef. I&#039;m just wondering, but is it worth it? I&#039;d love a rioter who could respond to this and answer a few questions:\r\n\r\n1: How much progress has been made on the reef? Is it 50% done? And milestones? All I know so far is that Nautilus is in it, and it&#039;s been worked on for a year. I&#039;m not sure if that means it&#039;s finished yet or not.\r\n\r\n2: Is it very pretty and colourful? A couple pics of the reef from underwater work would be amazing if possible!\r\n\r\nThe next two questions aren&#039;t about the reef itself, but rather about the conditions surrounding the reef. I&#039;m assuming that someone working on the reef would have insight on these, too, but ultimately these are bonus optional questions. Alternatively, instead of answering these questions, I wouldn&#039;t at all mind contact details of the cub contracted company working on this, so I can go to them directly with my questions! If you don&#039;t want to post their contact details publically, feel free to email them to the email address associated with my account! :)\r\n\r\n3: Will Snorkling do us any good? There&#039;s an approximately 11m depth I believe at the shallowest point during low tide, and tide variance is about 2-3 metres. How deep is the reef? Would it be worth snorkling over, or would the water be too turbid to see through? And opinion of one of the workers working directly with the reef would be amazing on this, plus also some fact checking (If I have the depth wrong, etc. BTW, the reef is approximately 500m off shore, right?)\r\n\r\n4: Would it be safe for a group to swim from the shore and snorkle over the top of the reef? (I&#039;m yet to check out wildlife, it&#039;s late tonight, I&#039;ll do it soon, haha. I don&#039;t want to snorkle with any great whites or crocodiles. :L)\r\n\r\n\r\nAny rioter response from this would be super amazing! Thank you! :) {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}  (I hope to one day scuba dive and look for my summoner name there, as well! ;D)","replies":[]}
