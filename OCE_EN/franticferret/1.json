This rework is designed to make him fall more nicely into the control mage territory. :L Imma do the abilities in a weird order but I think it makes the most sense this way.\r\n\r\nE: Imma pull a Galio rework on this and squish his current ult down into a basic ability. It&#039;ll be incredibly narrow compared to his old ult, and instead of leaving a tiny wall it&#039;ll leave a sand soldier at the end of it! Graphically a sand soldier will pop up behind Azir and do a spin/dash or something attack and push enemies around Azir and in a tiny area in the direction of cast to the full range of the cast, and leave that sand soldier there. This will be his new defensive ability, which won&#039;t really be able to do crazy battlemagey things like his old E and ult enabled, and also it&#039;ll have a pretty hefty CD because it is a really powerful self peel after all. :L (Also since it actually does something by itself now it&#039;ll be available at level 1 for that cheese E start invade strat. :L)\r\n\r\nW: His W&#039;s gonna be almost the same, but since his E will spawn a sand soldier, it makes sense to make his W less of his sand soldier button, and more of another ability that leaves a sand soldier after, so it&#039;ll be almost identical except instead of one charge just spawning a sand soldier, a sand soldier will pop up near Azir then just to the target location, damaging and applying a short lived slow to enemies hit. It&#039;ll mean people can dodge the sand soldier, but the slow will make them take about the same amount of hits as they would have back when the sand soldier popped up instantly.\r\n\r\nQ: His Q&#039;s perfect, no change here. :)\r\n\r\nR: Now for the fun stuff. I hear that Riot&#039;s been experimenting with the idea of permanent terrain manipulation, and I reckon Azir&#039;s the bad bird to give it a shot. My idea is basically he targets an enemy champion but can choose which side of them he wants, like how Kat&#039;s E targets, and up pops a Shuriman spire, pretty much a really small Trundle E that&#039;s yellower and taller, and with it pops up a big lot of sand that knows enemies around it away, including the individual targeted champ. The sand then pools around the spire, and the sand and the spire last the rest of the game and can&#039;t be taken down. Naturally the spires can&#039;t be placed right next to each other or walls, so you can&#039;t just permanently close off pathways, that&#039;d be stupid, but you can clog up areas to make it harder to traverse and harder to escape Sand soldier&#039;s range. ;) ;) Also all allies get a movespeed boost while on the sand, so they can run past a Spire to get a little boost in fights, or when roaming, and the clogging up of pathways is a lot less inconvenient to allies since they can zoom through it anyway. :) (Also note that he has to target an enemy champion, so he doesn&#039;t have 100% freedom in where he wants to put it, coz again, that&#039;d be stupid if he could just pop up a spire wherever he wanted once every three minutes or something.)\r\n\r\nPassive: I hear that Riot doesn&#039;t like the sun disc turret passive thingy anymore, so I have a cool idea. Keep the sun disc, but instead of being a turret, it makes the are below it be Shurima for a bit. So, while the sun disc is up, it covers the area which would have been under the fallen turret with sand. This is special sand though, it doesn&#039;t just give the movespeed that his ult&#039;s sand gives, but it also gives a little bit of hp and mana regen. Not so much that it&#039;s like you get a free ocean drake, but enough so that if they engage you on your home sand, then you&#039;ll have a subtle advantage pretty much everytime, from your team being able to move faster, and also recovering that extra bit of hp and mana for that edge that could make the difference. Also, all touching sand placed by Azir&#039;s ult is affected by this special sand, and they also get the added hp and mana regen, too, so a smart Azir can set up giant complexes of Special sand as the game goes on. (Thematically you can say that the sun disc gives extra life to the sand or something like that IDK it makes sense trust me) The sun disc will still have a health bar and will have its health drain like before, and when it explodes it blows away all the sand that it spawned, so the enemy team can focus the sun disc to get rid of your advantage if they really want to, and an unprotected sun disc will be vulnerable.\r\n\r\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} \r\nAnyway, that&#039;s my idea for the rework. I hope that wasn&#039;t too long, but I think those changes on his ult and passive to give him the sand mechanic, as well as removing his dash (He&#039;ll get mobility from positioning on his sand anyway, he won&#039;t need a dash! ;P), really fit the theme of an emporer who wants to rebuild his empire. Because, as the game goes on, he DOES rebuild Shurima! :D And it also fits his stand back and let his minions do the dirty work for him theme in that his ult&#039;s power is in slowly shifting the scales towards his empire&#039;s favour, where he makes his entire team stronger as the game goes on, instead of just having a flashy ultimate he can roll up his sleeves with, ya feel me? It makes him a lot less like a super soldier and more like an emperor making plans for his empire&#039;s propserity! :D\r\n\r\nI&#039;d love to see a Rioter response to this, even if you have no intention of putting this in the game, just to see what a rioter would think of this idea! :D I&#039;m open to hearing feedback and changes people would make to this! :) (Honestly though I&#039;d so love to see this kit in game! :D Hecking hire me Rito. ;P)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntl;dr his current ult will become his E ala Galio, his new ult will make permanent mini Trundle E&#039;s that speed up allies as they walk past them so that Azr can rebuild Shurima as the game goes along, and his passive&#039;s changed from being a turret to giving allies a movespeed, hp regen, and mana regen buff in the area around it so that they fight better if they get engaged on under it, and also the ult spires act as conductors for this buff.","replies":[{"poster":"Oxx","date":"2017-08-30T08:50:02.943+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that I am bit late to the party and everything may have been said already but I believe that Azir's rework should decrease his mobility and increase his damage. After all, he is an emperor who uses his soldiers to defend himself. The range of his abilities should be increased slightly and shifting sands (E) escape mechanic should be removed. This will fit Azir's profile perfectly and will bring some clarity to the issues surrounding his low win rate. This is because he will have an equal distribution of pros and cons allowing him to be beaten; unfortunately. I have been an Azir main for quite some time and I am happy that Riot is  taking the time to rework one of the best champions in the game. Either way I am excited that Azir's kit is being reworked so that I can regain the luxury of tearing apart an entire team. He is in safe hands and I know that you will do the right thing.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lysaaer","date":"2017-07-14T08:14:06.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This just sounds like Kat, Anivia and singed into one champs all the abilitys you said literally sound like you took it from them and tweaked it abit lol just let riot do the job ðŸ˜‚","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2017-07-14T15:29:41.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Literally every champion is a mix of other champions if you really want to call it that, but can you honestly say that the playstyle of Azir if there was his rework would be even remotely close to the playstyle of Singed, Katarina, or Anivia? :L Did you read the bit about how I justified why I chose those things, and how it goes towards his unique theme of being an emperor?
