It&#039;s just like ARAM to me. I remember back when they were both unsupported custom games, and then you made ARAM an actual queue and it was awesome! :D Could you please keep Dominion in custom games, so that people can play hide and seek, or made hide and seek a supported game mode with no control points, and stopping people from trolling? Or even making it so once a hider loses all their lives, they can DC without anything bad happening to them, and possibly even making a couple more items exclusively for seekers, to increase the number of people interested in that? I know there is a problem with resources, but come on, it mustn&#039;t be too much trouble simply keeping Dominion available for custom games. :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gesteppie","date":"2016-02-11T19:36:44.617+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"RIP Hide and Seek{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
