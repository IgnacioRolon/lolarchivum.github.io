I personally love playing as Fizz, but I agree that he feels very unfair to play against, but I thought of an idea which I think could be very nice! How about, instead of his E making him outright untargetable, it just makes him dodge all projectiles already in play! So for example, if a Varus wants to catch a fleeing Fizz, if Fizz reacts to the Varus ult with an E after it was cast, it will go under him harmlessly, so that Fizz still has that core aspect to him, but if the Varus knows Fizz is about to jump on him, if he reacts to the Fizz E, and ults Fizz just as he enters it, then the ult will hit him and snare him, giving Varus a fighting chance!\r\n\r\nThe counterplay to the Varus ult for Fizz would be something like, immediately hopping off the E to the side instead of directly jumping to Varus, and then Qing him. Anyway, I hope this idea helps! I think it&#039;ll mean that FIzz will be able to keep his defensive options for his E, but not so much his offensive options, which just feel unfair, because it stops people from defending against Fizz. I reckon this combined with a cooldown nerf on his E and extra clarity on his W damage could make Fizz bearable to play against without feeling unfair, while also keeping his fun elusive on his toes gameplay, where he can jump around his enemies a lot and do stuff! :D","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-30T11:39:10.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah Fizz is fine. (Coming from a person who doesn't play and is consistently pissed off by Fizz).\n\nHe is a high mobility slippery burst assassin. He is meant to be able to not be caught easily, much like Zed or LeBlanc. His win rate is a little high at like 51%, but that is just because he is common right now. As a squishy champion, he can't really do much when getting shut down. If he gets fed and has early CDR, he can be very frustrating. But if you lock him down straight after he combos someone it is pretty much a free kill.\n\nLots of champions can avoid fight changing abilities, Fizz can just do it easier, but with less reward. A Fizz can either play it good with his E in fights, or he can ran with his trident between his legs using E to dodge hooks. But once you get his E, his only reliable escape is gone.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-06-01T03:18:25.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No the problem is, it's impossible for certain champions to outplay his E, even on champs that require you to outplay the opponents to do well on them (e.g. Cass, with her, she's dead by the time Fizz has used his E and you can actually ult him.)\n\nAnd when you do, its cooldown is really short! I'd honestly be satisfied with a major nerf to the cooldown of his E. But still, I think the change I suggested would be good!","replies":[{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-06-01T08:19:29.038+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then don't pick Cass?","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-06-02T00:55:58.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's unnaceptable!

Will definitely need fleshing out. I imagine the coding for it will either be easy or insanely hard.\n\nOverall, a change like this needs to happen. His invulnerability has always been a subject of hate for years now. Saying this his invulnerability is a key portion of his kit and instead of taking it away maybe nerf it a bit i.e. only have 1 jump instead of 2 (he is way too mobile with 2 jumps, a q, flash, and protobelt) and/or drastically increase its cooldown (though I don't know what appropriate values could be used)","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-06-01T03:20:47.353+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the coding would have to be really smart. Maybe while Fizz is up on his pole, all projectiles cast have a switch flipped on them, and also while he's on his pole he's immune to all projectiles with that switch flipped. That way the extra information would only need to be done while he's up on his E, for half a second.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2016-06-01T03:53:26.485+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That actually seems quite intuitive.
