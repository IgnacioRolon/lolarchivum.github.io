Anyway, I would just like a meta where people accept that the marksman doesn't have to be bot lane, so that the day of Jungle Kog may rise! Mwuahahahah! (But for reals though, jg Kog, with the right team comp, works really well, because he can use devourer, and his clear is a lot better than you would think.)\n\nI may try that Yas lane some time. ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ScottyMcDavern","date":"2016-02-10T09:04:37.237+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You must of missed Imaqtpie playing Ezreal support last night :p","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T09:06:41.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":":O I can't really watch streams in any decent quality, net's too slow, dare I ask how it went?
