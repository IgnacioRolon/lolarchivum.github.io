Twice now, while I wasn&#039;t AFK, fully in lobby, trying to ban a champion, I didn&#039;t realise my teammate had already banned the champ, because for some reason the client&#039;s super super laggy for me, so when it doesn&#039;t show up as being banned it looks like it&#039;s just lagging like normal, and besides, it takes ages for me to search the champion I want to ban. Anyway, twice now I&#039;ve been kicked from a lobby because a team member already banned the champ I want to ban, and it&#039;s annoying. I get the annoying &quot;Oh you queue dodged you have to wait!&quot; thingy when I didn&#039;t even mean to queue dodge! &gt;:( It&#039;s so annoying! Please allow redundant bans! (Also for people who aren&#039;t paying attention and quickly ban their go to ban and barely get it but get cock blocked and kicked from the lobby.) {{sticker:sg-janna}}","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2018-02-24T07:10:03.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i've ran into this issue a few times before, because it takes about 5-10 seconds to select and ban a champion due to client lag, and it's just terrible when your forced to try and pick or ban something when the timer is on the low end.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2018-02-24T07:41:27.865+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yessss!!!!
