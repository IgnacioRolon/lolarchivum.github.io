Maybe I didn&#039;t tell you that I loved you enough. I figured you knew. Maybe that&#039;s what drove you mad.&quot;\r\n\t&lt;SILENCE HIM!&gt;\r\n\tI...\r\n\t&quot;look, At first I was so angry at you for leaving us, but now I honestly just miss you. Please come home. No one will yell at you. We&#039;ll just be glad you&#039;re back. All you need to do is leave this madness behind.&quot;\r\n\tMadness...?\r\n\t&quot;If there is some small part of you in there Veigar, please know that I do love you. I&#039;m your papa.

There's a constant race in the way the text is written that does so without becoming stale in the process. Interesting take on Veigar at what I perceive to be near the start of his descent to evil (following the acquisition of his powers and escape from noxus).\n\nThe absolute rush meant, in my opinion, the internal questioning kind of got lost. Veigar's self-doubt felt unfitting considering the way you wrote him near the end mostly because the contrast with his previous thoughts and unclear speaker meant it was hard to tell whether this was some sort of genuine self reflection, a voice in his head, or just some passing doubtful thought.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-07-10T09:19:37.785+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not really quite sure what you mean by that sorry.

I assume it's a smaller voice in Veigar's head, reminding him of things going wrong, but at the same time it could be indicating the fading voice of his dying father. It's just the weakness of this piece's narration style which forgoes stating who is saying what, but you can't change that without hurting the unique way this is written. Not sure how who exactly is saying that part could be made more clear.","replies":[{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-07-11T10:11:53.752+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh okay. Yeah, A concern of mine was that it might not be entirely clear all of the time, but I will say that the [] part is the real Veigar, the pre-prison version of him. He had been silenced for ages, but then that speech from the father sort of brought him back up very weakly, which is why he's mumbling at the end without being responded to.\n\nYeah, I think it would have been better as a comic tbh. Just writing as Veigar I didn't really see any room to put in much of an explanation of who was talking. Oh well.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"FranticFerret","date":"2016-07-10T04:19:40.751+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh, no! The indents at the start of each paragraph is lost!
