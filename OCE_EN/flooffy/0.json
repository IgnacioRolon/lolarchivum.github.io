Nothing weird, i was versing a Zed. But the problem came when he ulted me under tower, I used my W then i ulted myself, he got out of tower range then came back into range and and started to auto attack me under my tower but they tower didn't aggro onto him and he was able to auto attack me to death without having the tower hit him. Just wondering if this is known or not. If i haven't used enough detail please let me know and i will add as much as i can remember.","replies":[]}
