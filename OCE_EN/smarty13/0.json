You have to be in the top x% of players playing whichever champion in whichever role (they treat annie mid and annie support differently for example). Lucian is pretty popular champion\n\nIn this particular case I can definitely see your CS being your biggest downfall, with your games nearing an hour in length yet you having barely passed 200 CS. Work on getting that number to around 300+ in the same time frame as well as keeping your warding and team participation up and you should get an S grade.","replies":[]}]}
