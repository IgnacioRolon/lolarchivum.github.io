They are there for a sense of safety for the allied team, and a threat for the enemy team to have to plan around.\r\n\r\nSo why do I, and all of my friends, feel like after a certain point in the game, and I&#039;m talking 10-20 minutes in, not 50-60 minutes, that they fall off? Sure it might keep one squishy from trying anything on you under tower, but if there is even one other champ, it can be enough to allow a dive, even if that other champ isn&#039;t tanky. I feel there is inherent problem with how much damage towers do, how quickly they switch, and how slowly they fire the first shot. \r\n\r\nBefore I get too far in I want to say I like tower diving as a strategy, and when it&#039;s pulled off well, two squishy champs can do it, but at the moment I feel like 2 squishy champs can dive someone and get away with it far too easily, without having to worry about switching tower aggro.\r\n\r\nSo I&#039;ve got a few thoughts on what can make towers more punishing without being oppressive for the enemy team to do anything about, feel free to tell me that these ideas either wouldn&#039;t work, or are too strong, and maybe we can collectively come up with an idea to make towers a little stronger, without being OP.\r\n\r\n**1: Keep the starting tower damage, but make it ramp up faster/higher.**\r\nThis can be accomplished by either increasing the fire rate of the towers by an X amount, or by increasing the damage cap on them to make them truly punishing the longer you are under them. This would have to be tuned so that it wouldn&#039;t be the ultimate defense to stand next to a tower, but I feel like they need to have some damage increase.\r\n\r\n**2: When they switch to a champion, make it fire a shot immediately, regardless of when the last shot fired was.**\r\nLike it says on the can, make a tower fire a shot instantly when it locks onto a champion. this will discourage people stepping just into range to throw out damage, then backing off after the tower locks on, but before it can fire a shot. This will give people a chance to actually use the tower as a safe point when behind, instead of being pushed off every time they return to lane. It won&#039;t stop super long range poke, but that&#039;s why you bring those champs into the game, for their poke. It will also make tower diving more punishing unless actually planned for and executed properly, and give the defending player a better chance to fight off a sloppy dive.\r\n\r\n**3: Base tower lasers need a damage increase/ignore % armour.** Base tower Lasers, they look great, and the ramping damage visual effect looks really cool, so why do they tickle basically everyone? I personally have a problem with bruisers being too tanky and dealing too much damage, but that aside, If someone builds one armour+health item, laser towers seem to just give them a nice suntan, instead of burning a hole through their chest. When they were implemented, a tower that dealt continuous damage sounded great, until we saw it in game, and it deals less damage than the normal towers against anyone with that armour+health item I mentioned earlier. So either make them deal more damage, or make them ignore a % of armour, so that someone can&#039;t stand there and gain health for the first 5-10s the laser is on them.\r\n\r\nAgain, these are just suggestions, and any and all input is greatly desired, as I want to see how many people either agree or disagree with me about current tower damage and function. Lets spark a healthy discussion, and see if there is anything we can do, if something needs doing.","replies":[{"poster":"SummonerSquid","date":"2015-07-27T13:46:03.255+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There are a lot of consequences of buffing towers, but there's one that I can't overlook:\n\n**Increasing the game time**\n\nA snowballing team can almost ignore tower damage if they have a fed tank or assassin, which allows you to kill your opponents and go for the objectives afterwards. Tower diving is the primary snowballing mechanic for assassins and tanks in the mid-late game, because they have a difficult time attacking turrets or pushing waves (in general).\n\nYour argument is that towers become ineffective too early, but I disagree. At the mid-game mark (let's say 20 minutes) you need a primary tank to soak up turret damage, or you need to juggle the aggro carefully. If your tank's job in a dive is to soak turret damage, then I'd say that's balanced, but if they can do so with no consequences, I'd say that's unbalanced. In the cases of {{champion:57}}  and {{champion:12}} you could argue that towers do almost nothing. I'd agree with you here, and since those two are so popular in the meta, turrets seem ineffective if they use their ultimate abilities properly.\n\n**TL;DR**\nBy making towers stronger, you reduce the effectiveness of 2 classes simultaneously and increase game time by preventing dives.","replies":[{"poster":"NoNerf","date":"2015-07-27T15:56:31.706+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reducing the effectiveness of tanks is fine, considering how broken they are at the moment.
