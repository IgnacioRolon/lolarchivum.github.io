The new jungle tempo is going to be quite interesting, the plants are just ignorable, yes, Rengar seems damned OP and in need of a nerf, but something always ends up stupidly OP in these big shakeups, as long as he (and maybe Khazix) are back down to a regular level of utterly terrifying by next patch, I think it's all good.  Supports have item choice, which is a good thing.\n\nThe loss of tank junglers due to the loss of vision, and the power of assassins is a sad trend for the meta, as teamfights are likely to consist of 1-2 seconds of instagibbing each other before all over.  Again, when assassins and some of the more OP penetration (sorry, lethality) items are made a bit less lethal, we should have an interesting season.","replies":[]}]}
