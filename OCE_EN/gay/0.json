I think it's quite likely we move to a 10 ban system, though that's not guaranteed yet. Assuming we do go to 10 bans it's also possible Pro games and regular games might make the change at somewhat separated times (different workflows for draft matchmaking games versus tournament draft in custom games which is what Pro uses).\n\n>http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/99Oykczu-so-about-10-bans?comment=0005","replies":[]}]}
