And no matter how many times i report them they dont get fucken banned. Its ridiculous. You have even taken away the option &#039;Trolling&#039; from your report menu. I just would like a normal league game with normal teamate that say running down mid is the new meta. I dont know what you really can do but this is really getting ridiculous. I&#039;ve gotten so tilted just because 1 guy is trolling that it brought me down to b5 and i dont really know what to do. Trollers are ruining league #stoptrolling","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-01-18T11:34:16.350+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"its bronze, riot or anyone else in any other elo bracket doesn't give a fuck about bronze my man.\n\ni've seen multiple cases of feeders having at least 50 games of 20-40 deaths in each game before they even picked up on. one very recently posted here on the forum.\n\nevery promo series to date i have had a troll throw the at least 1 of the 3, sometimes 2 games for me.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-01-19T08:59:45.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only play ARAMs :P\nIt's just like league, but instead of tanks being the kings, it's fiddlesticks and every Yasuo ever feeds out his ass.\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-wink}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"magic558","date":"2017-01-18T20:49:59.374+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then how tf do i get out of elo hell then man.
