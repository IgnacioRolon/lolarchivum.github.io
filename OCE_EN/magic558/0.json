If you see or hear about another person breaking the rules, send us a ticket directly so we can investigate and take action if necessary. We know that players report publicly with the best intentions, but it often leads to a witchhunt, rarely resulting in a positive discussion. We'll be taking action against players who have violated rules, so please report these players correctly.\n\n>Moderators will be looking for the following:\n\n> * Posts that accuse others of being toxic players in-game\n* Posts accusing others of malicious activity\n* Posts that accuse others of cheating or using illegal services\n* Posts accusing others of trolling in the boards (there’s a report button for that)\n\n___\n\nThe primary reason for this rule is to prevent with-hunting of players. When it comes to innocent players the logic is rather obvious. In the case of those players being reported (named and shamed) that HAVE demonstrated a negative behaviour, discussing it is encouraged, as it gives community insight into what or why x isn’t allowed but witch hunting still has no place. \n\nIn cases like these naming and shaming only serves to create more negative behaviour (and hardly encourages reform in the negative players), which is hardly a favourable outcome.  It isn’t the place for “but they deserve it”, just as “they started it” is not a valid defense of negative behaviour in game or on boards.\n\nThis is the kind of thing you report in post game, or via a support ticket if you cannot report in post game for whatever reason. Reporting on boards does far more bad than good, hence the rule and hence the removal.","replies":[{"poster":"Istypuff","date":"2017-01-27T09:43:48.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you want the real reason why they input naming shaming rules.. Was due back when this game was pay to play. { Yes this game was pay to play.. IKR LOL!! }\n\nPeople would name and shame endlessly.. Riot had to stop it. \nTrying to keep the player base.\n\nBut now days. All Riot does is hide and use ambassador to post for them.. That way they cannot be blamed for saying it ","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-01-27T11:21:16.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To the best of my knowledge League was always free to play, but on launch had the options of a digital or physical collector's edition that got you skins like Black Alistar, but which were strictly OPTIONAL. Either way, whether it was pay to play or not is rather irrelevant to naming and shaming, their priorities as far as keeping players hasn't changed (keeping players happy is good, encouraging reform keeps players, keeping consistently negative players in the community makes the wider population unhappy, hence bans).\n\nThe reasons to stop naming and shaming are the same now, I'm not too sure how preventing it now counts as hiding when preventing it then didn't in your mind. \n\nThe volunteers exist because there aren't enough Rioters with enough time to answer everyone's questions on boards, especially hen those questions are ones which have been asked 1000 times before. We also exist as a link between the community in Riot, since we have direct contact with some of them we can pass along community concerns and the like where they might not otherwise see them.\n\nI'm also very unsure how the content of the OP would put blame on Riot, he was putting blame on the player intent feeding, you know the one responsible for his actions?","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
