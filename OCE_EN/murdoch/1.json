So there is no way it would be disclosed to any questionable sites.\r\n\r\nSo how did they manage to link this email address to my LoL account? I feel that sort of information could only have from Riot?\r\n\r\nFor the 3 years I&#039;ve had this email account I&#039;ve not had a single malicious email, purely because I ONLY ever disclose this email to websites I make purchases from....\r\n\r\nWould appreciate some feed back or suggestions","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-13T22:26:33.506+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThanks for letting us know - What was the subject of the email and what address did it claim to be coming from?\n\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Murdoch","date":"2015-10-13T22:40:06.396+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Subject\tMudanças na política de privacidade da Riot\nFrom\tLeague of Legends\nTo\txxxx\nReply-To\tLeagueofLegends.643vqn38z8.fdk6@email.riotgames.com\nDate\tToday 06:24\n\nI can grab a screen shot if you want, that's just the header details.
