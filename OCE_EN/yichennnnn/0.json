Back in 2013 the lunar revel ward skin had  the Chinese character \"蛇\" (snake) on the lanterns, which is totally awesome, because it was the year of snake. But the 2015 one had the same character on the lanterns and it does not make sense because it is year of goat/sheep/ram this year and we call it year of \"羊\".\r\n\r\nJust wondering if it is too late to change it?","replies":[{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-22T03:29:20.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was pretty odd that they had the Serpent Ward behind the Firecracker Ward.. Strange that they did that.\n\nIf they happen to release a year of the goat/ram/sheep ward skin, let's hope they change it ;)","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-02-20T09:56:53.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"probably cause it's the same ward skin? it's called the lantern of the serpent ward, it's not going to say goat/sheep/ram on it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-20T09:39:24.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"There is only the fire cracker ward skin.
