You cannot kite him as he runs faster than you and then knocks you back, slows you and chunks your HP by 40% on a 13s cooldown, and let's not forget that he regenerates half his HP on a low cooldown with zero counterplay as no toplaner will use ignite, as that's a noobtrap. So in order to beat VoliOPbear we must resort to using cancer like Quinn top and freelo like Lissandra. Which makes the game unfun for the other 9 people because they're worse than VoliOPbear. And then you have VoliOPbear's jungle sitting up in the bush, like %%%%ing vulture please! But that doesn't matter because your jungler just died to those goddamn birds who make VoliOPbear look like TrAshe.\n\nFunnily enough even after all this Riot refuses to nerf VoliOPbear, who makes this game amazingly unfun and makes me want to kill myself, rather than play toplane.","replies":[]}]}
