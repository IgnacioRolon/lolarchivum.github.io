So, I decided to pick Gangplank as ADC just to see how it would work out, because I thought that it might be okay considering he does a lot of AD damage and has that ranged Q. Anyway though, I kept up with Draven's CS by using my Q as much as possible, and grabbed myself some CDR boots. It would be a bit risky to just walk up and auto every CS, but that wasn't a big deal on Gangplank. My friend likes to do Yasuo bot, but can have trouble as he often misses CS to avoid harass.\r\nAnyway, although the beginning of the game was a bit hard, as soon as I got rolling I got rolling and like every Gangplank knows, Gangplank can kite similarly to a lot of ADCs.\r\nSo then I was legendary as Gangplank ADC. The end.\r\nWhat do you guys think of this though? Do you think it could fit into the meta?","replies":[{"poster":"SteelerKing","date":"2015-01-01T13:32:09.655+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC Gangplank is very fun especially when you build all around your Q doing more damage.\nEven though he can't one-shot people like he used to with insane crits anymore, his Q still packs quite a punch and you might still one-shot some squishies.\n\nIn any serious game silver ranked and beyond you will most likely fail as ADC GP however.\nWhich is simply due to the fact that you have nothing to bring to the table in a teamfight aside from that bit of Q, bit of E, bit of Ult (all minor stuff compared to the enemies ADC) and the fact that you can lure the enemies into wasting their CC on you. But even then how are you going to survive their CC if you built pure ADC? Chances are you will blow up without having done much.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2014-12-28T13:40:22.428+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"GP Support is better.\n\nSightstone, Sorcs, Liandry's, Thornmail, SV, Morello's.","replies":[{"poster":"Lnar","date":"2014-12-28T15:04:28.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"support critplank with clarity = gg\n\nunless they have sona or raka","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"TheTourist","date":"2014-12-28T12:25:20.538+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I doubt it really. It may work on some match ups kinda like a random yasuo ADC works but if they go anything ranged like Cait, corki etc and a hard poke support you'd be constantly under tower. The only benefit you have against them is your anti cc orange. Just my 2 cents. Then again TF jungle is coming back so who knows.","replies":[]}]}
