Their immaturity generally leads to them being quite mean/toxic in the way they act and interact with others. I'm not saying immaturity is the only factor or that it doesn't happen with adults but there are significantly more students who are misbehaved/toxic than adults, when talking percentages.\n\nSome do it due to immaturity, some do it because they think it's cool, some do it because it makes them feel better, some even do it to compensate for something they're unsatisfied with, and there's probably more factors, but the fact remains it's more common with younger individuals. Adults, who are generally more mature, are generally more capable of refraining from acting in such a manner.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2015-01-30T01:08:58.395+0000","up_votes":8,"down_votes":0,"body":"So what I am getting from this is you don't know when you are playing with high school/primary but you just **assume** a high % of toxic players you play with are high school/primary students?

Then link that age group to their acc, and check the toxicity level of that acc. Put results in a graph, and I bet the school kids would be the most toxic group. You could also ask for the average hours they play in the survey.\n\nI cant help but feel that the survey you mentioned might be biased. Even though I notice playing during school hours is almost always more fun, with more competent players, more willingness to win, and less \"freaking douchebags\".","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bookbash","date":"2015-01-30T06:56:28.888+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"HeartVine is correct. The reason is that kids are mollycoddled by the ways of the current society. But in the same token they are left free to the own **\"devices\"** (and the pun is intentional). The days of interacting with people outside of the home are dwindling.\nFor example: How many kids do you know that cannot even tie their own shoelaces at age 8? How many schools hire outside physical education tutoring so that they actually do some physical activity? A lot of them have never even climbed a tree (considered to be against OH&S). How many kids **don't** have a device in their hand on public transport?\nAnd so they act in an antisocial way, and do not know learn social interactions like past generations did. They also certainly cannot handle logic when it is dished up to them, because they are not interested for one reason, and do not know how to theorise for another. Theorising is simply beyond them. They just want that instant gratification, its what the society has taught them. They will make the same mistakes over and over again. And put it down to other people's faults. \nWhich brings us to league. I would guess that the majority of players in the game are bronze. Why? Because this is true for most elo(mmr) systems that rate sports. For example in chess 90% of players are in the bottom two tiers (under 1400 elo). And then quite a lot of these are kids because they love playing League in the holidays. So without having true statistics, I think you can just assume it. The other thing is that when you actually talk to them, they use texting shortcuts for actual language, and make many grammatical errors in the process.\n**I'm not saying that all kids are like this**, but in my experience the majority are. So now that school holidays are over, rest freer that the player in your game that could not listen to the rest of your team and ended up feeding, griefing or afking is most likely not going to be there.","replies":[]},{"poster":"OCE Yisus","date":"2015-01-31T06:24:58.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's the problem for  me and anyone who is living with their mom\n\nMum:PAUSE THE GAME AND GET DOWN HERE\n\nMe:I CANT PAUSE THE GAME MUM\n\nMum: IDGAF GIT DOWN HERE\n\nMe: fml well there goes my provisionals\n\nThis happened to me 4 times even though I was sure I had over 50 minutes game time, sadly all games were over 55 minutes, #dontpickkarma","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-31T06:38:04.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GalaxyGladious,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=E0hlP2j2,comment-id=0005,timestamp=2015-01-31T06:24:58.362+0000)\n>\n> Here's the problem for  me and anyone who is living with their mom\n> \n> Mum:PAUSE THE GAME AND GET DOWN HERE\n> \n> Me:I CANT PAUSE THE GAME MUM\n> \n> Mum: IDGAF GIT DOWN HERE\n> \n> Me: fml well there goes my provisionals\n> \n> This happened to me 4 times even though I was sure I had over 50 minutes game time, sadly all games were over 55 minutes, #dontpickkarma\n\nALWAYS.
