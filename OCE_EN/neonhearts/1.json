Disable any firewalls and/or antivirus applications that you may have running. These firewalls may block outbound and inbound League of Legends connections, causing some serious problems and preventing you from getting on the Rift! For help disabling your firewall(s), check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq3).\n> 3. Disable IPv6, as the League of Legends client is designed to work with IPv4. For help disabling IPv6, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4).\n> 4. Configure your DNS to use a public Domain Name System. For help configuring your DNS settings, check out [**this article**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq5).\n> 5.

Check for VPN and proxy usage. If necessary, [**reset your Internet Explorer settings**](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings). \n> 7. Disable IP Helper. To do this, open the start menu, search \"services\", and select \"Services.msc\" or \"Services\" (depending on operating system). Locate IP Helper, right-click on it, and select \"Properties\". On the properties page, select \"Startup type\" and select \"Disable\". Under \"Service status\", click on \"Stop\" and then apply the settings. \n> 8.
