The statistic could be KDA, CS, objective contribution vision providing critical CC and other figures.\r\n\r\nWin/Lose evaluation has a lot of limitations on solo queue. It start from ban pick phase. Player don&#039;t have the right to decide ohters pick. Even If it seems not winable, they don&#039;t have the right to refuse the game. It feel like force them to traped in the pitfall. But, If the evaluation is based on statistic, the unwise pick player will considering about the evaluating issues rather than pick a certain champion to adapt different scenario. \r\n\r\nAs we know that the game core is the competition of intelligence and skills. To win the game, players not only need to qualified proficient skill, but also need strategic view of the game. Experienced player would picture that the situation that helps the team to win. Laning phase, team fight and objective occupation are equal important. Do they have good initiate ability? What about range pressure? The weave clean, the CC, the defense and retreat capability. The people who think more should get more rewards than those don&#039;t.","replies":[{"poster":"raluca2","date":"2015-07-04T00:40:58.445+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If someone had a really good game, something like 17/0 with 300 CS, then the next game, they're going to be matched with people way of out their league.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sulbatamol","date":"2015-07-04T09:49:04.667+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"why dont u improve ur skill first. how bad rank system can be, faker will be always put himself in challenger tier.
