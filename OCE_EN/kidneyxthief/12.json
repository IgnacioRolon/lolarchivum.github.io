I&#039;m the only one on this connection and i&#039;m not downloading so I thought I would ask if anyone else is experiencing it?\r\n\r\nOn a lighter note, I have come back after two months of not playing and people generally seem to be nicer in games! I mean there are still a few assholes blaming everyone else for how shitty they are playing... but overall it&#039;s like a massive shift in attitude.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I&#039;ve just had a good couple of days.

I don't know how true this is but from what I have deduced 5pm-10pm seem to be the worst for unstable ping.
