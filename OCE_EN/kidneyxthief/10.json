Should be able to walk away from a game if your team mates show signs of being a problem. \nMaybe even have a report system that lets you select why you want to abandon the game, stuff like \n* x player being abusive \n* x player troll picked\nThen the acquired data can be used to judge if a players behavior is up to the code.
