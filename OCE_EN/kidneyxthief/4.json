But you don&#039;t because your not a plat smurf, you are full of shit and you are absolutely ridiculous if you think that everyone is stupid enough to buy that absolute bs.

People don't believe you are smurf normally, even my alkali average kda around 12/5/11 with his account. Smurf doesn't mean he can 1 V 5 all the time, he still need his team. There are many problems in bonze, front lanes don't know hot to engage, support does't know how to peel or crest vision, adc tried to be front lane and chase dying enemy miles deep when there is no vision, losing lanes can keep feeding with 10+ death each game, and the whole team except support doesn't want to buy wards or upgrade twinkles. \n\nI lost 2 or 3 games with his account as Akali, even I had full build 20+ kills. And ppl still blame me \" u said u are smurf, but you didn't carry\". Well, what else I could do?
