I have 650 wins in normals behind me but I only really do Mid+TOP + main support.\r\n\r\nShould I try to learn jungle and adc first? I've tried them before but honestly I suck at it and always thought being proficient in 3 of 5 roles in the game would be enough, however in ranked I'm not sure if this is the case.\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me any advice?","replies":[{"poster":"BladeSensual","date":"2015-03-24T10:50:43.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if ur trying to win at ranked, learn mid or adc. do not support because even if your teammate gets fed, they wont know what to do. dont go tanks or engagers. go the hard carries. for me my hard carries were rengar and nid. jg if u can play a late hard carry","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-03-25T16:24:54.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thing is I don't play a lot of hard carries. I play team orientated champs based on my  teams composition.... that rarely ends up being someone like Katarina or Riven who you can just mash keys to win with.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Antodara","date":"2015-03-24T10:11:02.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try and know every role. The only one I currently don't play is support. I hate it and it's boring, I also dislike ADC with a passion as it's the same thing, farm farm farm poke farm lol now I can auto champs dead in 2-3 attacks.\n\nI enjoy top/mid and jungler. I mostly play Vi and Warwick in jungle as they're fun to play there. Top I play Nasus, Darius, Cho'Gath, Trynd, Teemo and lately Pantheon. Mid I play Ahri, Lux, Annie, Yasuo, maybe occasionally Katarina.\n\nBasically, learn three roles to the point where you know what you're doing, and then know at least 2-3 champs for each role. You will be fine this way, as if your team is competent, they will pick based on what lanes you'd prefer and what the team can play.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-03-25T16:23:24.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I actually really enjoy support. I'm weird like that.... And I am confident in three roles. \n\nI kind of wish I Was better at jungler, I feel like I can't practice because if you are bad everyone just yells at you and calls you shit, and I am bad because I never get to practice. Catch 22 or something.\n\nThanks for the advice.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-24T05:45:27.778+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Explain to me why you run TP/Exhaust on everyone and also what your 2nd Rune page is all about and then I'll answer LOL","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-03-24T06:08:03.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Teleport so I never have to be out of lane early game and so I can quickly go to assist my team if they are in trouble, exhaust because I prefer it as a defensive option over flash. Just a preference, but in league of assassins it comes in handy.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-24T06:44:12.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah... i mean, i suppose not having a flash is only changing your playstyle and not hurting lane since you have the exh.\n\nTo answer your question, yes you can play ranked if you don't know all the roles. I would say learn and play simple champions that are super easy for the roles you aren't good with. Something like Warwick jg who just needs to W and Ult the enemy carry in order to be useful.\n\nAs for not being able to ADC, I think its fine since there are plenty of people out there who want to AD. Most mid mains AD if they dont get mid in my experience.\n\nJust make sure to tell your team in champ select your preferences and that your a sht ADC. Staying quiet s 5th pick if you can't fill is the worst thing in the world.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nyour 2nd rune page has armour marks and attack speed seals. Its really dumb. just FYI. Attack speed marks have more attack speed and armour seals have more armour. So it makes more sense to have all armour seals and all attack speed marks.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-03-24T06:58:35.298+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's my unfinished page that I don't use yet.
