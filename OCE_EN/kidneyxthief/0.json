Then get told I'm a noob because i have less kills than her.... then I explained the concept of supporting and that if I have a lot of kills I'm really not doing my job properly. No apparently it's because I'm a noob and shit. LOL\r\n\r\nThen I was like kat you really shouldn't go mid with brand he called it and in pvp duo mid just isn't done. To which she reply's I'm a noob and i need to think outside of the box because \"people will never expect it\".\r\n\r\nTried explaining the meta and how it doesn't happen and I just get abused.\r\n\r\nIs this the next generation of league players? \r\n\r\nThe arguments were so frustratingly nonsensical that it actually annoyed me but at the same time I was amused because of how mind bogglingly retarded they were with ZERO concept of how this game works.\r\n\r\nI'm lost for words. Level 30 players can be cunts but at least they know what they are doing lol\r\n\r\nI know this is a bit of a pointless post but it was just so weird\\annoying\\amusing. Anyone at low levels experience this kind of stuff?","replies":[{"poster":"Jakiron","date":"2014-12-01T14:08:11.371+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you rigidly follow the meta without questioning why you are a sheep.\n\nIf you've tried to break it and failed you have a reason to follow it.\n\nThese players are new to the game and learning how it works by doing it wrong.\n\nIt's the best way to learn, don't try to tell them what to do.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PainAlchemist","date":"2014-12-02T06:26:13.606+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have a friend who just reached lvl 30 who says this to his jungler when he ganks\n\"%%%% off this is my lane I'm SOLO TOP don't come in and try to ks me\"\nso i think its everywhere haha","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-12-02T00:08:49.122+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">Then I was like kat you really shouldn't go mid with brand he called it and in pvp duo mid just isn't done.\n\nI laughed, you're one of the people that enforce \"I called it first, it's mine\" when really the chat can be different for everyone as its done by ping, regardless judging from this you're worse than them, stop trying to enforce the meta.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2014-12-02T10:03:56.691+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know it can change and it's dependent on matchup.
