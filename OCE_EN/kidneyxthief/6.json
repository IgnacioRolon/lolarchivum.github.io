If people just put their heads down and play instead of talking shit we might actually stand a chance, but people never do that.  Even if i mute the rest of the team fights.\r\n\r\nSo frustrating -_-","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-23T09:35:43.320+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-23T09:36:06.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With who?","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-23T09:41:23.661+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Urgot Bot","date":"2015-04-23T09:52:38.724+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yes m8 i 100% lift everything","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Asia","date":"2015-04-23T09:14:50.632+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Welcome to solo queue, enjoy your stay","replies":[]},{"poster":"oops","date":"2015-04-23T09:41:48.908+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"yes i also get bad team mates in 100% of my matches making them impossible to win, when i carry and go 54/0/500 and still lose wtf, but then i sometimes carry and win, i should be challenger but my noob team mates make me lose 100% of matches gg","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-04-23T09:57:27.411+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Didn't say any of that. lol","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-23T10:00:06.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-04-23T10:19:28.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have NEVER said that.","replies":[{"poster":"jb3navides","date":"2015-04-23T10:44:49.842+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-04-24T07:28:40.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Only ever blame lag on skype ;-) Not in game.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-04-24T09:07:59.003+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Life is really hard as a support ... you almost get blamed for everything even when it is obviously the other players fault for example my teammate have really bad positioning and keeps tanking minions. The other thing which sucks about being a support is when you take CS you get blamed and if you killed an enemy u get blamed (more stupid thing is when i don't attempt to kill the enemy and teammate doesn't get the kill i get blamed again for bad supporting) which is just so annoying because :\n1) Support lacks gold to buy items \n2) Most Gold go to wards and visions and other support items such as {{item:2045}} \n3)Very team dependent \n4) No damage because no ($ for) damage items\n5)Gets negative comments for buying damage item on support \n5)When team refuse to teamwork and tries to solo because he/she thinks he/she is fed and ends up feeding and then i get blamed  (rarely happens but hey its still an issue)","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatzSoDraven","date":"2015-04-23T23:08:18.516+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeap, ranked sure does suck. Played this game where all my team were winning their lanes, then this Master Yi on our team started feeding, was 2/10 after 20mins.

Like bro, Yi fed a Teemo :s we ended up winning but that was one hard game...He even started blaming our supp! Because apparently they had been supporting me too much, like what?
