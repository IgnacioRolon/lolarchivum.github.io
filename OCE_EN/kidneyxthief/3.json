I&#039;m pretty new to ranked, I thought this was a myth... but it&#039;s happening almost all the time.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m never ever going to be able to climb at this rate. I main support , I can&#039;t really carry and even if was playing a carry it&#039;s really, really hard to come back when you have someone who is either completely absent or intentionally going out of their way to ruin their teams game.\r\n\r\nLast game there wasn&#039;t even a reason for it. No fight that started it off or anything, just &quot;Haha you guys are going to be so pissed off when I start feeding&quot;.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t even being to comprehend how going around intentionally ruining peoples days is fun. I guess I&#039;m just not a cunt.\r\n\r\nShould I just create another account and hope I do better in my promos by the time I get to level 30?","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-08-02T13:42:19.680+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"First thing to do is make sure you're not being mean, some things can sound nice but are very easily taken as a sarcastic remark. Second thing to do is not be a \"big boss\" as you said yourself you're new to ranked so more than likely don't know all the ways to win. A solid thing to do is not say anything even if someone provokes you. Call out what's happening and communicate what's happening so your team doesn't get crushed, ping objectives and see what your team say until you get a better idea, it'll help stop the flood of negative things you see. Also give's you some room to understand what the other 3 people not fighting are doing. If someone is acting aggressive towards you just mute them, don't go into chat like \"lol muted nerd\" because that just gives them a notification that they have to do something else to get back at you for whatever reason they have.\n\nI hoped I helped out at least a little bit! If you want to ask me anything reply with the question.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-08-03T02:55:31.721+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I mute people at the first sign of hostility as I can't be bothered dealing with toxicity. I also only ever say things like \"gj\" if someone gets a kill, I never harass people because from what I've seen as soon as people start bitching at each other the game pretty much always spirals into failure.\n\nPretty much the only way I communicate in game these days is to encourage people who are doing well or to tell the adc not to worry when they go all in and screw it up......and even then only if they say \"my bad\". lol.\n\nI'm not sure what else I can do. I'm trying so hard to stay positive but there just seem to be a lot of people out there intent on actively fucking up the game because they get off on ruining it for everyone else. I'm not even exaggerating here, a couple of months ago if I read someone saying exactly what I'm saying now I would probably be thinking that they were paranoid or making things out to be worse than they are.  \n\nAnyway. Thanks for the reply, I appreciate it.","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-08-03T06:47:17.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally recommend taking a break and playing another game and coming back to League of Legends after a week or two if you're having a hard time staying positive.\n\nOtherwise to learn why people behave the way they do take time to read the message they're saying from both sides after awhile you'll realize all the arguments that start a fight are quite alike so you should be able to think of a response that'll stop the fighting. Given that you've payed enough attention. The problem is learning this can take a pretty long time. 1 - 250+ games. It is completely based on how fast you learn.\n\nPlease note that this isn't the only way to win and have fun there is the option to ignore them and block out that fake distress in your mind, as in block people fighting just try your best and if you can pull off a few double kills or a triple kill they might just play to win the game and not go afk or feed the enemy team. \n\nThere is of course going to be that game every now and then where someone just doesn't want to win and will lose no matter what but everyone gets them and it sucks to get them in a row but eventually it'll stop and you'll be an amazing league of legends player after playing with such a massive disadvantage.\n\n\nSorry if you weren't looking for a big block of text but I want to try and help the best I can.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-02T23:22:40.145+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"at low elo, dont play support.
