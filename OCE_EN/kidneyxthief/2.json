I've stunned her and also knocked her back mid ult and it still goes off. It seems that you can't interrupt it. \r\n\r\nIs this the case? \r\n\r\nI swear when I play Lux my ult has been interrupted...

This was clarified because 2 people were next to each other and the one in the animation took no damage but the one next to him did.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2014-11-29T01:18:09.651+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks all... that clears it up.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Garens Harem","date":"2014-11-29T01:01:44.362+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cast times cannot be interrupted by crowd control effects.
