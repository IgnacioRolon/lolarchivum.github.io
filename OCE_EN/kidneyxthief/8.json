But mechanically, it is definitely the most difficult. There is more pressure on you to farm well, your positioning has to be on point and you will never be able to 100% master the ADC role without being able to kite/stutterstep well. Take the Jungler for instance, he doesn't have to worry about last hitting and he doesn't have a laning oponnent. But the jungle has turned into one of the most difficult roles, having to worry about jungle timers, enemy jungler movements, ganks, counter ganks, counter jungling, objective control etc.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2015-03-31T23:12:12.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seasons of Love,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=alGammON,comment-id=,timestamp=2015-03-31T14:32:40.297+0000)\n>\n> \n* **How is ADC a \"hard role\". **\n >\n* **I&#039;m used to all these foaming at the mouth ADC mains trash talking and saying how the rest of the team is shit if we are losing.

The rest of your abilities are basically utility.** \n > \n*  **Not only that you get babysat for the first 15 mins if not the entire game.**\n\n1) There's many different reasons which have been stated earlier in the comments such as positioning, farming, understanding the Champion and recognising the strength of your bot lane vs whatever you're facing. Yes, other jobs require positioning, farming and learning the Champions, but it's more of a make-or-break for ADCs. Top lanes and junglers need positioning to engage (usually), mid laners usually need positioning to get off a spell rotation, but ADCs need to be constantly positioning themselves properly since they're a) The squishiest, b) Have the highest damage output and c) Are naturally targeted the most heavily by the enemy team.\n\nAs for farming, mids and ADCs both need a lot of farm while top lane usually doesn't need as much since their items are generally cheaper.\n \n2) I can't deny that. ADCs usually have the worst attitudes from my experience because they believe that it's their job to carry the weight of the entire team on their backs by themselves, which isn't right.\n \n3) You do so much more than right click. As stated before, you need positioning, focusing, spell control, map awareness etc. A lot of ADCs' abilities are built for damage output mixed in with utility, and you need to learn how to use both properly if you want to succeed. e.g. Graves needs to know when to Q, which way to put it, and exactly how much damage it does. He needs to know where to put his smokescreen since it's a dead ability if used in the wrong spot. He needs to know when to dash for offense and when to dash for defense, and when to not dash at all. He needs to understand the size of his Ult (its hitbox is pretty small until the cone which you can't actually see), who and what it's going to hit and how much damage it's going to do. \n \nDon't want to write too much so I'll just leave Graves as the example.\n \n4) Supports aren't babysitters. They help you when you need it, and you aid them when required. Supports aren't the guardians of small children, they're the partners of marksmen. ADCs bring the damage, supports bring the utility to bot lane.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-04-02T07:39:41.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for the comprehensive response. I still believe however that almost all these points apply to ALL roles.

It's not unreasonable to assume you'd find it naturally easier to play as an ADC, your opponents being generally unskilled is just an added advantage. As has been mentioned there's a lot more to ADC than just right clicks but there's not exactly much need for skill in low ELO.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Risvik","date":"2015-03-31T19:17:21.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ADC is by far one of the more difficult roles to play. It may seem like it's right clicking but it has more mechanics behind it.\n\n1. The positioning - positioning is so important in a game especially in higher elo, or even Gold +\n\n2. Learning the mechanics of a champion - All ADC champions have different mechanics, e.g. Vayne relies heavily on mechanics and being able to evade \nenemies using her invisibility, whereas someone like Caitlyn relies heavily on outranging the enemy in a teamfight to avoid the full brute force of the enemy team.\n\n3. Learning what is safe and dangerous when laning and roaming - As an ADC you'll probably be the most focused target if not one of them. So you need to make sure you know exactly what is safe to do and what is risky, as these can usually be a game changer.","replies":[{"poster":"KidneyxThief","date":"2015-03-31T19:45:34.945+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All good points but to be fair that's something that ALL roles need to be able to do. It's certainly not exclusive to ADC although perhaps more important for them to be more proficient in...if they like being alive. (That is to all three points you made by the way). \n\nI get that there is more to it than right clicking. But seriously people need to stop making it out as if it requires an amount of skill that other roles don't require. \n\nI got a triple just by being in the vicinity of enemies during a team fight and it wasn't to do with MY skill as an ADC (which is woefully lacking) but due to my teams ability to keep them off of me while i just auto attacked.\n\nBut I get the credit because I got the kills? F*ck that.  Kind of going on a tangent here.
