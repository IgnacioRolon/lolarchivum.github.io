And the people who only play ranked instead of nomals because of the pick/ban system, would leave ranked, and ranked queue timers would increase as well.\n\nA lot of people want draft pick. \nQuite frankly i don't care much for draft pick myself, BUT, of late I have been craving it, just for the chance to play a few games without Lee sin and Darius and all the other obscenely over-picked champs.\nSo i am just as disappointed as everyone else that we cant have it.\n\nBut it beats having to wait 10 minutes every time you want to go into a game.","replies":[{"poster":"Arkangyle","date":"2017-05-02T04:58:10.909+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=JYE6kzEM,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2017-05-01T23:58:15.036+0000)\n>\n> Quite frankly i don&#x27;t care much for draft pick myself, BUT, of late I have been craving it, just for the chance to play a few games without Lee sin and Darius and all the other obscenely over-picked champs.\n\n\nTBH I think this is actually a benefit of norms. As a laner who intentionally bans specific matchups, finding myself in those matchups in norms forces me to learn how to play against them so that if it comes up in ranked, even though I don't like the matchup I do have some experience in trying to counter it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-05-02T05:03:16.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thats true, but it gets to a point where you don't want to vs Lee Sin's bs every single game, time and time again.\nBecause then you don't get to learn to play against other champions.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-05-02T11:29:37.841+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean, flex queue is literally draft queue, its the queue that doesn't matter because the teams have to be similar rank in flex so doesn't function well as a ranked teams on did for groups of mates with different skill levels, its literally draft pick and should be treated as such.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-05-01T23:00:18.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not gonna happen unfortunately.","replies":[]},{"poster":"LevvyLeviticus","date":"2017-05-01T22:11:34.294+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah, I would like that, too","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-05-02T12:33:48.553+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I want it solely because I hate calling lanes in chat, I would much rather queue like ranked as I have a much higher chance of actually getting my roles without having to argue with some kid on who called top first.","replies":[]}]}
