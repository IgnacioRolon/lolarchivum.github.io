What would like to see when you hover someone's name what would like it to look like? The tiers is good to have, and frequently played is good to have to see who would you like to play with in order to fill certain roles. Should we also like to have frequently played positions as well? Taking the information from ranked so we know who to invite to our ranked games? Not that we get people to invite two mid lanes and then there is tention in the group?\n\nI know that it is still bare bones and all. But the shape of the pop-out I would like to have that hext tech feel. Something mechanical and edgy. Something not so squared off maybe (I'm just throwing out some ideas).","replies":[]}]}
