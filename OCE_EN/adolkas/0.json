However, I wouldn&#039;t have minded it if it was consistent. My ping spikes up crazy high. Any where between 200 to amounts above 1000 ping. At this point, I don&#039;t know what to do, and lose so much because of it. How do I determine the issue? This has been happening even when my normal ping was 36-39 ms.

Before we start looking at factors that may be causing these issues on the ISP end, I'd first like to confirm that the issue does not lay on your end of things. Can you try as many solutions as you can that are provided in the [**Troubleshooting Connection Issues**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues) Riot Games Support article?\n\nIf those solutions don't work, let's start looking into the diagnostics and see where the issue may be originating. To do this, we'll need you to provide some information for us: \n\n1. Confirmation that you've tried the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article\n2. ISP that you're using\n3. Region and/or State\n4. Trace Route (Tracert) - If you're unsure how to do this, check out [**this guide**](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752674-Network-System-and-League-of-Legends-Logs#wq2)\n5.

However, the problem is that I am a 17 year old teen that is still going to school and so I live with my family. Because my parents do not care for new technology, their pc can on be supported by a direct wired connection. Because of this, the modem is placed in their room upstairs while my room is downstairs and they are unwilling to get a larger cable that runs from upstairs to downstairs. So I need wireless options.\n\n1.  Yes I have tried to the solutions in the Troubleshooting Connection Issues article\n2. Spark\n3. Auckland, New Zealand\n4.

Otherwise it may have occured multiple times in a single match and stay for up to 2-5 minutes at a time. It is hard to say how often/how bad as it is difficult to see a pattern. \n\n6. Sorry, I will get back to you with the Trace Route (Tracert) when i know how to link it.\n\nThank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-16T23:19:15.542+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're looking for a wireless option for ethernet, I have your solution!
