I stumbled across a Kiwi gent passing on Jungling skills and pre game planning, and that advice is golden.   MWAORRRR PLEASE.....\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve grasped some terms like below, but please add many more and or lead us noobs to a beginners guide to the game.{{summoner:4}} \r\n\r\nEg. The term &quot; ADC &quot; - &quot;Attack Damage Carry&quot;, pretty obvious &quot;Attack Damage&quot; - refers to the build and Champs skills, but &quot;Carry&quot;... What does this refer too?     Alot of us are noobs to this, not Smurfs or rerolls.   So is there a area that can educate us before we travel out there into the game world, and avoid getting abused for not knowing?\r\n\r\n&quot;Smurf&quot; accounts or as I know them Rerolls - I get why people to them.   Make new accounts and start all over, as a player, you now have alot of experience in the Pvp arena but basically you make these accounts to improve your stats.   But unfortunately at the expense of all the noobs out there.   You crucify new players and make them want to leave the game, whilst floating your ego&#039;s....is this right or fair?\r\nYou all decide.   \r\n\r\nJungler - the player that starts not on a lane, with Jungling skills and masteries and Runes etc allowing them to lvl up and get equipment from the Jungle monsters. \r\n\r\nMeta - No fn idea yet i hear it all the time.\r\n\r\nSupport - I guess its a champ not best at Ganking a enemy Champ, but is a team based Champ that boosts your guys to make them more effective.\r\nBut honestly, i have no idea.\r\n\r\nIs there a guide to why you take &quot;X&quot; item for this reason as it does &quot;Blah&quot; etc etc on the forums?\r\n&quot;Eg {{item:3301}} For a Support, as you want your lane partner to kill minions, boosting him along faster, whilst you also gain a benefit from them doing this.&quot;\r\n\r\nSorry it maybe very obvious and simple to others, but there is many out there too intimidated to ask for this type of game knowledge or assistance.\r\n\r\nAlso if you wish to open any &quot;Known Strategy&quot; and it&#039;s benefits etc, why you do &quot;X&quot; with &quot;Said Champ&quot;.  Please add.\r\n\r\nTy for your time and any help/advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nAnArtillerySpecialist","replies":[{"poster":"Katsprky","date":"2015-04-27T00:25:19.434+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If this is the case I'll put up a bit of information in a little bit (it takes time to think things through.)

Wrong use of the term \"trolling\". Usually means someone who intentionally annoys/inconveniences others in various ways.\n\n> The term \" ADC \" - \"Attack Damage Carry\", pretty obvious \"Attack Damage\" - refers to the build and Champs skills, but \"Carry\"... What does this refer too?\n\nThe \"carry\" refers to a champion that is designed to deal lots of damage, essentially carrying the game. Champs like Vayne, Ezreal, Kalista are ADCs and champs like Syndra, Fizz, Ziggs are APCs.\n\n> \"Smurf\" accounts\n\nI feel like you have a misunderstanding of what a smurf account actually is. There is nothing wrong with a smurf account in itself but there are a lot of individuals that use them in inappropriate ways that give smurfs a bad image, essentially a few bad apples ruin the bunch. It's not about intentionally versing lower skilled players, it's just another account to use. I have a couple smurfs not because I want to verse lower skilled people but because I want different champs on each, as I play a lot of ARAM, in order to experience more champions than I would just by having one.\n\n> Meta\n\nThis generally refers to the commonly accepted way to play the game. Things like positions (Marksman and Support bot, Tank/Fighter top, Mage/Assassin mid, Fighter/Assassin Jungle I think), using specific champions in specific positions (such as Vayne/Sivir ADC I think is current) and Pick/Call order. That mentioned\n\n> Pick/Call order\n\nCall order is whoever calls first has most right to the position and is only accepted in non-draft pick modes. Pick order, using draft pick as a basis, is whoever picks first has more right to a role. Since some people pick at the same time it's up to those individuals to sort out who gets what role. One thing to keep in mind is that Pick order is ALWAYS superior to Call order, Riot even officially backs Pick order over Call order.\n\n> Support\n\nWell this actually has two meanings, being a Role **and** Position, but it's most often referred to as a position. Generally champions that will \"support\" their team mates, usually by means of utility (heals, move speed/attack speed buffs, shields etc.)\n\n> Is there a guide to why you take \"X\" item for this reason as it does \"Blah\" etc etc on the forums?\n\nNot on the forums (at least not on OCE). Your best bet is to use google to find guides for specific champs as they usually differ in significant ways.","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-04-17T10:39:05.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Now that is a awesome start to my questions, but if you know of any more terms, please throw them in.\nThanks for the help,  it does make it a little easier to understand,  when players start getting Aggro'd at when we have no idea to what they asked because its like Piglatin to some of us...","replies":[]}]}]}
