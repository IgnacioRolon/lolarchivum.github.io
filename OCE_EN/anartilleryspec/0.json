Well we find ourselves playing in &quot;Player vs AI&quot; until we can go back/start in PvP.   \r\nWell the problem springing up more and more, is &quot;baddies&quot; or &quot;scrub lords&quot; that are using &quot;Bot Scripts&quot; to level up in this arena.   They are too fn lazy to play the game normally, I don&#039;t get it, don&#039;t people play this game for fun or to actually learn/improve their skills???\r\n\r\nSo can we get added in that arena a &quot;Offense Selection&quot; of &quot;Bot Script user&quot;?\r\nThese scrubs are pretty obvious, the champion attaches itself to a friendly and hovers around them auto cycling through abilities.   Then when you teleport, they go attach themselves to the next player and &quot;hover&quot; around them.   Pity we can&#039;t &quot;Name and Shame&quot; these scrub lords.  (Against the Eula probably)\r\n\r\nI have only now been playing roughly 1 month and come across 8 of them....I feel sorry for the long timers at the game...\r\nSeriously isn&#039;t there something we can actually do?\r\nIn my last competitive game, there is replays so you can attach to a offense and the players get banned or the account gets deleted.   this game doesn&#039;t have that feature(mainly due to scrubs levelling accounts then selling them)","replies":[{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2015-04-27T00:33:44.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Just play normals... you learn nothing decimating bots.","replies":[{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T03:25:14.794+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Sackboy,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Rd1GdLvd,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-04-27T00:33:44.656+0000)\n>\n> Just play normals... you learn nothing decimating bots.\n\nyou learn that basics of how to ignore dragon and feed","replies":[{"poster":"AnArtillerySpec","date":"2015-04-27T09:30:24.692+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Or as stated, you learn how the Champ generally works.

Lvl 2 runes vs lvl 3 runes plus 5 masteries doesn't sound much, but it is. but thats a issue out of my control)  \n85 takedowns and  1025 minions destroyed means an average per game is - \n17 take downs and 205 CS.....\nIt was disheartening to play and contribute to a fight, but still get spanked.   I felt it was my failure with the Champs use that did it, but then being only 20% of the team, really wasn't just my fault.   \nSo going to bots to \"Get Gud\" or in my case - \"get better\" with a champ makes a huge diff in confidence.\n\nA FYI average stats vs AI for me goes a little like this.\n20 take downs and 108 cs.   I get a 3 and if lucky a 4 item build made before the game is over, plus I get a bit of practice with team fighting, reading the mini map, keeping tabs on where the enemy champs are.   Practice jungling, what champs easily do it vs struggles, like I learnt some champs are really good junglers without the need of someone Aggroing/Leashing 1st.   Plus the equip a Jungler uses helps etc, etc, etc.\nSo vs AI this helps at getting it right, plus the timing for minion kills etc is very good to work out to be a efficient team member.   Because 1 player doesn't win a fight,  but they help the other 5 win.\n\nAlso, _**I WILL NOT BE GOING INTO RANKED GAMES**_....until I know what the hell I'm doing lol.\nBut thanks for the early warning lol.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-27T00:37:01.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"560 bot wins, i learnt how it felt to win","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-04-28T02:01:46.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"still better than normals, at least you can ALWAYS carry to victory on bots. 1st game evelynn on bots i had to get mejais AND occult sword to carry.....ON AN EVELYNN.... the final score was just 56-40 and the shitty bots took 7 towers and i think 2 inhibs. moral of the story dont play evelynn or a wimpy support like janna or nami on bots in case you have to carry your shitty 12 year old bot-ass teammates","replies":[]},{"poster":"skippy82","date":"2015-04-27T04:31:20.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's an issue in ARAM too :/","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-04-27T00:38:24.981+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much what Sackboy said.
