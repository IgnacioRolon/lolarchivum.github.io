My smurf was just banned (this account I am posting from) for 3rd party software. I solely play flex on this account for fun and have been winning close to 100% of my games. I theorize the enemy team has been reporting me en masse which has triggered some riot bot to flag my account.\n\nThis combined with the account having an exorbitant winrate, LB's gunblade lich and Illaoi with stoneplate is extremely good vs gold and under, has garnered my ban. https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=Flaming%20Meat . Was my first account, kinda really sucks to lose so much history.\n\nP.S No prior suspensions, no prior chat restrictions, zero since season 2 when I made it. I sent a report ticket and got an automated response, I sent a reply back and will post the results here.\n\nP.P.S I started trying to rank this account up in line with my main in master since my friends are hard stuck bronze since last season so I cant play ranked with them anyways.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:44:16.930+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reports do not matter if the behaviour does not exist. A report is only a flag. If you were banned for cheats it's because cheats were detected on the account, not because you were being reported. Either you shared the account with someone who used cheats or the account was compromised.\n\nIn the case of the first, you aren't going to get the account back.\n\nIn the case of the second, continue with your ticket. They will ask you to secure your account (change your PW) and will ask you a whole bunch of ownership verification questions. Once the account is secure and ownership is confirmed they'll give the account back.\n\nPrior punishments are irrelevant, cheats/scripts are an instant perma ban.","replies":[{"poster":"Flaming Meat","date":"2017-05-12T15:53:53.780+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for replying, I was panic looking over your posts and seeing if there was any information I was missing from the ticket I sent. I assumed they saw that I had had my account compromised a few months prior but it was recovered through support. At the time all I saw that was malicious was a purchase of teemo and warwick as well as a bunch of gp10 runes, however it is certainly possible that they tried to get it banned in any way possible and played a match or two on it without me seeing in the history (hence the 'troll' purchases of teemo and ww). This is certainly possible as the source of my ban, but I am still skeptical of the foolproofness of accounts being flagged and banned by bots.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-05-12T15:58:04.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The cheat detection is by far the most accurate. I'm not saying that false positives don't happen, because they do, but very VERY rarely. We get a lot of posts like these every time a ban wave goes out, but that doesn't mean there are a lot of false positives, it usually just means the owner was unaware of cheats being used on the account (for one reason or another) or is just straight up lying to try and get the account back, not that that has ever worked.\n\nJust follow through with your ticket and let me know if you have any troubles and I'll do what I can to help out.","replies":[{"poster":"MalçolmTurnbull","date":"2017-05-13T02:55:31.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just for an update, I got unbanned.
