The systems they have put in place to punish toxic players just screw everyone, and the only reason players are so toxic is because this game is sub par and poorly supported unless you are in the top 1% and making riot money.  Plenty of quality games on the market that put this 2d 90's  looking hack to shame. Venture forth and try some quality titles other than enslaving yourself to this pointless carrot chase of a game.","replies":[{"poster":"paul  b1art","date":"2017-08-29T23:55:17.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oh yeah i know! if you aren't pro or a youtuber they dont care and i usually only play league with friends(because his laptop cant run anything else) but even that is looking like a no go these days.","replies":[]}]}]}
