They tested various different options including, picking two roles and opting out of one, but the result was simply that too many people were opting out of support so there was no real benefit.\n\nMy advice is to either find a support to duo/flex with, or learn the role well enough that you can go even most games. Learning support will give you good insight into the mechanics anyway, if you're an ADC main it'll help you in particular (better understanding of what the enemy support is thinking and what they might do at a given moment).","replies":[{"poster":"paul  b1art","date":"2018-03-20T04:08:17.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support isn't the issue here. It's about all roles going into a ranked game and playing to win to improve and climb you NEED to play your best role. Going into a ranked game when you've been auto filled to a role you are simply just not comfortable is a huge disadvantage. I would rather wait then have myself or someone on my team get stuck playing a role that they wont or cant do their best in. For norms i think autofill is ok but not ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-20T04:58:12.495+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Support *is* the problem because the population of supp mains and supp seconds is too low. The alternative to autofill is queues as long as a whole game (if not longer). Riot will never be able to please everyone and this is the middle ground they have chosen. It keeps queue times short enough for people who only get to play a few games a day (the majority) but also leave options to ensure your main role for key games (autofill protection).\n\nIf queue times were 30+ minutes barely anyone would play ranked, which would drop the population even more, which would make queue times longer and so on and so forth.","replies":[{"poster":"paul  b1art","date":"2018-05-04T04:40:36.657+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support isnt the issue! I've had people on my team get auto filled to top and adc and even jg and say that they are no good at playing those roles and because everyone else got their main roles no one wants to swap! BECUASE WE WANT TO DO OUR BEST! getting auto filled into ANY role you aren't comfortable with in ranked is shit. i'd rather wait 30 minutes to get a game were everyone is comfortable with their roles, then waste 30 minutes playing a losing game because someone got auto filled into a role they can not play.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
