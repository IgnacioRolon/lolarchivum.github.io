I have checked in the store skins section, and yes I have unchecked and checked the owned boxes. They are just missing lol!\r\n**BUT, I am still able to use them in-game. ** So it&#039;s not THAT big of a deal. Just worried that they might go missing from the champion select screen too one day.\r\n\r\nSo, after a long night of checking each Profile/Champion tab, and then going into a custom games champion selection, I have comprised a list of legacy skins that are not displaying in the Profile/Champion tab, but that I am 100% sure that I own.\r\n\r\nTWO things that I&#039;ve noticed are:\r\n1. Not ALL legacy skins are missing! Only the ones that are:\r\n2. Part of the upcoming sales this Month (Snowdown/Snowstorm)\r\n\r\nThe skins that are missing from my Profile/Champions tab are:\r\n* Matador Alistar, Queen Ashe, Safari Caitlyn, Mr. Mundoverse, Executioner Mundo, Fiddle Me Timbers, Dark Candy Fiddlesticks, Toy Soldier GP, Desert Trooper Garen, Caterpillar Kog&#039;Maw, Sonoran Kog&#039;Maw, Defender Leona, Exiled Morgana, Lollipoppy, Molten Rammus, Frozen Shen, Hextech Sion, Badger Teemo, Firefighter Tristana, Guerilla Tristana, The Magnificent TF, Vandal Twitch, Butcher Urgot, Baron Von Veigar, Bad Santa Veigar, Viscero Xin Zhao, Winged Hussar Xin Zhao.\r\n\r\nThat&#039;s quite a few, and they have that one thing in common, except lollipoppy maybe (I cant find her on either sale list)\r\n\r\nLike I said before, not that big of a deal, since I&#039;m still able to use them, but it&#039;ll just be nice to see them in the profile tab so that I can show them off to friends. A lot of money has been put into these skins through store and mystery gifting, so to be able to display them would be nice. Not sure if it&#039;s a bug with the upcoming sales or whatnot.\r\n\r\n**Anyway, I know how to take screenshots, but I&#039;m not familiar with imgur and all that, so if someone is willing to tell me in steps, I&#039;ll be glad to post some.**\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and hopefully it&#039;ll be fixed soon. And check your skins!\r\n\r\nPM.","replies":[{"poster":"Akiru","date":"2015-12-15T04:58:22.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, I was just thinking the same thing.
