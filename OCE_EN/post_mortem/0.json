Lately I have been playing a lot of ARAM games, as they are faster, and noticed that in my most recent games there are a lot of questionable summoners. \r\nThey seem to have something in common:\r\n-Their names have two words and end in the letter Z\r\n-They always take Mark/Ghost\r\n-They have no masteries\r\n-They always just buy recommended items\r\n-They FEED, as in they just walk straight down the lane, and auto-attack the first encounter till they die.\r\n\r\nLast several games has been a matter of &quot;please no bot...damn...i hope they have one on the enemy team...yay!&quot;\r\nIt is really ruining this game for me, and i&#039;m sure plenty others. I don&#039;t know what this is called exactly, but it doesn&#039;t seem fair for other players for sure. \r\nFor now, all we can do is report these &quot;players&quot;, and hope for the best out of the OCE server. A few names that I have taken note of are:\r\n- WinteraMerleZ\r\n- SwordaValentineZ\r\n- BuckaMosesZ\r\n- MoonaTabZ\r\n- DellaTabZ\r\n- SitaffaBrandonZ\r\n- KingaJackZ\r\n- WinteraMerleZ (AGAIN)\r\n- ArightaWarnerZ\r\n- Laelavinkol (DIfferent to the other names, but did the same thing, TWICE)\r\n\r\nI&#039;m really thankful for the time you take to read this, and I hope that something positive comes from it.\r\nMany thanks,\r\nPost Mortem (OCE)","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2015-11-16T03:28:57.557+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the report. Please continue to send tickets in if you suspect any accounts of botting.\n\nWe do regularly check for and permaban bots as we find them, and are working on doing a better job at this to prevent them from impacting as many games as possible.","replies":[{"poster":"MrSparkle91","date":"2015-12-27T03:11:41.040+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is not a solution, either temporary or permanent.\nI've been dealing with these things for roughly a year now, and lets say every time I play an ARAM game I have to submit a ticket. I would be spending more time describing tickets that I would playing the freaking game!\nThe solution, to me, is simple: Change the reporting system in ARAM to reflect the system used in SR. All this means is that _when you report a player on SR they seem to be removed from your matchmaking pool._ This is not the case in ARAM and we are forced to either play a losing game or cop a leaverbuster punishment. I obviously don't know how script writing works, or if you can even combat an issue like this on such a level, but for the love of all that is holy - when I report the _same account three times in three days_, **TAKE THEM OUT OF MY MATCH MAKING POOL!** Reporting these accounts seems to count for nothing, so why the hell would I waste even more time submitting a ticket?\n\nAlso just to confirm/build on OP's name theory: \nI found that in the beginning the ~nameZ~ were always bots, but then it evolved and have my own theory about how to identify bots just like the last name on that list there. So far we have\nName always ending in Z (evolved to being a one word name, not actually being an English word and therefore being a closer chance to use the name in an automation)\nNo masteries (I assume either incorrect or no runes at all)\nLaid out weapon choices (at first just recommended > evolved to all tank items) and summoner spells. \n\nI have now spent about an hour of my time updating and reporting on these forums. If you expect me to now write a ticket or three, I know where you can stick them...","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Blood Fest","date":"2015-11-16T09:03:47.577+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i ran into dozen theses bots tonight all in late 20s how are they getting level 28 without ban?","replies":[]}]}
