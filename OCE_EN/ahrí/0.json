Are u hurt?&rdquo; Asked lamb \r\n&ldquo;Arghh she is strong lamb&rdquo;, wolf said in a growling manner \r\n&ldquo;How are you able to hurt my dear wolf I may ask?&rdquo; said lamb \r\nThe woman replies with a grin on her face \r\n&ldquo;I feel she is angry wolf. Speak, wanderer. what is your name?&rdquo; \r\nThe woman replies with &ldquo;my name is Aswin. what is yours?&rdquo;\r\nLamb replies with &ldquo;I am lamb and this is wolf, but we are known by kindred&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Lamb can I play chase the Aswin-thing again&rdquo; with great excitement \r\n&ldquo;We shall ask dear wolf&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;Aswin! would you prefer wolfs chase or my arrow?

The bandit swiftly attacks her soon after, she although parry&rsquo;s his attack, but pushes to knock him off balance. The push of her might causes the bandit to stagger back and trip, all the bandits become suddenly nervous. \r\n&ldquo;let&rsquo;s just take what you can and go!&rdquo; \r\nAs they try to take what they can from her companions, she forces them away with the swing of her blade. One bandit is able to grab her cloak and quiver, she swings her sword only for the bandit to dodge.\r\nWith the bandits fleeing away, she too flees the jungle swiftly \r\n&ldquo;what shall we do now lamb?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;nobody knows wolf&rdquo;\r\nAs lamb walks past the wanderers, she stops to pick up Aswins cloak.\r\n&ldquo;looks interesting lamb&rdquo;\r\nthey then continue walking through the forest. Walking in the forest they come across an abnormally large tree with old carvings and leaves covering the ground \r\n&ldquo;what is it lamb&rdquo; said wolf \r\n&ldquo;Let us find out dear wolf&rdquo; lamb replies\r\nAs lamb inspected the tree wolf asks &ldquo;can I eat it&rdquo;\r\nthe tree shakes smoothly and softly in the gentle wind \r\n&ldquo;what new shall we encounter here dear wolf&rdquo; lamb whispered to wolf\r\nWith the touch of a hand from lamb, wolf sniffs and investigates the tree \r\n&ldquo;this smells old lamb&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;yet could be so wise wolf&rdquo; lamb replies\r\n Leaves of all colours float and fall to the ground\r\n&ldquo;ever so calmly wolf. That is this tree&rsquo;s purpose&rdquo; said lamb peacefully\r\nThe fall endlessly on and over lamb and wolf. Trapping the two, lamb waits patiently while wolf struggles and tussles. \r\nAfter moments, a gust of wind blows the leaves away. Up past the branches, the leaves fly out of sight. Lamb, captivated by the beauty of nature she stares to the sky\r\n&ldquo;lamb, what have we encountered?&rdquo; \r\nShe looks at wolf and sees his face turned to the wood of the elder&rsquo;s tree. His horns grown, and his wound healed.\r\n&ldquo;may what has happened to you dear wolf, your body flows with the leaves of the wind&rdquo;\r\nWolf turns to see his tail flowing of the elder leaves \r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the only one lamb&rdquo; wolf said staring at lamb\r\nLamb sees that she too has changed. Her main turned to leaves and her bow turned to the wood of the elder tree.\r\n&ldquo;beautiful isn&rsquo;t it wolf&rdquo; lamb said graciously \r\n&ldquo;would anyone still recognise us lamb?&rdquo; said wolf \r\n&ldquo;maybe so wolf&rdquo;\r\nWolf grows and says&rdquo; can we play chase and bite to bits again lamb?&rdquo;\r\n&ldquo;we shall go now wolf&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nWord count: 1500\r\nThis story had much inspiration from the art of &ldquo;Vega colours&rdquo; (I am not completely sure of this)\r\nBut this art design and skin, I would love to see in game.
