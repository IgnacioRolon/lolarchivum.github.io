When old inactive low level accounts that don't have immunity have their name wiped so they're available for others to use or create?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-04T10:48:56.216+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought it was just when an account becomes six months unused.\n\nOn the [support page](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201751914-Summoner-Name-Clean-Up-), it says\n>    Levels 1-6: 6 months of inactivity immunity\n    Level 12: 1 year of immunity\n    Level 20: 1 year, 8 months of immunity\n    Level 30: 2 years, 6 months of immunity\n\nso I guess it depends on your level.
