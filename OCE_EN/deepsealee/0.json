Is this unwise?\n\nI'll do some dot points\n\n- as a support you don't take cs UNLESS your adc isn't in lane and the tower would otherwise kill them, which is when it's ok for the sup to take them as it's not losing your adc gold.\n\n- You get gold from your support item (the coin / shield / spellthing) which grant you gold based on their description \n\n- You shouldn't use mana unless you're trying to achieve something in lane, try auto attacking the enemy to poke down their health before using mana\n\n- As a support you need to build specifically to SUPPORT, just remember that.\n\n- Don't ever get attack speed on zyra, you need primarily AP to deal damage.\n\n- on zyra get {{item:3098}} not {{item:3069}} (she's an aggressive support, coin is more for passive play)\n\n- boots should almost always be {{item:3117}} on support\n\n- don't save gold, your general build should be (to start the game off);\n\n{{item:3303}} {{item:2003}} {{item:2003}} {{item:2004}} {{item:2004}}  {{item:3340}} \n\nfirst time you go back to base have atleast 800 gold\n\npurchase {{item:2049}}  and also sell your {{item:3340}} and buy {{item:3341}} (because you have infinite wards now)\n\nif you also have the gold purchase boots or upgrade your support item ect.","replies":[{"poster":"deepsealee","date":"2015-01-20T04:40:50.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!

To my delight, taking a gold generating item really, really does make a difference in terms of not hitting the minions myself. I really didn't know that those gold generating items were truly that useful. When you just read numbers and stats, you just don't understand what an item will really do for you until you use it. I've definitely improved even just over the last two days. Thank you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2015-01-18T09:40:44.321+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"With all of the other advice in mind, you are gonna have a lot of trouble with adcs getting angry at you for taking cs because any plants you summon will probably aggro onto the minions. When this happens, just ignore them and try to position your plants more carefully. \n\nZyra support takes ages to learn and a lot of skill to play well, so keep at it and good luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"deepsealee","date":"2015-01-19T11:11:07.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. Yes, I def find that my plants can unintentionally do that so I've been trying to hold back on planting seeds when I can. It's definitely hard though to figure out in which cases seeds are necessary and in which cases they are not. Sometimes when I plant seeds in my R (activated by my Q) they just keep on firing and firing and sometimes take away someone else's kill :( . I usually try to tell whomever I'm playing with that if something like that happens it is not on purpose and I'm still learning...Some people get it and some don't.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"deepsealee","date":"2015-01-17T12:26:10.714+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, thank you all so much for the advise!

They build a support item that generates gold. Either {{item:3301}} {{item:3302}} {{item:3303}}\nYou also take the gold generation masteries that are in the \"Utility\" Tree.\nSupports aren't meant to buy \"good items\", thats why  they are supports. They are there to provide help to the team through CC (like stuns,roots etc) and keep their team alive or catch the enemy so the team can kill them.\n\nSupport Zyra is one of the supports that builds damage rather then stuff that helps the team.\n\nWhat you should build is: Mobility Boots or Sorcer Shoes, Support item (seen above), Sightstone (not needed when playing bots), You can then build damage. Something like, Liandries, Rabadon Deathcap, Twin Shadows, maybe a Banner of Command if you really want to.\nIf you really have trouble with running out of mana, build a tear first item {{item:3070}}\n\n{{item:3117}} {{item:3092}} {{item:2049}} {{item:3023}}  {{item:3151}} {{item:3089}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-17T12:06:44.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you dont EVER need attack speed on zyra....thats why your build was criticized...","replies":[]}]}
