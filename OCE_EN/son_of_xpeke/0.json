Now its finally working now xD BUT... I got lower priority queue of 10 mins for the 'AFK', which I blatantly couldn't avoid... Idek what happened, but if you could please take this restriction off my account it would be highly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-07T21:54:01.473+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Best place to ask is to file a support ticket, not on the forums... but you don't get low priority queue for leaving one match.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Of xPeke","date":"2015-01-07T23:21:42.315+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude I got the 5 min low priority like a couple weeks ago and since then I haven't afkd or dodged a game or anything... so I have indeed earnt this unfairly.. :/ could you explain to me how to file a support ticket?","replies":[{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-01-08T00:14:51.967+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Son Of xPeke,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=4yh1IQ4r,comment-id=00000000,timestamp=2015-01-07T23:21:42.315+0000)\n>\n> Dude I got the 5 min low priority like a couple weeks ago and since then I haven't afkd or dodged a game or anything... so I have indeed earnt this unfairly.. :/ could you explain to me how to file a support ticket?\n\nOh damn, that does suck. At the top left of the page when you are boards there is a support button :P. Click it. There'll be a get help button there. Go there, click that you have a question about LoL and lodge your case. Good luck.","replies":[{"poster":"Son Of xPeke","date":"2015-01-08T01:03:46.340+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks heaps man (:","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
