Now its finally working now xD BUT... I got lower priority queue of 10 mins for the 'AFK', which I blatantly couldn't avoid... Idek what happened, but if you could please take this restriction off my account it would be highly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-09T01:22:35.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you left just one match then you shouldn't immediately be put into low priority queue.\n\nAnd make sure that you actually have AVG and not an imitation of it.","replies":[]}]}
