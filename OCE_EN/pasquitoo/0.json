We are from Australia, but have American friends. We were playing on the NA region for so long, but due to our ping being 200 constantly, we decided to switch over to the Oceania region. So my brother switched his account, he played a game on the Oceania, and all was fine. He logged out after his game, and ever since then he cannot log back in. It keeps saying \"Please select the correct region when logging in\". He has tried selecting every region on the list and it constantly says this. **It's like his account is stuck in limbo**. This has been happening since Thursday. He put in a support ticket but has only gotten about 2 replies; 1 of was asking him for his account information, another was asking who was on his friends list. Now everyone who has ever switched regions knows, that when you switch regions it deletes your friends list. So asking for that information is kinda pointless. I guess Riot has been busy over the past few days, because he still cannot get into his account. He missed being able to play the entire weekend due to that (I am sure you League addicts understand the pain). Has anyone else encountered this problem or know how to fix it? He has tried redownloading the league client, and recovering his username, password, etc, none of which work. He has tried logging into all the regions on the list, still doesn't work. Please help us, we just want him to be able to play again.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-01T03:56:31.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are you sure that it was a transferred?

Almost a week later and still no response on his tickets, he has put in 3 so far. They closed one of them with \"Finished\" and commented on it saying that he needs to only have 1 ticket open at a time, that he was too comment on that one, but when he did he got a response saying that every time he commented on it, it was going to get bumped back down to the bottom of the list. It's just ridiculous, he just wants his account back. He brought $40 worth of riot points the day he transferred, he didn't spend them yet, he transferred his account and hasn't been able to log in since.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-02-04T06:48:57.486+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A heart-breaking story, but for something like this, no matter how distressing you make it seem, it won't be fixed sooner. At least, that's what'll happen on Riot's end. As far as I'm concerned, all the guys who handle tickets are really just robots.\n\nCould you explain the exact events that transpired when you tried to change regions for your brother's account?","replies":[]}]}]}]}
