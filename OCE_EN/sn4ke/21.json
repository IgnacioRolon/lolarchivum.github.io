When I play League or any other games my internet is terrible even when I don&#039;t even have League opened. This problem started about a week ago and I&#039;ve been playing league for about 2 months and I&#039;ve no problems till now. I&#039;ve used an Ethernet cable to stop using the wireless internet and it worked for a bit but then my screen just kept freezing. I&#039;ve uninstalled League and then even reinstalled and nothing changed and it was just the same. For my phone TV and even my laptop can run everything fine except for my desktop which has the problem. Please help I haven&#039;t played League in a week and I basically have nothing else to do than play Overwatch.\r\n {{sticker:cass-cry}}","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-02T10:10:28.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To clarify, you are having connection issues or disk usage issues?
