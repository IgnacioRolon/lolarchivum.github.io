I&#039;ve been deciding between Dawnbringer and Championship.\r\n\r\nDawnbringer:\r\nDawnbringer I&#039;ve heard to be very smooth, thicc, looks splash art is amazing, looks cool and the animations are huge. But of course I have doubts, the animations could stuff up my combos because of how large they are, I&#039;m kinda not liking the skin in character model wise but the Ultimate is amazing #SuperSaiyanFishRiven.\r\n\r\nChampionship:\r\nThis skin looks amazing, the animations, the colour looks very nice. Though, the splash art, the model is nice but ehhh, the regular sword looks weird and the Ultimate sword looks weird as well. Also I have to wait till Worlds to buy the skin off Store.","replies":[{"poster":"Iloveyoubabygirl","date":"2018-03-29T02:37:40.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"as an NA ex-riven main from before oce had a server the defaults my favourite\n\nthat arcade one is cringey as a mf\n\nchampionships allright but its even worse on a bad player then aforementioned","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rohiki","date":"2018-03-27T10:36:26.075+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I definitely think Dawnbringer Riven, her animations look really smooth and clean.
