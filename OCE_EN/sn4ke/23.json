I just hit level 30 so I&rsquo;m gonna start playing ranked but I don&rsquo;t know what lanes. I used to be a Jungle main but now I&rsquo;m not due to how boring and how much flaming I got. Mid lane is too impacting for me and I literally only play Talon mid. Top lane I&rsquo;ve hardly played but I love tanks and juggernauts. ADC is very hard for me as I&rsquo;m mostly used to melee champions. Support I&rsquo;ve never really tried but it looks fun. I love CC champions.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking Support but I only like {{champion:12}} pretty much because his CC is amazing and because of his tankiness\r\n\r\nTop lane is probably my most confident.\r\n{{champion:157}} and {{champion:92}}  I&rsquo;ve tried and I love playing them but I am considering {{champion:122}} and {{champion:98}}.\r\n\r\n{{champion:157}} because it&rsquo;s fucking Yasuo and you have mobility, damage and you are somewhat tanks.\r\n\r\n{{champion:92}} CC is great and extremely fun to do combos.\r\n\r\n{{champion:12}} because of your massive amount of CC and tankiness.\r\n\r\n{{champion:98}} tankiness and great team fighting and some nice CC.\r\n\r\n{{champion:122}} because he&rsquo;s a tank, can damage very hard, has 2 abilities that 90% slow and the fucking dunk.\r\n\r\n{{champion:202}} I fucking love because of personality and nice CC but the only chanpion I like in the ADC category.\r\n\r\n{{champion:254}} Can be a Tank, Bruiser etc and SO MUCH CC.\r\n\r\n{{champion:91}} amazing burst and can fucking wall hop.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2018-01-10T22:29:49.412+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello friend, \n\nI would highly suggest not playing ranked as soon as you hit level 30. You are likely to be disappointed with your placement (luckily it seems easier to get placed in silver these days rather than bronze, but still). \n\nI think if you love CC then toplane and support might be the roles for you! Having support as your secondary also means that you will probably never be autofilled so yay.\n\nFor Toplane you have yasuo and riven and thats a great start. \n\n* I would definately reccommend following through on darius since he is very snowbally in low elo and is a bit tankier than riven and yasuo. \n* Shen is also a great pick up, and you can turn a fight with your ult. \n* I would also suggest picking up maokai, since he is very very tanky and has so much CC, and can also be flexed as a support pick.\n* Lastly for top I would suggest picking up something like swain, Ekko, or vlad (pick one), since there will be cases where you are last pick and literally everyone on your team has picked AD and you will be in desperate need of an AP pick. Swain is pretty tanky and provides good CC, Ekko is basically AP riven and Vladimir is a strong force with enough sustain to get you through laning phase and make you nearly unkillable late. \n\n_Note that swain is getting a rework, so best keep an eye on him to see what happens_\n\n{{champion:157}} {{champion:92}} {{champion:122}} {{champion:98}} {{champion:57}} ({{champion:50}} /{{champion:245}} /{{champion:8}} )\n\nSupport is also great that you love Ali, since it seems that engage supports are very strong right now. In line with him, I would reccomend you try Leona, Braum, and Tahm Kench (who can also be played toplane). These are the tanky supports that have their kits packed to the brim with CC. \nYou also have the squishier utlility champions like Janna and Lulu and the AP supports like Morgana and Zyra to try. \n\n{{champion:12}} {{champion:89}} {{champion:201}} {{champion:40}} {{champion:117}} {{champion:25}} {{champion:143}} {{champion:223}} \n\nHold off playing ranked until you find what champs you like playing, and have experienced most of the matchups for each of your champs. There is nothing worse than going into a ranked game and being like \"oh snap i've never vsed x before, I vaguely know what they do but idk how to approach this match up*. I would say maybe around 500 games in total (at the very least). It also gives you time to practice things like [trading stance and map rotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ), which will immediately put you on a better starting foot so you don't start your journey in low bronze like I did. \n\nGood luck ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-01-11T02:03:16.683+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow uh thanks! I didn’t expect someone to answer with this much detail and effort so thank you! I will definitely try out these champions when I get enough BE. I’ll probably make a second account so I can try out {{champion:122}} so I don’t have to buy him. \n\nI’m probably going to start playing ranked when I’ve learned at least 3 champions in each lane and yes hopefully not start out in bronze.\n\n{{champion:40}}, {{champion:117}}, {{champion:25}}, {{champion:143}} and {{champion:8}} I’m probably not going to try as I’ve seen their kits and I don’t like them but maybe {{champion:8}}.\n\n{{champion:223}} and {{champion:201}}  I will definitely try out as Support and maybe {{champion:223}}  on Top as you suggested.\n\n{{champion:50}} and {{champion:245}} look pretty cool (especially {{champion:50}} ) so I’ll probably try them both out as I’ve seen many {{champion:245}} ‘s and they are very annoying.\n\n{{champion:57}} I might try out. To be honest I do kinda like his kit but I very much dislike his design and I don’t like playing champions that are considered ‘God Tier’ in the Competitive Scene as I basically see {{champion:57}} 90% of professional players playing him Top.\n\nBut anyways I appreciate you helping and putting your time and effort into responding to my post this has helped a lot and snow I’m not really worried about what lanes and champions I should play. \n\nThanks.\n\n{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]}
