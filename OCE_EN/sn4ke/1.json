I love CC, tanks, damage and just everything. \r\n\r\nI feel like the meta also changes my mains but I hate that. Constantly switching my main when I just want to stick to one champion. It&#039;s frustrating. I get to a skill of a champion and then I just move on and I&#039;ve made 0 progress and all that time was for nothing.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve considered many champions bt then I just reject them like Jhin. I love Jhin&#039;s kit. But I hate his reloading and how slow he is. I like ADC&#039;s but I always die. I love Tanks for CC and engages but I do 0 damage and have almost no mobility. I love Assassins for the shit tons of damage but they are squishy and can&#039;t sustain much in teamfights.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m actually thinking of quitting this game because of the fact that I can&#039;t find a champion I like. I&#039;ve tried everything, every role, most champions and I&#039;ve spent quite a lot of money.\r\n\r\nPlease.","replies":[{"poster":"VeryLastGrimm","date":"2018-03-11T11:48:50.368+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Someone who will always be  good in the meta until Top becomes carry central which requires most tank items to become null void i do recommend trundle {{champion:48}} The reason being is trundle can duel with the best of them, his ulti saps tank stats and health leaving you incredibly tanky and them without tanks stats, he can hurt depending on build path but {{item:3078}} always hurts and a must, his Q gives you an AD buff for a short while based on THEIR AD. He can run fast and the troll pole is a good way to slow down runaway targets or disrupt a jungler ganking you as it pops out of the ground and slows around the pillar. He is not the best at sticking to targets and struggles into ranged champs (But so do most melee champs). But overall i think trundle is the best fit for what you want.","replies":[{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-03-11T12:55:19.383+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Oooooo yes I will try mah boi","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wean","date":"2018-03-13T06:34:00.179+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have you tried Nasus?\nWhile he may be weak in early game, once he goes into mid game, if he farms enough with his Q, he gains tons of damage, and he also gains stacks of life steal by autoattacking units or enemy champions, which makes him eventually unbeatable 1v1, and once he reaches that point plus getting Sunfire Cape, Thornmail, Randuins and Deadman's plate, even building lethality would not really work against him.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Matsuzaka544","date":"2018-03-10T11:25:01.740+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The answer is always Vi {{champion:254}} .

She is a fighter that is more of an assassin. Her E gives her CC, her abilities do tonnes of damage, and her W gives her a pretty huge shield. Not to mention her standard build path gives her a lot of HP too. She is also very mobile.\n\nTo me it sounds like you have an interest in Bruisers. They have tankiness, yet deal a lot of damage, and most are quite mobile. Think Fiora, Jax, Camille, Riven. Go for the typical bruiser builds on them (Trinity + Hydra into tank, with Gunblade + Rageblade on Jax) and not the Lethality builds. Great Fioras and Rivens can solo carry games.\n\nHave you considered Nasus? He is a Juggernaut. This means he has a weak early games, but the more stacks he farms, the stronger he gets. Even in lane phase, he has incredible sustain, and come late game he is unkillable due to a full tank build (with maybe Trinity) and does LOADS of damage with his stacked Q, Armour Shred E, Dark Harvest, and Spellblade proc. What about kiting? With his standard build, you have enough CDR that you will be able to Wither someone permanently (that is a 90% MS reduction!). His ult also makes him much tankier AND deals AoE damage.\n\nThe same applies to Nunu and Cho'Gath.","replies":[{"poster":"oPuredo","date":"2018-03-11T11:17:57.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As a Diana main, I wouldn't recommend her to him.\nHe seems to like broken champs.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-03-10T11:41:01.672+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried Fiora, Riven and Camille. Out of the four Camille is probabaly my favourite due to the mechanics of Fiora and Riven. \n\nBut hmm Diana I'd maybe like to try. Though she is an AP Burst which is something I'm worried about do you have an escape? I know Ekko does as I've played him ( his R). \n\nNasus maybe, guys slow AF but the Wither so strong.\n\n I'm kinda debating either to go for an ADC, Bruiser or a someone that's Tanky and has nice engage so I was thinking Zac but I'm not sure, does he do damage? Plus he's a Jungler which is too much pressure for me, don't gank and get flamed, fail a gank get flamed. \n\nAny other good enagers that can set up for a team. I've recently been playing Thresh and man he is fun but I'm already yet again getting bored.\n\nI appreciate your help :)","replies":[{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2018-03-10T18:51:45.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana can use her ult on enemy minions or monsters to dash away. It requires positioning, but it's easily possible. She can also use it to jump over walls (ie to camps to escape someone). Also, her R resets if the target was recently hit by her Q.\n\nlol with Nasus it doesn't matter that you aren't fast. With Wither, everyone else is slow.\n\nWith Zac, he does a lot if built full AP, but not really if you build him as the engager and tank that his standard build takes.\n\nJarven IV is a decent engager who also does a lot of damage. Same with Vi and Skarner. But those are usually Junglers. Perhaps even Kayn? His Darkin form is both tanky and does a lot of damage due to lots of %HP stats. And then, if the enemy have few or no tanks, just take Shadow Assassin and one-shot everyone.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Sn4ke","date":"2018-03-10T11:48:08.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"By good engagers I'm not really talking about engagers I guess.
