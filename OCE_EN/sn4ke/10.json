I have liked Shen but I feel like he&rsquo;s in a way too boring. E, AA, Q, W,  AA, AA, AA. Just the cooldowns. I love his ult and E tho. He&rsquo;s a tank and everyone wants tanks, his R can save people and give you a free kill.\r\n\r\nCamille on the other hand, so much more fast paced. The abilities are on small cooldowns and just occupying with the keyboard. She&rsquo;s meta but gets banned a lot too. \r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not the best with AA resets or animation cancelling so I&rsquo;m thinking Shen but Camille though. Shen winrates have been terrible but for Camille they&rsquo;re great with a high play rate.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","replies":[{"poster":"00shots00","date":"2018-05-01T23:24:40.425+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it took me over 80 games to finally learn every combo camille has up to the flash animation canceling second proc of the Q. \n\ncamille is more reward-able to learn than shen because she even counters shen.\n\nshe deals true damage every 2-3 seconds and if shen ults to save someone she takes towers as fast as yorik","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2018-05-01T23:20:41.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Shen","replies":[]}]}
