But I have a problem, I have no idea who to main or play. This was partly the reason why I quit the game in the first place. I know there are over 140 champions but I have no idea who I like playing since I&rsquo;ve gotten bored of pretty much everything.\r\n\r\nI know I can go back to Rakan and Morgana as I have thoroughly enjoyed those champions but I want something new other than support. I want someone who can impact a team fight and do (aoe) damage having some cc and sustainability or escape. \r\n\r\nI tend to be very indecisive about my champions and very critical, for example: Zed, a champion who is insanely hard to master and learn. You pretty much need to hit everything and learn combos and be very quick with your fingers. I am looking for someone not as hard as a champion as Zed or Riven etc or an easy champion as Garen or Annie.","replies":[{"poster":"mamidyou7","date":"2019-02-17T19:48:35.588+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I dont play since 2 years ago what champs should i play now?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Socon","date":"2018-06-09T11:39:39.625+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Master Yi. You can build him on-hit, crit, tank, leathiality, hell even build him ap. You can invade level 2, do a full clear, or do a 4 camp gank. You can be annoying and camp people easily burning flashes, or you can farm up and be a late game powerhouse. At first you'll think he's a shit no brains champ that just presses AA move and afks. But when you put some time into him you'll learn there are a lot of mechanics you can utilise to outplay your enemy and show your skill as a player. The higher ranks you go, the more difficult it will be to play him, and the more skill you will need to make him shine.\n\nBut the best part about playing yi is that you are rewarded greatly for doing well and can very easily take games into your own hands.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Quinncest","date":"2018-06-07T12:18:22.282+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't really give you any tips other than to play a bunch of people and see who fits in your comfort zones.
