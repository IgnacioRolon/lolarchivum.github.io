I started placements at level 30 so I was bound to place somewhere low, my highest is Silver 4 (went from Bronze 4 to Silver 4) which I got into after playing promos. I hate playing solo queue and really need to find a support main who I can play with in ranked. My best ADCs are {{champion:81}} and {{champion:67}}. Add me on discord if you’re interested, Snake#2874.","replies":[]}
