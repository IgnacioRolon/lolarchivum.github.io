Such would be a case where there is a valid case against you, but a lack of negative history means you are essentially given a pass. You on the other hand, have proven over a vast number of games that it isn't just a bad day or a frustrating teammate, but rather simply the way you behave towards other players in general.\n\nWhat that means is that you have gone past your second chances and you \"it's just a bad day\" passes and are being punished for behaviour that the *community* has deemed unacceptable.\n\nA valid report is a report where there is evidence of negative behaviour. A false report would be reporting someone where there is no negative behaviour.\n\nAs for how the system chooses what is and isn't ok, it doesn't, the community does. The community decides what is acceptable and what is not by what they choose to report. Players have been overwhelmingly choosing to report you, so that should tell you something about what they think of your behaviour.\n\nTrue your worst may not be racist or explicitly abusive, which is precisely why it has taken you this long to get to a perma, if it was that bad you likely would have only made it one or two games past your 2 week. The fact remains however, that you are exceedingly antagonistic and negative in a vast majority of your games, which in turn ruins the experience of others. Why should you be allowed to sour the experience for 4-9 other people and face no consequences? Especially after you have had your behaviour and the punishments explained, and been warned of what continuing would get you.\n\nYou were told explicitly when you received your last punishment that if you continued your behaviour you would eventually see a permanent suspension. You claim your behaviour has improved but the chat logs above show all the same behaviour. You are constantly prodding and berating your teammates, questioning their every action instead of playing the game. \n\nYou aren't helping your team and you aren't helping yourself. You are stopping yourself from playing, making your team second guess and tilt and not play well which results in you essentially sabotaging your team, both in gameplay and enjoyment, and in the majority of your games.

I don't go into a game hoping a player wont use heal for 10 minutes long or end the game with putting 5 trinkets down after repeatedly asking them to do so. I don't question everything, just the stuff i see and i think a better action can take place. where is the difference in asking something once getting no answer, and asking again till i get answer. I think it is where I have the big issue. I go into a team game with communication pushed onto me as a way to win games by riot and when i ask something in game. when is it appropriately to ask something about another player like why ward there and not here? \n\nIf asking question in a team game with players i have no idea how they play or what they are doing is wrong then why have the chat feature at all?\n\nyou should see the games where i ask something about a summoner or a ward and i get a response with didn't use it didn't think i needed to, i respond with kk. Ive asked a question i get a response and that's that, i move on. my problem is when i don't get a response and the player continues for another 10-20 minutes not using trinkets or summoners. i continually ask them them to use it and why not use it in that situation.  \n\nyou saying im tilting them because the players i question put down 8 trinkets in a 40 min game is tilting them? the 3 and 10 mid hiem who stands on a bush where i type its warded ping constantly and he dies and i get abused, is tilting my team. those examples from game 2 of the chat above. i do understand what you're saying but i don't go out of my way to criticize the players, the urgot in question in game 2 was abusing my as i was playing support and our vision was poor, i dont abuse back, i criticize why he has 2 trinekts up for 10+ mins and he should use it and not grief me. and the message i get from riot is that this is the worst 0.06 of the player base and crazy toxic and inflammatory. \n\nshould i be allowed to show negative behavior and not get punished? the answer is no plain and simple. however the example i mentioned in the previous paragraph is considered negative where does it stop? that example is very clear in my memory, the others not so much, there is alot that happens in chat in the game that isnt on there. ive had people constantly put trinkets down in base non stop because ive asked them to use them, flash and heal on me non stop because ive asked them to use it, and that it would help the team if they did. and the behavior i show should get punished, however there is clear disconnect to the actions no one sees in those chat logs that doesn't get punished.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-13T04:28:17.949+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"> where is the difference in asking something once getting no answer, and asking again till i get answer.\n\nI think the main distinction there is that the latter could be considered \"spam\", which is a breach of the rules (I believe one of the report options includes \"spam\" in the description). I'd recommend not asking more than 2-3 times. After all, if a player hasn't responded by then it's unlikely they will at all (it may even be a case of \"language barrier\" if they're not using chat). Similarly, don't overuse pings either. 1-2 in a specific situation should be enough, and if the player(s) in question don't pay attention there's really nothing more you could have done (I've got to be honest, I'm guilty of occasionally missing a ping and dying because of it).\n\nAll that said, if you do see something that you think is negative behaviour, don't be afraid to report it. It can be said that not enough players use the report feature (likely because there's a misconception about the effectiveness of reporting, for the most part), so one report can really make a difference.","replies":[{"poster":"KaynMid","date":"2017-08-15T02:09:27.263+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"id just like to point out, its not that people think the report system doesnt work.\n\nits that we know the report system doesnt work.\n\nLets lay out the groundwork.\n\nAutomated system that by nature requires certain checkboxes to be ticked for punishment to actually occur.\n\nWeighted report system that makes your reports less valuable the more you report.\n\nThe first option is well known, its automated thats a fact, and anyone with even subpar knowledge of programming (i myself am fairly proficient, infact i specialise in the types of ai/automated systems that riot would be using, but on a much grander more resource intensive scale (like neural networks)) knows that an automated system cannot look for something it doesnt know exists.\n\nnamely for a report to be valid the automated system must look for a flag that it is preprogrammed to look for, be it a regex search for keywords with a weighted value on each word where you pump those numbers into an algorithm to figure out just how negative that players language is, like for instance the occasional %%%%% please wont get you banned as the weighting value of %%%%% is alone not enough to flag the report, but if you were to say string a sentence such as \"you fucking %%%%%% i hope you get cancer and die\" the words fucking, %%%%%%, cancer and die would all have weighting values that when combined would probably cause a flag to occur.\n\nHence why its very very easy to cheat the system if you know what the system is actually looking for, like for instance passive aggressive trolling, where you use specific wording to anger your teammates without explicit language (well placed mmhmm's, lovely's, good jobs, etc) you wont get banned for that without a human audit, ill bet any money on that, but thats a discussion for another time.\n\nWhat is more pressing is the need for consistency in report to trigger action on the account coupled with the decreasing value of reports.\n\nIts well known that the more you report the less value in your reports, hell every time i make a new account i see that mythical \"a player you have reported has been punished\" message 5-10 times within the first week, then the well runs dry.\n\nWhy? because i report often, very often, too often, but all my reports are always accurate.\n\nSo on a brand new account i start off by causing punishment left right and center (as was the case when i made this account and any of my other smurfs) because my reports are actually valuable, but as you get into the thousands of reports made (like on my main) it very quickly devolves into seeing one of those messages every 2-300 reports.\n\nWhich is a conflicting issue, requiring consistency in reports means that there is X number of report points (thats what we will call report value from this point forth) wasted just getting that player flagged for action.\n\nFor every player that actually gets punished theres X number of players who have had their report points diminished without seeing any action actually made up until the point that last report that tipped the scale went through.\n\nWhich is why the report system is damn near useless, your reports have next to no value unless you are the type of person to never report, and if you are the type of person who is trying to clean up the community by reporting your reports dont matter leading to the idea that the report system doesnt work (irregardless of my opinion on the automatic system that is true)","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-15T08:49:55.855+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think there's a key fact you are missing here.

This has resulted in a 2 week suspension placed on your account.\n\nHere are some Chat logs from games where you displayed offensive behavior:\n\n[3:14] Bright Dusty (Morgana): wow\n[3:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i can tell\n[7:11] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i wantyed to back cait pls use heal im so sick of adcs you cant use summoenrs it happens to often kid\n[10:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): whjy heal after i die? pls tell me\n[12:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls come bot gravesn and help get this tower im roaming if you wontr\n[17:27] Bright Dusty (Morgana): im not kidding you guys catn even use basic sumnmoenrs\n[21:13] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cass flash ultri\n[22:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait\n[30:29] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait why do you nerver ulti?\n[31:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls stop absuing me i just noticed you leave summoenrs up so long and barely ulti\n[35:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait real pls use summoenrs\n\nThese are examples of berating your teammates by asking overly sarcastic questions with malcious intent. We will not be lifting the suspension due to the negativity observed.\n\nKeep in mind that if audited again for negative behavior your account will be permanently suspended. The good news is that most players will never reach that level of punishment. In fact, most players who have been warned or suspended are able to change their behavior completely; I am confident that with the right attitude you can avoid any bans in the future.\n\nBest of luck out there!\n\nEconetics\nPlayer Support\nShuriman Acolyte\nShurima?\n\nwith this getting me 2 week banned for the second time in about a month and half. i knwo im still gettitng reported for similar less toxic behavior. as i believe getting reported no matter what is enough to get you punished. what can i do to improve my behavior\nGunny\nMarch 09, 2017 11:02\n\nHey there my name is Gunny and I'm here to help you!\n\nSo through a lot of your games and especially the ones that you are receiving reports from other players for I can see a trend of negative attitude. Most often this seems to be taking the form of passive aggressive comments or giving backhanded advice.\n\nWhen I find myself focusing on other players too much I end up playing worse and having an all around bad time. In times like that, I force myself to take a few days off from Leagues and come back to it with a fresh perspective. If that's not something you want to do, another tactic I like to use is to limit myself to not typing unless I am giving a compliment to another player or discussing something lighthearted (complimenting their good plays, kills etc.)\n\nI hope my advice has helped you out and I appreciate that you're looking to reform :D\n\nHave a fantastic day and feel free to hit me up with any other questions or concerns!\n\nGunny\nRiot Games Player Support\nBright Dusty\nMarch 09, 2017 11:57\n\nWhat do you mean with back handed advice, I'm not familiar with that term. I like the idea of taken some days off, with uni starting up again it seems like the best choice. In my games I give compliments, like good play, or nice Cs, you're a good player, or nice comeback. However I tend to also mentoin when people throw, can't use abilities in the form of asking them why they can't use X summoner. It seems like for me, voicing my opinion is troubling. I get nothing for mentoining a compliment and every punishment possible for talking negative. You're response focusing on my passive aggressiveness confirms it. You bring up to mentoin compliments. If you look over my games I do give compliments, I say sorry for doing X play and throwing. Light hearted isn't worth it, my next punishment could be my last and given that any report can be taken to the extreme with my copy and paste with the previous rioter, do you really think something light hearted wouldn't get me reported and punished. Is there a possible way to impose a chat restriction?\nMama Meep\nMarch 12, 2017 04:20\n\nHey there,\n\nI'm Mama Meep here to assist you on behalf of Gunny.\n\nWe don't have a system to permanently disable a player's chatting abilities or issue chat restrictions outside of punishments.

I wouldn't say i was ever crazy toxic but my behavior was negative and could improve and i believe from each punishment it has to a degree. it took me 3 or 4 days to come off a 2 week suspension and get perma banned for in game chat of what Ive posted above.\n\nEconetics\nFebruary 15, 2017 04:31\n\nHey there,\n\nYour account was locked during a manual audit because we observed a pattern of excessive toxicity within a small period of time. This has resulted in a 2 week suspension placed on your account.\n\nHere are some Chat logs from games where you displayed offensive behavior:\n\n[3:14] Bright Dusty (Morgana): wow\n[3:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i can tell\n[7:11] Bright Dusty (Morgana): i wantyed to back cait pls use heal im so sick of adcs you cant use summoenrs it happens to often kid\n[10:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): whjy heal after i die? pls tell me\n[12:28] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls come bot gravesn and help get this tower im roaming if you wontr\n[17:27] Bright Dusty (Morgana): im not kidding you guys catn even use basic sumnmoenrs\n[21:13] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cass flash ultri\n[22:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait\n[30:29] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait why do you nerver ulti?\n[31:25] Bright Dusty (Morgana): pls stop absuing me i just noticed you leave summoenrs up so long and barely ulti\n[35:23] Bright Dusty (Morgana): cait real pls use summoenrs\n\nThese are examples of berating your teammates by asking overly sarcastic questions with malcious intent. We will not be lifting the suspension due to the negativity observed.\n\nKeep in mind that if audited again for negative behavior your account will be permanently suspended. The good news is that most players will never reach that level of punishment. In fact, most players who have been warned or suspended are able to change their behavior completely; I am confident that with the right attitude you can avoid any bans in the future.\n\nBest of luck out there!\n\nEconetics\nPlayer Support\nShuriman Acolyte\nShurima?","replies":[{"poster":"Doc Savage","date":"2017-08-12T10:03:24.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Here are some Chat logs from games where you displayed offensive behavior:\n\ni mean riot said it right there. you got banned because someone else found it offensive (like you said its coz you get reported by multiple people that find it \"offensive\"). not because it's necessarily wrong. riot is just another liberal/lefty safe space for snowflakes. they need to outline specifically what is right or wrong, not the current system of \"if the community doesnt agree with your behaviour then you are wrong\".\n\nand specifically looking at your log, people are getting offended because you're criticizing them, which, as you know, is not tolerable by liberal snowflakes. sooner or later ranks and ladders will be abolished so everyone can participate equally and not be offended by competition and criticism that comes with it (already happening in schools).","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-08-12T10:30:46.529+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Kinda agree well not with the lefty liberal safe space stuff, however I think these days when something is criticised you will get reported.

It's all about lol can be an intense game and you shouldnt take it out on the players or stuff like that. I get told to focus on my behaviour and don't worry about others, that's fair its way to not get punished in the future, but getting punished because I realise other players aren't doing stuff I would do asking them to do it and why aren't they doing it, shouldn't mean I should get punished for it.The constant lack of support from riot support, and to be punished like I have, maybe this game isn't for me anymore. \n\nI've read over the terms and agreement and if riot wants to suspend my account for no reason they have the power to do so and I have to agree with it, however to be punished for being told I'm one of the worst toxic players to play this game and that's why I'm getting punished is upsetting from the chat logs i get shown on why I'm so bad.\n\nIf other players don't like what I say then they can mute me, it doesn't mean I'm abusive.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-08-15T04:17:04.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I've once or twice received the message that my report resulted in a ban, over years.\n\nTrolls gonna troll, system won't stop them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-08-15T08:45:53.303+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You don't always receive the notification, it is notoriously lacking.
