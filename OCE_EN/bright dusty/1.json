teammate and congratulate them for their achievements \n\nA negative comment is you venting your anger, the comment does not help your team, or give them advice, it questions their ability and their skill level. Calling gg early, calling people boosted or saying they're inting etc.\n\nA neutral comment is \"trains go nyoom\" or \"Lets get baron they're all ded\" It's something without any emotion.\n\nWe all have bad games, think about how you say stuff because your comments can affect how your team plays. Your comments were mostly negative, and I agree with Riot's ruling.\n\nIf someone is abusing you, mute them and report them, don't answer back. I don't know what they were saying but you played the victim card while still being negative.\n\nPeople all have bad games, staying positive can turn games around.\n\n#StayPositive {{champion:99}}","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-06-21T08:36:54.874+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good points there. You present a good way to play any game. I'm not going to act innocent I'm annoying as. However with out the time  stamps and visual of what's happening in game this doesn't tell the whole story. some of the points you make I agree well pretty much all of them. However my train of thought is coming from a different area. If I ask someone why they won't heal or do a certain thing which I don't agree with. I ask them why, I don't abuse I don't threaten. Alot of the times I don't get an answer so I ask again to the annoyance of my team. If here why they play a certain way I'm going to preform according this player is more, lea aggressive. If I ask what rank an adc after he dies with flash up 2 times in the first 5 minutes I'm wondering how do I support him is he a gold 3,4 and I should play more safe with him is he plat 4,5 and expects me to go all in. \n\nMy intention isn't to come across like that however it is how it is. If league is being pushed to communicate to win games and I ask what rank they are? Or why didn't they do a certain thing? Like using flash, heal and I get no response I ask again and the game becomes increasingly annoying","replies":[{"poster":"hehe nice meme","date":"2017-06-21T09:37:56.925+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Unfortunately League is known for it's toxic community, so most people will assume you're asking rhetorically to be a *badword*.  I know plenty of people who ask without wanting an answer. :(\n\n As a support main I've seen adc's forget to heal ALL the time (even my duo does it). Mistakes are a part of human nature, it doesn't mean they did it on purpose.\n\n If you want to know why they did a certain mistake I can give you the answer: Players are human, we make mistakes and bad calls ALL the time!\n\nFor future games try phrasing questions and statements differently. When someone makes a mistake in my games I say \"oh bad luck, next time lets do x\"\nThis gives them advice for the future, it also lets them know that you aren't angry at them (even if you are >:P). \n\nChanging the way you say things can help your teammates focus on the game and improving themselves. I'm blatantly optimistic, and it tends to help win games.\n\n(I would say look at my match history but i'm sick af and not playing well)\n\nBut gl hf, I hope your games go better!","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-06-21T10:35:30.743+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"You say forget but how are you sure? Do you ask them and find out? I should phrase it differently but then I'm filtering myself which shouldn't happen. I have more pride in myself and asking stuff the the way I want is who I'll rather be. I don't won't  and shouldn't have to filter a question a certain way to not get punished over and over.

Some random harping on about forgetting the heal is not going to make a player be inspired or even feel good from that.\nI like Nice Meme Hehe's way of phrasing things so as to indicate that you are not having a go at them, but merely giving advice. Remember that on the internet you cannot see a person's body language, you only see what is typed. Things can be interpreted differently if they are vague or leave any indication that you are having a go at another player in game.\nSo yeah, that's what got you a chat restriction.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Main Line","date":"2017-06-21T09:41:39.853+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Game 1: Your teammates are Gold, and as we know in OCE, Gold is the new bronze. What you could have said **once** was, \"please use heal to save me sometimes\" and leave it at that. Also stuff like \"ward bush for vision if you have a spare trinket\". And leave it at that. If they are boosted monkeys, they won't listen. Nothing you can do about that, focus on your own gameplay. You took Ziggs support, so know the limits of the monkeys and play accordingly. The best plays don't always apply to soloqueue. You have to account for monkeys, so learn early how good your teammates are, and adjust to that.\n\nGame 2: Once again the people that you comment about are Gold. Don't expect players in flex queue to be good. Starting wraiths is fine for junglers with AOE. Yorick may fit the bill. Focus on your own gameplay. Once again you took a support (Ezreal,?) with no crowd control, healing, or shielding abilities. Did you try to get mid lane but because you couldn't you just play AP mages in the support role? Perhaps you also upset your team this way, leading them to report you for trolling. But the main point about this game is if they are monkeys and talking smack, just mute them and don't retaliate. THEY ARE MONKEYS THEY WON'T CARE OR LISTEN TO YOU!\n\nGame 3: Bright Dusty: ummm why didnt blityz exhasut? Because he made a mistake maybe? Or maybe he wasn't in range, or maybe he was crowd controlled? Or he's a Gold 5 monkey. Bright Dusty: amumu why banadage out of baron pit? Bright Dusty: why knock hgim away lol \nQuestioning previous plays is a waste of time. Especially when you are in low elo. Nobody likes to be questioned when they made a mistake. It's better to give positive advice and when bad plays happen, just say nothing. You have to realise that Amumu is **two tiers** lower than you in this flex queue game. No use crying over spilt milk. Saying stuff like \"muted\", or \"reported\", does nothing to help team morale. Just do the actions and **SAY NOTHING**.","replies":[{"poster":"Bright Dusty","date":"2017-06-21T10:38:45.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I play alot of off meta supports and enjoy them.
