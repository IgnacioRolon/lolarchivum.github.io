I&#039;ve played league with many years now and an old buddy of mine who went overseas for work and stopped playing. Now he&#039;s back and he tries to log in and his account has been perma banned for hacking.\r\n\r\nDue to nobody being on the account for years, how is this possible? Has anybody else had this happen?\r\n\r\nSupport have been less then helpful with sending back seemingly copy paste responses about unfair advantage and perm suspention etc. And help/ideas woukd be greatly appreciated! We want to play again but having to level him from 1 would be a pain as neither of us have much time to play nowadays.\r\n\r\nThanks! :)","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-01-31T03:46:46.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nWhat is your friends summoner name?","replies":[{"poster":"Dagel","date":"2017-01-31T05:36:46.533+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi sephirothCG!\n\nSydchrome","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2017-02-01T01:23:19.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey dude,\n\nAfter following up with Player Support it seems your friend has already submitted a ticket about any issues he was experiencing.\n\nAny further information regarding this matter can only be disclosed to him, if there are further concerns he may continue to follow up with his ticket.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
