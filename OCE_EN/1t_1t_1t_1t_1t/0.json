If you lost 5 games in a row then won 5 games you would get placed lower than if you had the losses dispersed. So on a fresh account, it is entirely dependant upon placements and you can get Plat 1 if you play at a scaled high elo level, everything below that is trying it's best to be accurate to a close elo to last season. (Mostly under)\nIf it is a fresh account it is a bit unpredictable and some people have placed at elos really high or low compared to what they are on a main.","replies":[]},{"poster":"esp","date":"2018-02-13T00:54:58.674+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can you tell me what determines your placement?

If they base it on your K/D and CS the system would be so easy to abuse and you could just anti-social split push your way to a high placement. \n\nWins is definitely a big thing for placements, and usually the system wants to get you settled into the right kind of niche early on so you don't have such a big impact on games (goes both ways, for both bad players and smurfs).\n\nPeople usually notice the biggest changes in matchmaking after their first 3ish games, where if they win all three on a fresh account they start versing mid goldish pretty quickly.\nWhere you place from all 10 games takes into consideration the MMR of your teams and opponents, and sometimes you hit luck of the draw and are able to get placed in slightly higher MMR games that you keep winning so the system keeps moving you up. You could also be unlucky and still keep winning your games but be placed into more average MMR games (especially with all of those youtubers and streamers that do these challenges, often do it at peak times with a larger population so they aren't forced upward).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2018-02-13T03:33:00.378+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is so bs.
