I have all chat turned off so I minimise my own susceptibility to engage in a&rguments aka be a toxic guy. We happened to win the game meaning the lux, lost, whom my friends were telling me was quite tilted over the whole ordeal. This resulted in a friend request from the lux, where he proceeded to tell me &quot;enjoy ur ddos...and ur 2 bnum buddies&quot; and &quot;your life is shit, queing with 2 bum buddies in silver&quot;. Finally he said &quot;check out aussyelo(where he supposedly makes &quot;200k a year&quot; :) and run for the hills because im coming for you&quot;. Just putting this out there because people like this is what ruins the game. \nThanks.","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-05-04T11:51:31.156+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi AvCorsair Goku,\n\n**The Boards are not the right place to report things like this**\nAlso, can you please remove the name as [there is a strict no name and shame policy](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules). \n\nFor cases like this, please send in a support ticket to Riot, detailing what happened as well as any evidence you may have (screenshots).
