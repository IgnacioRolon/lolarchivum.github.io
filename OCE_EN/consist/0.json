I&#039;ve had a tough last month and It just comes out. I promise I won&#039;t do it again, can you please lift this and if i do it again just perm ban me? I honestly promise I wont do it again, im trying to master tf and this 2 week ban will slow me down alot. I wont tell you whats happened in the past month to make me this angry, so it doesnt make me sound like im just trying to get unbanned, unless you'd like to know, if you can't unban me fair enough, ill have to cop the 2 weeks but I promise you I wont do it again. :)\n\nKind Regards, Consist.","replies":[{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2016-03-19T20:21:13.656+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Hello, sorry to say but they don't lift bans, just to warn you once you have a 2 week ban the next is a permanent ban, be very careful as they don't lift bans unless it's done in error, I'm sorry you've had a bad month but try not to take it out on others... I know this isn't much help but this is just the way their system is... good luck ):\n\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201898070-My-Account-is-Suspended\n\nRead that for more information (:","replies":[]},{"poster":"trolledallmylife","date":"2016-03-23T18:26:09.730+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"suck sh it for your ban, toxic biach!","replies":[]}]}
