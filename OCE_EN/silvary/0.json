Random selection is actually tilting everybody and so unfair, which brings to the next point that did riot intentionally set up something if you lose too much you will get op champs like jax, zed or shaco? \r\n\r\nFrom my experience, everyone in the game basically was complaining about why we cant choose which champ we want to play and then when we see some op champs like zed, jax or even just yi when OUR TEAM CHAMP totally sucks then we just lose so fking fast that we cant even ff to stop the feeding, in which the team cant even get near to the turret.\r\n\r\nRito please.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-08-21T05:15:54.026+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If they are gonna have random selection AT LEAST allow 10 bans because some champions like master yi or zed just make the game almost unwinnable if they are on the enemy team.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-08-21T00:38:44.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The reason it was changed to be random pick was to add to the champion diversity, rather than games of URF always (or almost always) having the same 20-40 champs. Having a lack of champion diversity means the game will stagnate much faster, so it seems reasonable for Riot to want to do something about it.\n\nAs for the choice of random pick itself, the idea with that was probably so players would try out things they wouldn't normally consider, which is honestly something I can agree with. I have actually found a few champs I like playing in URF from the random pick, and they're ones I wouldn't have considered otherwise. While the random pick may seem like a good idea to Riot, it kind of falls off due to the fact that not all options are available to all players. With the system working like that, it leads to situations where players will create accounts with champion pools that are explicitly filled with the \"OP\" champs of a given mode (this has been happening in ARAM for years already).\n\nAs for why they didn't choose to go with banning, that doesn't do much to the issue of champion diversity. There are only a maximum of 10 bans in a given game (anymore would make the champ select process too bloated), so that wont have much effect when talking about a common pool of 20-40 champs that are almost always picked compared to everything (rather, everyone) else.\n\nThe concept seems reasonable to me. The thing that brings it down is not having all champions free to play in random pick modes, since that allows for \"abuse\" of the system to gain a favourable champion, thus taking the fun away and making it more about \"tryharding\" and \"grinding\", which shouldn't be the case.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-08-21T03:38:19.087+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Same 20-40 is a bit generous :^)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Plutooh","date":"2017-08-20T22:40:32.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Easy fix would have been to allow banning but Riot aren't the smartest tools in the shed....","replies":[]}]}
