Laning can be difficult pre-6 but if you get a kill or two before then you can roam a bit to pick up kills. Your ult has a high mana cost at its first level however so mana management is important. Once you reach rank 2 ult this is much less of an issue.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hounorsboy","date":"2017-12-30T01:24:39.725+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"akali","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2017-12-30T00:14:25.211+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"maybe {{champion:238}} ?","replies":[]}]}
