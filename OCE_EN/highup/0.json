Do not worry however as your account should be locked as soon as someone from support receives your request and after an investigation (And you proving you are the original account holder) any actions taken on the account since it was compromised should be reversed.","replies":[{"poster":"Highup","date":"2016-05-18T22:38:48.899+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks very much","replies":[]}]}]}
