This includes basic data as far as the Pick &amp; Ban phase, GPM and goes deeper as far as preferred strategies, looking for patterns exhibited by players and so on.  We are after someone with lots of experience in this role or with the game and is committed and willing to work with the team 3-4 nights a week. If interested, either comment below or add me to have a chat and to see what is on offer.","replies":[{"poster":"catch this work","date":"2016-06-03T03:32:44.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sure thing, I'd be happy to help you out with this. I've never been an analyst before, but I'm good with structuring bodies of writing and making educated judgements about the game. Provided you gave me a replay+general opinion on how the team thought the game went, I can fire away with adaptions/improvements that need to be made.\nThough I'm only Diamond V I do find that I understand the game rather well such as positioning, objectives and a mixed mindset between safe and high reward playstyles.","replies":[{"poster":"Makkam","date":"2016-06-04T05:59:47.519+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there, it says your friends list ingame is maxed out.\n\nGive me an add :)","replies":[]}]}]}
