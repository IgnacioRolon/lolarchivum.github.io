I&rsquo;ve lived in the void longer than I can remember, but I still do not know what it is. I know it&rsquo;s hopeless to fight this monstrosity alone, but I have no choice. Alone in this world of darkness and death, this creature is all that stands in my way. My home, my first home, is above me, I can feel it in my heart. Nevertheless, I know I must fight for my life. No, not just for my life, for all lives. Shuriman, Demacian, the Yorldes and everyone else that lives in the land above. &ldquo;My name is Kai&rsquo;sa. I am the girl who was stuck in this hell, and now I am the girl who will escape it.&rdquo; \r\nI do not know if the creature can speak, but I know for sure it was laughing at me. The deep guttural sound resounding around the cave. My armour, my body, prepares itself for action. The void shell that has become part of me now seethes with anger, and so do I. I step forward, closer to the pit. The creature is now staring intently at me with all 10 of its disgusting eyes. \r\nSuddenly it lunges at me with its huge gaping mouth. I barely dodge to the side when it disintegrates the ground where I just stood. I begin to open fire, I run around dodging and parrying its strikes. I can see its anger now starting to increase, again those disgusting eyes tell me its hidden emotions. There is no fear in its eyes, no remorse, no mercy only pure rage and malice. I continue to dart around the monster, my suit giving me enhanced speed, but even with my suit to help me, I will run out of energy soon and when I do I&rsquo;ll be a sitting duck. \r\n&ldquo;Come on. Come on Kai&rsquo;sa.&rdquo; I try to encourage myself to keep going. The monster strikes repeatedly, its long snake-like tail wriggling and lashing out every chance it gets. There is only one reason I have survived so long here, my experience in this place, this hunger. \r\nThe monster strikes a decisive blow right at me, it grazes my shoulder and I fall to the ground. It sees its opening, now is the time I die. It lunges forward with its enormous mouth, I fire my void seeker into the beast&rsquo;s mouth, but it barely notices a thing. I stop it by holding by its disgusting yellow teeth, but it won&rsquo;t be long before it overcomes me. \r\n&ldquo;I will never give up! Never!&rdquo; I scream at the beast, willing myself to win this unwinnable battle. I am far too distracted to hear something walk near me, but I see it from the corner of my eye. Oh no, how am I supposed to fight this too? But it&rsquo;s not a void creature, I&rsquo;m not sure what it is. It walks like a man but looks like it is powered by the void, like my suit. \r\n&ldquo;Get back Baron Nashor. You will not consume her.&rdquo; The voice is muffled through the mask, but I recognise it from somewhere, a distant memory from my life before the darkness. To my surprise the creature, the Baron, backs away from me, rearing back to its full, terrifying height. I feel my shoulder healing already and get up to my feet to look at this man. He is wearing a full body suit with a purple blade that radiates power and death, his mask is incredibly strange, it looks as if tentacles are protruding from the central area of it, with metal horns sprouting from the top. \r\n&ldquo;You will never reach the world above. Your life will end here by the Nether Blade of Horok.&rdquo; He says this with such force and power even I move away from him. I realize my fear and instead stand next to him. \r\n&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I ask him. Before he can answer, the beast lets loose a mighty roar, louder than anything I have ever heard during my life in the Void. It is silent for a few seconds before a small light opens up far above the deep cave. A small figure descends from above, I have no idea what it is, never seen it before. \r\n&ldquo;What now?&rdquo; I say to the man beside me. He doesn&rsquo;t take his eyes off the figure who is now clearly visible through the deep purple light of the Void. It looks like a man covered in rags and a purple cloth covering his face. I know my new ally has seen this new enemy before, he gives off a low growl that emanates around the cave. \r\n&ldquo;PROPHET!&rdquo; He suddenly yells with pure anger and malice I have never heard from a person before. \r\n&ldquo;I promised them I would find you and kill you, now you&rsquo;re here. AND YOU WILL DIE!&rdquo; He disappears from my side and appears a few metres in front of me, and then is stopped by a horde of void scuttlers that this Prophet has summoned. \r\n&ldquo;I heard about a man whose life had been taken away. His home and family dropped into the Void, and the dedication he has to kill the one he deems responsible. I am known as the Prophet but my name is Malzahar, and now you and this pest will die by my hand.&rdquo; Him calling me a pest angers me and sets me to action. Once more, I begin to open fire on Baron Nashor with renewed strength and fierceness. It is not long before I land a lucky shot, bursting one of its eyes out of its disgusting head. It rears its ugly head and lets loose a pained and angered howl, the sound should scare me, but I&rsquo;m elated. Now I know how to hurt it, to kill it. I send another barrage at its head, destroying several other of its eyes. It now only has one eye remaining which I teleport in front of it now slash with my arm. As I fight my foe, my ally is doing battle against Malzahar, but he cannot seem to get within striking range of the Prophet. Always getting close before he blocked by a purple barrier. \r\n&ldquo;Stop getting distracted Kai&rsquo;sa.&rdquo; I berate myself, focusing again on my own enemy. Now without any vision, I start to hit it in its soft spots. I have learned that every enemy has a weakness, even this one. One of my blasts knocks out several of its teeth. Nashor&rsquo;s teeth fall to the ground, and I suddenly have an idea. I grab one of its enormous teeth and leap towards its mouth. A stupid idea, but I believe it will work, and so does my suit. Together, as a team, we plunge into the beast&rsquo;s mouth and bury it deep in the back of its throat. Simultaneously I begin to blast all around me. I manage to blast a hole big enough to escape back into the cave, just as Baron Nashor&rsquo;s body writhes and falls to the ground. Dead. \r\n&ldquo;NO. YOU WILL PAY GIRL.&rdquo; Malzahar screams at me. I don&rsquo;t care, I tell him exactly who I am. \r\n&ldquo;My name is Kai&rsquo;sa, my home and my family were destroyed in this place years ago. I am the bridge between the world above and the hell down here. I am their protector, and you shall die.&rdquo; \r\n&ldquo;Kaisa? Is that you?&rdquo; The man whose voice seemed so familiar I now recognise. \r\n&ldquo;Father?&rdquo; My mask opens revealing my face, he gasps and falls to his knees, removing his own mask. I cannot believe it. I found my father; I am not alone anymore. However, Malzahar only laughs, he moves with lightning speed, striking down my father. His fading eyes stare right at me I cannot contain my anger. I fall to my knees. He found me, I found him. My father&hellip; he&hellip;he is dead. \r\n&ldquo;MALZAHAR! YOU WILL KNOW FEAR, YOU WILL DIE AND THIS HELL WILL NOT SAVE YOU NOW!&rdquo; I scream at the Prophet. My suit, my second skin prepares for another fight. No not a fight, a murder. \r\n&ldquo;Come, girl, you too will die and soon be forgotten with the rest of your town.&rdquo; He made a mistake, he called me girl again. \r\n&ldquo;My name is Kai&rsquo;sa.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"Dire Bees","date":"2018-03-17T22:22:45.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There's some really nice descriptive scenes and a good story line here, I would just suggest you think about paragraph spacing and perhaps putting a little more of that great description on the death scene.
