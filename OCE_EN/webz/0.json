You were pretty much setting yourself up for massive disappointment, though the system was probably way too cruel with this reroll I agree.\n\nThankfully, you're in luck. Have you heard the Ocean Week? You can make up the losses with it as the rewards also include Hextech Chest and Keys.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-02-01T11:14:00.897+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yeah if anything you should disenchant your higher tier shards for dust and only reroll the cheapest shards.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ROGU3","date":"2017-02-01T11:09:13.469+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Whenever you gamble, my friend, sometimes you lose.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2017-02-01T07:39:37.793+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you gambled and took the risk lmao","replies":[]}]}
