I was surprised so I told my friend in my Skype call that it said this and he was gonna play Illaoi since i duo with him bot. He tried to use the skin but it didn&#039;t let him. (I played Lucian). Later after that I forgot about it and when I was gonna play a 1v1 with my other friend (1v1 Yasuo, First death) its came up with &quot;Highnoon yasuo can be used in this game&quot; so I locked him in and I went to the skin but it didn&#039;t let me use it I already had project and blood moon. So I was like is this a troll or a bug. Thank you please someone reply and tell me why ahaha.","replies":[{"poster":"Wam Bam GG Mam","date":"2017-06-06T04:53:28.715+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't know about you but I got this happening in games after aram games that had been skin boosted.
