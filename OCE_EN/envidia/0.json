His Q sounds like Soraka's old Q but with a stun. His E sounds like a Kassadin ult but a whole lot less useful only dealing damage if it hits a champ, no waveclear or jungle use there. His passive doesn't sound that good to be honest, 5% AS is barely 1 extra shot every 10 seconds for most adcs. And btw, is he ranged or melee?\n\nOnly thing that does sound interesting is his R. Giving him a terrain ability similar to Trundle's pillar but on a charge system could add some interesting utility. But dealing no damage does not make it a very good \"ultimate\" ability in my opinion. I know there are many ult's that deal no damage, but they usually have something else that makes them really strong.\n\nYou seem to have a decent concept. Keep working on it, make some changes to his kit so he has a more defined playstyle without being too stiff. Read up on some of the old News articles Riot has done when they release new champions or re-worked old ones. Look for when they talk about things like \"champion identity\" to see what you should look for when creating your own ideas.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-03-10T08:02:36.956+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does his passive work on enemy's too?\nCause u haven't exactly noted who it gives AS to...","replies":[{"poster":"Envidia","date":"2015-03-10T12:09:56.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There I changed it","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Wild Card Shaco","date":"2015-03-10T09:03:22.712+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"passive: bad\nq: bard q but easier\nw: blitz passive\ne: kassadin ult\nr: lame","replies":[]},{"poster":"Noobbanana123","date":"2015-03-09T23:35:20.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive: Lame\nEverything else, OP","replies":[]}]}
