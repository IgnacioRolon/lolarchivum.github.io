As I am sure everyone is aware, this is probably the most casual form of league and has potentially the fewest number of people that can be affected by negative behavior (5 total). Still, in this game, three of my teammates were using Bot-scripts, programs that automate the actions of a character such that the character will perform actions without player input. \r\n\r\nThis is obvious tampering with game files, failure to communicate with the team, as well as poor-sportsmanship in general (automated farming and attempting to cheat your way to lvl 30 when you haven&#039;t put in any effort/practice). I want to stress that the problem did not have to be in a game against AI, if this was in a real match I would have been even more annoyed.\r\n\r\nI propose that Riot adds a new form of reporting option to the list : &quot;Tampered with game files/Attempting to cheat&quot; As you can see, when you label this behavior for what it is, the seriousness becomes much more apparent. I currently assume this is possible as the tribunals are being revamped and the reporting system will eventually be overhauled anyway. Tampering with game files is also a well-known ban worthy offense (as far as I am aware). Expansion of the things we can report would also allow for more specific problems to be targeted.\r\n\r\nPlease give any thoughts and feedback.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-15T12:15:46.472+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Solid idea.
