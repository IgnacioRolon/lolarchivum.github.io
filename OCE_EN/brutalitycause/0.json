While you are on the punishment and for a period of time afterwards you will be unable to earn hextech loot (since it is a reward for positive play). \n\nThat period of time is not strictly defined, though if the punishment was only a 10 game chat restriction then with good behaviour it can be as short as a week before you get loot privileges back. Obviously harsher punishments will extend that time significantly.\n\nSo basically, just keep playing, be positive, and you will start getting loot again fairly soon.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/209939463-Hextech-Crafting-Restrictions","replies":[]}]}
