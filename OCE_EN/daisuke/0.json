Here is my support ticket with info that may be relevant to yoursefl should you get a similar laptop https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/17937760 . I think my issue is with some setting but i would like to say the specs you mentioned should easily handle LoL at highest setting with around 300 FPS with vsync off. With vsync on it may go down to 60FPS. But vsync is useless and actully impacts gameplay negatively so you would want it off anyway. Hopefully i can get my FPS issue fixed so i can confidentaly say your PC will be fine.","replies":[{"poster":"Daisuke","date":"2015-07-22T06:55:26.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wont let me open that link, im assuming its a ticket raised on your login, as it says my login deets are incorrect.\nany chance you can copy and paste some of the info you think would help.\nAlso i only stated 60 FPS as this is at most what current screens can refresh at anyway as long as i can get it to sit and stay and play nice at 60 with minimal to 0 FPS drop id be happy... problem is being new this year to laptops there is rather little info on the cards and it all seems to be \"Should be\".\n\nAlso in your case, is it possible the game isnt running on the Nvidia card, i read somewhere that you have to access the setting in the Nvidia settings and allow the program to access the 860m and not the on board, if your unsure i can link you the article.","replies":[{"poster":"Conrad","date":"2015-07-22T07:32:34.950+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm  pretty confident that you should have no problem at all with running LoL on high and for that price i imagine the screen will be able to refresh at a rate much higher the 60 fps. For comparison my brother has a laptop a model below mine but still fairly good and it runs Lol on highest with no problems at all. In fact i would add that the specs you suggested would be a bit of an overkill for just LoL even on high i think you could get a laptop able to run LoL on high these days for perhaps a minimum of $1.5k.  Mine was bit under $2k for reference.\n\n\nIf you could link that article that would be great. I'm  pretty sure it's  not the issue given it runs at 200+fps when it's  not spiking but at this stage I'm  willing to try anything.\n\nP.S feel free to add me in game and we can talk about it more if you like when i get back from work.","replies":[{"poster":"Daisuke","date":"2015-07-22T07:59:39.938+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Can't find the article ill keep looking, but the gist was\n\nOpen Nvidia Control Panel>manage 3D settings> make sure LoL is on the program list to use the Nvidia card if not add.\n\nAlso limit your FPS to cap at 60 FPS, Trust me unless your on a 4k monitor your not \"seeing\" 200 FPS your screen cant display that even if its a 120hz monitor it doesn't technically display at 120 Hz its still only 60 but Predicts the image to appear to be 120hz\n\nAlso Play in Boarderless Window Mode this will make sure the nVidia card is being used i had to do this on my Beastly SLI'd desktop.\n\nAnd ensure you are using the most up to date Drivers, if your using Beta Drivers revert to most current non Beta Drivers\n\nYou can Also access most of the options in the Nvidia GeForce Expireince Tab ensuring that League is on the list and let the program decide what the best setting for the game are based on your setup\n\nHope one of these helps\n\nI'm getting no where really just a lot of people Speculating it \"should be\" ok to run with these cards, wouldnt have thought it was that uncommon being this years model of GPU in laptops","replies":[{"poster":"Conrad","date":"2015-07-22T08:21:14.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have tried most of those things but il give some of rhe others a crack when i get home.\n\nI only say \"should\" work beecause if the issues I'm  having with mine but I'm  about 99.9% confident yours will be easily good enough unless you get a lemon or a have a similar issue to me.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
