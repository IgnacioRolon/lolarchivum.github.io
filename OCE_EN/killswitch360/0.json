Riot doesn't see champions who are too buffed (yi, diana, fizz, brand, etc) because to them, it probably seems like they are \"balanced\" whereas when you are playing a game against a yi who has 0/7 and they reach a full crit build, they end up winning the game with 25/10 and almost all the time are able to win in a 5v1\r\n\r\n3. Whenever a new champion comes out all op and trendy, after a week or so, riot decides to GUT them and I mean like, actually deem them useless. Recently, when Neeko was released, she was really well balanced, her ultimate had a higher CD and slightly less damage depending on your build, now she is just a champion that no one knows how to play or what role to go. \r\n\r\n4. Lets talk about the items, Riot changes the items because they think it is whats making champions strong, if you don't want strong champions, change the champions not the items because when one champion needs that item because it is an essential core item and it has been nerfed, then their stats will be affected\r\n\r\n5. Riot is making copies of the same ultimates but with small editions (darius ult = pyke ult, nunu ult = neeko ult, etc)\r\nI didn't ask for the same copies of other abilities, diversity matters Riot, thats what makes the game fun, not similarities\r\n\r\nI've got more if you want :) (let me know what other things make league trash)\r\n\r\nNOTE: New players, uninstall league of legends, there are way better games than this trash.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2019-04-16T06:14:51.618+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1. no they don't. Telling people to kill themselves is an automatic 14 day ban. Why do you need to \"defend yourself\" against trolls and angry idiots online... just mute and report. You really think they care what you have to say?\n \n2. Scaling champs can scale even when behind yes. That's why its important to capitalise when they are weak and not let them farm back into the game.\nI agree sometimes they take too long to balance certain champions but they are never going to balance the game, its literally impossible to try and make all 143 champions both viable and not over powered\n \n3.  yeh. they get the balancing wrong on a lot of champs. But Riots policy seems to be, better to start too strong and nerf then too weak and buff.4.  Don't know why.\n \n4. Riot have this idea that a \"most efficient\" build is boring and that each game you should customise your build to the matchup and game. A nice idea, but all sweaty gamers will always find the most efficient and most consistent way to play and build and do that, so its an effort in futility in my eyes.\nBut changing items every 18 months keeps people in jobs and can make the game somewhat interesting to go and fin5. d the \"best build\" again.\n\n5. Similar, not the same.\n\n\nNOTE: If you don't like the game, just leave. no one is making you stay.","replies":[{"poster":"The Mark Show","date":"2019-05-02T07:24:46.889+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"yi is not balanced, he's an assassin and as one shouldn't be able to 1v5 and burn down tanks, which he does, he's the only assassin that still does. Zed used to be able to burst tanks, but they nerfed him, I guess that's why yi is no 4 on the highest win rate champs atm, he's broken I believe. Fizz isn't that good if he doesn't get fed, yi still is if he just farms for 20 mins. I agree that scaling should happen, but not to the point of an assassin being able to 1v5 and burn down tanks.","replies":[]},{"poster":"jonZooz","date":"2019-04-24T09:23:07.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Reporting is like a 50% 50% tho i report people for being toxic and they usually never get banned.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-16T06:12:33.335+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"_*~~1~~*_ No tolerance language like suicide encouragement and hate speech is grounds for instant escalation to a 14-day ban. That's not to say the system is perfect and will escalate every time, but in the vast majority of cases, such language is met with an almost instant ban. On the other hand, defending yourself (fine) and retaliating (not fine) are not the same thing.\n\n___\n\nBalance isn't my strong suit but I'll answer these as best I can.\n\n_*~~2~~*_ Champions have different strengths at different levels of play. Having different balance for different levels of play doesn't make sense, and balancing for every level of play is far from easy, particularly when it comes to the simple champions. EDIT: Also see Barry's very good poitns about scaling champs.\n\n_*~~3~~*_ Champions are (usually) intentionally released strong, this is to help with the learning curve. After about a week, once most players have a passable knowledge of how they work, and if it comes to it how to play them, they *have* to drop that strength or they slide into OP very quickly. If we're using Neeko as an example, she's still plenty effective and still played, but she's fallen in line with other mids. True they pretty much nerfed out on hit Neeko, but the build was problematic.\n\n_*~~4~~*_ They pretty much always balance item changes with champion changes for just this reason, but if an item is too strong on everyone who can buy it, of course they're going to change the item instead of all the champions who were taking it. If that means some more niche champions suffer a bit, then they'll buff them accordingly.\n\n_*~~5~~*_ At a point, you run out of completely new things that are also balance-able and possible to implement with the current technology, but that doesn't mean such abilities are just carbon copies. Would you not agree that Neeko's ult feels and plays very differently from Nunu's? Particularly with the interaction with her passive? Would you not agree that while Darius's and Pyke's are very similar, there are different use cases (Pyke's is a dash, Darius is tankier), setup conditions (Darius stacks, Pyke's is a skill shot) and counterplay (Again, Darius stacks and Pyke's is a skill shot)?\n\nIf you think the game is trash, why continue to play it? After all, the purpose of a game is entertainment. If you aren't enjoying League, but are enjoying those other games you feel are better, go play them instead.","replies":[{"poster":"KillSwitch360","date":"2019-04-17T00:43:36.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"a note on point 5: why not let the community decide the abilities of the next champion and what they should look like, it will bring the whole community on one big project and give them a sense of achievement","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-04-17T03:09:31.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much entirely because that would be impossible to balance. Everyone would be picking their own brand of OP, but Riot does take community suggestions into account.\n\nNeeko and Sylas are examples of champions integrating requested mechanics. Turning into other champions, and stealing their ults were two of the most requested abilities like, ever. The execution isn't going to be exactly how everyone imagined it, but that's impossible, especially when you throw balance into the mix.\n\nXayah and Rakan are also a good example of this. People wanted a duo set like them forever. Kindred was a stab at the duo in one champion, and it fell a bit short of the fantasy, but that one is a lot harder to implement, and they still ended up with a cool champ.\n\nLittle Demon Tristana and Resistance Illaoi are examples of community-driven content creation too.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
