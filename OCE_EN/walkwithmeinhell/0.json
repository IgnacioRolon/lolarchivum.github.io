Something like a temporary lapse in connection, even if it was Riot's fault, would not trigger loss prevented. Also, it is not activated on an individual basis, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to alert them to when the servers are stuffing up (they only use their internal tools to detect this).\n\nIt is ridiculous.","replies":[]}]}
