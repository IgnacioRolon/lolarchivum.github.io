While enemies are in the rain they take **10/20/30/40/50** magic damage per second.\n**Cooldown: 17/16/15/14/13 seconds.**\n\n**W: Geyser:** \nTirranna channels for **1 second** to create a geyser of hot water from the earth. The geyser does **40/60/80/100/120** magic damage and knocks up.\n**Cooldown: 14/13/12/11/10 seconds.**\n\n**E: Whirlpool:** \nTirranna channels for **2 seconds** and makes a small whirlpool for ** 1/2/3/4/5 seconds** slowly drawing enemies into the middle and slowing them. (they can run out of it) Upgrading the ability increases the size (from about Miss Fortunes e to Nasus's e) and the speed that it draws them in.\n**Cooldown: 19/18/17/16/15 seconds.**\n\n**R: Revive and Annihilate:** \n**Ally Cast:** When cast on an ally, Tirranna encased the ally in a sphere of water and the ally can either choose to teleport to any allied unit/structure taking **2.5 seconds** to channel (can only be interrupted by silences and death) or to cast on another allied champion which takes **3 seconds** to channel and heals the ally for **100/150/200** and gives an extra **30/40/50** armor and magic resist.\n**Enemy Cast:** Tirranna creates a circle of crushing waves around a single target that deals **100/125/150** magic damage, stuns for **2 seconds** and reduces their armor and magic resist by **30/40/50** and decays over **2 seconds.** (armor/mr buffs and debuffs don't stack with anything) \n**Cooldown: 120/110/100 seconds.**\n\n**Lore:** (summery of it) Tirranna lives in Bilgewater in a lonely house by herself. Tirranna wasn't a very social lady, no one really knows what she does or where she really came from, some say she came from the sea itself. They only know she practices using water magic. 4 months after she turned 17 an unsuspecting and clumsy thief tried to steal her gold while she was meditating and practicing. The thief walked into the table \"shit\" he said, Tirranna came for him. The thief slashed her arm, Tirranna made a swift comeback and crushed the thief with waves, his bones were destroyed in an instant, Tirranna called the guards. Tirranna went into isolation for 4 years to train and meditate on her skills. The word got out that the league of legends was on and she was so powerful that she had to join.\n\n**Notable appearances:** She MUST have the scar on her arm from the thief. Blue eyes. \nHigh-ish voice. Long, dark blue hair.","replies":[{"poster":"Vantage Point","date":"2015-08-01T05:49:31.362+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Passive isn't that effective, I would consider changing that to something a little more cohesive with the rest of the kit. Her W appears to be {{champion:223}} **Tongue Lash**, with less damage and slow, with about the same CD. I like the idea of the **Whirlpool**, but it doesn't seem to fit woth anything else in the kit. Her R completely breaks the ongoing theme, making full attack speed spammy abilities the way to go.\n\nHere's my suggestion for an ultimate.\n\n**Tidecall** Channelling, Tirianna calls forth the power of the tides to create a controllable ball of water that follows the mouse cursor at a set speed and max range (increases with level). The ball deals X magic damage every 0.5 seconds to all enemies in the balls radius. After an enemy has been damaged x times it will take 35% damage from **Tidecall** Enemies hit are stunned for 1 sec the first time they are hit, then slowed by 20% while they remain in the ball's radius.\n\nCan be recast to be cancelled. It can only be interrupted by silences, stuns, _Airborne_ and death.\n\nMake sure you keep numbers consistent too, **Downpour** seems to have wierd scaling, but also extremely low numbers.\n\nOverall, I like the effort put into it, but I think you can do better. And I don't think the name Freya is copyrighted to Smite. You can't exactly copyright ancient culture.","replies":[{"poster":"Danielw258","date":"2015-08-02T00:43:15.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alright.

Not particularly interesting. It doesn't bring in any cool mechanics or anything particularly creative. Sion is a steam train, ramming down the lane. Rammus is a rolling ball of doom. GANGPLANK IS A PIRATE! Annie has a teddy bear which is used to summon a giant savage bear. I like the idea of drowning people in overwhelming amounts of water. This kit doesn't quite match that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
