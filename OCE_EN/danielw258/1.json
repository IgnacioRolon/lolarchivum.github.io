Using the rifle you use more cc but no AOE so alright in teamfights but best at 1v1ing. Nikzo can be played everywhere but support.\n\n**Stats:**\n550 Health (+37 per level)\n360 Mana (+26.5 per level)\n35 Armor (+4.5 per level)\n35 Magic Resist (+3.5 per level)\n70 AD (+29.75 per level)\n0 AP (as usual)\n360 Movement Speed\n0.74 Attack Speed\n\n**Abilities:**\n\n**Passive: Assassins Speed:** \nNikzo hones his speed to gain **2%** attack speed and movement speed every 3 levels. (12% total)\n\n**Q: Silent Strike/Crippling Shot:** \nDaggers: When Nikzo is using his daggers, he will dash towards an enemy champion dealing **40/60/80/100/120 (+65% AD)** physical damage to the target.\nRifle: When Nikzo is using his sniper rifle, he will aim for 0.5 seconds and shoot the targets leg slowing them by **20%/25%/30%/35%/40%** for 2 seconds and dealing **30/50/70/90/110 (+65% AD)** physical damage.\n**Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds**\n\n**W: Poisoned Daggers/Flaming Rifle**\nDaggers: Poisoned daggers allows Nikzo to do poison damage every 6 hits for **10/20/30/40/50 (+70% AP)** magic damage per second for 2 seconds.\nRifle: Flaming rifle allows Nikzo to do burning damage every 6 hits for **10/20/30/40/50 (+70% AP)** magic damage per second for 2 seconds.\nPassive effect.\n\n**E: Curved Slice/Head Shot**\nDaggers: Nikzo sweeps his daggers from the sides into the middle moving all enemies hit into the center and dealing **60/80/100/120/140 (+65% AD)** physical damage.\nRifle: Nikzo will take 1 second to aim his rifle and shoots the target in the head dealing **50/70/90/110/130 (+65% AD)** physical damage.\n**Cooldown: 16/15/14/13/12**\n\n**R: Switch:** \nNikzo quickly switches between his daggers and his sniper rifle. When Nikzo switches to his daggers he increases his attack speed by **10%/20%/30%** for **3/4/5** seconds. When he switches to his sniper rifle he increases his range and ignores **5%/10%/15%** armor for the first 3 shots. (Nikzo starts with his ult just like Jayce or Elise)\n**Cooldown: 10/9/8 seconds**\n\n**Notable Appearances:** He's 24 so he'll look young-ish. His body should be like Yi. He has black hair and brown eyes. If he's using the rifle his daggers will be on his back in the shape of an X and if his daggers are out his rifle will be going from his right shoulder to his left hip. When he's standing and he's using his daggers, he'll swing them around a bit. When he's standing with his rifle out he'll start pretending to shoot.\n\nI hope you like it and tell me in the comments whether I should change something. :D","replies":[{"poster":"Bibimbap","date":"2015-09-14T12:43:48.424+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"He seems like a very hard champion to vs, I mean, great in team-fights AND great at long-range 1v1's? \nConcepts are great, but... he has an AOE pull like Orianna ult and Diana, he has a knockup, he has a gapcloser (Q) and he has damage over time... \nIMO he seems pretty broken, but then again... everybody's broken *cough* Garen *cough* 1000 true damage *cough*","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-09-14T11:02:58.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"r cd 2 long","replies":[{"poster":"Danielw258","date":"2015-10-09T11:29:28.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah cause if you get cooldown reduction.

That seems a bit strange.\nI do have some suggested ratios though:\n>Passive: Nikzo hones his speed to gain 5% movement speed, 5% attack speed and 5% chance to dodge a basic attack.\n\nSeems fairly balanced, however, dodge was removed from the game in Season 1/2, and Jax is the only champion who has it now, so that may reduce your favouritism with the Rioters.\n>Q: Daggers - When Nikzo is using his daggers, he will leap towards an enemy champion dealing **40/60/80/100/120 +(70% AD)** physical damage to the target.\nRifle  - When Nikzo is using his sniper rifle, he will aim for 0.5 seconds and shoot the targets leg slowing them by 20%/30%/40%/50%/60% for 2 seconds and dealing **30/50/70/90/110 +(70% AD)** physical damage.\n*Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8 seconds*\n\nIf this seems too much, tweak it down, but I wouldn't go under 50% AD for either, due to an assassin being a burst damage role.\n>W: Daggers - Poisoned daggers allows Nikzo to do poison damage every 6 hits for **10/20/30/40/50 +(25% AP)** magic damage per second for 2 seconds.\nRifle - Flaming rifle allows Nikzo to do burning damage every 6 hits for **10/20/30/40/50 +(25% AP)** physical damage per second for 2 seconds\n*Passive effect (assumed)*\n\nI'm assuming that the W is a passive effect, which is toggled based on Nikzo's stance. If this is not the case, add a cooldown.\n>E: Daggers - Nikzo sweeps his daggers from the sides into the middle moving all enemies hit into the center and dealing **60/80/100/120/140 +(25%)** physical damage and slows for **20%/25%/30%/35%/40%** for 1 second.\nRifle - Nikzo will shoot directly into the ground and the bullet will travel to the target and knock them up dealing **40/60/80/100/120 +(25% AD)** physical damage.\n*Cooldown: 16/15/14/13/12*\n\nA fairly well balanced pair of abilities. Just lowered the slow scaling, because a 60% slow is damned annoying, especially in the late game. It's a lot less annoying at 40%.\n>R: Nikzo quickly switches between his daggers and his sniper rifle. When Nikzo switches to his daggers he increases his attack speed by **10%/20%/30%** for 3/4/5 seconds. When he switches to his sniper rifle he increases his range and ignores **5%/10%/15%** armor for the first 3 shots. (Nikzo starts with his ult just like Jayce or Elise)\n*Cooldown: 10/9/8 seconds*\n\nThis ability seems very well balanced, and is central to his kit. I like it a lot.\n\nOverall, I think you have come up with a fairly solid kit, and I would love to see some concept art or anything that resembles Nikzo in any way. I feel like you definitely could go places with this.","replies":[{"poster":"Danielw258","date":"2015-10-09T11:27:07.450+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the suggestions.
