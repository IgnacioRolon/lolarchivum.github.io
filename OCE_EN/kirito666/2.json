I chose not to play ranked in 2014, or I was actually too busy with school and life. I was really pumped about the new season, I ended up going 3-7. \r\n\r\nGames:\r\n1) Ally Janna wouldn't stop crying and fed the enemy team.\r\n2) Team just fed.\r\n3) Same as #2\r\n4) I won this game...\r\n5) I won this game..\r\n6) Jungler and Support fed their bottom lane.\r\n7) I was carrying hard and ended up as 17/4 and our wonderful feeding Ashe decides to leave and come back just before the defeat screen.\r\n8) We were winning hard until Tristana throws the game by farming bottom lane instead of grouping, after we asked multiple times.\r\n9) I won this one?\r\n10) Lux didn't pick an AD Carry, I played poorly, and every other lane fed.\r\n\r\nSo you place me into Bronze 4, the place where I'm likely not able to climb out of.... I try hard not to focus on others gameplay, but I guess it ended up getting to my head and I started to flame a little in game 7/8/9. I still don't understand why I was getting matched with 950 MMR players, when my MMR before the season reset was 1300. The placement system makes no sense at all, if someome leaves in your game It should count as a loss prevented..\r\n\r\nThis is just me trying to scream out all the anger inside of me..","replies":[{"poster":"KingDinger","date":"2015-01-23T15:53:11.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I try hard not to focus on others gameplay,\n\nalmost all loses you are blaming others.\n\nyou dont even look at what you did in the ones you won....\n\nmaybe try actually looking at your mistakes first.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FetusDeletus1","date":"2015-01-23T15:52:18.657+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone can climb. If you play enough you will get out, you can't blame riot for getting unlucky with your teams. It's best to keep a positive state of mind and just mute negative players.","replies":[]},{"poster":"You are loved","date":"2015-01-24T19:49:55.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, I got pretty similar teams and I was in sil3 last season. I'm now in bronze 2 and almost into my bronze 1 promos. Honestly it's difficult but if you keep trying eventually you will climb. Try and make smart picks at champ select is probably my best advice!\nBest of luck!
