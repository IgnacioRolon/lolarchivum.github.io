Why is it so hard to get stuff done and manage your account? The game is bloody 11 years old. We all know the systems are in place and it can be done, stop wasting each others time. Especially for a game that has you spend on random boxes, super rare drops and items to not be able to manage them from account to account is atrocious.","replies":[{"poster":"Jockulation","date":"2020-01-25T11:27:59.587+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"For a game where you can spend literally hundreds of dollars (I'm up to $530 myself) on cosmetic items, for Riot to still NOT HAVE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION is an absolute joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-25T16:23:56.893+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Holy crap, I know right?\nThis would be so good, it would back up so many claims of compromised accounts.\n\nOnly downside, rito would still find a way to screw it up.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-01-24T09:49:56.962+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot don't care so long as the company can make a quick buck. \nBrother spent a fair bit on his old account, only to get a \"not our problem\" when it was compromised and banned. \n\nHonestly, expecting Riot to do anything and expecting good results is like expecting food to be left alone when left in front of a feeder. It's not gonna happen.","replies":[{"poster":"Vellaura","date":"2020-01-24T12:22:54.628+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Seriously mate, its so bloody frustrating, I'm convinved at this point they just have slightly more advanced bots that are programmed to constantly say no to anything you want done.","replies":[]}]}]}
