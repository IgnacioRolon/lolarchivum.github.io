I am getting sick of solo bronze que. I always end up getting out of B5, do good in B4 and end back in B5 again because of the constant AFKers and KSers. Need a change of pace. I play mid, adc and top. I am also learning to jungle and can kinda supp. I also know someone else who is in either B1 or B2 who may be interested who mains Supp, his summoner name is Melchior119 I think, mine is RebirthKnight.
