Jarvin had a similar interaction with his Demacian Standard where team mates were able to Dragon Strike to each others Demacian Standards. We just wont know until they bring back URF, which will happen at one point.","replies":[{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-24T12:17:47.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We will finally get too see 2 reksai head butt in the same tunnel","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-24T08:29:00.130+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As broken as it was it was the most fun I have had in league","replies":[]},{"poster":"Dynamax","date":"2015-01-24T07:30:08.855+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Also Azir cdr passive in urf op {{champion:39}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Espada XII","date":"2015-01-24T07:21:30.114+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"omg yus pleasee..","replies":[{"poster":"Mackfive","date":"2015-02-13T14:02:12.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Espada XII,realm=OCE,application-id=hIjvqaz6,discussion-id=9FUaBjhv,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-01-24T07:21:30.114+0000)\n>\n> omg yus pleasee..\n\nWHo gives a ..... about nemesis just bring URF BACK!
