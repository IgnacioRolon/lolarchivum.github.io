The Nautilus artificial reef was the final reward in Ocean Week 2015. Players from all around Oceania played games with specific Ocean Week champions (like Fizz, Nami or Nautilus) to contribute one point per win. The points required to construct the artificial reef was a hefty 275,000 from all Oceanic players.","url":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/oceanweek-reef/index.html#find","image":"http://promo.oce.leagueoflegends.com/assets/oceanweek/img/leona.png"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Why am i not there? me and my friends who earned WAY enough points are not there.

I think we only had a few days (2-3) to play on 2015 ocean week.\nI just feel like some of us had the rug pulled out from our feet's. With a sign on the ceiling saying \"Lol you didn't do enough\".\n\nCan you deny/Confirm the point increase needed? (I'm sure Maraduar said you only needed 3)\nAnd what about us summoners who had the points but didn't have our names put on the list.\nDo we all have to submit a ticket for this?","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-04-12T14:45:59.045+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Absolutely not true. 3 points was the required amount in Ocean Week 2015 to end up on the statue and it remained at 3 points despite the community smashing through it in a couple of days.\n\nSo far **every single summoner** who's name isn't there but has claimed that they made it on the statue in OW 2015 has been found to be incorrect. Many of them didn't even participate in OW 2015 and are just confusing last years event with the points they earned in 2016's Ocean Week, which instead gets them on the Community Mural Wall if they earned 10+ points during Ocean Week 2016.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-13T03:06:45.414+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah but I did.\nI had to walk to a friends house just so I could play ocean week.\nI could only do it for one day, so I managed to get my 3-4 points before heading off.\nI'm glad that you could deny those weird things I've heard but I did participate, and I'm not on the list :(","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-04-13T05:44:21.293+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry to say, but it appears that the games you played were all after the Ocean Week challenge phase had ended (when the community unlocked the statue).","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-13T05:49:09.952+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought that this might have been the case, But I could have sworn I played on the second day.\nBecause the moment I saw the event I rushed to play it.\n\nThis kinda sucks, also as a side note.\nWhy couldn't summoners who earned points after the event was reach get their names on the stature?\nFrom what I saw, you still had plenty of room, 1 plate almost had no names on it.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-04-13T06:18:53.830+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The expectation we set was that the 3 points was required to be earned before the statue was unlocked. 42006 summoners made it on to the statue this way and we had to stick by our initial conditions to honour their efforts.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-04-13T06:24:55.852+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah fair enough, but it wouldn't  be the first time you guys went past your initial conditions.\nI still remember a few times where you guys made things go on for another few days (A week at one point) for certain events.\n(I don't know why some events get extra days while others don't, popularity I guess)\n\nAs much as I am really sad about it, I still could have sworn that I got 3 points before that.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Lil Udyr Vert","date":"2016-04-12T06:44:38.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I shrugged off ocean week last year and now im totally regretting it\n{{sticker:zombie-nunu-tears}} \n\nwell atleast ill be getting my name on the mural! hopefully its in Sydney :D {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
