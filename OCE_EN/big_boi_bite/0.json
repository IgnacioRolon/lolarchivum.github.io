I stand up and dress in my ragged and torn clothes and prepare for the first half of the day. As I walk outside a guard of sand approaches and halts me &ldquo;what are you doing outside of your room before our emperor has given you permission&rdquo; I try to hold back a laugh about our fool of an emperor. Azir they call him &ldquo;I am his advisor he asked for me to meet him&rdquo; at this the soldier walks off obviously having received orders to allow me to pass earlier in the day but did not recognise me. His guards are just as foolish as the emperor himself it seems and I walk towards the emperor&rsquo;s quarters halted by several more guards along the way. As I enter his quarters the emperor is already standing and at the door. I despise the man and his golden bird mask comparing himself to Ra. He asks &ldquo;is the ascension procedure in place?&rdquo; ah yes the ascension&hellip; later he plans too ascend himself to the power of a god I plan to take this power for myself &ldquo;yes emperor I have notified the other augurs and they are ready&rdquo; I advise and assist him with magic. Without me this city would crumble to pieces as hextech is highly popular in the city as it is highly efficient but is requires magic to run and not everyone can use magic so me and the other 9 augurs are essentially the glue that sticks the city together and I lead them without us all his soldiers and hextech would crumble. &ldquo;Are you ready emperor?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes we shall begin the ascension&rdquo; as he walks out and stands before his city on his balcony while I gather the other augurs into an arc &ldquo;augurs ready?&rdquo; I shout, &ldquo;Yes xerath&rdquo; they reply. We begin to channel energy through all of us almost overloading all of us due to the sheer amount of energy necessary for ascension and direct this energy into a large orb of energy that we then shape into the shape of azir. As azir is just about to walk into the energy before him I release the hands of the augurs next to me breaking the circuit causing the other augurs to vaporise as I push azir out of they way and walk into the energy&hellip; then&hellip; nothing I don&rsquo;t know how long I was out but I awake completely energised and look around. The city&hellip; it&rsquo;s gone! I stand alone in a crater of the city I grew up in. i&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t plan this! I just wanted to steal the emperor&rsquo;s power! As I look down at my body I realise that I don&rsquo;t have one I have lost my body to be replaced pure energy restrained by magical chains&hellip; I have ascended yes&hellip; but I have destroyed all those around me and my very humanity in the process&hellip;","replies":[{"poster":"Vantage Point","date":"2015-07-30T20:07:10.292+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that you should reformat it a bit, right now it's a little hard to read.

He mentions Azir comparing himself to Ra? I can understand if this is actually set in Egypt and just based on LoL lore, if not then this would make no sense seeing that LoL is in a different universe and doesn't have the same mythology.\n2. Sand Guard. Azir didn't have those powers before the incident. He was just a normal man.\n3. Hextech in Shurima makes no sense. Hextech is from Piltover which probably wasn't even founded yet when Xerath ascended in Shurima (note that he was imprisoned in a stone sarcophagus for _thousands_ of years.\n4. If you read the Shurima lore thingy from when Azir was released you'll pick up that Xerath was so selfish that he didn't care at all about what happened to anyone else as long as he got all of the power.","replies":[{"poster":"Big Boi Bite","date":"2015-08-04T12:11:27.991+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for your feedback but i was basing it on lol lore not an exact copy. the people that are marking it at my school probably do not know actual lol lore and it had a word limit of 500 so i didn't want to complicate things. i thought the ending would be better if he actually felt regret for his actions. i used ra so that people reading it with no idea of league characters would be able to relate to what azir may be like","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-07-30T13:59:49.545+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"tldr","replies":[{"poster":"Big Boi Bite","date":"2015-07-31T04:50:01.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"xerath is a slave to azir. is given job to help ascend azir. pushes azir out of they way and steals power for himself. everything goes black and he wakes up with everything around him destroyed","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-07-31T23:10:58.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cool story brah","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Big Boi Bite","date":"2015-07-30T09:42:08.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"wrote it in 20-30 min so keep that in mind","replies":[]}]}
