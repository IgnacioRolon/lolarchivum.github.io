I have an Idea for a new mode that seems cool enough for consideration.\r\n \r\nThis is what I was thinking:\r\n**Team Size**: _3v3_\r\n**Champions allowed**: _Only_ {{champion:134}}\r\n**A New Map**: A spacious and skirmishing map, but the shadow around the map makes a circle in the middle and indicates the designated fighting zone. (A kind of replacement for Crystal Scar) [] https://i.stack.imgur.com/vQbz8.png)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**Interations with the map**:\r\n**1.**There is a cube in the center of the map ( too many orbs and balls in other modes)\r\n**2.** A {{champion:134}} can use **(ONLY)** her W on the cube, which will drop smaller cubes based on how many people were hit with it, these smaller cubes can be used for any  {{champion:134}}  on the team **who threw it** with their E and R\r\n**3.** Wherever the cube is, the center of the map is, this means if the cube is thrown into a different location then the current designated fighting zone will be shifted according to the where the cube now is.\r\n**4.** Anyone who is still outside of the new designated circle will perish (This keeps everyone in the middle fighting each other with the cube)\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**How lives will work:**\r\n**1.** Everyone gets 5 lives each\r\n**2.** Will teleport in on the outskirts of the map with immunity for a duration\r\n**3.** Once a team is out of lives, the remaining team wins.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nI have no clue if Riot will even consider this, but if they do, they can make the decision if there is a shop or (like Dark Star) they will modify abilites and give items will tooltips.\r\n\r\n**TDLR**\r\n\r\nYou are Syndra, with two other Syndras on your team. There is a cube which spawns little ones (when thrown with W) which are compatible with your other abilities. If you move the cube: then the map moves with it and if you aren&#039;t in the middle you aren&#039;t going to have much fun or live long. You get 5 lives and immunity when respawning. The game is over when a team has no lives left and the winners will be the opposite team.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not a Syndra main nor a game developer so if there is anything you want to add or clarify then just post a comment and I will answer it if I can.","replies":[]}
