I understand this is to make the bans not be the same 6 champions each game, but we&#039;ve been waiting nearly 4 months and just to see we can&#039;t pick the champions we want. I understand the balancing is not negotiable, but all I want to do is pick Jhin and he&#039;s not even op but now I can&#039;t pick him at all because there is a 1/132 chance I will get him. I hope at least there will be some way the actual gamemode is modified from before otherwise I won&#039;t have fun like previous Urf times.","replies":[{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2016-09-02T08:23:00.596+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its on summoners rift. They did it so people stop playing the generic op URF champions and find other champions which are just good, if not better. Just be glad URF is back at all, plus normal URF isn't gone forever, this is just a different game mode.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-09-02T16:31:10.461+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dont complain, its an improvement, the game wont be 99% cancer","replies":[]},{"poster":"MrBrandon","date":"2016-09-02T13:15:00.551+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea its still fun don't complain man its good its urf atleast.","replies":[]}]}
