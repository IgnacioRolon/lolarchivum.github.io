Seems a bit annoying to enemy players who would think W is up. I swear this didn&#039;t use to happen but I could well be wrong.\r\nTL;DR\r\nDno if animation is bug or intended","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-08-17T06:56:27.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nI'm unsure if this is intended or not, I've asked a few people and they're not really sure either.\n\nIf this is occurring 100% of the time when you play Janna, it couldn't hurt to [post a bug report](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report) just in case.\n\nPlease remember to read the \"[How to Report a Game Bug](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/bug-report/3mQGBEjA-how-to-report-a-game-bug)\" sticky thread before posting.","replies":[]}]}
