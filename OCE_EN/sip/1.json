He should also immediately change the password for his League account (if this is still possible) and his attached email/the email he used to sign up since this could also be compromised (that may be how the intruder got his login details).\n\nBarring any extraneous circumstances he should get his account back once ownership and security have been verified with Player Support.\n\nAnd remember! A long password is better than a random one, most passwords are \"guessed\" by computers randomly putting letters together, so something really long like \"thecowwenttothemarketandboughtsomehayfordinner\" is a lot more secure,takes much longer to crack and is more memorable than \"a@17Hj\".","replies":[]},{"poster":"Domine Vindictam","date":"2017-08-06T06:50:36.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey!
