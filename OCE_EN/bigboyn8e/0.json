My question is after you drop it in the ocean does riot have any plans to add a way for people to check on its progress as a reef? Whether it be through Riot putting in a live stream camera or a video device that can upload video or pictures every few months or so? Or even a section here or on the league subreddit or the league main website that summoners who do go to dive it can upload their own pictures and videos of their experience diving it so we can kinda get an idea at how impactful it was or look at it just out of simple curiosity?","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-01-14T00:28:40.690+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just finished my SSI Open Water certification and I cannot wait for this.\nYou are totally right, it would be so cool to have regular updates but perhaps not scalable if Riot does it. Perhaps Riot can facilitate a page where players can upload pictures they take?","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-14T08:11:43.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Mirk not nessecarilly related to this but i didn't get a reply on the naut thread so i'm gonna bug you here.\n\n>A question that i have been asked after showing this to a few people, is the frame of the reef (that is shown in the pictures) made of steel or is it some other type of metal?\n\n>EDIT: Another question i personally have, have you guys settled on a length for the chain of Naut's Dredge Line (as the plans seem to show it's uncertain)?\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/the-news-hour/XVeHQ56E-nautilus-reef-january-2016-update?comment=003f","replies":[{"poster":"CptStupendous","date":"2016-01-15T02:21:06.422+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The frame is what they call 'mild steel'.

And is kinda what i had in mind just some place where people can upload their pictures and/or videos they may have taken while visiting and diving the reef to show how it has become a part of the ocean as well as keeping people who are curious up to date on how far its come. So maybe make the theoretical page chronological?. Id hate for the reef to be made and then after dropping a majority of people forget about it or lose interest. \n\nP.S congrats on your open water certification *Makes ok symbol with hand","replies":[{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2016-01-15T00:32:03.234+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I messed up with the OK symbol on my last day of course and my instructor took my mask away from me when we were down at 9 meters...

As to how to share photos/videos of the reef, it will likely depend on the interest. For instance if there's lots of threads posted here/social media posts from people diving the site, then we can look into the idea of creating somewhere permanent for those to be shared.","replies":[{"poster":"BigBoyN8e","date":"2016-01-14T02:51:51.995+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you for replying, it was just a thought i had because im an avid diver and a huge fan of the game so its the closest thing to the combination of both and id hate for all the hype you've built for it doesn't just go away after the project is complete.","replies":[]}]}]}
