It does NOT take 6 years to make a Yorick skin, so there is absolutely no excuse for him still not having one!","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-07-08T12:09:48.843+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"We were promised a Yorick skin faster than Sion got one one after his rework, so we're still on track for that.\n\nLooking at the updated visuals for Urgot, new skins for him will take extra long, his new model is very intricate.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-08T22:38:49.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea thats true, but theres still no reason for him to have not already had a skin, even before his update.\n_(I think the rumour was that it'll be arcade Yorick.)  _\n\nYea he dies look very complex, and has a large number of particles. \nBut the more interesting the champion, the more interesting skin ideas you can come up with! _(the reason why Jax's has no imaginative skins, while all of Thresh's are interesting.)_ So hopefully we will see some great skins for him in the future.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-07-09T06:53:45.427+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't make a skin for a champion you know you're reworking/visually overhauling.\n\nIn the case of these champs, Yorick, Sion, Urgot, etc making a new skin before their rework will just be wasted resources and time.\n\nThough as I say this we got Safe Cracker Evelynn when she was confirmed for a rework with the official statement being \"she will receive no new skin until after her rework\"","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-09T11:27:32.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yea obviously you don't give them a skin right before a VU, but there was still 5 years of pre-rework Yorick that never got a skin before they even considered reworking him, so there is still no excuse, especially seeming Ezreal gets a skin every year.\n\nI agree with Eve though, they did go back on their word there.\nBut tbh I think we all expected Eve's rework to happen a lot closer to that statement.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-07-09T14:18:24.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you ever took the time to look at old Yorick's model, you'd notice his wrists were 2 pixels thick.\nMaking a skin for that old model would be painful for any artist working on it, it just wasn't viable in any sense, as no matter how hard you tried your work would be fugly.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-09T21:48:05.923+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its true that he wasn't pretty, but there were plenty of hideous champions _(poppy for one)_,\nBut you can't just ignore part of your player base and not give them a skin for 6 years just because you fucked up when you made an ugly champion. \n\nBut either way, we cant change it now, I'm looking forward to his new skin ^^","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-07-10T00:23:03.776+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It wasn't a matter of the champion being ugly, Yorick did look really cool.\nThe issue was the model, and trying to rig textures to it.\n\nPoppy's model was still quite solid and usable, the reason it got updated is because meglings went the way of the dodo and are just female yordles now.\nSame with Tristana.\n(there's a reason I still call Poppy \"Megling Prime\" )\n\nOn top of that you ultimately have to look at the champion's popularity, if a champion is played as little as old Yorick, you're gonna be wasting resources to give him a skin.\n\nIt's like Aatroxx, yes he's \"recently\" received a skin, but I'd outright bet he'd have never gotten it if the other champions weren't in that bundle.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-10T06:11:10.938+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But with the logic of _\"We should only give skins to popular champs.\"_ all you're doing is making it even less likely for people to play the unpopular ones like yorick or swain, and more and more likely to play the already popular champs.\n**RIP diversity.**\n\nSo Yasuo will have 30 skins and Yorick/Swain/Azir would have none.\nNot exactly the kind of game I want to be playing, wbu?\n\nSure you keep the Yas players loyal, but you'd soon lose all the rest of your customers.\n\nIf you gave old Yorick a legendary or ultimate skin, his player base would have quintupled.
