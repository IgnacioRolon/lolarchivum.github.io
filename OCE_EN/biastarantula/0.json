It wasn&#039;t here for Snowdown 2016 and apparently this is because of client issues, but some people are speculating that Riot has removed the system altogether (due to money). It would be nice to get a definite answer as I&#039;ve been holding all my Rp for the Your Shop sales of Snowdown 2016 and when I heard they weren&#039;t happening I&#039;ve held onto it for the Lunar Revel.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks, BiasTarantula","replies":[]}
