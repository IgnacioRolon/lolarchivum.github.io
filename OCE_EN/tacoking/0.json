I'm sure everyone who played adc has come across a Lucian before, or even played as Lucian. I personally HATE him! He is impossible to beat. I played against him many times in a row and every single time he beat me. I tried many different strategies when going against him, and none worked. Riot should nerf Lucian as soon as possible.
