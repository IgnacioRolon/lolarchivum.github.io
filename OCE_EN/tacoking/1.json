I'm a weird guy, and that means I play with plastic tubes and pretend they're swords in the backyard.\r\n\r\nSo I came up with a design of a new champion...\r\n\r\nHis name will be Izoh.\r\n\r\nThis is his design:\r\n\r\nPassive: Knowledge - For every minion kill, Izoh gains knowledge. 1 Knowledge reduces the chance of his e damaging himself by 0.1% (can go as low as 20%). 1 Knowledge gives +25 damage to his R (can go as high as 300 damage)\r\n\r\nQ: Study - Toggle - Izoh puts more work into his studies and for a fair amount of exhaustion, minion kills give even more knowledge and reduce the chance of his e damaging himself by 0.5%. This makes him more vulnerable, allowing incoming damage to deal 10%+ damage.\r\n\r\nW: Rest - Izoh drinks some tea, regenerating his exhaustion bar from 0%/100% in 3 seconds. Comes with the taunt \"A man needs his rest\"\r\n\r\nE: Reverse Grip - Izoh holds his two swords reverse grip, dealing 20% more damage but starting with 45% chance of dealing half damage of reverse grip to himself. Dying reverses his passive and increases the chance by 5%. There is no max.\r\n\r\nR: Extension - Izoh changes back to normal grip by default. His swords turn into feint extensions of the arm, grabbing then pulls the enemy stunning him for 2 seconds. The more knowledge Iroh has, the more damage he does. Dying reduces the damage by 25, the min being 50. Comes with the taunt \"A sword is only an extension to the arm\"\r\n\r\nOther: HE'S A FLIPPIN NINJA\r\nInstead of a mana bar, he has an exhaustion bar. His exhaustion bar can ONLY regenerate with his W or by going to base.\r\nHe's an old man, but he's been trained as a ninja since he was very young.\r\n\r\nHis dance is based off of this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duDfT7KxNxk\r\n\r\n\r\nTaunts are: W taunt.\r\nR taunt.\r\n\"Horrible! Horrible positioning!\"\r\n\"My grandma could do better than that! But I guess that's because she's a dragon spirit...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAny constructive feedback is appreciated.\r\nIf you add to the lore, abilities, or anything else I will commend you in the original post.\r\nI do not wish for Riot to see this. I only want to see your opinion.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day ^_^","replies":[]}
