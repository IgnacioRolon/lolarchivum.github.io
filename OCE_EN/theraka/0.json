For all you know it might be another account they have.\nIf you want to climb.. Start to think \" What am I doing wrong \" Not \" They only have 200 points and play in rank WTF \"\n\nAlways look at your self and how you play. Make another account and get it into bronze or iron. Something that is completely easy to play in. \nThen watch how you play vsing them and how you play vsing higher skill and learn from it. More relaxed you are. Easier it is to climb.\n\nAlso stay away from OPGG per match or any other sites like that. If you see you are vsing gold 1 with a team of iron players. You will think \" GG I lose \" instead of thinking in game \" What do I need to do to win \" \nWhen you own your own mind and the way you think. You will win more.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-25T01:35:56.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"both teams get idiots, every player has their fair share of bad teammates.\n\nWhat matters most in this elo is you.\nHow consistently can you crush your lane opponent, regardless of how much better they are than you? Do you know the lane matchup and powerspikes, do you know how to control the lane? Are you making sure to deny cs and xp? How big is your gold and xp lead, did you manage to get a few kills and a big cs advantage? Did you manage to make your opposing laner afk or just leave their lane and remain poor and underlevelled? How many times can you win the 1v2 when the enemy jungler or mid tries to gank you, how much map pressure can you generate top without dying? \n\nHow well are you holding your own in your lane, and how often are you blaming the result on other teammates who aren't responsible for your lane? Are you warding and denying wards well? Are you roaming and impacting the game, or are you staying in lane too much?\n\nHow well are you transitioning your lead into midgame rotations and objectives? Are you building correctly and managing your minion waves? Should you be setting up a wide net of vision control around your lane and splitpushing? Should you be lane swapping or setting up nets of vision to deny the enemy jungler his jungle camps? Are your teammates running around like headless chickens, would ARAMing it be a good idea, or should you try to 1man gates?\n\nHow well are you handling lategame scenarios? Optimally, you want to have solocarried and ended before lategame, but anyway, are you controlling objective vision and making good picks? Do you know how to play the teamfight? When and who to peel or engage on, who needs to be focused, what ults and big abilities do you need to be careful of and position around?\n\nYou can't control what teammates you get, but you can control how much you can battle through and steal a victory.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-02-25T01:43:50.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Alternatively, you can play for fun and just do something meme like, like Critical Conqueror Rammus mid or Onhit Predator Janna jungle or Praise the Sun Leona top, or Nuclear Ammumu support","replies":[]}]}]}]}
