(https://oce.op.gg/summoner/userName=big+boy+bolge)\r\n\r\nSo, Myself, the jungler and support were waiting at the blue buff for it to spawn so that we could leash, then my support disconnects at 1:11 into the game. &quot;Oh well&quot; I say, expecting to be able to create a Remake vote shortly after, only to my dismay do I find that I cannot start a remake vote. The game plays out and we almost win 4v5 as Soraka doesn&#039;t once reconnect throughout the whole game. \r\n\r\nThis is frustrating considering i&#039;m trying to climb/win and a feature that is meant to resolve this kind of issue for some reason isn&#039;t working. After the game, I took to a Facebook group i&#039;m apart of asking for suggestions as to why this is the case. Someone stated that a player has to be disconnected for 90 seconds before the 3 minute mark of the game. So, using the new client I went back and watched the game to find that Soraka disconnected at 1:11 as stated above. I also then checked to see that no one on my team got first blood before 3 minutes. I also, looked up Riot&#039;s definition of the guidlines that must occur for a remake to become available and from what I can tell, everything that happened/didn&#039;t happen in the game should have been eligible for a remake. (http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/player-behavior/play-games-matter/remake) \r\n\r\nSo, I sit here, incredibly frustrated about why I couldn&#039;t remake and then as to why there is even the option if the most obvious cases are not permitted to let the system work correctly. \r\n\r\nI would love some insight into this issue.","replies":[]}
