I get cocky, i get to about 5/2/10 or something like that with 4 items and just go \"you know what, i wonder if i can solo the fed adc\" sometimes i do, sometimes i dont, its fun like that.\n\noh that and im singed, not everyones retarded enough to chase me, my solution to that is to not back until i have literally 10 health, as  a result im usually running around the map at 100 hp bming people into thinking im an easy kill, sometimes they land hard cc and kill me, sometimes they dont cc me and they die, its great.\n\nThe games where im buying tear on sona im not the support, as you saw it was sona taric botlane, im the damage dealing portion of that lane, and the tear and chalice lets me use my q practically on cooldown to do massive burst damage from a q auto combo.\n\nThe few games i played that build with support was just seeing if it was viable outside that lane (clearly its not)\n\nOh and an explanation for why i use double edged sword on singed, he has relatively high basedamage, very high base damage infact, and if im playing him properly i shouldnt be getting hit in the first place, his healthbar is mostly just a buffer for adcs and the occasional skillshot i fail to dodge, that and getting trapped in hard cc. the talent is basically all positive because if im doing damage and not getting hit the damage bossts are in my favor.\n\n\nAs for the warding? yes i do need to ward more, no im not warding less than other bronzes im arguably warding more than them.\n\nIn my history of ranked ive only seen 2 other people buy a pink ward. thats how low my elo is.\n\nIf you were to pose these points to any other player in my elo they would just say \"oh so your challenger right? you think your pro right\" atleast i can explain my decisions and actions.\n\nOh and btw as for my singed performance, according to lolskill.net atleast i perform 10% better than the average singed, getting more kills, more assists, more gold, slightly less cs, and like 2.2 deaths more than the average, dying a little more for just more performance overall is a good trade off.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"CryptozoicMan","date":"2015-08-19T14:23:50.055+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well one of your first problems I see is that you have your ping's silenced.
