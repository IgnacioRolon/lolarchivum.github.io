It's just a waste to regurgitate her old template and colour palletes already used by dozens of other champ skins.","replies":[{"poster":"hamzilla15","date":"2015-03-08T10:41:59.368+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the last image! thanks for these","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Danasko","date":"2015-03-07T17:25:28.404+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Insta buy, looks amazing :D Really good job man.","replies":[{"poster":"hamzilla15","date":"2015-03-08T01:02:51.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thank you!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Itami Amaya","date":"2015-10-29T04:48:47.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I love Syndra (and consider her my main) and I cannot love this skin concept enough.

Syndra is a champ I love the concept of in general, so I am a little disappointed in her other skins, they don't really scream \"ABSOLUTE POWER\" type of deal. However a fiery theme really does speak to that overall concept of \"power mad\" or otherwise.\n\nThough I do agree with some other posts on here that say her outfit is just a bit bland. Possibly stylizing the outfit to be made of fire and burning, or something other than basically a re-colour of her original outfit, would be awesome.","replies":[{"poster":"hamzilla15","date":"2015-03-16T01:44:22.467+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you! yeah i agree now when i look back at it xD i might change the outfit when i make the splash art of it.. eventually","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Monkey D Luffy","date":"2015-03-07T19:49:55.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nice concept, however I have to comment, Your syndra looks like Shyvanna.","replies":[{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-03-10T08:03:59.633+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i gotta say, it really does.
