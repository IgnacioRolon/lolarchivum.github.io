I'm finding myself really enjoying all the rotating game modes because of how short yet rewarding they are. \n\nThe thing with the classic mode is, every time **Riot** has tried to shorten game times we've gotten snowball metas which are terrible. Maybe increasing XP across the board could get us into mid and late game faster without snowballs?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-07-11T04:05:27.339+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can say you would rather games go on for shorter times, but Riot can't just set game times. It relies on the players, the champions, the objectives and the meta. Right now games in ranked average about 40-60 minutes if people don't surrender. This is most likely because of two things: the new objectives Riot is introducing e.g the Dragons, and the current Tank meta. \n\nWe don't realize how much longer teamfights and pushes take now that 1. there is so much other things to contest or do 2. most teams have about 3 tanks or at least 2 tanks a tanky mid laner. And then there is junglers, I've noticed the longest games I have had have been a result of a high tank comp. That doesn't mean it is OP, it just makes it take longer to beat.\n\nLets say they have 3 \"tanks\", and 2 squishy DPS, like Jinx and Veigar. (Even though it's so dumb even Veigar can build tank now). We could run in and destroy these two, no problem. But wait... there is 3 people locking us down with CC chains. We would kill them, but they each have over 3500 HP and 150 in each resistance, more if they are someone like Sion. Our ADC has Lord Dominik's Regard, but she is Ashe and can't get close enough to attack without dying.\n\nSo we wait it out about 20-30 seconds, no idea what the enemy is planning. Their ADC slightly mis-positions to throw the chompers, luckily, our Jarvan E-Q-Rs her within a second. Our damage eliminates her, we flash past Veigar's E and proceed to decimate him. Then it takes at least a minute to kill all the rest of the tanks otherwise they can stop us pushing or getting drag.\n\nBy the time we kill the tanks and get an inhibitor tower, the rest of the team is back up and we have to back it off and do it again.\n\nThat is probably why games take so long now, it was better when there was 1-2 tanks on a team MAX and maybe a tanky split pusher. Again, this doesn't make the tank meta OP, it just makes it really boring.","replies":[]}]}
