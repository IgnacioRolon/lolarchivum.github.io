Due to this, I eventually accumulated enough &#039;leave-game credits&#039; to be placed in low priority queue.\r\n\r\nMy problem with this and the crux of my point is that the games I left were for such a short period of time that the impact on the overall game would be mainly negligible. I understand leaving games is frowned upon but I am thinking that there should be a system implemented - if possible - that means you don&#039;t accrue &#039;leave-game credits&#039; if you leave the game for less than 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nI know something like this will be something that will get opposition and I believe me when I say I have considered opposing points but I am sure that there are many players out there who have felt miffed by being place in low priority from only leaving games for less than 5 minutes\r\n\r\nThank you for reading","replies":[]}
