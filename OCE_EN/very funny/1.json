Imagine &#039;batting&#039; it away. The projectile then becomes either neutral or friendly. 50% reduction in damage when colliding with allies and/or enemies. Possibly able to chose direction it gets &#039;batted&#039; away.\r\n\r\nI understand something like this will be nigh impossible to code but imagine how awesome it would be to &#039;bat&#039; away a Jinx ulti that would otherwise kill you and kill her instead.\r\n\r\nWould like to know what people think of an ability like this","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-23T08:40:44.199+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haha very funny","replies":[{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2016-05-24T00:16:11.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2016-05-24T05:10:47.862+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In appreciation of the pun I made{{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2016-05-23T03:59:39.978+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"lets bat jinx ult away","replies":[]},{"poster":"Illidalian","date":"2016-05-23T03:09:52.832+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally love this idea.\n\nThe love for it stems from my love of playing a Warrior in WoW.
