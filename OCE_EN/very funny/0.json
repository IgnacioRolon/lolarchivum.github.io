The problem at the moment is that when they stop they don't come back. Meaning that both new and old players won't get to experience it (again).\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple: Have a 1 or 2 week rotation for the game modes. Meaning that every 9-18 weeks (as there are presently 9 game modes). The roster will repeat. Or a vote for a different game mode every 1-2 weeks, with a game mode not repeating for 3 weeks.\r\n\r\nThen everyone is happy.","replies":[{"poster":"Fog","date":"2015-02-16T02:00:33.112+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's already long enough finding a game for solo queue. I don't need another game mode to take more players away from my limited selection of suitable players for said solo queue, thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Very Funny","date":"2015-02-16T03:09:21.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I get that, however if it works of the rotation system then there will be weeks that the game mode won't be played much, like showdown. If it is on a vote system then, yes, queues make take longer to start. However by implementing this, more people may start to play, decreasing queue times across the board.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-16T04:44:48.330+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fog makes a good point. I see this being viable on other servers, but yeah this could be a problem. However, a week for a features gamemode a month which is down when a new gamemode is introduced? Maybe possible.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Slim Chaedi","date":"2015-02-15T23:18:25.217+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its a \"Why not?\" sort of thing. It'd be good, and if we had votes that didn't allow gamemodes to just repeat every time it'd be good because, that way, when more gamemodes come out the most popular ones won't take half a year to come back.","replies":[]}]}
