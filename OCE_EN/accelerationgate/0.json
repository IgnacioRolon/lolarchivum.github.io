Not to mention that until Zyra gets some points in her W the plants are hella squishy.\n\ntl;dr they both have their strengths and weaknesses appropriate to their function in each champions kit.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LAKIGR","date":"2016-11-01T15:05:57.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"maybe try playing a proper support or short of that a \"mage support\"","replies":[{"poster":"AccelerationGate","date":"2016-11-03T12:09:14.639+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I guess you didn't see worlds then?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xDarkRavenx","date":"2016-11-01T22:10:00.491+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Zyra's plants proc Spellthiefs?\n\nIf they do, then they should fix it.","replies":[{"poster":"AccelerationGate","date":"2016-11-03T12:08:35.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They do, which is pretty ridiculous considering it takes no skill to get procs off those","replies":[]}]}]}
