I don&#039;t want one of questionable sexual orientation (Leave Taric out of this pls). I want a legitimate, overbearingly male Star Guardian, and Jhin is be perfect for that. Speaking of Jhin, why do he and ASol still have no new Skins? I would have gladly skipped the whole doom bots event with the nth Teemo skin, for a Jhin, ASol, Illaoi, Taliyah, Ivern or Kled skin.","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2017-04-10T12:02:46.786+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it should be star guardian urgot","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-10T11:30:10.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jhin just got a new blood moon skin, and all of the champs you mentioned are the new ones. Creating skins is a creative process as much as a dev one and they take time. Newer champs with only one skin are high on the priority list sure, but ultimately if they don't have a good skin concept they can't create a skin. They'll be done when they're done essentially. X other champion getting a skin doesn't mean that y priority champion won't get one, it just means x champion has a concept that's made it through the dev process and y doesn't yet.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-16T16:17:05.070+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":2,"body":"A male doesn't make sense for the star guardians.\n\nIf you knew the reference you would understand.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-04-10T10:41:39.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what are you talking about? the whole concepts of star guardians came from star bishounens. \n\nYou cannot deny the facts, magical girls and boys are a disturbing staple of anime.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5NTMFraP2Y","replies":[]},{"poster":"AccelerationGate","date":"2017-04-10T09:35:43.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Valor Carrys,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=6rKorP8Z,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-12-16T16:17:05.070+0000)\n>\n> A male doesn&#x27;t make sense for the star guardians.\n> \n> If you knew the reference you would understand.\n\nStar Guardian Ezreal coming out soon :)","replies":[]}]}]}
