I reported a player after one game, and i was immediately matched with him in my next queue. Thankfully, someone dodged, so I avoided a second loss thanks to said player, but I must ask: why can this even occur in the first place?\r\n\r\nI&#039;m not expecting a serious answer from Riot. Hopefully they just hotfix this or something.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-08-16T23:22:58.687+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why would reporting someone the game before ever stop them from being matched again with you.

This system follows an escalation process so for the first two offences it will typically be chat restrictions, followed by account suspensions for offences after that. However, people do have bad games and the occasional slip-up will not typically be considered a serious offence by a player who is otherwise neutral or positive in their games.\n\nI agree with OP that being matched with a player who has already made a game unpleasant is no fun at all. It would be interesting if the matchmaking system was changed so you can't be matched with players you report, but this could easily lead to abuse of the system, with people reporting for no reason so they avoid someone they dislike. Fortunately I think the chance of encountering the same toxic person in consecutive games is pretty slim (I think it's happened twice to me in all the time I've been playing)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Jayhawk","date":"2016-08-18T05:18:51.392+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's why Riot won't implement that any time soon:\n\nLet's say in ranked, you know your teammate isn't very good or isn't at your perceived skill level for your game (Even though the basics of matchmaking suggest you're around the same skill bracket). You report/block them in the knowledge that you won't get them again on your team. But because matchmaking exists, if you were to queue again, they could be placed onto the enemy team and not yours.\n\nThen apply that same example given above in a high-elo game where the matchmaking pool is much, much smaller and you end up with a ladder that has people jury-rigging the matchmaking system to avoid certain players or try to give themselves an advantage by having them placed onto the other team and not onto yours.\n\nSorry, but this is too easily to abuse within the current system.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Teemo","date":"2016-08-17T12:29:34.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you block someone I think it should be made so that you can't be matched with the blocked person","replies":[]},{"poster":"Star","date":"2016-08-17T05:20:09.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, i've experienced this too. \n\nI've had players intentionally throw games (like afk/run down mid) and be extremely salty. I would report then at the end game screen and then queue again. Then unfortunately i'd get them again! Even when i would take a 5-10 minute break, this could occur. It can be a little frustrating. \n\nHowever, i have managed to resolve my issues with some players after being queued with them again. \n\nThe reason they i think Riot don't implement this feature is because its open to so much abuse (and compromises matchmaking). Even Overwatch, which had a similar feature enabled (prefer this player/ don't prefer this player), removed the option to avoid playing with people and removed the feature due to problems it caused with matchmaking (and people abusing it after just a month).","replies":[]},{"poster":"y u feed me","date":"2016-08-16T16:35:13.244+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"because riot use bandaids to fix problems ;)\n\nalso notice they took away the unskilled section from where you report players so you don't get matched with them. funny huh","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-08-16T15:47:04.704+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LOL was just in champ select with you on my smurf HAHAHA was the raka :)","replies":[{"poster":"AccelerationGate","date":"2016-08-16T16:24:36.290+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow.
