How the hell can riot rank us based on win/loss when you are constantly getting idiots that dont take the game serious and have more fun trolling their own team?\n\njust had a yorick who couldnt understand the concept of farming under tower and instead tried fighting the aatrox that has already killed him 6 times in the past 10 minutes meanwhile my 0/8 gragas jungle continues to tower dive for ganks and fails. Everyone says elo hell doesnt exist but this is a joke i cant remember the last time i was matched with 4 other people that actually knew what the f they were doing.\n\n/rant\n/need another game to play","replies":[{"poster":"Positivity 4 OCE","date":"2016-07-09T04:24:23.969+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@Hairless Iguana! \n\nDon't worry! You won't be the only player that feels like that, but I'm very sad to hear that you have been through so many unfortunate circumstances. In these times when it feels like this, sometimes its more fun to play bot games and just destroy the computer or play some ARAMs with friends.\n\nOtherwise take a break! Enjoy some other games. I do hope you re-install and we see you in the future! The game is forever changing and improving to rid these hindering situations.\n\nAll the best!","replies":[]},{"poster":"Hairless Iguana","date":"2016-07-06T03:32:00.383+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers for the reply guys. officially uninstalled this game today.","replies":[]},{"poster":"hðnkƒørÇªmíllè","date":"2016-07-05T15:30:36.436+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dude it aint even the players or trolls or feeders or whatever that made me quit this game. I just really, really dislike the game in its current state. and alot of riots decisions this season have been questionable and annoying. The people were the only reason I stayed. You play this game long enough you start to respect the trolls xd. anyways in terms of new games:\n- Overwatch. expensive but pretty fun. games are short and sweet, although shitty games feel extra shitty :\\\n- CS:GO. cheap fps. thats all there is.\n- Dota 2 (dota 2 is fucking hard if you have no idea what you're doing I tried to migrate to it after league fucking damn dude, like relearning maths from the beginning shits tough if you got no one)\n\n- new games that got announced at e3 that are coming out soon idfk.\n\nhonestly ive gone back to my main game before league. its old af, no official servers, but i dug up the disc and got the bad boy running. having a fuckin blast not playing this steaming pile of a game called league of legends clash of fates :^), but honestly every time i boot up my computer, and see my league icon banished in the corner of my desktop, i do get an urge to boot it up and play a game, but I know, 100% for certain that i will regret it no matter what. Win or lose i never have fun playing this game anymore, and after 3 months my game proficiency will have decreased dramatically lol. just that when you commit 3 years and alot of money to something you kinda get attached to it a bit.\n/s","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-07-05T07:14:41.350+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"New Games to play:\n\nOverwatch (Don't do ranked. just as bad as League)\n\nCS:GO = (Be careful of raging teammates in voice chat)\n\nVainglory = 'iPad or android only' (be aware of some ragers spamming the ? ping in games if you die)\n\nDOTA 2 (lol)","replies":[]}]}
