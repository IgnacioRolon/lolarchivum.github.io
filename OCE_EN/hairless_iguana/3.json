I love ranked play but I hate losing and even when my teammates go bad I want to be able to be the best that I can to give me the best chance at winning. I have a decent knowledge of the game as I've been playing for years and I've even made it to gold 5 before dropping but I know I have a lot to improve on. I main top and can jungle or support so could anyone please show me some good video guides or give tips on how to be a better player?

The first step to improving is your mindset. Play to improve, not play to win. If you play to improve, you'll improve a lot quicker and as you improve, wins will come naturally. If you don't have anything to say that contributes to winning the game, then just don't say anything. If someone starts talking negatively and you think their comments will mess with your focus on the game, MUTE THEM IMMEDIATELY. Don't talk back. They're not worth your time typing and by typing you can take free damage, lose cs etc...... As for the roles, I won't worry about it too much. I would always fill in solo que and just play what the team needs, yes even support. By playing more roles you get a better understanding of the matchups, champion mechanics and just better understanding of the game overall. Like I said before, play to improve not to win, and filling is a good way to improve. If you have time, go back and watch some replays. Look at yourself from a spectator point of view, the spectator will always see something that the player in the middle of a game doesn't and it's always good to look at yourself from another perspective. Take notes on your mistakes so you can avoid them in the future. Take notes of your teammates' mistakes so you don't repeat them when playing their role/champion. You can also watch solo que games from pro players and take notes from them when they do something that you never thought of. (eg. I analysed a game where Faker played Ahri vs Fizz, a matchup I had a lot of trouble with. But by watching and analysing that game I learnt to push his wave under tower, force him to use his E to waveclear and harass him when his E is on cooldown) That is just one of many things you can learn from doing this. And REMEMBER, no matter how bad your teammates are doing and how much they feed, DO NOT TALK TO THEM NEGATIVELY. This means don't swear at them, don't ask them questions like \"Why did you go in?\". If you want to say something, say it in a way that doesn't make you sound angry. Like you can instead say \"Sorry didn't tell you my stun was on cd, We should try to communicate better before going in next time\". Remember that you will achieve nothing by flaming your teammates and only waste your time typing something that doesnt need to be said. If you only blame your teammates, you won't see your mistakes and therefore won't learn from your mistakes, meaning a game and in turn, time being wasted. Even if it doesn't seem like your fault at all, there is always some little thing you can do. Even something as little as pinging a mia or placing a ward in a different place can make a huge difference. Remember solo que is all about improving yourself. You can't control how your teammates play, you can only control how YOU play, so in-game, only focus on your own play and try to cover your team's mistakes instead of getting salty over them (eg. When your team loses a team fight coz they didn't wait for you, try getting an objective somewhere that the enemy team isn't instead of spending time flaming your team in chat). Final tips, Buy wards no matter what role you play, each player can only put 4 wards at a time (3 green and 1 pink) and only the support warding is not enough to cover the map. Prioritize objective over kills as this game is all about taking objectives from kills, not the kills themselves. And to top the tips off, turn off /all chat. Most of the time the people on the other team will not say something to help you win and the cocky, rude etc... opponents can really distract you from your focus on the game. I hope this helps and good luck in solo que!","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheBadSamaritan","date":"2015-03-07T00:58:47.150+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What i did to g from B5 to around S1 in 1 season was simply:\nDon't Hate\nDon't Rage\nWhen you're mad Don't Talk\nWard up\nAnd Don't take Defeats too Seriously\n\nYou will win, and you will lose, like before you hit G3 (for me) skill doesn't effect your game that much. It does help, but you cannot single handedly carry your team, and even if you're losing really dammed hard, staying positive will help win 1/3 of the games which seem like a certain defeat. The Only issue with that is the whole dammed team needs to be positive or at least trying to win. \n\nThat's what worked for me, and i sure hope it works for you ^_^","replies":[]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-06T00:37:03.609+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"www.mobafire.com\n**ITREALLYHELPS**","replies":[]}]}
