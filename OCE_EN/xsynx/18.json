Ive noticed my MMR dropping on op.gg now ive been promoted to B4. I admit, ive had some terrible games over the past 20 games on my op.gg profile, but such a drastic shift from around 1.1k to under 900 seems a bit unfair.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are, how does MMR work and what factors are calculated into it?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSyn","replies":[]}
