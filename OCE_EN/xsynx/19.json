Never happened before, my ping usually sits at around 30-40.\r\n\r\nI can&#039;t seem to figure out what&#039;s wrong, ive reset my modem, reloaded the client and a few other things. My system is also fine for those who might have suggested that.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!\r\n\r\nxSynx","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-03-07T07:10:23.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Mindstar,\n\nthanks for the swift reply!

Thanks for your input though, ive never had this issue and thought it may have been an issue with the league servers.\n\nCheers,\n\nSyn","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-03-07T06:48:26.958+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nWhat ISP are you with?
