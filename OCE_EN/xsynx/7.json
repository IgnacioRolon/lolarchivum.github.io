Im 25, mature and have decent game knowledge. I refuse to duo with any toxicity coming from my partner, banter is acceptable within limits.\n\nHit me up, I play 15+ games a day usually, depending on if im playing other games with friends. Prefer you to be 20+ in age, I don&#039;t play well with kids, sorry.\n\nBest champs:\n\nADC: MF, Jinx, Vayne, Varus, Twitch. (Comfortable on all though, except Draven.)\n\nJungle: Quinn, Lee (Not bad), Graves. Comfortable on others, Nida, Elise, Reksai.\n\nCheers,\n\nSyn.","replies":[{"poster":"Endless Heights","date":"2017-03-10T11:12:53.301+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Supp main (Annie and Orianna are my best) can play top and jungle if needed b3 solo b4 flex hmu sometime","replies":[]},{"poster":"Samo","date":"2017-03-10T09:13:40.820+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i like your name","replies":[]}]}
