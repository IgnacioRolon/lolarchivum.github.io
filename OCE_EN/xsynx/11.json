I&#039;ve tried a ton of guides from multiple different sources and nothing seems to be helping. usually sit around 50-250 while nothing is happening and in team fights it can drop to below 15 and usually results in my death. \n\nPC Specs:\n\nIntel Core i5 2.8ghz\n16gb of RAM\nNvidia Geforce 960 2gb GPU\nx2 500 GB HDD\nGigabyte motherboard (Not sure of the name)\n800W corsair PSU\n60hz monitor\n\nIn game settings:\n\nAll very high except no V-sync, character inking and anti aliasing.\n\nNvidia settings are all default, all drivers up to date (Version 375.70).\n\nGPU isn&#039;t overheating/Not spitting out hot air, same with all other hardware. 0 dust on any of the fans.\n\nI&#039;ve tried everything up to the point of reinstalling, id rather not do that as it never seems to help. Tried the Riot support guide for FPS also.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, I should be getting way more FPS then I am and im confused as to why im not.","replies":[{"poster":"Orunitor","date":"2016-11-14T19:31:03.333+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Try lower the graphic settings or reinstall gfx card drivers. if that doesnt work, then uninstall the driver and install a older one\n\notherwise i think your out of luck if those dont work\n\n2 option, maybe your card is about to die and need to get a new one?\n\nbut you know.

Lowering graphics on higher end GPU's makes it worse, which mine is and lowering the settings will lag it harder.  And I have tried installing multiple other working lower versions of my driver, no effect.","replies":[]}]}]}
