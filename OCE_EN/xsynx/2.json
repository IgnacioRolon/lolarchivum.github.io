Im B5 (Due to decay) and yes, I know im bad, and I don&#039;t need you to tell me that :P. I welcome the chance to join a more experienced bunch of players and gain more knowledge from those better then myself. I don&#039;t rage, im not toxic and I most certainly do not troll and I hope you have the same values as myself :)\n\nI main jungle and my off-role is mid.  I can also play all other roles comfortably.\n\nI have Skype, Curse, TS and Discord, whichever you prefer to use and a working mic (Mics essential)\n\nId prefer it if you were 18+ as I swear like a sailor and my banter isn&#039;t for the young :P\n\nFeel free to add me :)\n\nCheers,\n\nSyn","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-07-26T19:57:24.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Still looking for peeps! :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MungindiPride","date":"2016-07-26T01:47:38.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"no such thing as decay in bronze but ok","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-07-26T07:13:00.816+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have several accounts, one is in high silver/low gold elo atm (Which is the account that is decaying and wlll likely be in bronze soon if I don't play on it soon), other one I play is in b5, too lazy to climb solo so im looking for people who actually want to climb lol","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"IndianGamer","date":"2016-07-25T18:08:39.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can duo and play with my one of accounts, as that account fall to b1 last day lol but idm not my main, also this is also not my main.
