I&#039;ve tried a ton of guides from multiple different sources and nothing seems to be helping. usually sit around 50 while nothing is happening and in team fights it can drop to below 15 and usually results in my death.\r\n\r\nPC Specs:\r\n\r\nIntel Core i5 2.8ghz\r\n16gb of RAM\r\nNvidia Geforce 960 2gb GPU\r\nx2 500 GB HDD\r\nGigabyte motherboard (Not sure of the name)\r\n800W corsair PSU\r\n60hz monitor\r\n\r\nIn game settings:\r\n\r\nAll very high except no V-sync, character inking and anti aliasing.\r\n\r\nNvidia settings are all default, all drivers up to date (Version 375.70).\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve tried everything up to the point of reinstalling, id rather not do that as it never seems to help. Tried the Riot support guide for FPS also.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated, I should be getting way more FPS then I am and im confused as to why im not.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-11-05T14:02:36.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThat sounds quite odd, your GPU should provide more than enough oomph to run the game properly.\n\nYou mentioned your drivers are up to date, have you tried rolling them back to a previous version to ensure it wasn't a driver update that caused your issues?","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-11-06T04:46:56.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nI only updated them about 2 days ago, just to see if it would fix the issue. Didn't seem to help. As an added note, all my other games run perfectly fine at high rates of fps, just seems to be league and majority of the drops are in team fights.\n\nEDIT: Just thought it could be DX9 doing this? Im running a lower version as DX11 seems buggy on most steam games and as a default installs DX9 when you install games. Could this be the issue that im not running the latest version of DirectX?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2016-11-04T07:41:47.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"And now im sitting on 20 frames, this hotfix seems to have stuffed it for me.
