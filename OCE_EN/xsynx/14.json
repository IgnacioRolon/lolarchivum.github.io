First one is this one, stuck at calculating and has scanned only 1 file, it's no longer stuck and now it's doing a full scan again, im not sure why. But here's the pic anyway:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/yJsxe\n\nOnce that finishes it wants to download a 60 mb update but gets stuck on a really slow speed, it's not my internet, I can play other games and im also talking to mates on ts as well and they tell me my quality is fine and im getting no lag, i'ce also watched videos with no buffering issues, ive also ran a speedtest to confirm. Here's the screen for this problem:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/EqOHU\n\nAnd it hasn't done anything since, it's crashed a few times when I tried to repair and i've tried 2 repairs and no luck.\n\nHeres a screen of my speedtest, ran at 4:12pm AEST: \n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/3aNge\n\n\nHere's the things I tried as solutions:\n\n-Repair (twice) no effect\n-Reboot PC\n-Load client with and without admin\n\nIm a bit uneasy about trying some of the rads stuff as im not even sure that would have an effect either. Some info from a tech person would be great.","replies":[]}]}
