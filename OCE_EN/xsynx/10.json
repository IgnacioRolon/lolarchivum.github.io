It hasn&#039;t been an issue up until about 5 minutes ago where I was in a lobby and got kicked and lost LP. My friends and others are also getting them at random intervals. Just wanted to make you guys aware and hope a fix can be bought out soon!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSyn","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2017-10-11T17:05:09.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Haven't had a bugsplat since the update, maybe that fixed it. Would still be keen on getting some info on it, curious to see if it was on Riot's end.","replies":[]}]}
