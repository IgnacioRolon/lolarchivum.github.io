This person (will remain unnamed unless im asked to post it) plays Anivia (Bottom or Support, doesn&#039;t matter) and uses the wall to block off team mates who are out of position, recalling to base, walling off the majority of her team mates in a losing team fight so they die and also walls off her rotating team mates from objectives so they can&#039;t get a drake or baron/rift or get stuck in either pit with enemy players.\n\nI&#039;ve been on both sides of this person who is plaguing OCE solo queue on multiple accounts in bronze and silver. Said person claims that nothing can be done about such behavior, laughs and is extremely negative/abusive. and im beginning to think their right, as they are still in game after all the reports that have been sent in about said player.\n\nIs there anything anyone can do here or can refer my complaint of said player to someone who can? Behavior like this should not be tolerated, you can lose a lot of business because of the minority of toxic griefing little trolls. \n\nIf anyone can help me id greatly appreciate it, after 10 or more games of this im simply tired of it.\n\nKind regards,\n\nSyn","replies":[{"poster":"xSynx","date":"2017-07-24T09:55:19.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I got was a generic copy paste message, as per usual from a support ticket system.

Ill definitely drop them a message as this person seems to have dodged getting banned and I can't let this go on any further, I have them on my team or the enemies team at least 2 times a day, its got to stop.\n\nAgain thanks for letting me know who to hand this information too, maybe Riot can update their detection systems to prevent players from using Champion Abilities to grief their team mates.\n\nRegards,\n\nSyn","replies":[]}]}]}
