Now this happened because they are Gold IV in solo/duo queue and somehow bronze and iron in flex. But what ensued was a one sided slaughterfest. I double checked by going to each profile in the client to be sure the website wasn't mistaken. Which it wasn't.

The starting MMR is low Silver~ so if they haven't played much Flex their MMR won't have risen to match their skill. That Iron player is also going to be dragging their average MMR down if they are queued with them (which looks likely).\n\nIn addition, the lesser restrictions on Flex mean there can be a much wider variety of skill in a single premade (particularly when unranked players get involved), and the system has way more factors to try and match up between teams, so Flex matchmaking will never be as accurate. It's generally a smaller population queue which compounds that effect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-08-29T12:17:05.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"don't expect good matchmaking in flex.","replies":[]}]}
