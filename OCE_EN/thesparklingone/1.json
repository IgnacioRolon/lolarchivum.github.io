Suddenly, My game turns yellowish. Afterwards we decided to log out and reconnect then the Firewall message appears. I clicked retry several times and it doesn&#039;t work. I have already disable my firewall and stuff like ages ago. Then, eventually after the game ended, the match was not shown on our match history.\r\n\r\nAny solutions? Anyone also experiencing this issue/bug etc?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-07T05:31:41.643+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">My game turns yellowish\n\nThat's what happens when the game is 'paused'. Usually comes with a message (and countdown timer) saying that.\n\n>I have already disable my firewall and stuff like ages ago.\n\nYou shouldn't leave your firewall permanently disabled. That's a security risk. Only disable your firewall if you're testing out your connection and aren't trying anything else. When you find a fix, reactivate the wall and make the appropriate exceptions.\n\nIt might be a server/ISP issue, considering the amount of people posting. What ISP are you with?","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheSparklingOne","date":"2015-06-06T09:01:16.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"[UPDATE] So far I have found 2 people who are experiencing this problem/issue. \n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbQwUw4f-what-happened\n\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/LbQwUw4f-what-happened\n","replies":[]}]}
