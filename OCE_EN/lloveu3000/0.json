I don't know if Riot have commented on dealing with this *issue - yes it is an issue*, because people buy new accounts either to grief or to start their account from \"Scratch\" from a certain rank, which can be debated as boosting, but you really only get boosted by Plat 1+ (A bit off topic I know, sorry).\r\n\r\nAgain, let me be clear, I don't mind that there are bots, these will always be here, but I am starting to get annoyed that it's become the norm after all this time. Riot is making massive strides to making the game they've made and nurtured even better as well as having other projects in their building / testing process, but if they can tackle some of the issues that have been making the game annoying since the get-go, that would be more appreciated.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI believed it would be best if I'd vent my thoughts here, would be great to get anyones opinion on this topic","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-02-16T10:32:28.878+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Riot don't care that there are bots. \nTFT or SR. \n\nAddressing bots is not a priority at the moment, the priority at the moment is damage control.","replies":[{"poster":"Addam","date":"2020-02-17T00:28:17.612+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"are you legit? I've had every single ranked game today be against bots, and not only that, they force me to play better than i actually am. I'm currently silver 3, and shouldn't have to change team comps since they all seem to pick champs that i pick. It's ridiculous.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-02-17T11:04:26.405+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why yes, I am legit. \nI'm giving you fact of whats currently happening, and has been happening for the last year or so. \n\nI get it, you're triggered and hate knowing that Riot don't care. I don't blame you, BUT you don't have to come across as rude about it to me because of someone elses decision.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Nikirah","date":"2020-02-29T14:15:03.341+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are not bots. TFT mobile was released on OCE in beta. Smurfs from other regions testing the mobile version. There is no chat feature, or way to change your icon, or emote in the mobile version. They cannot see what you type in chat nor can they respond. TFT also does not give you XP towards your account.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Scary Time","date":"2020-02-27T11:13:12.541+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot nurturing the game? I don't think so you should try intro bots summoners rift all 4 members of the team are bots, Riot simply doesn't care, they care about money and profit and selling skins that is there business and nothing is going to change I been putting up threads over 2 years for Aram to be a balanced system and for there to be more evenly placed matches across the board, to stop smurfs and high tier players wrecking havoc against players like myself who just want to get a win in.\n\nThey wont fix anything this game will end up like Runescape a dead weight game with 3-4k playing it world wide with dwindling profits because why play league of legends right? why suffer through years of grinding for nothing just to have to start the same grind next year with a bunch of uncultured players who are toxic from other nations who don't know social norms? and cant accept defeat.\n\nI would rather keep league at arms length rather then go any deeper into underlining problems with TFT or Summoners rift more needs to be done to this game before its even recommendable to people.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Savagepaw","date":"2020-02-17T23:26:28.397+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't bots. They are mobile beta players. Players from other regions are making throwaway accounts to test mobile tft. Oce and Euw (possibly Eune too) are the only servers testers can play on atm in closed beta. There is also no chat or shop functions in mobile and you cannot change your player icon. Which is why theres so many default players who do not respond in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Addam","date":"2020-02-16T07:02:27.180+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd care less if they weren't in my god damn ranked games, in all honesty","replies":[]}]}
