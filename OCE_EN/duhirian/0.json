Not just LoL and other games, but TV shows, movies etc.\nI'm about as liberal as a person can get, I even let the Jehovah's into my house to chat (and I even went to church with them), because I wan't to learn all perspectives.\n\nI'm about as open minded as a person can be, but there are limits, and Riot is crossing them.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-15T12:57:21.412+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Believe me I respect your desire to actually understand other perspectives, and to prompt others to understand yours, instead of just saying I'm right you're wrong. It's frankly refreshing in a world where people are all to eager to tell people how much better they are.\n\nI also very much appreciate that you understand restraint. If you disagree with the rules of a community you're free to do so, but surely it should be a given that if you break those rules you will eventually be removed? Some rules are more reasonable than others, but that's true of any community, from MMO guilds to bible study groups.\n\nAs for Riot crossing those limits, I'm inclined to disagree. I have yet to see an actual case of someone being escalated for nothing, though I'm sure they do happen from time to time. But as I understand it you'd be in the \"no specific words should be punish worthy on their own\" camp? So I guess we're bound to disagree there.\n\nI agree that there *are* limits, but so far as best I can see Riot are handling things pretty well. A no tolerance stance is always risky, and you can never please everyone, but I think given the age range of this game taking a hard stance on certain things in particular isn't a bad move. Some things more than others, but we'll see how it continues to play out I guess.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-15T07:38:46.676+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"To be completely honest, the only time I ever here the \"N word\" said, is in American music and television, and 95% of the time it comes out of a black mans mouth.\nHow is this a no-no word for white people but completely fine for black people?\nThis is a prime example of \"reverse-racism\".\n\n[edit] Like here in New Zealand, Maori and Pacific Island people can get away with using 'that' word, but white people cant. They aren't of African heritage, so isn't that just as racist as if a white (Irish/German) guy like me said it?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-15T07:59:33.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The N word is a tricky one, and is arguably a lot more sensitive in the US than it is here. For me at least, and this seems to be the direction they've taken, it falls into a similar category as the six letter f word for gay person. It tends to be inherently negative, i.e, on it's own it would be negative, if someone just yells f$$$$t!! across the room at you, probably not a shining example of humanity.\n\nI agree that it should be either ok or not, but I also respect the whole \"take back the word\" ideal. Taking the word and making it your own means it can't be used to hurt you (anymore than any other swear), but if they want to go that route then *everyone* should be allowed to use the word provided it isn't in an offensive context. Obviously if someone is using it as a racist remark, no bueno. \n\nGay for example, it really isn't offensive anymore unless used in an explicitly offensive context, and even then, \"those filthy gays\" is pretty much the same as \"those filthy homosexuals\". I don't think we're quite there with the N word yet though.","replies":[{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-01-15T08:27:45.322+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=9iwGR9gB,comment-id=00030000,timestamp=2018-01-15T07:59:33.804+0000)\n> \n> Gay for example, it really isn&#x27;t offensive anymore unless used in an explicitly offensive context, and even then, &quot;those filthy gays&quot; is pretty much the same as &quot;those filthy homosexuals&quot;. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re quite there with the N word yet though.\n\nYeah, but 'gay' is in a real grey zone.\nIt was taken back and owned by the homosexual community, but the rest of society moved on and changed the meaning (like has been a few times over the last few hundred years with the word 'gay').\nIf I say to someone \"nah, I don't watch that TV show, it's gay\", I'm not expressing any contempt or dislike for the homosexual community.\nThe word does not mean \"I hate homosexuals\", nor does it refer to homosexuals in any way.\nIt is a plastic word that has changed meaning many times over hundreds of years. The homosexual meaning of the word 'gay' is probably the shortest lived in the history of that word, so they don't own it.\nFFS, gay used to mean happy.\n\nI have homosexual (gay) friends. I had a girlfriend with homosexual (gay) brothers. My cousin is homosexual (gay) and married to a guy I get along well with. I am friends with all these people, I am not homophobic.\nNo one can tell me I'm not allowed to use the word 'gay' for something I dislike.\n\nThe word '%%%g0t' though, also has had many meanings in the past, and is in the same boat. If I call someone a \"%%%\" I don't mean they are homosexual, I mean they are obnoxious or whatever.\n\nPeople can't claim words. The English language doesn't work that way.\nIf you want to play that game, I'll claim the word \"potato\" as offensive to my Irish heritage, and if anyone in-game says anything about potato PC or potato net, I'll have them banned.\n\nDo you see what a slippery slope this is?\n\n[edit] Oh wait, I'm a straight white male, any abuse against me is allowed because I'm a majority.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-01-15T09:00:35.420+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is true, and I think it's short history as an offensive term is largely why it was able to evolve so quickly, which isn't true of a lot of other offensive terms that either originated as slurs or have a much longer history of being one.\n\nAs for the f word, it still has that association, and if you want to say someone is obnoxious, why not just say \"fuck you're obnoxious\" or something, it has basically the same effect, and throwing slurs around for no real reason tends to discredit a statement. Don't get me wrong, I'm of the mind that among friends, intent is everything, but as soon as you enter a public forum, you have to consider that experiences will vary massively or risk being outcast from x community.\n\nIt's true that people can't claim words, as much as they might want to, and I wasn't trying to imply that, but some general situational awareness goes a long way for everyone not hating each other. That said, you're absolutely right, it's a slippery slope and we have to be careful not to let things go too far, but ofc everyone has different ideas of how far that is.\n\nAnd it's a fucking dumb idea that because you were born with certain advantages you don't have any valid experiences to draw from. I've never been criticised, ostracised or anything of the sort for being a gender or sexual orientation (for which I am very grateful), but that doesn't mean I've never had the asshole roommate or a struggling family relationship.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2018-01-15T00:46:58.744+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"N word ban worthy.","replies":[]}]}
