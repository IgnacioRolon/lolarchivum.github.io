I like the new client which looks really cool. However, I don't quite understand why Riot has removed the function which allows player to preview the skins for a particular champion before he locks in? I have bought over 300 skins in this game and I can hardly see them unless I click on my collection -> champions -> skins which is very troublesome. \r\n\r\nRiot please, get that function back for summoners.","replies":[]}
