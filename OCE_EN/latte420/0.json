I have been playing a lot over the last month with friends, and enjoying getting back into the game. I also want to note that there is a real value in this account to me, I've spent a lot of money and time over the years on this account and formed a lot of memories playing this game. \n\nI checked my emails when I got up this morning and saw an email saying I was permabanned, I assumed this would be just a phishing email but, when I tried to log in, I found out that I was permabanned. It says I've been permanently banned for \"the use of prohibited third party software\". I'm really at a loss for what to do. I submitted a ticket, figuring that was the best place to start. I've since logged on and checked my match history on a website to find that, hours after I went to bed, someone had played a game on my account. If you check yourself, they played as teemo (that wasn't me). Every other game in my match history I can remember playing, but that game I didn't play.\n\nI understand this sounds incredibly unbelievable, I've read dozens of posts like this on the forums and other sites over the years and have always seen them as probably someone's last ditch effort at getting unbanned when they did something wrong. But this is an account I really care about. I have never hacked, I think my rank, cs, score etc. are enough to attest to that. But please, please can someone tell me what I can do to get riot to believe me?\n\nFeeling so lost.\n\n\nEDIT: I've checked now and there were actually about 4 games played after I finished playing for the night.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-08-13T04:57:14.269+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, this sound like it could be a compromised account, in which case you'll want to submit an account recovery ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Recover my account\" option, you'll need to be logged out to do so). The support agent will want to verify that you're the original account owner, and will ask a series of questions to help that along. You wont have to answer all of them, just enough to prove beyond reasonable doubt (also, any information about the account that can't be accessed through Riot or 3rd party services might help). Hopefully, they'll be able to identify a compromise and take the case from there. Changing your password would also be a good idea.\n\nNote that if you have given your account details to anyone else, you *may* not receive the same assistance from support. Account sharing (in any of it's forms) is a breach of the ToU, and Riot tends to view compromises on shared accounts with significantly more scepticism.\n\nI would also recommend running an anti-virus scan on any personal computers you've used recently, as well as recommend the same to anyone who has a computer you've used for LoL recently (personally, I'd recommend Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for manual scans, as it tends to pick up a bit more than other anti-virus programs in my experience, but that's up to you). I'd also recommend ensuring the security of any important accounts (like emails, banks etc) just in case. The website https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is a good tool to help track down any compromises on your accounts as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Latte420","date":"2019-08-13T09:50:11.476+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the response. I have secured my account with a different password, howeverused a different pw for this account than for other ones so I can't understand how I'd be hacked. I've done multiple scans as well and can't seem to find anything, maybe I need better antivirus?? No clue. Also never have given my pw to anyone.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2019-08-13T14:57:52.650+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"From what you've said, I don't think you have any reason to worry about other accounts/services. If this compromise were the result of a compromised computer, or shared email (for example), then there would probably be other accounts getting compromised as well. Since that hasn't happened, it's probably just a case of someone managing to get access to your LoL account without anything else. It's just always a good idea to check all of that stuff in case there is a deeper issue, as it will allow you to get on top of the issue sooner rather than later.","replies":[{"poster":"Latte420","date":"2019-08-14T00:17:52.032+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand.
