Your placement is still heavily influenced by where you ended up last season and what you accomplished during preseason. If you’ve never played ranked, then your placements will be all that matters!\n> Preseason brought some substantial changes to the game (learn more about preseason here, so we’re again running a soft reset before placements kick off. As with previous years because of the soft reset, you’ll likely place lower than where you ended last year.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/competitive/2016-ranked-season-kicks-soon","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ljelite","date":"2016-02-05T01:25:16.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I just won 8 out of my 10 promos, and i was b4 ending last season, and i get placed in b5. how does this work :/ {{item:3070}} {{champion:77}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2015-11-12T20:18:29.993+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man,\n\nWhen the new season starts they do a reset yo your mmr. Something along the lines of (current mmr + some number) / 2 i think. Someone willing to look it up will tell you something more accurate. \n\nBasically if you do average in your provisional's you end up where you ended up last season.","replies":[{"poster":"NCG GarenMekanix","date":"2016-01-23T21:59:47.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was silver1, didnt play any ranked during preseason and then won 7/10 of my provisionals.

What you can do to help your chances of getting placed higher is to play ranked during the preseason. You can't change your rewards but your rank and mmr will still change, so when the big reset happens it can totally change the outcome.","replies":[]},{"poster":"CatchTheseHands","date":"2015-11-12T22:57:35.750+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In my exp i went from g4 season 4 to s4 season 5, yet i only lost 1 of my provisional's. i did put it down to a large losing streak during preseason that must have destroyed my mmr, based on that i came to the conclusion the provisional's mean very little, its actually your hidden mmr that determines your placement. my advice, do well in the preseason rack up some wins, go in and win over half your provisional's. should give you a good placement.","replies":[]}]}
