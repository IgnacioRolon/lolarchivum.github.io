I build Merc's, randuins. BORK, triforce, banshee's and at the end bought a sunfires over ga because they had mostly ad. He built Merc's, frozen heart, maw of malmortius, ravenous hydra thornmail and banshee's veil. he was not a very good player but we were both full build and i even had baron buff at one point. i was using my w as an auto reset and he wasn\"t even bothering to use ravenous active. it wasn't even close. he destroyed me with half health remaining. i don't understand why he was able to 1v1 me so easily. i had always assumed jax excelled in a 1v1 situation especially late game. can anyone offer any insight?","replies":[{"poster":"RNG Remilia","date":"2015-01-17T05:14:35.343+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"Think about every single item he bought, his build was literally made so that he could fight you 1v1.","replies":[{"poster":"DarthVrael","date":"2015-01-17T05:34:29.475+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pretty much as above. Darius also gets passive armor penetration where as you had none. It also would have been helpful to look at the death recap to see where his damage came from, specifically looking at how much damage his thornmail did since all you had for magic resist was Merc's.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Samurai Jin","date":"2015-01-17T05:13:52.475+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"idk how that is possible, you must of got outplayed.
