However, if she is banned or picked by the enemy team and the only role left for me is adc I'm done. I don't know why but I excell at trist but will end up just borderline feeding with any other adc. Can anyone suggest an adc with a similar play style or one that is just very simple. This is an issue for me when playing ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Acheron","date":"2015-01-28T07:59:54.344+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"trist is a very unique ADC in the fact most other ADCs hate her but she is very easily countered. if she jumps in and gets stunned she is dead. you could chose either:\n{{champion:51}}  \ncaitlyn is me personal favourite because of her long range and her ult finisher. she can hang back during laning and push whilst also easily being able to get out of ganks with her E. \n{{champion:104}} \ngraves is alike to trist in the whole \"burst in and clean table\" with his quickdraw and then his buckshot and then his slow smokescreen. (which is why i hate him with a burning passion)\n\nthe thing with these two champs is that they both fall off late game but both can get out of situations with both cait's net or Grave's quickdraw.\nalthough this is just my opinion so dont take too much to heart.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sethane","date":"2015-01-20T05:56:23.717+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Most adcs don't jave a jump they can engage on like tris can. But I do recommend some of the adc's no one plays if you want too learn adc. Sivir is simple and can survive ganks with her spellsheild and ulti movement. On top of that she can farm and split push better then tris and be useful in teamfights due too the aoe speed boost. I also recommend Quinn if you want more mobility. BEFORE YOU RAGE AT ME I have my reasons. She can survive most ganks with a support that has a ranged stun. Also Quinn can win most 1v1 duels, high mobility and because no one plays her no one really knows how too play against her. Hope this helps :)","replies":[{"poster":"daveeyx","date":"2015-01-21T11:14:00.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:15}} \nI'm not an adc main, but when I'm left with adc I usually play Sivir. The problem with her is that if you have a bad game people just go \"bg %%%% adc lost in champ select sivir useless champ\" because she's not meta, and I'd also assume this would be similar with Quinn. Sivir also doesn't have a jump and has a relatively short range, she's fairly dependent on positioning and using your Spell Shield effectively. \n\n{{champion:51}} \nI'd recommend Cait based on what you've said, she's reasonably simple, long range and does have an ability to reposition. She doesn't carry as hard as most of the others but you're almost always guaranteed to be effective just by standing at the back and auto attacking.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-01-19T13:59:40.041+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Trist has a really poor early game, maybe you focus too much on trying to beat the enemy lane instead of just farming and getting items which is mostly what trist needs to do to be effective.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sheepmoose","date":"2015-01-19T08:06:53.603+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"my shift keys aren't working so...\n\ni used to be the same, did well with trist but couldn't play other adcs. my advice is to firstly just practice playing other adcs, my first suggestion is {{champion:42}} because he also has a jump. trist is good if you're learning coz you can get away with w and she naturally scales well to late game even if you have a bad start...","replies":[]},{"poster":"DiabolicEsper","date":"2015-01-19T05:11:17.131+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If u feed a lot why not try Kog'maw{{champion:96}}  it'll change some of the outcome XD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Cuttledawgs","date":"2015-01-19T03:24:19.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think the reason I love her so much is the huge cleanup potential with her w, and also her slippriness from ganks etc with her w and ulti and also I love her range in the late game.

What is it you like about her kit? Do you like being able to jump in and kill everyone? Do you like the passive on her E? Do you like her massive disengage ultimate? \n\nSome ADCs that are worth trying are probably:\n{{champion:51}}- really easy adc to learn, has CC, great poke and amazing range in the early game\n{{champion:222}}- IMO, the closest thing to tristana in terms of resets (her passive) and aoe auto attack damage (with fishbones). Also has a great attack speed passive on her mini gun. Only problem with jinx is that she lacks a quick disengage unless you can trap your enemies in flame chompers (needs the right timing).\n\nSome others to consider are those that have dashes (kind of like Trist's jump), like {{champion:236}} and {{champion:104}}","replies":[]}]}
