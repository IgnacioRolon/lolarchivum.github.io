The Post game screen registered victory but the winning of my promos had not been registered. I took a screenshot that is now attached. When i looked at my match history it was fine, but looking at my league my promo games had &quot;shifted along&quot; as in my second promo had become registered as my first and my third had become my second. Can someone please shed some light on the matter.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-04-19T10:15:40.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">May or may not be related to the severe lag that some people have been experiencing.\n\nNothing's perfect.
