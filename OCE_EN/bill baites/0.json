I also have only been able to find one game where an obvious AFK stood out for me. \n\n>It's ruining my experience and I don't enjoy playing as much as I used to.\nIf this keeps going on I'm seriously thinking to start playing something else.\n\nIf you want to avoid players that you perceive to be ruining your games, the answer is simple; play ranked flex in a 5man. You can avoid everything you just described by handpicking your teammates each and every game. Do a bit of voice chat on discord, have a karaoke party, whatever you feel is needed to make the game fun. \n\n\n> They are not afraid of the tribunal because apparently they rarely get a ban and if they do is 5 or 20 minutes.\n\nWe don't have a tribunal\n5/20 minute bans are only a thing for leaver buster (the AFK detection) and are actually called [low priority queue](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ). it places players in a queue that they have to wait 5-20 minutes (x5) before getting into an actual queue. If they continually AFK despite leaver buster punishment, then we start getting into account suspension territory. \n\nWe do have the instant feedback system. If you report accurately (example: not reporting everyone who is having a bad game under \"feeding\"), then you can be assured that your reports are stacking up against a player \n\n[the punishments escalate as follows:](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/Boqd81O0-upcoming-upgrades-to-chat-restrictions)\n\n* 10 game chat restriction\n*  25 game chat restriction\n* 14 day account ban\n* Permanent account ban\n\nBehaviour that is considered severe (like racism/sexism/homophobia) is enough to have you skipping to a punishment tier (although not usually instant perma). \n\nFor games where you can't obviously see what people are doing from that chat logs, be sure to still report them and leave a comment on what they were doing (comment is very important and helps the system learn). It can trigger a manual review of the games, which can also lead to bans[ Example ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation/WQdqZQOw-temp-banned-can-riot-email-me-my-chat-log?comment=0004).","replies":[{"poster":"Bill Baites","date":"2017-01-13T13:29:32.047+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well, I wish you could look at the in-game chat.

Never get into arguments, it just increases negative attitudes on your team.\n\n\n\nStage one: focus on your gameplay\nStage two: once you gameplay is good, think about how you can help your team (bolster those that are doing well, and work with them(increasing moral in the team))\nStage three: learn to make shot calls, and setup plays in the team(skill level increases respect, and willingness to listen)\n\nBronze is filled with a large mix of skill levels, what you may think is someone feeding might be a low skill level playing against a much higher skill level player.  Some of the things i can get away with in bronze would be less effective in silver, and punished in gold or higher.\n\nAs a support main, if I am with a low skill level ad, I just ask them to cover my retreat from an engage harrass, not to try and follow up.  Unfortunately many low skill level ad's think they are alot better than they really are, try and follow up and die.   Not listening to reduce pressure game plays.","replies":[{"poster":"Bill Baites","date":"2017-01-13T12:58:01.788+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm not talking about feeding unintentionally because it happens to me as well sometimes... I'm talking specifically about players that feed intentionally or afk intentionally. How do I know they're doing it? They told me themselves!!! It's so frustrating.\n\nI'm not a negative player and I hate toxicity so I never flame if someone is feeding because they got countered or because their skill level is lower than that of their opponent. But I do get upset when they do it intentionally to ruin everyone's game.\n\nThanks for your comment Strewth. I appreciate your recommendation and I will try to follow them.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
