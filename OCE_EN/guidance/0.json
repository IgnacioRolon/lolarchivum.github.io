Being able to **potentially** do 105% max health true damage sounds strong. But in my opinion the current Fiora passive/ult is pretty balanced. Main reasons below;\n\n1) You have to proc the passive on 1 champion on 4 different sides, which requires really good positioning and movement and/or rely on Fiora's one dash (Q).\n\n2) To achieve 105% max health true damage on 4 hits every the build is ALL AD with 4 dragons. This would make it insanely hard to survive long enough to get all 4 hits or event most into the right position to get all 4 hits","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-08-20T09:53:59.033+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can play her like Yasuo ADC with a good CC support, maybe.

But in trying to answer your question as completely as I can I'm going to give it a shot as there's clearly a component of your question that involves pretty specific numbers in regards to Fiora.\n\nMost of what you're asking has to do with the specific numbers on Fiora's passive so let's take a closer look at those numbers.\n\nFiora's passive at level one with no runes or masteries provides 3% true damage per Vital spot hit for a total of 12% for all four during Grand Challenge (obviously we can't ult at Level 1, but it's good to have a comparison and understand the baselines we're looking at). \n\nI took the scaling numbers from the League of Legends wiki (Source: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Fiora) and as far as I can tell (again maths = awful) Fiora gets a set percentage increase to her passive damage per 100 AD, scaling at a base percent + her level. At MAX level, Fiora gets a 4.5% increase to her passive for every hundred attack damage. Obviously that number is going to fluctuate as you're not always going to be at Lvl 18 but let's use that anyway as a demonstration. \n\nSo to easily calculate Fiora's passive damage per 100 AD we can simply use this equation: 3% + (Total AD/100) x 4.5%.\n\nNow that we have a better understanding on Fiora's passive damage numbers, let's look at the example you gave and try to compare it to a more typical game of League of Legends. As your screenshot indicates, clearly the potential for crazy damage is there, but you have a monstrous amount of AD in that screenshot - 617 to be exact - which works out to be more than a quarter of someone's health in TRUE DAMAGE per Vital hit. That's absolutely insane and you probably do only need one proc to savage someone in a duel, but is that indicative of a regular game of League?\n\nI wasn't sure so I tried to pull a relevant example, thankfully your summoner icon inspired me! I went ahead and checked out Raydere's Sivir build from Game 1 of the OPL Finals to see how much AD he had towards the end of the game. Keep in mind Raydere is pretty fed in this first game, sitting on FOUR items at ~36 minutes. His team also has four dragons, which plays into the example you gave.\n\nHere's the timestamp I used if you want to check out where I'm pulling this from (or if you wanted to re-watch the Final, that would work too!) - https://youtu.be/hrqUWjpkAZk?t=55m14s\n\nSo how much AD does he have? 346. Let's round this up to 350 just to make the numbers a bit cleaner.\n\nIf Fiora had that much AD and was Level 18, her passive would do 18.75% per Vital hit for a total potential of 75% total true damage. \n\nThat's actually QUITE a lot of damage. But it's nowhere close to the 25%+ from your example and to me, this Chiefs game is a lot more indicative of realistic numbers in a match of League and Raydere is even operating in this game in fairly OPTIMAL conditions. \n\nTo be fair, he also has a Phantom Dancer, which does not provide any AD at all so let's try and convert that 2800 gold into more AD to get a slightly more realistic number for a full AD Fiora in similar conditions to Raydere in this game. \n\nThankfully a BF Sword, Pickaxe and Long Sword costs 2785 gold which is as perfect as it's going to get for this example! Altogether that adds up to 85 additional AD so let's add that on top of our other number to get Fiora's new theoretical total AD of 435.  For the sake of example (and because I've not calculated mastery bonuses for this new AD total), let's round up AGAIN to 450 to make the numbers cleaner.\n\nFiora's passive in this new situation now does 23.25% damage per Vital hit for a whopping total of 93% potential True Damage.\n\nAgain, like our other example, that's actually a pretty nuts amounts of damage and it's easy to see that even one or two procs (which is much more reasonable than all four) does a substantial amount of damage just from her passive!\n\nBut again, I think the best way to address your question has to do with realistic expectations for your average League of Legends game. Clearly she does a lot in optimal or perfect conditions and even in strong conditions like the one's listed above she does good damage with her passive as well.\n\nWe could pull examples forever and examine Fiora's power points based on exact amounts of AD but let's just set up a quick table per hundred AD as a reference for Fiora's passive damage, again for the sake of clean and easy numbers I'm assuming Fiora is MAX level for these calculations. The first number is per Vital, the second number in brackets is total potential damage.\n\n100 AD -  7.5% (30%)\n200 AD - 12% (48%)\n300 AD - 16.5% (66%)\n400 AD - 21% (84%)\n500 AD - 25.5% (102%)\n\nBy the looks of things you have to be breaking 400 Attack Damage to really be doing insane things with Fiora's passive and I think 300 or 350 is a bit more of a realistic example which is still good damage, but nowhere near the amounts we first looked at keep in mind also that ALL of my numbers were inflated to provide cleaner examples so they're not necessarily as impressive or accurate as an actual Fiora game would be.\n\nTo me, while her passive clearly provides good damage, even in optimal situations you're unlikely to get so much damage output from it alone and by the numbers I don't think Fiora's passive is overboard at all. Is it good? Absolutely! Especially in situations where you're duelling people.\n\nIn fact, seeing as Fiora IS the Duelist, let's talk a bit about her playstyle and some general counterplay to melee carries.\n\nMelee carries do a lot of damage, anyone who has even had a fed Master Yi run around their game killing everyone can attest to the raw damage output that a melee carry can dish out. But that damage comes at a big price: you have to get in range to start doing damage and you need to STAY in range to continue doing that damage.\n\nYou could have 2k DPS as Yi or Fiora (I'm pretty sure that's borderline if not actually impossible in League btw) but if you can't get in range to do your damage it's going to mean nothing.\n\nClearly Fiora has some good tools to fight this sort of thing. Between Riposte being able to outplay crowd control, a good dash and some strong movement speed buffs Fiora can get around skirmishes well and be able to fight the big issue that plagues melee AD carries: getting kited or crowd controlled. \n\nHere's a great example that made the rounds on Reddit today regarding some Big Fiora Plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXOYa0l0ODQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nWhat's the one thing that really sticks out in this clip? To me it's the fact that all these huge plays are being made in small skirmishes or 1v1s. A.k.a. DUELS. The place where Fiora really sets herself apart!\n\nIf you facecheck a whole team, especially if they have good crowd control, you're going to have a much worse time than Fiora did in that video and your sweet passive isn't going to do all that potential damage it can do =(\n\nSo, taking this all in it's pretty easy to see that even in situations that are great for you (the Fiora in that clip is pretty damn fed) the nature of melee carries is such that you'll need to make sacrifices in order to be useful in combat-relevant situations. Long story short: you most likely can't build nothing but Flat AD and even if you did you'd need a metric craptonne of it before your passive started doing eyebrow-raising levels of damage.\n\nAll to say that while I think her passive in strong, I think it's in a good place and doesn't look to me to be overtuned right now.\n\nObviously this post only addresses the damage portion of Fiora's passive as that was what the original post was exploring but here's a quick look at the healing portion of Fiora's ulti while we're at it.\n\nFiora's ultimate Grand Challenge has a pretty good heal and one that I think most people would compare to Janna's ultimate Monsoon.\n\nFor reference Janna's ult at MAX level heals for 200 health per second, with no additional scaling added at all. Fiora's ultimate heal at the same level (MAXIMUM) heals for 140 health per second + 60% of her bonus AD. \n\nThat's means if we're looking to match Janna's ultimate as far as base healing goes we'll need an additional 100 BONUS AD exactly which is actually not that bad! Still, it's certainly an investment and while Fiora's heal is great when you trigger it, it's very clearly not Janna's ultimate (even just looking at the base values). I know the OP didn't originally ask after the heal, but I thought if I was already going through numbers given that their was some discussion about it in this thread, I'd mention the numbers to aid that discussion too!\n\nBefore I finish I'll just share a few things about Fiora that I learnt from investigating all these numbers/information. Here's some tips for any of you budding or possibly veteran Fiora players out there that are still adjusting to the re-work!\n\n* The % based damage from your passive means your 1v1 trades in lane are VERY good if you can get the relevant poke onto Vitals in, this is especially true once you have Grand Challenge (seeing as it's much easier to hit 1 of 4 spots than 1 of 1) so keep that in mind from your laning!\n* \n* The Riposte 'parry' timer is exactly 0.75 seconds long, so you have a very strict window to parry that key crowd control, but it's obviously great for your mobility if you can time it (and it makes you feel like an absolute baller).\n* \n* Lunge is on a crazy short cooldown at Max rank (it literally halves from 16 seconds to 8) and gets reduced further if you dash to a champion. Given that Lunge also prioritizes Vitals (which in turn give you movement speed when you pop them from Duelist's Dance) it's vital (heh) that you make good use of this ability in skirmishes/duels.\n* \n* Vitals on an enemy once hit will always re-appear on the opposite side (so if you hit top left the next one will appear either top-right or bottom-right never bottom-left, hope that makes sense) so factor that in when you're manoeuvring around people! \n\nAnnnnnd done!\n\n**TL;DR She's fun, she's fine. She's Fiora!**","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-08-20T06:23:25.209+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ignore the fact that even with a defensive item and boots, it's still disgustingly high.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"McRuthless","date":"2015-08-20T05:37:32.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know theres a champ that can do 100% max hp magic damage with enough AP.
