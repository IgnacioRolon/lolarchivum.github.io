This is good because as players in solo queue we can learn from this as to how to adjust how we go about champion select and improve as players going into the new system.\n\n---\n\nOverall though that is just my opinion on how it might end out if Riot were to do it with only in plat+ let me know your thoughts on the points that I have brought up. If there is anything I can clarify on or any other questions I can answer let me know. Good luck in your games.\n\n~Elam","replies":[]}]}
