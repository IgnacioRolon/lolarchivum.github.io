I was considering not getting bloodthirster because of the already 12% lifesteal but I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s enough, I would like to know your opinion :P  thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2015-09-29T23:28:56.886+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In all honesty I highly disagree with your build, whats with all the attack speed? If it's for the passive his abilities can already build stacks up fast enough in a fight, also you should remove the frozen mallet as your E already give a massive slow. You could also maybe include {{item:3065}} or {{item:3742}} and take {{item:3111}} or {{item:3047}} depending who you're up against. Darius is all about sustain in a fight so you need to build up some defense alongside all that AD.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-29T15:34:18.446+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you're doing unorthodox builds or considering Lifesteal over more damage you should consider the matchup, for example if the enemy team have a lot of Assassins it can be worthwhile taking some lifesteal to be able to sustain through their damage because they're often bursty whereas if they have a fair few tanks - raw damage will probably help you come out on top. Builds should really be changed situationally when considering 3rd and 4th items etc or what order to take items in etc.\n\n{{item:1324}} {{item:3134}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3078}} {{item:3142}} {{item:3071}} {{item:3143}} ","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-27T07:58:09.766+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Drop the frozen mallet as you already have an inbuilt slow (W) and get both.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-09-27T08:36:05.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"*[insert \"why not both\" GIF here]*","replies":[{"poster":"Jink","date":"2015-09-29T15:30:56.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://memecrunch.com/meme/VT4T/why-not-both/image.png","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ABlueQuaker","date":"2015-09-29T10:00:31.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{item:3111}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3035}} {{item:3065}} {{item:3071}} is about as Offensive as a Darius build should get.

You really dont need all that attackspeed to do it , as your abilities are strong enough and you really should be using them as your main damage output and stacks , only using auto attacks in between abilities . As your all short range skills and lacking in mobility you really want to build more defensively so that you can survive being in the middle of the enemy team. Out of IE and BT you should definitely get BT , the shield and extra sustain compliment darius much more then critical strikes. Id get rid of the Pdancer too for something like a deadmans plate or randuins/sunfire ect.","replies":[]},{"poster":"KagamiArata","date":"2015-09-27T10:29:28.423+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Your build have too much offensive items and you are melee and will most probably get kited. Other than that Darius really doesn't need that much ad because his passive gives him a lot of ad and his skills base damage are extremely high. I would say two damage items is all you need on Darius and just go full tank from there. it might be better for you to go {{item:3071}} {{item:3074}} {{item:3742}} {{item:3111}} {{item:3143}} {{item:3065}}.  With this build you will be tanky as fck and your heals with Q will be amplified by spirit visage and merc treads reduce the duration of CC and black cleaver helps you stick to your targets and 30% CDR reduces your skills CD since Darius is more of an ad caster then an auto attack based champion. Armor pen from black cleaver and your E passive should be enough to make your damage relevant throughout the game. You can switch out the ravenous hydra for a bloodthirster if you don't like hydra.
