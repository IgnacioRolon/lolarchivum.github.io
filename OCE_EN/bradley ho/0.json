I was already Bronze in skill level but now I am even worse. I tried to research on how to improve myself but I couldn't find any updated sources. I have been so bad that my friends don't really want to play with me. Also I tried to switch my fingers on different letters (q, w, e, r, etc) and put my {{summoner:4}}  on space which made me do some accidental flashes (as my camera center on camera button was on space). This has negatively influenced my muscle memory to a point where I am can't react half as fast as I could to which was slow to begin with. Also I only play on Friday, Weekends and holidays due to studies. I am looking for sources or tips or anything else that could improve my mechanics and decision making. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nI hope I go from {{champion:32}} to{{champion:79}} (Sad to happy)\r\nI am not sure if this post is suitable in Gameplay & Strategy","replies":[{"poster":"Saldean","date":"2015-02-24T01:32:10.563+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know that there is a website that you would like to use for LoL purposes to improve yourself as a player. LOLclass now has free content however I think you most register for their content that are still being released until now. The site is good to use and you can view it at your disposal. What else I do is twitch streams or any games that are on spectate mode just for important little information that are put out. Overall playing more games get's you going as well so you will improve nevertheless with the skills you have. :>","replies":[{"poster":"Bradley Ho","date":"2015-02-24T06:20:46.590+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you!
