When I'm talking about the same movement and attack pattern, I basically mean how the bot(s) follow the same pathing by going into enemy turrets and attacking them every single time without any proper skill initiation, just an auto-attack or the bots just staying still for a  few seconds then walking once again and following that same lane and pattern over again. \n\nNow there is a difference between a player who doesn't know what to build and a bot who's just building items that make no sense to that champion under any sense. Because a person who is trying to know what to build can at least refer to the recommended items where a bot would either buy nothing at all and initiate the ''same movement and attack pattern of either diving into an enemy turret auto attacking the rival champion or diving into a 1v4''. Another action they usually do is standing still and not moving at all when being attacked by the enemy. \n\nBeing passive and aggressive has nothing to do with what I was talking about; I'm more talking about what was stated above. \n\nIn regards to your second question, it was more-so of a joke because obviously it's not RNG, there are tons of bots in this game however AFK farming may not be punishable BUT using a third-party software definitely is and trust me, Riot does actually handle it well. I made a report a few days back on a definite bot, got sorted and the bloke got banned. \n\nI don't mind if someone is new, trying to learn how to play or build - but a bot is a bot, it's just an afk-script continuing the same movement and attack pattern and buying items that make no sense or no items at all throughout the whole game. I do understand that some people don't communicate, I don't do it as much as well as I just pretty much play music at times and just mute everything else. However - that being said, there are so many indicators of a bot that is obvious at some point in the match.

I understand some people may not be as good as others, fair play - but you can usually tell the difference between a bot and an unskilled player (in role/tactic/mechanic). Bots usually always follow the same routine of movement and attacking every single time. They will buy items that make no sense and won't talk the whole game. \n\nI just keep reporting them because it does honestly ruin the game for everyone. Other then that though, just hope the RNG gods don't put an AFK-script into your game.","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2019-03-10T13:15:00.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"2 Questions aye.\n1st:\n> Bots usually always follow the same routine of movement and attacking every single time.

Its at the point its common as hell, but is unpunishable because \"AFK farming isn't a thing\". \n\nIm not taking a shot or stab, i really just wanna hear your view on this.","replies":[]}]}]}
