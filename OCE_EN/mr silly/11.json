So for example, say I'm on 40 gold on round 3.1. That means at the end of combat I'll receive the baseline 5 gold plus an EXTRA 4 gold from interest (+ whatever from win/loss). Then I'll get an another EXTRA 4 gold at the end of round 3.2, so on and so forth until the end of round 3.6. Add up that EXTRA gold you've earnt across rounds 3.1-3.6 and if it comes to 20 or more you get the mission complete.\nHope this helps!","replies":[{"poster":"shadelas","date":"2019-07-27T02:21:29.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I started 3-1 at 8 gold and finsh with 50+ gold at the end of 3-6 and it has not been finsh","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Killian426","date":"2019-07-22T16:24:41.477+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"My guess would be, 5 gold per turn, 5 gold from interest, max of 4 from pirates, 3 from a win/loss streak of 8 or more and then you'd have to get gold from one of the later creep rounds?

I think they mean by stage. Like earn 20 gold during Stage 4 before it turns to stage 5. I also think they are only talking about interest and not gold you earn from selling champions. RIOT needs to learn that words can't just be interchanged. They need to be defined and then used correctly.\n\nRIOT needs to understand the importance of verbiage. They have no idea what their key words are and what they mean. Turn. Stage. Round. Gold. Interest. Ect. All these words need to be defined and consistently used without being swapped or interchanged. This is not the first weekly mission that was confusing and will not be the last until they have this figured out.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bureido sama","date":"2019-07-22T20:11:03.594+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"i've finished the mission in a game where i've used a lot of gold to refresh inone turn, maybe its what they mean by mining","replies":[{"poster":"UsagiYashaHime","date":"2019-07-22T22:03:19.103+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"OMG...
