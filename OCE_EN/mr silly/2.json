No other human players. What the heck! Every game in the past few days is 5 or more bots and today was only bots vs ME. (Always a LVL 1 river sprite, weird names, no/black summoner icon, lightning-fast placement times, always take all the champs I start picking). Obviously, this is a massive problem, as I keep seeing posts about it all over the place, however, there never seems to be any response from riot or admins. Gotta fix this soon RIOT or TFT won't be playable.","replies":[{"poster":"Savagepaw","date":"2020-02-17T23:24:45.949+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They aren't bots. They are mobile beta players. Players from other regions are making throwaway accounts to test mobile tft. Oce and Euw (possibly Eune too) are the only servers testers can play on atm in closed beta. There is also no chat or shop functions in mobile and you cannot change your player icon. Which is why theres so many default players who do not respond in chat.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AGoldenShovel","date":"2020-02-17T16:35:21.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am one of these strange players.I am not a robot, just a mobile player from other era.Since the mobile TFT only opens Australian and European servers, we can only come here to register for a new account to play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2020-02-17T10:00:00.763+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot don't check boards anymore, complaints fall on deaf ears, you can always send a support ticket, but i severely doubt they do anything about that either.\n\nThe sooner the game dies, the better","replies":[{"poster":"Exarch Leona","date":"2020-02-17T14:04:44.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support tickets achieve nothing either.\nRiot just out right do not care anymore.
