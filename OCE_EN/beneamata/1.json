No lag throughout the entire game, just a sudden &quot;attempting to reconnect &quot; error that refuses to resolve itself.\r\nLast night I restarted the client and it would not let me log in before a few attempts.. As soon as i did,  I was back in the game after about 10 mins. \r\nThe second time, I attempted the same thing (had no issue logging into the client) but could not return to the game at all..\r\nThird time now,  I was dropped.. was able to get in after MANY &quot;retry&quot; attempts but was dropped a second time and cannot get in.\r\nI will not attempt another game until I figure this out as it is not fair to my team-mates..","replies":[]}
