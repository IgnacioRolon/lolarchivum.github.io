This time more than any other, truly. I spot out legendary champions from each side of this battle-to-be. On the main opposing side I see Darius, Draven, Le Blanc , Swain , Elise, Warwick, Singed, Riven, Cassiopeia, the beautifully talented and ever evading Katarina and many more. Beside me, my allies new and old; my sister Luxanna, my friend and king Jarvan IV, Xin Zhou, Galio, Quinn, Vayne and more. The thing that I am curious about is who will come out of the other two bases.\r\nIn all my time with the League I have never thought that they would put every great champion into one battlefront. Given the battlefield is enormous, but there are so many here. I only had time in the fountain to make friends with a few as we shopped and readied ourselves for the oncoming onslaught of glorious battle but I am sure they are all (as Fiora put it) &ldquo;worthy opponents&rdquo;. Perhaps this battle will end and I can settle things with Katarina once and for all or perhaps I may have to settle it during the battle, I may not be ready for either, but **I am willing for both**. Our announcer welcomes us to the battle and the gate opens. This time most of the arena is lit up with no fog in site apart from bushes, bases and some parts of this enormous jungle. Most likely where each jungle monster is. The rules set out for us by the League were clear. Winning is not about pushing bases and destroying a nexus. But having the last remaining members when the battle ends, if the timer goes for too long then sudden death will occur where no more entry to bases is permitted and health regeneration is disabled however for me that won&rsquo;t matter so much as most of my regeneration is my own source and not permitted to me by the League but through my own strength, every item is free and each champions items are hidden from our vision. We all wander to our paths deciding what will be best for us. Unfortunately, Jarvan IV has taken to the centre (whereas I prefer the upper most path) and he must be protected and so I will join him along with our closest allies Lux, Xin and Galio and a few others. As our minions arrive it is time to start the fight.\r\nAcross from us is Darius, Draven, Swain, Urgot, Riven, a few others and Katarina&hellip; A perfect match. Each minion will give nearby allies shared experience with a bonus to the killer. I will need an early lead to vanquish our foes quickly as possible. As the first minion becomes weakened I hit my decisive strike. Gaining the first bit of experience in the battlefield. I&rsquo;ve left myself open and Katarina throws her blades at me in an organised attack as Darius decimates our first wave of minions whilst Draven showily bounces axes off of the weakened minions, Talon alongside secures another minion with Leblanc. Just as the first blade reaches me so does Lux&rsquo;s cast of her prismatic barrier over me. An unnecessary move? Just then I notice Urgot&rsquo;s Corrosive charge also hit and break the barrier, that&rsquo;s why I was being shielded. Swain&rsquo;s Decrepify went unnoticed and is sure to hurt a fair bit. I&rsquo;m too far in front. My allies are behind me. Why aren&rsquo;t they alongside me? Just then Prismatic Barrier swings back and shields me once more as Draven throws an axe my way and Viktor burns up the ground underneath me. This is my chance. I go in to decisive strike but, instead head back towards my own teammates.  Now I understand why they were not alongside of me. Riven is attacking Xin, my team has secured all minions, Galio and Quinn take on Draven who has moved behind me alongside of Darius. Jarvan and Swain are locked one on one and Lux&rsquo;s barrier has clearly been cast over them all. I use my Decisive Strike on Leblanc to prevent her from lunging in but this battle does not appear to be being won by my allies. Jarvan calls for a retreat as Taric now contains us all in his healing. We stand under tower and suddenly I hear it. The roar of the other two gates. This map is a maze and more minions are coming through. We keep our fight coming wave after wave of minions and all at once our foes change their positioning and all jump on Jarvan IV, not yet. It&rsquo;s too early. I must protect him. He contains them all in his cataclysm and Galio provides a shield and an escape for him whilst Xin jumps in and pushes them back towards the walls of the cataclysm. But it&rsquo;s a sacrifice. They both put up a valiant fight and do substantial damage. It won&rsquo;t be enough to take them all down. Suddenly a cyclone tears through them all and Yasuo jumps in and attack, locking them all within what will be his last breath, another sacrifice to the team. Our announcer calls out more names. I wasn&rsquo;t even listening to the first that have come through. The names listed &ldquo;Riven, Cassiopeia, Galio, Xin Zhou has been slain&rdquo; and then &ldquo;Yasuo has been slain&rdquo;. By now twenty or thirty names must have been called out. Yasuo must have chosen to ally with us. That is the reason the other two sides were locked in their bases for. Each champion of the other two sides must choose his allies and foes from each champion in the battle. Before we can recollect Kha zix attacks us for a chance to prey on our low health Quinn, however turns at the last second as she pushes him back and attacks Vayne. She is cut through and tumbles to become invisible to him. But is spotted by Reksai and she sends a Prey Seeker out. &ldquo;Vayne has been slain&rdquo;. We&rsquo;re now two men down and are scrambling for a plan. They&rsquo;re closing in.\r\n**&ldquo;BREAK THEIR RANKS&rdquo;**\r\nBefore I know it I am spinning through them and I cut through Rek Sai to further kill Elise (The most effective way to kill an opponent is to slice through the man next to him). I&rsquo;ve taken some damage but I can still fight using courage. As I do I feel a sparkling sensation as Taric begins his Cosmic radiance. This will be just enough to get me through. Jarvan spears through Talon. Then we hear it &ldquo;Sudden death&rdquo;. We go all in as a Trueshot Barrage plows through them &ldquo;Noxians, I hate Noxians&rdquo;. Taric seems overjoyed, meanwhile the announcer calls out 30 more names. It must be at least 100 names by now. Renekton joins the fray quickly slices through me and dices through Ezreal in our backline. Taric goes insane. Using his bravado, he hits Renekton twice in quick succession and the announcer calls out names just as fast. Darius performs his Noxian Guillotine on Taric &ldquo;Taric has been slain&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s begun. Left and right Darius comes crashing from the sky &ldquo;Ezreal has been slain, Quinn has been slain&rdquo;. Kha zix, Darius and Urgot all turn to me. I&rsquo;m done for&hellip; \r\n**&ldquo;RAWR&rdquo; **\r\nRengar leaps over me, throws Bola and stabs through Kha zix. &ldquo;Kha zix has been slain.&rdquo; Darius is quick and takes the advantage &ldquo;Rengar has been slain&rdquo;. Darius and Draven both turn to Luxanna, she uses final spark. &ldquo;Draven has been slain&rdquo; &ldquo;Swain has been slain&rdquo;. &ldquo;Lux has been slain&rdquo;&hellip;\r\n**&ldquo;DEMAACIIAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!&rdquo; **\r\nSimultaneously he jumps on me, but it won&rsquo;t be enough to save him. &ldquo;Darius has been slain&rdquo;. Guardians Angel kicks in and I make it. Viktor uses Chaos storm &ldquo;Jarvan has been slain&rdquo;. My blood is hot, but not like Olafs &ldquo;Viktor and Urgot have been slain&rdquo;. My last attack must be now. I run in and prevent Katarina&rsquo;s death lotus with a decisive strike. She&rsquo;s down and I&rsquo;m barely up. We&rsquo;ll have to settle this on the field it seems. Together we step as we begin our last dance. Her sandtorm against my Desert trooper&hellip; together we dance our blade dance to the music of ringing steel around us. I charge with all my courage and she swiftly uses Shunpo to get to me.\r\n**PAWOOF**\r\n&ldquo;hehehaha&rdquo; &ldquo;hahaha&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe poison takes its toll and we lie side by side, our bodies being drained of health. Is this how it ends&hellip;\r\n\r\n\r\n**- OCE Garen**  \r\n{{champion:86}}","replies":[{"poster":"PhantomFable","date":"2016-06-27T06:34:31.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"this is really good :)","replies":[]}]}
