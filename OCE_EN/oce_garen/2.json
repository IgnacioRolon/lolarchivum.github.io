Firstly the OCE servers have been in very poor condition lately and people with ping tests of 17-30 are experiencing 100-400 ping in game. Secondly WHY THE HELL is it possible to join a game and get a message saying you have been afk and the game will now exit. That is pure crap. Would it not be more helpful if there was no message so that said that and the player was then free to rejoin and help the team? Thirdly every time I re-enter the shop it has closed out and needs to reload. Can these problems not be fixed?","replies":[]}
