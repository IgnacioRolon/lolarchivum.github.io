Legit just group as 5, 15 minutes in making champs that require items or levels useless. Theres nothing you can do but pick early game champs and just group with team for whole game pushing down bot lane and getting inhib pre 20 minutes every time.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-28T06:03:49.269+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Pretty much every patch aimed for the pros sucks for the rest of us peasants.\n\nIf you want my opinion, i think the game should be balanced around the majority of the players (bronze/silver/gold), not the 1 percenters in challenger.\nthe top players are good enough to deal with changes aimed at us, but we aren't good enough to play around the changes aimed for them.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-07-28T07:52:17.036+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I disagree. Why would you balance around the playerbase who has the smallest understanding of how to play the game?\nThe game should and hopefully will always be balanced around professional play/highest tier of play because that is as close to how the game \"should\" be played, then Riot simply review the meta and adjust as needed to bring it in line with their vision.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-07-28T08:39:45.294+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The same reason they make cars to suit housewives instead of F1 drivers.\n\nbecause 99% of the population don't drive cars with the same skill as F1 drivers.\n\nthere is no 'should be played' in a game, the point of a game is to have fun, so if you're having fun, you're playing 'as intended'\nand if op champs run rampant in 99% of the population's MMR, just because faker knows how to play against them. Then fewer people are having fun, and the game is counter productive.","replies":[{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-07-28T11:07:30.520+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well I'm sure Riot do their best to ensure that players of all skill levels can enjoy the game. But it is partly being sold as a competitive game ( look at the money they are pouring into developing the e-sport scene ) and they do need to provide game design to facilitate exciting, tactical and skillful gameplay, something the lower elos do not possess.\nBuffing or nerfing champions based around low elos would result in very useless or very broken champions in higher elos because their understanding of the game is at a much higher level.  Although this does already exist to a degree and champions/items have been buffed/nerfed to alleviate lower elo problems , im looking at you Yi. \n\nIf Riot wanted to sell the game as a \"fun\" casual game then I'm sure it would have been released as league of mario party, that you can play on your phone/tablet while watching tv. \"Fun\" games are usually much more basic and much easier for a wider population to play.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Volcanuz","date":"2016-07-28T05:11:34.018+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Have yet to see this happen really. People do come bot and push it hard but it isn't hard to counter it or stop it just with 2 maybe 3 people. And if your top pick is right you can have top and mid pushed so hard before they even get T2 tower so i don't understand your hate for the patch. The tower changes aren't in yet and same with siege as it was reverted/stopped in the patch cycle for a later date.\n\nUnless something drastic changed i think you are just getting unlucky.","replies":[{"poster":"Tempered in Salt","date":"2016-07-31T10:29:27.452+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed a team fight under tower is disastrous for the tower divers, two champions with descent cc or wave clear can easily halt a team of 5 in their tracks unless they have tanks with massive health and tower dive specific capabilities (eg. {{champion:12}} ) and it's not even worth it considering the fact that one of their lanes could be pushed in hard and tower traded or objective traded.
