Wouldn't it be better to slap people like this on the wrist and give them a 14-day ban Because as of late people it's actually very common to have\n \n1. A racist towards Chinese\n2. To go AFK after losing the early game\n3. Someone to say kill yourself over a fucking video game\n4. See someone get intentionally griefed or get griefed\n5. someone goes AFK for half of the game to type in chat\n6. Getting spammed ping is the norm if you don't it's rare\n\nwhy does the report system lack common sense? why doesn't riot care?  \nWhat I'm scared about is there are younger people playing this game on a regular basis and over time this could affect or already has affected their mindset. What happens outside? What happens to their moral compass? Their thoughts could look like something like this \"It's ok to express hatred to Asians online as long as riot lets me.\" or \"It's ok to say Kill yourself if someone makes a mistake or gives me advice about the game\" to a suicidal teen who was only trying to be helpful. \nRiot you NEED to take steps to remove players who are on to use this game as a coping mechanism in a bad way or a way to express their hatred towards races.\nSo please fix your FUCKING YOUR REPORT SYSTEM YOU BUNCH OF FUCKING DOLTS {{sticker:zombie-brand-facepalm}}\n\n**[REMOVED - [Reporting other players](https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/BjArMH2B-boards-universal-rules)]**","replies":[{"poster":"Ä„ngel","date":"2019-11-27T10:19:38.354+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I said \"kys\" once during a game and got a two week ban (recently), so I'm not sure how you think people aren't getting banned for it (for additional context, I'm not toxic for the most part. and I'm never the first to START being toxic. I just react really poorly towards others being toxic to myself or my other teammates.. so yes, with a clean track record you can still instantly get a 2 weeker for 'kys').\n\nIn saying that, it's common knowledge that the banning system is biased and unfair. Many of my friends are consistently toxic and use racial slurs, swears and generally awful insults and they haven't gotten banned once. Ironically one of them got a 2 week ban about a week ago for inting when his entire team was premade and TOLD him to int. So, LOL. Rage at people? Go ahead! Feed with your entire teams consent?

Generally, things like suicide encouragement and racism will result in an escalation to a 14-day ban. If you're not confident that the post game report feature is addressing the situations properly, you do have the option of reporting directly to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) which should allow for a much higher success rate for valid reports (particularly in borderline and unusual situation). Not everything will immediately escalate, but if you have reported something via Support and believe it should have resulted in an escalation you could attempt to request a second opinion through the ticket.\n\nI'm completely with you in saying that these behaviour should be taken seriously, it's undoubtedly something we don't want younger individuals learning to think is ok. Personally, through everything I've seen, heard and experienced, I've never had much reason to doubt Riot's systems as they relate to chat-offences, which do seem to have a fairly high success rate while staying to true to an underlying concept of reform.\n\nSo far as some of the behaviours you've described as \"very common\", I'd have to disagree somewhat. You may be encountering them in-game a bit more than others, though you're probably also experiencing a bit of \"negativity bias\" which could be exaggerating the situation a bit from your own perspective. It's ok to experience a bit of negativity bias, happens to everyone from time to time, but when you do you should take a step back and try to re-evaluate the situation in a more objective manner. You might find that you are \"filling in\" a few instances with more negativity than actually exists, and being able to recognise when that happens can help you change your mindset and enjoy the game more.\n\nIf there's anything specific you would like to ask or discuss, or if you think I've missed anything important, feel free to let me know.","replies":[{"poster":"DeIud3r","date":"2019-11-02T08:19:45.761+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":3,"body":"\"To be clear, it's not ok for anyone to use such language in-game. Generally, things like suicide encouragement and racism will result in an escalation to a 14-day ban.\"\n This is false and when they do get banned they have to be doing it consistently (10 games straight back to back). I've reported plenty of players over my 7 years of playing league and  1/10 of my report will work. Implying they're making racist assumptions, racist slurs, telling players to kill themselves and insinuating they should kill themselves. \n\nThat photo that I posted that has now been removed, that player is still playing on as I write this comment! That screenshot was taken 6 days ago and even after I've sent a ticket it hasn't resulted in him getting a 14-day ban as you've said. \nThe current report system is too lenient is should be imo anyone that said racist remarks or encourage suicide should be 14-day banned on sight.\n\nI think they could make the honour 5 rewards much better for players who did have sportsmanlike/good behaviour all year round.\n\nI play the game for more than 40+ every week and I can say with confidence that I am not exaggerating at all. All those points I listed will happen in at least 9/10 games you play in p1/d4 ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2019-11-02T14:54:47.789+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"The issue isn't that the system is lenient the issue is that the system is inconsistent and works off of bad metrics, and doesn't automatically check a chat log if someone is reported.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bring me my belt","date":"2019-11-02T10:41:12.059+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"probs got a chat ban. if someone gets chat banned, they shouldn't be allowed to play ranked regardless. I agree this game needs a rework on the punishment side of things, however the side of chat log how it is, from personal experience I have been chat banned for singular games, not being racist or abusive. purely for being sportsman like. if anything I think chat log is to strict and encourages people to ruin game play instead. at the end of the day we can mute chat, but we cant mute game play. so just mute chat and the games should be 5 times easier","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"DeIud3r","date":"2019-11-02T08:43:02.455+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":5,"body":"Heartvine I checked how much you actually play and it's really far from how much I play so you saying that I have negativity bias is kinda insulting especially when you don't play ranked and that's where people show their TRUE colours.

This acc has been perma'd for 2 years (Surprise, because of CH players being %%%%s toward me, so of course i fired back and i'm the one that got punished)\n2. i never said all CH, i said 9/10 games its their fault (from personal experience)\n3. If chat affects you so much, mute it and just use pings\n4. They don't allow it, they just also are extremely selective about their ban choices, Talking won't do anything, scroll through the last 3+ years of OCE posts regarding this kind of topic","replies":[]}]}]}]}
