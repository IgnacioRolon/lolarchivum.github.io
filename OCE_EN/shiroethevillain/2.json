Replying to a ticket or creating a new one before getting a response will drop you back to the end of the queue. It's also possible they are busier than normal given the holiday period. \n\nYour best bet is to just wait on player support. Don't reply to the ticket or create any new ones. You should get a response in no more than 3 days, though usually within one.","replies":[]}]}
