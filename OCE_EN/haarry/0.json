This isn&#039;t me complaining about their skill level but purely attitude, the players all seem to give up after their second death flaming and calling gg. as more of a jg player I talk to the person one on one on how its not gg politely not getting angry at them but saying how we can win and how there loss in lane wont play a large role. However after continuously blaming others and receiving no results they look to me and how I&#039;m now the culprit for encouraging and micromanaging them into having a supportive mindset. I feel myself getting more and more angry at myself and the game as I see improvements in my own play style but am set back due to serious team issues. I believe there&#039;s no possible way for me to work around this as I do not have any psychology practice or background and I can&#039;t stop them from flaming, giving up, and then verbally harassing me. I am now dreading starting a game because I&#039;m just waiting for the next person to give up or int.\r\nI hope that this message can recieve a response, I just want to know that I&#039;m not doing something wrong that it isn&#039;t my fault, and that my league games will get better but sadly I think I want to give league a break for all the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nA low elo summoner.","replies":[{"poster":"TheOneUser","date":"2017-01-03T09:45:13.327+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Haarry,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=XbQzmyMA,comment-id=,timestamp=2017-01-02T15:02:28.997+0000)\n I talk to the person one on one on how its not gg politely not getting angry at them but saying how we can win and how there loss in lane wont play a large role. \n\ndisagreeing with someone is enough to set them off. that is not being \"supportive\"\nespecially if they're pissed at how horrible their team is or how they failed their last play. \nsomething like \"bad luck\", \"we can still win\" etc isn't going to make them feel any better; that's stuff you save for teammates who are actually trying to win/get better/are supportive themselves","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-01-04T05:13:49.372+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They are babies.
