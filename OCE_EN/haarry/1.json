I've taken a look at the logs myself and unless there was some mistake with what is being presented to you, I would not consider any of what you said \"lack lustre\".\n\nIf you are concerned there was a mistake, feel free to share the log you were presented here for review.","replies":[{"poster":"Khangaroo","date":"2017-10-04T11:36:09.781+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got a 14-day suspension for saying one phrase loool.
