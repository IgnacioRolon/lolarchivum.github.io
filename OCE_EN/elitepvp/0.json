I will also not include any type of special event skins nor any legacy skins.  I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS SO IM NOT PULLING SH*T OUT OF MY AS*\r\n\r\nSo I have played {{champion:4}} for a bit now and I love him. He has a great skill cap and can be super powerful if mastered. I was looking through his skins (because I wanted to buy one) and he doesn&#039;t have a legendary skin. Now I&#039;m not saying he doesn&#039;t have many skins I&#039;m just saying that the skins that he does have are not very nice. I mean Tango TF is like put that in the trash, musketeer TF he can go in the trash too. Jack of Harts TF isn&#039;t bad but I think he is still way to plane. Now High Noon and Cutpurse TF are cool but there no legendary skin. and that brings me to my point. Twisted Fate has got 6 skins and all of them are only character appearance changes which is really boring if you were to add diffrent cards or voiced animations they&#039;d look SO cool. Now personally i think you should remove tango and musketeer Twisted Fate and add one legendary skin something advanced like a Project type skin(which look awesome btw) or a space type theme. for example his cards could be hologram like he could have a robot voice something like that But dont just have some boring normal change it. if its just for cash I under stand but if you want more cash I&#039;d put in better skins.\r\n\r\nAnd also Twisted Fate&#039;s W is great i think though that the stun should be changed to a type of heal,shield,buff but u allready have a slow on the red card which slows to a near stun so why would u use the stun and the blue card is perfect i love it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkins-Tiers of disappointment. {{item:3070}} {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}\r\nWorst-  \r\nTango Twisted Fate\r\nmusketeer Twisted Fate\r\n\r\nOk-\r\nRed Card Twisted Fate\r\nJack Of Cards Twisted Fate\r\n\r\nGood(but could have some extra stuff)\r\nCutpurse Twisted Fate\r\nHigh Noon Twisted Fate","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-12-08T06:23:14.228+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You ever seen Underworld TF?
