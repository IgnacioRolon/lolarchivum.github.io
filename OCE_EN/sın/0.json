They've removed End of Season Ranked borders.\n\nInstead, they're having \"live\" borders, so during Season 9 our border will show our *current* rank, and not our previous one. The only place Season 8's rank shows up is in the Lobby where your banner will have a different outline based on how you ranked this season, which basically means no one but someone you're queuing with will see, and even then there will be a massive icon on each lobby banner showing the current rank (will will draw attention away from the banner outline).","replies":[]}]}
