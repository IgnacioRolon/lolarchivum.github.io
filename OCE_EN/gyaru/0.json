We're all aged 20+ University students/Full time workers.)\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, add either Fuh or Ngau in-game and remind us who you are and what role you'd like.","replies":[{"poster":"Mar3thyu","date":"2015-02-11T06:01:04.785+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Jg Main if you need I will add one of you 2 now","replies":[]},{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-02-13T08:55:48.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hello, i'll be happy to join, looking for some new friends to play with","replies":[]},{"poster":"Posso The Pimp","date":"2015-02-13T06:25:45.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can sub for the adc if needed :) i can top lane as well add me if need ( Posso The Pimp)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Draeneroth","date":"2015-02-12T05:32:50.881+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i can top or jungle, gold 4 last season.. add me in game if interested \"draeneroth\"","replies":[]}]}
