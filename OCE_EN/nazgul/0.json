We're sick of hearing \"the server's too small\" when they wont even put it up and actually see if people play it.\n\nRanked TT has been discussed more than a few times before and, if I'm not mistaken, there are always more than a few people who tell Riot to \"suck it up\" and just give OCE a *chance* to have it.\n\nOf course, people like you always *have* bring up that age old sh!t of an excuse.","replies":[{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-11-02T02:56:20.476+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Think of the scenarios that could come from ranked TT:\n1) All regular TT players jump to ranked, and thus the normal queues are abandoned, completely shutting the map out from first timers or those that don't want to play ranked\n2) The TT players are split, with a portion of them going to ranked, and doubling the queue times for both normal and ranked.\n3) It entices more people to play TT, and further lengthens the already agonizing queue times for Summoners Rift Ranked queues.\n\nIt's not that hard.

It's easy enough to have them alternating and/or on at different times during the day *if it's required*.\n\nAs for your third point, why should players not get to choose between two queues simply because it doesn't suit *some* people? If it really causes queue times to increase that much because people are switching from SR to TT then that tends to indicate that TT is the preferred queue *overall*, so why should Ranked TT *not* be a thing if it's going to be used *that much*.\n\n>As much as you 3 or 4 TT players are sick of hearing \"the server's too small\", we are sick of hearing shit responses like yours\n\nI would like to take the time to point out that I am NOT a TT player. The issue here is that Riot simply *refuses* to even give the queue a *chance*, which you would find obvious if you had actually read my previous post.\n\nWe've had all the same discussions/arguments before about normal TT and that's been made available, so why not give ranked a *chance*?","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Samo","date":"2016-11-03T06:24:47.125+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That would be the dream","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tempestous","date":"2016-11-02T10:52:08.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-11-02T14:30:15.983+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Scam alert!\n\nYou have been warned!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Garen Player","date":"2016-11-02T04:53:06.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"3v3 seems legit and short to be ranked xD","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-11-02T02:58:07.898+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I imagine Riot's next priority will be to see whether Flex Queue is viable on OCE.
