So really, either ways a win when someone&#039;s being a fuck wit.\r\nSo no, I&#039;m not complaining about my rank at all.\r\n\r\nNow for all you bronze/silver who read this, understand that once you hit 50 kills, you DONT win, this is NOT team death match. Inhibs, Towers, Baron and Dragon are what matter. Getting to the nexus is what matters.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVES &gt; KILLS also CS &gt; poke\r\n\r\nexample - we kill 4 of them, I start baron, the other 3 who are up leave baron and chase a vayne for about 2 minutes. They baron, they win.\r\n\r\n( No I never said I&#039;m pro, yes I&#039;m aware Silver and bronze are one big Wood div, just tyring to teach floppers to get on that first rung )","replies":[{"poster":"Just Bocaj","date":"2015-11-08T00:21:22.560+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Just Bocaj is my Username.
