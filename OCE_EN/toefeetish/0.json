I swear none of these chat msgs are from me because i have not been able to get to a computer in the last 3 months since my old computer broke and i was given this computer for an early Christmas present.

Riot own the game, therefore they own everyone who plays LoL's accounts. Your account was toxic, your account gets banned.\nWhy do you think that this should be another way? If Riot unbanned your account; your friends would STILL use it and STILL be toxic.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-12-24T08:39:51.042+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Read the terms and conditions. its literally like the 4th rule - no sharing.\n\nhttp://na.leagueoflegends.com/legal/termsofuse#your-account","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SirBlueWaffle","date":"2016-12-24T06:27:38.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Assuming Riot's rules on account sharing are similar to Valve's then you are responsible for the behaviour of others on your account.
