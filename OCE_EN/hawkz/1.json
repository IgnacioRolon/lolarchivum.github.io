It makes champion select more fiddly, especially with the need to lock in, I have to scroll so much when making a pick based on role. On the legacy client I have all the champions I can play in a certain role that I can simply copy and paste into the search in champion select and all my champions in the role I've been put in will be visible and nothing else. They're not all the same class so \"Fighter\" or \"Mage\" filters just won't cut it.\nReally hope this does get put in, I'm worried that it hasn't been mentioned by Riot yet, it's a really useful little feature","replies":[]}]}
