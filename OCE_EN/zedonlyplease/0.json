Makes everything a lot easier.\n\nHave you tried rewatching your own games? Its amazing at how many mistakes you can pick up on your own just by going back and rewatching what happened. You can download \"League Summoner Info\" which records your games or simply use Replay.gg.\n\nSome tips: Don't go Thunderlords on Soraka. If you want to carry in low elo, play a champion that can carry. Healers like Soraka are cool if your team is good and you can rely on them, otherwise supports like Brand/Bard/Braum/Leona etc are much more effective. Tanky Playmakers or Supports that do ridiculous damage.\n\nGet proper Runes. Yours are kind of garbage.","replies":[]}]}
