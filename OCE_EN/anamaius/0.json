I think having a user reporting system where we as players are in charge is a better system. Before in champ select you can flag people on this watch-list. It would be very useful, especially in ranked if you know the guy is going to instalock regardless of pick order or feed if you ask him to group, etc etc. And hey, if someone is very toxic and is on this list and riot isn&#039;t doing anything well we have proof the system doesn&#039;t work (although we all know it really doesn&#039;t only one that&#039;s delusional is riot). You guys think this would be something good to start?","replies":[{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-09-22T07:15:35.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I thought we already did 97% of the bronze and silver OCE Summoners?","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-19T09:03:58.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"go for it bud but keep in mind that that is shamming and if you get banned it no ones fult  but yours","replies":[]}]}
