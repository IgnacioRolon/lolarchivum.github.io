Just to see that everybody in my game is platinum and 1 silver player. When I just hit lvl 30 and only have like 150 games won. Why in the world am I getting matched with platinum who have +1000 games won?","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-08-04T01:28:53.443+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"was it ranked? ah, either way it doesn't matter. how are you going to improve if you only get matched with people worse than you?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Djenzy","date":"2015-08-04T07:10:35.081+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm a new player. Trying to improve was already hard when I was getting stomped 8/10 games when I started. Like I said I played around 200 games and I've won 151. I just got basic rune pages and mastery's. But I was getting outsmarted quite a lot. Ending up in being nearly useless in teamfights because I've never had these kind of games. I'm just saying that you shouldn't let new players go with platinum's. Maybe silver and max gold but I didn't even played ranked, not even 1 ranked match.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-03T23:19:41.825+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey maybe ur gud enough to go up against harder people?","replies":[{"poster":"RonyStark","date":"2015-08-04T01:27:54.530+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or it is just normal game","replies":[{"poster":"Iosua Bot","date":"2015-08-04T03:01:13.948+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"or that","replies":[]}]}]}]}
