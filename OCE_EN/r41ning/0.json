You could be diamond solo/duo but silver flex if you don't play on it.\n\nWhat you should play is up to you. Riot are using preseason to see how popular and how well each que runs and whether OCE is big enough to have simultaneous ranked ques.\n\nI personally will mainly play solo/duo as my \"main\" ranked and Flex will be when im playing with friends.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2016-11-18T00:56:45.875+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There will be another minor MMR reset at the start of the season for both queues. So any games you play in the preseason in either queue will affect your 2017 Season starting rank in that queue.","replies":[]}]}
