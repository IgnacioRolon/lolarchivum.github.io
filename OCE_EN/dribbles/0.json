The &quot;My Tickets&quot; button in the support section that up doesn&#039;t work, it isn&#039;t a link. It also tells me to login to submit a request when I am already logged in, while the login button also isn&#039;t a clickable link.\n\nCan permabanned players not even send emails?\n\nEdit: Specifically it's the option for \"I have a question about a suspension or restriction on my account\"","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-05-17T14:50:32.798+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The login for the support page and the website (boards) are seperate. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/IrSBuzi.png?noredirect\n\nThere are currently issues with the login transition preventing players from easily logging into support. There are two current workarounds:\n\n1. Open the support page in an incognito/private window and follow the process as normal, pressing the login button when prompted.\n2. Log out of the website **from the support page**, and then follow the process as normal, pressing login when prompted.\n\nIf your support page has the blank \"OC\" login in the top right, you're good to go. If it only has your summoner icon with \"OCEANIA\" it means the support page is seeing you as logged in on the website and not in support. You need to follow one of the steps above.","replies":[{"poster":"Dribbles","date":"2018-05-17T15:53:31.121+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks man, helped a lot.
