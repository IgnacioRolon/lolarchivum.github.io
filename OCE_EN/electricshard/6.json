It has partially downloaded and opened it to download the final part on the LOL client.  It reaches a certain percent like 5% or 11% then crashes.  I then go to turn it on and it has reset the download.  I have repeated this multiple times and every time it crashes and resets.  I am not sure what is wrong I have not downloaded anything onto the computer except League of Legends, and I have had it for about 4 hours by now.  I would really appreciate any help!","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-20T08:16:19.760+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nHave you tried reinstalling the application (Download a fresh copy of the installer) and seeing if the issue persists?","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-20T20:01:03.182+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help, I have fixed it.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-21T09:19:39.252+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good to hear.\n\nSee you on the rift,\nSeph","replies":[]}]}]}]}
