She's also nowhere near as contested as Gosuliftlet, and is probably the most versatile mid laner in the entire game. I think you know the correct choice bud.\n\nPretty sure it's written as a statistical fact somewhere that Ahri is the most superior champion in the entire game.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-09T23:45:58.957+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks do you think she'll get nerfed?","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2016-04-10T10:36:35.686+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No, not anytime in the near future. Because even though she is very strong, she IS balanced. There's also a very obvious difference between a good Ahri and a bad Ahri so while she is a rather simplistic champion mechanically, she requires a fair amount of experience","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-10T18:51:54.067+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ok thank you","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"ƒamous","date":"2016-04-10T01:09:21.762+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"She's already been nerfed a couple times but she's still really strong. I don't think so unless she gets to where she was before her latest nerf. It's like a cycle, a champion gets nerfed, suddenly it's difficult to play until you figure that champion out again, then it becomes strong again once you've figured that champion out after the nerf. At least that's how I see it.\n\nI'd definitely say Ahri is top pick if you're looking for a fun champion... coming from an Ahri main (not biased at all).","replies":[]},{"poster":"BurningAvalanche","date":"2016-04-09T17:20:26.623+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"VAYNE:\nPROS: Tons of Damage, Can carry if played well, Good Skins, Nightmare if she gets fed\nCONS: Difficult to learn, lot of mechanics needed to perform, Sterotypes by players :(\n\nAHRI:\nPROS: Easy-ish to play (2 SkillShots), Fun to Play, Has good pick with her Charm\nCONS: Fairly skill-shot reliant, Kinda hard to CS with, Only a few good skins IMO\n\nI hope this helped in some way, I know you said you enjoy every role but you should decide on 1 'main' role and 1 secondary roles of prepare yourself for ranked. If you play more ADC than Mid I personally would go Vayne just becuase I would be somewhat better on her than if I didn't play a lot of ADC and vice-versa if I played more Mid and ADC.
