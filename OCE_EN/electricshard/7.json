She's great at cleaning up and dueling and shes got the best bedtime story voice ever. Very solid champ. The only thing that really gets to you when you play her jungle is not being able to have much map pressure pre 6. L\n\nThat being said I am yet to try out Kha'Zix, and Yasuo is very slipperly and seems to have alot of outplay potential combined with the fact he does well in many team comps.\n\nI don't know what would suit you better so it's really up to you. Perhaps you could list some of your favourite champs to maybe help us out.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-14T18:51:03.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :)\n\nHere is a list:\nZed\nFizz\nVel'koz\nKindred\nEkko\nKalista\nHecarim\nLeblanc\n\nHopefully this helps.","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-04-15T14:17:51.559+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So really in my eyes, it comes down to Diana and Kha-zix since both do really fast burst in a short amount of time and both are pretty mobile.\n\nI'm sooo biased towards Diana so I hope you pick her. Her burst is pretty much on par with Kha Zix's, maybe even lower, however, the double dash makes flashing from her almost pointless and hard to peel agaisnt, and her tankiness can surprise you. Plus shes a really straight forward champion with not much hard mechanics unlike Zed or Leblanc yet she yields godlike results.\n\nThat being said I did some poking around with Kha Zix, and watched alot of games vs him, and I can conclude that he is really strong from my point of view, and seems to excel better at destroying isolated targets and have more map pressure. He needs a few more kills early game to become this unstoppable god but his kit makes him naturally good at this and once you have snowballed the crap out of yourself, you become extremely hard to deal with. However, you seem to be extremely weak and pretty much useless when you have fallen behind whereas I always seem to quite powerful with Diana even though I had a rocky start. \n\n\nHonestly with some thought, Kha Zix might actually suit you better BUT PLEASE PICK DIANA SHES SOOOO COOOL.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-15T20:06:00.332+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you so much, , Yasuo is the funnest I've tried but I still really like both Diana and Kha'zix.\n\nCould you please give your opinion on who is worth it most in the long run.

Try queueing up with some friends who play knock up champs like malph, wukong and vi and your face will beam.\n\nI don't play yasuo much, but his major outplay mechanics and the fact that he makes playing with friends EVEN FUNNER seems to me that he would be worth the most in the long run (still biased towards diana, ugh).\n\nDiana is obviously pretty weak early until she gets level 6, since she doesnt have a gapcloser, but in mid lane she can be quite strong pre 6 against some matchups like Katarina, and Kha Zixs tends to be quite weak earlier on, and needs to farm hard and  acquire some kills in order to snowball and become a real threat.\n\nYasuo doesn't really fall off at any stage imo, so I reckon you be better off if you got him.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-16T05:30:00.718+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks!
