But I am not very good at deciding, I would much appreciate someone to tell me which champ fit my play style.  I enjoy playing mainly jg, mid, or top and really like champs which are strong throughout the game but have powerspikes in the late game, I love mobility and high damage as well as the potential to carry.  I like being able to kill enemies either quickly or safely, I also enjoy escapes and utility.  Any comments and help will be very helpful thanks!

Pretty much ticks all your boxes.\n\n{{champion:103}}  would be my personal bias for those who are looking for someone to main. Plenty of damage, pick potential and mobility and she's such a forgiving champion to play. At a mediocre level, you can survive the trickiest of situations and at a mastered level you can pull off so many neat tricks and shenanigans it just makes the whole experience worthwhile. {{champion:92}}  would float in the same boat I guess.\n\n","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-08-15T04:57:41.106+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you I do enjoy all your suggestions ;)\n\n(Anyone else you can think off that's unpopular?)","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-08-15T06:54:50.157+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would probably then look at {{champion:59}}.\n\nHigh damage, can usually pick off lone squishies, good gap closer/escape although you won't be backing out of a team fight once you have committed, which is usually ok since you can trap many people in that massive ult of yours which I guess would be very useful in the late game.\n\n{{champion:38}} is also a good option if you want to be elusive. Theoretically, {{champion:240}} seems to be a great option that fufills most of your criteria, but I haven't played any games with him and Riot is probably going to play around with his numbers a lot. Even then, time will tell if he ends up being popular or not. He should be on the free rota soon so make sure you try him out.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-08-15T08:21:27.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Overall I quite like riven the best (I think she suits me perfectly) but is she good in the late game?","replies":[{"poster":"Légs","date":"2016-08-16T08:21:45.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah i mentioned her earlier, I believe she can completely stomp the enemy team in the late game, but i would imagine that you can't be too reckless with her in teamfights, especially if the enemy team has specific spells that can shut you down.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Erøse","date":"2016-08-15T08:03:12.531+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I say go for either volibear, tryndamere, yasuo or jax.\n\nThey are all relatively strong but literally destroys anyone late game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-08-15T07:58:04.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riven.
