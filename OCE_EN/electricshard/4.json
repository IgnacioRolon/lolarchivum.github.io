I am looking for strong, fun, and hard champs for any role that I can learn and do well with.  I have almost reached 4800 ip but am struggling to decide who to buy.  if you could comment who in your opinion what champs I should get I would really appreciate it.  Here is a list of the 4800-6300 ip champs I own and enjoy:\r\n\r\nZed\r\nVel&#039;koz\r\nRek&#039;sai\r\nRiven\r\nKalista\r\nEkko\r\nFizz\r\nHecarim\r\nKindred\r\nCassopeia","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-09T21:36:18.682+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Here's what I think:\n\n1. If you're looking for champions that reward mechanics then go for {{champion:92}} **Riven** and {{champion:238}} **Zed**. They are really hard to play at a high level, but super strong once you learn them. They also don't really go out of meta much.\n\n2. {{champion:203}} **Kindred**, {{champion:245}} **Ekko** and {{champion:421}} **Rek'Sai**. These guys are great junglers who need some mechanics. They're not as rewarding as some of the other champs, but becoming a god on these guys will definitely set you apart from the rest. They're all high impact and great in the early game.\n\n3. {{champion:105}} **Fizz**, {{champion:120}} **Hecarim** and {{champion:429}} **Kalista**. \nI don't think **Fizz** is the champion for you, he's generally quite easy to play. Some of the pros do reach crazy levels of mastery with him though.\n\n **Hecarim** is pretty strong in certain metas, but usually he's an average pick. He's kinda cheesy as well with the insane speed. It can get you out of most situations.\n\n **Kalista** is a super great carry champion, but recently Riot has weakened her 1v1 because they want her to be more ally reliant. So she's still really strong in lane and team fights, but her 1v1 is below average now.\n\n4. {{champion:161}} **Vel'koz** and {{champion:69}} **Cassopeia**. I wouldn't recommend buying these two since they're due for reworks in about 1 or 2 patches. You could end up getting something completely different.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-04-09T23:44:39.351+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking your time to write that but it was a list of champs I already own :/\n\nWhat do you think on Kha'zix??","replies":[{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-10T00:26:37.679+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha lol XD, well probably {{champion:64}} **Lee Sin** then.
