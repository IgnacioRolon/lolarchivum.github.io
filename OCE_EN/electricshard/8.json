I like all lanes and I do not mind either AP or AD please could you give me your opinion on which champion I should purchase and which is the funnest overall :)  Thanks a lot!","replies":[{"poster":"Truegolddigger","date":"2016-01-03T07:29:37.414+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well Vladimir is played both top and mid, whereas Cassiopeia is primarily a midlaner.\nIn my opinion, Vladimir is a much easier champion who is also resourceless.\nCassiopeia requires you to use your spells very effectively, as if you miss your abilities you are vulnerable.\nVladimir is more mobile, and has an escape. He is tankier too due to his passive.\nThey are both great lane bullies.\n\nIn my opinion, Cassiopeia does more damage but is much harder to play.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-04T13:02:19.233+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cass can be played top lane, she is just so mechanically difficult that she's extremely hard to play anywhere.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-01-03T07:58:49.371+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks :D","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-01-03T07:59:23.112+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I am mainly looking for a top laner","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"DianasGotSwag","date":"2016-01-04T00:50:11.749+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Diana.","replies":[{"poster":"Electricshard","date":"2016-02-29T02:56:13.854+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"k","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sour mash","date":"2016-01-04T10:39:13.802+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"vlad is more fun to play and easier. but i feel cassiopia is more rewarding because of her skill cap","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-01-04T01:51:48.550+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I prefer Vlad.","replies":[]}]}
