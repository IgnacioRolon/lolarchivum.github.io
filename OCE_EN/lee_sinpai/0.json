Given that Lee Sinpai had gone on to lose 2 matches since and *still* have a higher than average MMR for their division, there's no possible way their MMR could've been less at the time the match was played. As for the \"plat\" player, their MMR is lower than average for their division, after a loss and a win since the shown match (which indicates their MMR would either be about the same or lower).","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-06-05T06:33:04.219+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nami was plat","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gravelord","date":"2016-06-05T04:08:27.458+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'd like to know how our Prime Minister did as Vayne!","replies":[]}]}
