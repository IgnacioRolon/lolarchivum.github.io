I had a really good MMR around master tier in all honesty. Play a game once a month to just keep it from decaying. Have time to play in July/August and MMR shot down incredibly, lose one or two games at 0lp and get demoted, upset, but not the end of the world, I can earn it back. \r\nStart winning games and the lp gain is the most miniscule thing, the peak of LP gain has been 13, and lowest 10. And then lose 20+ for a loss, with an all time high of 28 LP. \r\nNow I&#039;m not a god, my win rate is only like 52%, but how the actual tits am I supposed to climb with a broken LP system? \r\nIn all honesty, it&#039;s such an unattractive and distasteful problem for players who take a break to actually have a life and come back and get kicked in the teeth.\r\n\r\nThoughts, ideas, rants, other stories, what ever.
