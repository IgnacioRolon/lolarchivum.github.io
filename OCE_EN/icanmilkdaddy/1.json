His voice lines and animations would be customized, probably making him seem far less trusting of the world and champions around him. In a sense that everything that isn't himself, is likely some kind of disgusting abomination that needs to be purged from the world. I also thought that involving ravens could make the skin pretty cool - But they'd have to be pretty strange looking ones, probably with missing feathers and patches of visible skin, to assure they look plague-y. Going into stealth Q would probably have a flock of the aforementioned ravens swarm him out of nowhere, flying off as he becomes invisible. His W would be a plague cask, and the 'icon' for his poison effect could probably be a Rat themed skull an crossbones that seem as if they're dripping with poison. \r\nWeapon wise I think it'd make sense for him to have a crossbow, still. Although something that fits with the theme. \r\n\r\nIt's still really just a random sleep idea, but I've always wanted a fully fledged skin for twitch with custom animations, voicelines and effects. And I think this sort of theme could definitely take the cake for a great one. Thoughts and additions, please.","replies":[]}
