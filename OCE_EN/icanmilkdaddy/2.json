So recently I was playing a ton of {{champion:202}} I love his voice, I love his kit and hes an absolutely perfect champion. However, I was thinking a lot about his ultimate, Its probably one of the funnest in the game, And it really makes you feel super special when you manage to get a kill or two with it. But I was thinking, The last bullet is probably the coolest part, Because of its damage. However, Its only single target (To champions). I was playing around with this idea in my head, What if, Upon killing a enemy champion with your last bullet, The bullet will penetrate again, Not increasing its range or damage, But just allowing it to hit another champion? I don&#039;t see it as being OP, More of just a really cool thing, And hilarious if you actually manage to get more than one kill with that last shot, Feedback would be great!","replies":[{"poster":"Hallbringer","date":"2016-04-07T13:51:52.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"the odds of riot doing this is kinda low but my god that would make the ult even more fun, an so many funny plays could happen from it  spot on.","replies":[]}]}
