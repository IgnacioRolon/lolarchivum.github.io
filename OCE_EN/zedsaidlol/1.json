Lets face it more than 80% of people playing LoL use all 3 of their refund credits when they were low level, just started playing league and didn&#039;t know lets say that skins exit or they didn&#039;t really want a skin for a champion they really liked. This happened to me, I used all 3 of my refund credits on probably refunding 1350ip champions. I just think its stupid only giving people 3 refund credits because me and all my friends used them up before we actually realized they important. I know you don&#039;t want people to have unlimited refund credits (otherwise people will just try out skins and refund them etc) But atleast maybe implement a system where you aren&#039;t allowed to use your refund credits until your level 20 or 15 ie give people more refund credits.\r\n\r\nFrom, ZedSaidLoL\r\n\r\np.s can we have more insight on the new mage update? Keep up the good work :)","replies":[]}
