(Colliding Q with creeps, reduces each missile damage by 6%, and {{champion:6}} can only apply Q to the certain creeps every 4 seconds - sort of like Ryze's E - Spell Flux). Opponents hit by ****the first missile get applied a passive**** (will get to that in next ability).\n\n_Deals physical damage_\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**W** - {{champion:6}}  creates a aura effect around him, which makes ally cc lasts an additional 0.5 seconds. **Enemies with q passive applied**, crowd control additionally creates a green graphic effect. (Briefly loses them some of their vision). Additionally if {{champion:6}} irrupts his missiles in the W aura effect his Q slows enemy champions movement speed aswell by 15% for 0.3 seconds\n\n_({{champion:6}} will  get an assist if the ally was in the aura and briefly got a kill). I also imagine this spell to have a fairly long cooldown._\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**E** - {{champion:6}}  irrupts his q missiles dealing a bonus 4|6|8|10% health damage + 20% of his health as physical damage. Additionally if {{champion:6}} irrupts his missiles in the W aura effect his Q slows enemy champions movement speed by 15% for 0.5 seconds **(Does not apply the CC Empowered W active)**.\n\n> Anyone wondering, you can cast E without the Q missiles, but doing that only enables a single target empowered auto mechanic, that applies % health damage.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**R** - Hyper-Kinect Postion Reverser (Don&#039;t think the Spell name needs to changed).\n\n{{champion:6}}  channels his Hyper-Kinect Thrusters, swapping positions with the target. Any crowd control spell casted on {{champion:6}}, for the next 1.5 seconds, {{champion:6}} negates any form of cc his opponents effect him with. **Instead, {{champion:6}} swaps around the cc to the opponent that dealt the cc** (I imagine the effect being a ghost imitating what crowd control was effected onto {{champion:6}}, sort of like {{champion:82}} &#039;s ult clone, obviously would look different. Also **would be able to apply all types of cc)**.\n\n_I imagined this ultimate ability having an above-average ultimate cooldown. Could be something like 160 seconds at all ranks._\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\np.s I couldn't come up with an explanation for this ultimate description that made reasonable sense. Sorry ;>\n\n\nEDIT: I know now this kit has some obvious floors to it now that I&#039;ve properly analysed over it, but I hope you enjoyed what possibility&#039;s my Urgot concept has to offer regardless and had a little fun imagining the possibilities with this kit;(especially the ult =P).\n{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}} ","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-03-12T02:44:15.734+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Nar","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2016-03-12T02:31:32.173+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"nar rework shen he needs it","replies":[]}]}
