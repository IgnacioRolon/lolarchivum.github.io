Lets face it more than 80% of people playing LoL use all 3 of their refund credits when they were low level, just started playing league and didn&#039;t know lets say that skins exit or they didn&#039;t really want a skin for a champion they really liked. This happened to me, I used all 3 of my refund credits on probably refunding 1350ip champions. I just think its stupid only giving people 3 refund credits because me and all my friends used them up before we actually realized they important. I know you don&#039;t want people to have unlimited refund credits (otherwise people will just try out skins and refund them etc) But atleast maybe implement a system where you aren&#039;t allowed to use your refund credits until your level 20 or 15 ie give people more refund credits.\n\nFrom, ZedSaidLoL\n\np.s can i have insights on the mage updates ;P Keep up all the good work","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-24T04:43:11.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nThis suggestion has been raised many times over the years and from what I can remember was always met with what is basically a \"no, we won't be doing this\".\n\nWhile I agree, some people may not understand there is more expensive things to refund down the line and they may regret using all their tokens, however it is clear that you are only allotted 3 refund tokens and that is it. final.","replies":[{"poster":"ZedSaidLoL","date":"2016-01-24T05:08:49.413+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":">  some people may not understand there is more expensive things to refund down the line and they may regret using all their tokens\n\nExactly thats why I think they should implement a system so that you aren't allowed to use your 3 until your level 20, so they don't waist them refunding cheap champions because they might of thought they would be only playing this game for a month so it doesn't matter if I use them all up","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-01-24T05:23:04.377+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should consider posting your suggestion in the [Misc Board](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous) or [Player Creations](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations) so that others may join the conversation :)","replies":[]}]}]}]}
