Lets face it more than 80% of people playing LoL use all 3 of their refund credits when they were low level, just started playing league and didn&#039;t know lets say that skins exit or they didn&#039;t really want a skin for a champion they really liked. This happened to me, I used all 3 of my refund credits on probably refunding 1350ip champions. I just think its stupid only giving people 3 refund credits because me and all my friends used them up before we actually realized they important. I know you don&#039;t want people to have unlimited refund credits (otherwise people will just try out skins and refund them etc) But atleast maybe implement a system where you aren&#039;t allowed to use your refund credits until your level 20 or 15 ie give people more refund credits.\r\n\r\nFrom, ZedSaidLoL\r\n\r\np.s can we have more insight on the new mage update? Keep up the good work :)","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-24T11:08:02.060+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ZedSaidLoL,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oNPchilt,comment-id=,timestamp=2016-01-24T07:24:13.390+0000)\n>\n>more than 80% of people playing LoL use all 3 of their refund credits when they were low level\n\nwell i know 3 people who havent used all their refund credits, not like i needed that statistic to prove how wrong your absurd pulled-from-the-ass statement is. seems like you havent learned your lesson about smart decisions when you used all your credits on pitiful refunds, cos now you're on here trying to bullshit everyone including riot to make up for the fact that you were a young stupid kid like a year ago, when you were 12. let this be a lesson to you, i know your parents must say that a lot, but hopefully one day you can grow up and be a more intelligible individual capable of surviving in the easiest of societies this planet has shaped for you to date","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-12T02:43:40.237+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=GigaPube,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oNPchilt,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-01-24T11:08:02.060+0000)\n>\n> well i know 3 people who havent used all their refund credits, not like i needed that statistic to prove how wrong your absurd pulled-from-the-ass statement is.\n\n3 people = more than 20% of players?","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-12T04:46:48.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Kylar Alice,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oNPchilt,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-02-12T02:43:40.237+0000)\n>\n> 3 people = more than 20% of players?\n\nits a sample size that shows him being wrong by 180%. but then again its not like i needed that statistic to prove how wrong his absurd pulled-from-the-ass statement is.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"chezwickcheese","date":"2016-02-12T02:05:12.096+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1 every season would be acceptable and not over the top.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JaimeeK","date":"2016-01-25T03:37:09.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should just slowly gain refund credits over time like maybe 1 a month to a max of 5 then it's not OP","replies":[]},{"poster":"oOo0oOo0oOo0oOo","date":"2016-01-24T07:31:26.621+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is a poorly constructed argument","replies":[{"poster":"ZedSaidLoL","date":"2016-01-24T07:48:34.124+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-01-24T11:15:26.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you have a missing ID to show to bouncers and bottle-o employees, oh wait it doesnt exist, and it wont for like 5 years. also a missing chromosome does not directly lead to a loss of cognitive ability. you're thinking of an extra chromosome, which is an attribute to downs syndrome in which there is a higher chance of a lesser mental capability than most. the person who is correct in saying that you have a poorly constructed argument is correct, i also agree with him, and you are wrong, there is nothing to disagree with, you are wrong, i have proven you wrong, so if anything, you have the extra chromosome","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"wonkey donkey","date":"2016-01-24T08:02:43.356+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"have a mass cry about it mate","replies":[{"poster":"ZedSaidLoL","date":"2016-01-24T08:11:34.649+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"1v1 me mate","replies":[]}]}]}
