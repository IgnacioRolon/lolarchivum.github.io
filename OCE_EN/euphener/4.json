I got a question, So theres 10 placement matches when you hit lvl 30 and 10 placements after the start of each season. \r\nThe question is, when you win 10 placement games when you hit lvl 30 you roughly go to the tier silver or gold, does that happen in \r\nthe placements after the start of each season? Or if you win at the start of the season 10 placement games you only get put into bronze 1 if you were for example bronze 3 last season?\r\nIf that makes sense PLEASE answer\r\n\r\nor in basic sense, Do you get  a higher chance of getting put into a higher rank of the 10 placement  matchs when you hit lvl 30? or the 10 placement matches at the start of each season? or both are as effective?","replies":[]}
