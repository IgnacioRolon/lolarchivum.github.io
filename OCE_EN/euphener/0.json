That, and there's a very loose term of \"Player Creations\" ( See; [The next champion, will it be a Support?](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-creations/xePRuvVn-the-next-champion-will-it-be-a-support) ). This could be from low activity, low moderation, or low playerbase to begin with being the OCE server, but a few other content creators I've spoken with agree that it's not THE place to discuss and post. We.... don't really agree on what is though, to be fair.\n\nI've had some discussions with players, creators and rioters alike and we all agree that there's a lot of potential for change. That being said, all of them disagree what the change should look like. Riot doesn't have an \"Easy fix\", but as a player, I've got a bit more freedom, and the best thing would be to try something, and see how it goes. If it fails, oh well. If it goes great, it may incite change on a greater scale.\n\nI'm curious though. Wuks ( and everyone else ), let's say it's your job to tell us what it should look like and how it functions. Would you make changes? how significant would they be? \n\nno wrong answers :)","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-06-28T12:32:03.735+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"The main problem is that (especially for smaller servers) there are very few places that get enough advertising to the server as a whole, for example OCE, there are a few subsets of people that come on boards.\n\nRegulars\nPeople who come on through the client (to places like http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/reformed-players-ask-riot-how-you-me-now )\nPeople who come on to post something specific (whether this is a complaint or what)\n\nOf these people the ones who actually will see anything on boards, is the regulars, and this is basically what small content creators are posting to when posting on boards.\n\nThere are a few remedies that can be employed to try and curb this.\n\n1. Post News topics into boards, we need riot to quit posting it on the site, and making it link from boards to there, while using boards as the commenting area, if the actual news topic was on the actual boards part of the site, that increases potential traffic for boards in general, and this one probably applies to ALL regions, not even just the small ones\n2. Riot need to support smaller content creators, i'm sure we can all recall that /All chat is great for giving views from the league client into certain youtubers, but for fucks sake, does that have to be limited to the 100k+ groups, hell make a smaller one for each region that is hosted on the League client that gets stuff from the local youtubers, and gives exposure, this doesn't have to be a week to week like /all chat is, but could say be a monthly thing that riot throws together (and hell, cut down the work and make it submission based.)\n3. Make more Specific boards, this one is simple, \"Player Creations\" is too broad a subject, even going with \"Youtube creations\" and \"Player Ideas\" would be a better segregation of the 2, this makes it clear what is youtube oriented, and gives the ability for people to come on and look for youtubers if they want to do so, this also can help youtubers find each other and be able to talk and collaborate as well.\n\nNow sure, yes this will require some actual effort, but it will be a 2 way street and will give to not only riot, but to smaller youtube content creators (within each region that they possibly decide to run something like this)\n\nHowever, 1 more thing needs to be done, and that's to curb the \"upvote bot\" sort of posts where they have clearly mass upvoted there own stuff, this is more prevalent from people who aren't actually from our server, but it happens and should be changed.\n\nHell this post is a great example\n\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/miscellaneous/EH6r8E66-teemo-got-a-stream-yes-check-out-this-teemo-with-a-real-yordle-cam-dafuq\n\nSo this maxed out at around 14 votes (within a few hours, when no one would have been on because i personally saw it at like 9am, when no one would have seen it because it was posted at something like 3am)\n\nThis was at the top of the \"hot\" stuff for most of the day, this isn't something that riot should really allow.","replies":[{"poster":"Euphener","date":"2016-06-28T20:43:33.870+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=Azsv9XOn,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-06-28T12:32:03.735+0000)\n>\n> The main problem is that (especially for smaller servers) there are very few places that get enough advertising to the server as a whole, for example OCE, there are a few subsets of people that come on boards.\n> \n> Regulars\n> People who come on through the client (to places like http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/q/reformed-players-ask-riot-how-you-me-now )\n> People who come on to post something specific (whether this is a complaint or what)\n> \n> Of these people the ones who actually will see anything on boards, is the regulars, and this is basically what small content creators are posting to when posting on boards.\n> \n> There are a few remedies that can be employed to try and curb this.\n> \n> 1.
