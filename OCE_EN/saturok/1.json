Overall, the event was awesome, but I have included quite a bit of constructive criticism that I think is useful for future events.\r\n\r\nYou can find the articles summarizing my experience at the event below;\r\n\r\nDay One - [Live at Margaret Court Arena ](http://www.thegamebastion.com/international-wildcard-all-stars-melbourne/)\r\nDay Two - [Hoyts Viewing Party](http://www.thegamebastion.com/category/esports/)","replies":[{"poster":"ViolinMaker53","date":"2015-12-17T10:35:04.719+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"@MM kill yourself you autistic retarded loser %%%got","replies":[{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-12-17T22:38:16.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=ViolinMaker53,realm=OCE,application-id=ATM3HYki,discussion-id=mpGaiGgr,comment-id=0003,timestamp=2015-12-17T10:35:04.719+0000)\n>\n> @MM kill yourself you autistic retarded loser %%%got\n\nWell that escalated quickly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Saturok","date":"2015-12-16T20:04:15.850+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for taking the time to follow up on the thread. Honestly, you guys did a fantastic job and it's unique & encouraging to see an international organization to actually invest time, effort & money into oceania. I think I was way more critical then most punters, just due to my professional background. \n\nIt will be great to see what else is in store for 2016 (hopefully plenty of Melbourne activities!)","replies":[]},{"poster":"MasterMirkinen","date":"2015-12-15T14:47:56.346+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great read.
