My normal resolution is 1920x1080. I can change it to 1600x1200 at max but it always defaults back to 1024x768 whenever a new game starts. I have tried repairing my client and I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and I also found a thread from 2 years ago showing how to change the resolution in C:\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\Config\\game.cfg but none of that fixes it. \r\nI have no idea what else I can try to fix it, so any suggestions would be helpful, thanks","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-29T13:13:57.256+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"What graphics card do you have?
