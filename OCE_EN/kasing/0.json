If this dosn't work, \nTake a log of your client (this can be done in the same screen that you go into to repair the client) and attach it to a support ticket to Riot. \n\nThis will let riot know what's going on and how to fix it.\nRiot are the best equipped and can help you with your issue if you attach client logs. :)\n\nHope I helped \n:3\n~Reported4Verbal~ OCE~  Always Happy To Help! :)\nARAM Main!
