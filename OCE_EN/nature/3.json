If we spread the message out maybe just maybe, one day everyone will feel positive each game. But ik this is impossible but if you guise could make most players feel welcome, that'll be very appreciated.

As the booster climbs, he stomps whoever is in his/her path. then when the original owner returns to the account he/she cant actually handle the new higher elo, is unskilled etc.. and drops like a stone. effecting even more players.\n \n2. Promotes toxic/raging from his/her team players because of sheer frustration because of point 1\n\n\n\nthe other problem i see on this server is\n\n\neveryone wants to be the hero, never the team-player. and most of the time cant work in a team orientated fashion, its pathetic\n\n\n\nthe mentality I usually see on OCE is:\n\n1. Entitled snotty brat who refuses to listen to anyone even if they are higher ranked. and will rage at those who are lower ranked.\n2. Selfish\n3. Closed minded\n4.

They in turn get defensive and it spirals out of control. I think the most important way to battle in game rage is realise no one is responsible for carrying you. You are responsible for your wards and your plays. If you go balls deep and your team don't back you up, guess what. Its your fault you went ball deep. if you get ganked and you didn't have wards up, guess what. its your fault. \n\nAnd to be perfectly honest. If you don't like what someone is saying. Mute them. \n\nNow all you have to worry about is trolls and afks. There the real problem. Not ragers","replies":[]}]}
