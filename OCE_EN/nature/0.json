Let me highlight some reasons why and the thought process behind it.\n\n* **Minimizing attention to an application/platform and maximizing focus on content (images, media, formatted text)** In general, individuals focus on brighter areas on darker backgrounds and dark themes bring forth focus on content instead of the overall platform and its window.\n\n* **The color of the text in combination with the background color is actually very purposeful as there is research around the best combination of colors.** The two best being light non-white background with off-gray text and dark blue/black backgrounds with yellow text. The latter pulling slightly ahead for web. The common thought is that white background + black text is best however this is due largely in part to the legacy of how we as a society transitioned from print, magazines to web, digital. It can take some getting used to however as we are very accustomed to black on white text and it has therefore created a very real preference bias.\n\n* **In dark environments, light backgrounds can strain the eyes especially in low light environments.**\n\n* **Accessibility is of high priority and concern to us.** Some individuals have eye-sight problems and can only read high contrast text. Light on dark is higher contrast than dark on light for them. It's about finding a balance though and we are still striving to find the perfect combination.”\n\n**Bear Hat Alice** added to Sweet’s answer: “To add to what Riot Sweet said, while we have no plans to support multiple color schemes in the near future you are able to take control of your browser and override our color schemes. You can create a user stylesheet for the boards using a browser extension like Stylish for Firefox or Stylebot for Chrome and recolor the boards to your liking.”","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2014-11-22T20:59:20.474+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm still using forums, going to use them as much as possible before they're archived.
