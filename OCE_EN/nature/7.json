I was in a game with three of my teammates being premade and they decided that it would be fun to call me a %%%%%%/autist/downy for the entire game. I was 0/3/0 by 15 minutes and was doing pretty bad and they were begging me to afk and uninstall. Such fun times in league. \n\nEnded up 5/6/13ish  and we won the game.

It segregates people over a superficial detail and causes conflict where it's otherwise unnecessary. It doesn't matter if you're a girl or boy in League. However, I'm not going to go out of my way to hide my gender. If that offends people that's their problem.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to trust statistics.. but I know there are a lot of \"girl gamers\". You're not as unique as you think you are. It's just that different games appeal to us than males. There are some communities that are more than likely over half female, and possibly as high as 90% female players, the reverse of the League community.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sackboy","date":"2014-11-30T06:32:03.076+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I honestly would have told her to shut her mouth, if people mention that they're a girl I lose all respect for them.
