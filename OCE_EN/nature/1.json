Anecdotal evidence aside, I would challenge your statement about Optus (see the last few weeks @ https://aussieoutages.com/top10/)\n\n2. The firewall issue affected mostly TPG players AND it was resolved by TPG improving their connectivity to our game servers. So who would you say was 'at fault'?\n\n3.
