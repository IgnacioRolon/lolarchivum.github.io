I was playing a game the other day as Renekton v Ornn top, and we decided (after I died 4 times and he died 1) that we would have a bro lane, and not hurt each other, just take the waves. Now my team weren&#039;t so happy about this, and claimed they were going to report me for doing this. The closest I can see to this is greifing, but at the same time I kept an enemy member top. And it was also not to say that I didn&#039;t help my team, as I saved the entirety of the game at one point.\r\n\r\nSo I pose to you this question, is a Bro-lane reportable?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-11-25T20:53:07.318+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"it isnt really in the spirit of the game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2017-11-26T01:27:30.572+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Technically: No\nIn Reality: Anyone can report anything, and that's what Riot want's.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2017-11-26T03:58:46.070+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I think I'll agree with Essembie's statement of \"it's not really in the spirit of the game\". However, based on the information provided, it does seem that both you and your lane opponent had \"winning\" in mind as the main intention behind agreeing to a peaceful lane (and it's not like you're really going with a different playstyle, pretty much just \"playing safe\"). That, in itself, isn't really a punishable offence, so I don't imagine you'd receive any kind of consequence from this.\n\nWith that in mind, Riot's policy on reporting is that players should report any behaviour they *personally* believe to be unacceptable (kind of like what JasonWazza has said). It's that kind of feedback, on a large scale, that indicate to Riot what behaviours the overall community doesn't want to see in-game.","replies":[]}]}
