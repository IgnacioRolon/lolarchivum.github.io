I have repaired the game through the sign in menu, and have even uninstalled and reinstalled the game, which only worked for one game, then it broke again. Does anyone know what is causing this, or know what I can do to fix this issue? Because I would really just like to enjoy some LoL lmao :/","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-03-02T09:32:32.968+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Do you have any overlays active? (Discord, Overwolf etc etc). If so disable or update them. Usually this sort of behaviour is the result of something over the top of your League window (like an overlay) not working as intended.","replies":[]},{"poster":"ChriSKate","date":"2018-03-08T07:52:55.337+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, Chris from Overwolf here :)\nThis issue doesn't look like it could be related to Overwolf, but our support team would love to help you make sure of that.
