You don't have to be rank 5 with a champion to earn an S rank, you just have to earn an S rank to get a chest.\n\nTo get an S rank you have to play better than the vast majority of players on that champion in that position. S+ is the top 2% of scores on that champ in that position.\n\nMastery 5 has nothing to do with earning chests, you only have to get an S rank on a champion you own, or have someone in your premade get an S while you are playing a champ you own.","replies":[]}]}
