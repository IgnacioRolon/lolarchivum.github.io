But a few days ago, I thought of a game were bots (As in Champion Bots) wonder around in a map (Summoner&#039;s Rift &middot; &lrm;The Twisted Treeline &middot; &lrm;Howling Abyss &middot; &lrm;The Crystal Scar), Then when you kill them they will be automatically switched into your team (Also including enemies team Bots) which includes the bots getting a level of some sort, such as an item or a level in exp or a level in difficulty.\n\nThe game will get progressively hard through out the game and the bots will get extremely harder to defeat.\n\nAlthough, I don&#039;t know how to make the game more fair because when the enemy team gets a stronger team. Like, what if they have all the champs on a high level, it&#039;s basically useless to try and kill them. Do you know what I Mean?\n\nMaybe there should be a crystal that spawns a new champ after 20 minutes or so in the game, which spawns the bots in average level of all the bots. so like the _mean_ (Maths term) of all the bots.\n\n\n**This is really weird, because it&#039;s my first time making a post. &gt;.&gt; I don&#039;t know if people will comment or not. But will this be a thing if people actually vote or something? like if the riot people check this on request?**\n\n{{champion:26}}  ~The best  KILL STEAL EVER! ;D","replies":[]}
