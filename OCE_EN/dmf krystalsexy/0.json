I live in Canberra and play LoL in Canberra, and I have been getting an increase in latency recently. When I play, I used to get around 20~30 ping, but now it stays at 450 ping every game. I checked that my internet speed was same as before. Sometimes, when I leave the game and come back, the ping becomes alright, but that costs me the lane every game. Also, sometimes leaving the game and reconnecting doesn&#039;t solve the issue. Could you please help me?","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2015-10-22T03:27:41.575+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey,\n\nThe support article on [Troubleshooting Connection Issues](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169336-How-do-I-run-a-traceroute-) might be a good starting point.\n\nMight also be good to run a trace route to 103.240.227.1 to check the path between you and the server.\n\nLet me know how you go\nCheers\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"DMF Krystalsexy","date":"2015-10-26T05:26:57.487+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"These are my results.

Do you connect over wifi by any chance?  Have you tried direct connecting with a cable or resetting the router?\n\nFor reference, this line is where I think the issue is highlighted: _1 192-168-1-1 (192.168.1.1) 87.763 ms 503.423 ms 4.079 ms_ \nIt shows that your connection to your router is inconsistent.   Without knowing a bit more, I'd assume it is a sign of either Wifi interference or an overloaded/unstable router.  On a stable network, I'd expect to see this number to be a consistent ~1ms.\n\nI'd suggest a router reboot and also try connecting with a cable.\n\nCheers\nMindstar\n","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"ElysiumManifests","date":"2015-10-20T08:44:57.291+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello,\n\nYou still around??\n\n~ORION~","replies":[{"poster":"DMF Krystalsexy","date":"2015-10-22T07:14:57.919+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes","replies":[]}]}]}
