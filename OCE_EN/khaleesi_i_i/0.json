As such, it'll \"repair\" the bare minimum components for LCU to properly launch. After that, it should start patching normally.\n\n**System Error**\n\nOn a completely fresh OS install, the Alternate Installer will not install third-party dependencies in order for the game client to run. One such dependency is DirectX; have them install it from the Microsoft Website.(edited)","replies":[]}]}
