I feel like my roster of champs is pretty wide and have always managed to obtain atleast gold in previous seasons, minus a year or so break from the game.\r\n\r\nSince moving here, I feel like im finally experiencing &quot;Elo Hell&quot;. Every single game without fail, I have an afk on my team, someone who starts the game off swearing and shouting obscenities, someone who has watched a nightblue video and thinks they can soraka jungle for the first time.\r\n\r\nI give up positions for people, I help others in the best way possible. Whenever I actually put effort into the game, it&#039;s always a loss. Every single one of my performances are usually an A or S, yet I still get punished outrageously for having bad teams or afks.\r\n\r\nIve been demoted twice in one day and I don&#039;t understand the match up system here. It always feels like I have a team full of bronze elo players who are new to the game and this wouldn&#039;t be a problem, except we end up getting matched against plats and high golds.\r\n\r\nMy team gets trashed, without fail. And no matter how well I play, it&#039;s impossible to carry now. The new turrets, the new runes... It makes it so difficult to solo carry.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how to persevere?","replies":[{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-12-28T04:42:31.003+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Take a break for a year, come back and complaining why he couldnt make gold. \n\nHere is a thought, YOUR skill lv have deteriorated.

In probably 90% of my games someone gets told to kill themselves, hang themselves, slit their wrists, uninstall themself etc. I'm certain all these players get reported. I know I report them I'm sure the rest of the team do, but I keep names of all the players who do it and nearly all of them are still playing and their accounts not banned.\nI've leveled over 30 accounts to level 30+ now, and large amounts of them were leveled by just running it down mid game after game after game and only 4-5 accounts have been banned. 4-5 may seem like a lot, but I'm talking out of literally close to 40 accounts. \nI don't believe it's possible the staff at OCE are just worse at their job than the rest of the world, I'd say it's more likely their hands are tied due to the unique constraints of Australian law because they host servers here, but I'm honestly just guessing here and hoping they're actually not as bad at their job as they appear.\n\nI'm only talking about ban bans, 14 day or perm. Not referring to 20 minute game restrictions as they do nothing you just load a second league client in a VM and queue the restricted account on the VM while playing another account on your desktop and completely ignore the 20 minute game timers. All those game timers do is make pissed off tilted kids more pissed off and tilted they had to wait 20 minutes to play.\n\nAustralia is one of the few countries in the world you can actually call the police if someone is harassing you in game and they will do something about it. I believe it's the reason OCE didn't have a tribunal when the rest of the world still did. My understanding of it is it was a minefield of legal problems if someone used the tribunal to punish players they didn't like.\n\nThe laws put OCE players in a unique position also. You can literally call the police and report someone for hate speech in game. It has to be legit hate speech though, you can't just ring the cops because someones calling you bad or a noob, but if someone tells you to kill yourself and riot don't ban that player then you are well within your rights to call the police and tell them someone was trying to encourage you to kill yourself. Honestly I think if players want to force Riot's hand to start actually doing something about intentional trolls and toxic players the best method they have is to start calling the police. With the current anti bullying climate, and a number of people recently killing themselves after being told to do it online, if the police suddenly have tonnes of calls all coming in about the same game, you better believe Riot will have some legal questions to answer about why they're allowing these reported accounts to continue playing","replies":[]}]}
