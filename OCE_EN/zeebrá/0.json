It's pretty sporadically that it happens, sometimes it happens 5 times in one game, other times it might only happen once or twice and then it might not happen again for 3-4 games. It seems to always happen just at the start of a big team fight, which usually results in a game loss - hella frustrating when trying to climb. \r\n\r\nI've tried uploading some logs into the latency checking tool and most games I have a 0.20% packet loss, but on the games where I have had the disconnections then my packet loss is just listed as NA/N%. \r\n\r\nI noticed that there is issues with the network and client as of the 17th May, but I feel like I might have been having this issue before then.\r\n\r\nI've tried reinstalling and repairing the client.\r\n\r\nAny help or advice would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks &lt;3\r\nZeebrá","replies":[]}
