Seem&#039;s kind of unfair when lvl 3 players get matched with lvl 10+, since the match-making is intended to be &quot;fair&quot;, that is highly contradictory. Is it possible to make spells such as smite available at lvl 1?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-14T14:16:46.704+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Because actual NEW players have a lot to learen already. Riot would rather introduce things step by step then take the DOTA route and say \"heres 100+ characters and everything in the game. good luck\"\n\nEasier to learn. You get all of them unlocked by level 10 anyway. Which takes like 30 games if that.","replies":[{"poster":"Vespar","date":"2016-02-14T14:44:50.796+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand your point, but it's not like dota where you get 100+ heroes. These are like 7? summoner spells. \n\nYes, I can see that you get them at lvl10, what I'm trying to suggest is that it is frustrating as a veteran player to queue as a lvl3 and verse lvl10+ players.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying Riot needs to release them all, why not just smite to allow people to jungle?","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-02-15T01:28:29.449+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Because jungling without runes and masteries (at least level 10 people have 10 masteries) is ridiculously hard, even if you are smurfing and know what you're doing. \n\nBy hastening the introduction of the \"jungle\" role, it allows new summoners to have a firm grasp of laning dynamics and what some of the basic champions you encounter in low level games do. It sets then up for further success when they do start to jungle, as they have been in a lane and know how they work. \n\nThe only people who jungle in low level games (pre 20) are smurfs. Most games you don't even need a jungle.","replies":[{"poster":"Vespar","date":"2016-02-15T08:23:17.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree that Riot aims to introduce roles as we level, but it is because of your last comment that prompted me to create this topic and mostly because the matchmaking system has certain flaws, but again, this probably can't be helped.\n\nItI feels very restricted when queueing as a low level, yet getting people much much higher with other spells unlocked.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"bonjwa1","date":"2016-02-14T13:31:22.139+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is possible and RECOMMENDED to play with bots if you are new :)","replies":[{"poster":"Vespar","date":"2016-02-14T13:55:22.620+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"uhh..... missing my point.
