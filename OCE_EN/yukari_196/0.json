I clicked on the link and went to a website that let me log in with my username and password. I logged in and it takes me again to that dialog saying \"update your account to Riot account\". That process just loops forever. Telling me to log in and update account, and then tells me to log in again. PLEASE HELP! I cant even play League now because that dialog in my client is there forever, I cant even close it.
