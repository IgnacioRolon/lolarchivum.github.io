Not int feed mind u but just give no fucks attitude.\r\n\r\nTeam in general does poorly, tryndamere gets fed, akali gets fed. It&#039;s pretty much gg no matter what\r\n\r\nIn the 20 minute game I was in fountain for like 5 minutes? 3 when they denied remake then another 2-3 at the end whilst they took nexus.\r\n\r\nNot once did I get the afk notification but lo and fucking behold theres an afk ban on my account.\r\n\r\nI dont want to play some shitty game where I have to 1v2 for 20+ minutes waiting to (90% of the time) lose.\r\n\r\nFor 5-6 minutes of afk in a 4v5 that didnt get remade and I had to 1v2. Part of the time was waiting for them to end cuz open mid. I get a fucking 10 minute afk ban?\r\n\r\nHow dare I be pissed off that I waste fucking 20 minutes of my life playing some shitty 4v5","replies":[{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-11-12T08:22:30.835+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"You afk'd and are complaining about an afk ban ?","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-11-12T09:31:08.856+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Knuuckles,realm=OCE,application-id=T8eq2lFQ,discussion-id=NGRKeHeJ,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-11-12T08:22:30.835+0000)\n>\n> You afk&#x27;d and are complaining about an afk ban ?\n\nthis.
