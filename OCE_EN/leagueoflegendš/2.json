Now usually if you miss out you miss out, but the fact I was experiencing issues throughout that period, not being able to purchase riot points due to the client bugging. I now sit here without the skin.\r\n\r\nI submit a ticket into riot games, asking for them to please allow me to buy the skin as I would have owned it had THEIR system not bugged out, had THEIR  system allowed me to purchase Riot points or make ANY transactions of any sort. Then I'd have the skin. I have spent over $3000 dollars on League of Legends, I'm a skin collector and have 489 skins and counting. Regardless to the fact I was having issues within the client to making any transactions, the amount I have spent ALONE should be enough for them to give leniency.\r\n\r\nTheir reply is as followed, \"As much as I would like to be able to extend the Challenger Ahri sale to you, I am unfortunately not able to. It is against our policy to extend sales to individuals for any reason, as this would not be fair to other summoners. The only time we extend sales is after server downtime - so that everyone has a chance to catch the sale after the servers come back up. Extensions granted after downtime happen automatically within the game store.\"\r\n\r\nI realize it's an unfair advantage towards other summoners as they wouldn't have the same privilege, but what you have to realize RIOT is it's a unfair advantage that I wasn't able to make any transactions within the client BECAUSE YOUR STUPID CLIENT WAS BUGGING.\r\nHow is that fair what's so ever to me that everyone else that wasn't haven't issue's of some sort were allowed to purchase the skin, yet I can't because your client is bugged?\r\n\r\nPeople might sit here and probably think \"this guys complains to much\" or \"you spent enough of the game\" or \"no one cares\" but that's fine.\r\nThe point i'm trying to make is Riot Games wants to make a fair game for everyone, well then realize when you make mistakes and fix them. Instead of making people who PAY  your BILLS suffer.\r\n\r\n#RIOTGives0FksAboutTheirCustomers","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-05T15:24:55.664+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You should have made a support ticket back when you were having trouble purchasing Riot points in order to have the issue cleared up before Challenger Ahri left the store.\n\n\nYou had ample time to talk your problem out before the closing period.","replies":[{"poster":"LeagueOfLegendš","date":"2015-02-05T22:44:53.220+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a lot of family issue's going around at the time, and contacting Riot wasn't on my first Priority list, I had good reason to believe that the bug/issue would have been fixed much before a whole week.","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2015-02-06T04:39:07.382+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Then it's your own fault.

The want to keep this completely fair to all summoners yet I summoner having a bug issue which is caused from Riots servers, or dodge coding is making a disadvantage to someone, therefore they should take leniency on that summoner.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"LiAMfACE","date":"2015-02-05T15:45:59.527+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's unfair for you to get the skin..

Put yourself in his shoes, where you are a skin collector and you make it your best effort to buy and own all skins, and you even have spent thousands upon thousands on the game, and you were having bugs/issues with the client.
