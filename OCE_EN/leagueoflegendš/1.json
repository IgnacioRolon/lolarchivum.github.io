My goal is to own all the buy able skins by mid thus year! I'm slowly buying the last of the 41 as they go on sale, and purchasing the new skins as they are released.\r\n\r\nSupport me or not but I'm emitting what I do and am having fun while doing it!","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-11T21:36:35.530+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"I still support you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"csm","date":"2015-03-11T19:15:26.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand it's a hobby or w/e.\n\nBut what is the point in owning that many skins?","replies":[{"poster":"Zero Infinity","date":"2015-03-11T22:58:20.486+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Some people are collector; they pay money for full collections.","replies":[]},{"poster":"my dads a cop","date":"2015-03-13T01:30:03.539+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"so he can realise that if his account gets hacked, he will have nothing","replies":[]},{"poster":"Homura Akemi","date":"2015-03-12T06:43:43.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it is the biggest waste of money lmao","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2015-03-11T21:35:20.279+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Argonian","date":"2015-03-12T11:13:52.970+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"An old account of mine had almost every skin (Minus the promotional PAX, Championship and Ranked skins) back in 2012 which i spent a considerable amount on.
