I am using chrome by the way. Why am i installing the game in the first place you ask? \r\n\r\nSo, the last pvp match i played. (Before i chose to re-install) the game kept on freezing. I could move my cursor though. I chose to exit ( cmmd + alt + esc) and reconnect. Every time i reconnected, it would freeze after a couple of seconds. I could not type as well. This happened around 4 times before i chose to exit LoL and log back in, because it usually works. However, i could not log back in or get on. \r\n\r\nWhenever I clicked on LoL, only the logo would show up and nothing will happen. After a few minutes, this message will pop up. (Sorry for the arrows and stuff) \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/qr3U60z.png\r\n\r\nThis happened for a day, every time i wanted to go on, it would not let me. So I deleted LoL so I can re-install. I tried the remove solutions fix and the remove some files ( I forgot what it was) but none of that seemed to do anything. I went on the LoL site and clicked on play now. Then I chose the option already have an account lalala. Every time i clicked on the download button, nothing will happen and after a few moments this screen would come up.\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/MFOSzsR.png\r\n\r\nThis has happened everytime for the past day. Just recently, i have cleared my browsing data just incase that was the case but it would still not let me download.\r\n\r\nPlease help and thank you!","replies":[{"poster":"SumCoolAid","date":"2015-01-20T10:36:55.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Could you please provide the logs that it generated this would help me solve your issue.","replies":[{"poster":"SirBaconRoll","date":"2015-01-20T22:00:35.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, thank you for you reply but I do not know how to get the logs.","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-01-21T07:05:14.596+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Applications/League of Legends/Contents/LOL/RADS\n\nIn this folder you'll find the patcher logs.

This might be solvable.\n\nI know you said you've uninstalled, but I'd like you to try somethings, if you will. [Change your DNS](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq4) and [turn off your firewall](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq2), then try again.
