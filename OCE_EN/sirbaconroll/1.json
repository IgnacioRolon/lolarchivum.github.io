Maybe GLITCH?]","subforum":"Help & Support (OCE)","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I understand this is like a punishment for begin AFK/leaving games but sometimes I left the game as my home phone is connected to the wifi so whenever someone uses it, the wifi cuts off and usually the calls are very long. The leave buster low prority queue keeps refreshing when it hits 0:00. This has happened over 4 times but I only have recorded 1. I have a  gif  from my video as I don't know any video hosting sites sorry, to show that the leave buster low priority queue keeps refreshing. I did not leave the queue just incase that matters.\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Click on play\r\n2. Select for eg, co-op vs Al\r\n3. Click on Beginner\r\n4. Leave buster low priority queue will show up\r\n5. Wait the amount of time you are suppose to wait. (for me it is 10)\r\n6. The timer gets to 0:00 it will restart \r\n\r\nBUT if I get invited to a party, I wait 10 minutes then we are in queue. \r\n\r\nThis happens every time I want to play a co-op vs Al game but not when I get invited to a party.\r\n\r\nVideo/gif -----> Taken on 2014 Dec 17 Wednesday 20:21 \r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/w6ewSJm.gif","replies":[]}
