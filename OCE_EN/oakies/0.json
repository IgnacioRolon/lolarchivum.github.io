It would be nice to customise runes just as one customises masteries. Not everyone has the IP or money to afford 5+ rune pages for different positions and lanes. \n\nI can understand if Rito wouldn't want this though since they are probably making money on the 7-rune page deal and if people were to customise prior to each game then people wouldn't go for some of the rune page RP deals. \n\nI support the changes though.","replies":[]},{"poster":"HTMekkatorque","date":"2015-11-13T06:43:43.735+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would like to add that if you make them moveable you also include a lock feature as it could be an annoyance to accidentally move pages all the time. :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"OakIes","date":"2015-11-13T02:59:21.257+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Great too see how strongly people feel about this I tweeted this page at RIOT and maybe it can make a difference.","replies":[]},{"poster":"bollockz","date":"2015-11-13T02:33:57.636+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot have stated that they are working on a NEW client.
