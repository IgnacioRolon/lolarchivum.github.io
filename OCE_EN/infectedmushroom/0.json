I am by no means an angel. I just played a ranked game with a guy who AFKd 10 mins in to purely type racial abuse for the next 10 mins until we had to surrender. This behaviour is a joke, accounts should be perma-banned for it... Hands down.\n**[REMOVED]**    &lt;- This guy really needs looking into\nI&#039;m white and I felt insulted by it, I can&#039;t imagine how the two Chinese fellas felt. Disgusting!!!\nPlease let me know if this gets taken care, I can take a fair bit of abuse but the trash this guy was typing to the other guys... Wow.\\\nNo space for racism, especially in a region so culturally diverse, only inbred sister lovers would deem it as okay.
