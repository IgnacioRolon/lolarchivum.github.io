(Anivia/Zac style passive). Granting Rock Lee some time to recover.\n\nPassive: every 3rd auto attack against the same target heals rock lee for  26 / 32 / 38 / 44 / 50 (+ 70% AP)\nSustain aimed to be like xin's in effectiveness.\n\n**Q. Dynamic Entry!\nRange: 600 \nCD: 12 secs**\n\n\nRock Lee fly kicks, closing the gap on a target hitting it for 5/7/10/12/15% of max health + (100% Bonus AD) slowing the enemy by 40%.\n**Dynamic Entry can only be used while out of combat.**\n\n**W. Springtime of Youth CD: 6/6/5/5/4**\n\n\nEpowers Rock Lee's next AA, 20/60/80/100/120 (+10% Bonus AD)\nRock Lee gains attack 20/25/30/35/40% attack speed. (AA reset)\n\n**E. Leaf Tornado CD 16/14/12/11/10**\n\n\nRocklee sweaps the legs out from his opponents, knocking up all opponents around him. Doing 60/90/120/150/180 + (90% Bonus Attack Damage).(small knockup, not alistar/malph size)\n\n**R. Open the gates.\nCD: 100/80/65secs**\n\n\nRock lee pushes his body beyond its natural limits, granting him bonus 25/30/40 AD and movement speed 10/15/20% lasting 10 secs, Gains Primary Lotus ability.\n\n**Primary Lotus:**\n\nRock lee knocks the target up, pushing his body to the point of breaking he follows the target delivering a devistating combo. 400/600/800 damage + (150% Attack Damage).\nAfter using primrary lotus Rock Lee's is completely fatigued. Applying fatigued debuff to himself, slowing movement speed by 90% and reducing damage by 50% for 10 seconds.\n\nThis kit is aimed at jungle, early ganking style similar to lee/xin. Being able to use his revive passive for safer dives.\nHe has some sustain in his passive and attack speed to help survive the harsh jungle.\nHis Q can only be activated if he is out of combat, this is aimed at giving him a weakness so ranged/poke teams are able to abuse this.\n\nHe could also top lane, but would be best used as a counter pick as ranged champs who could keep him in combat such as Kennen/Gnar or Moakai would deny him his gap closer.\n\nHis ultimate applys a hefty debuff so Rock Lee players would use it when they are sure it's a 1v1. We believe this will seperate good Rock Lee players from the great. :P\n\nI'd imagine he would build similar to Lee sin, 1-2 damage items usually or he would become paper. However QSS synergises well with his ult as he  could remove his fatigue debuff which I think makes him somewhat unique. Sheen effects would work well.\n\nHe's a good ally for Yasuo who could use his windwall to keep him from behing poked and put into combat. Also Rock Lee can setup Yasuo ults with his E.\n\n\nMy numbers might be too much/not enough but thats easily balaced..right?\nI did try to compare his spells to similar spells to get an idea for damage, but comparing spells individually and not as a whole can lead to a kit that has too high/low damage.\n\nOh a little easter egg quote, When he first see's an enemy/Ally Ahri he'd say \"huh.. 9 tails..Fox? No that's Impossible\"","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2015-02-01T08:18:07.778+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"LoL only makes references to other medias instead of simply porting them from somewhere, except the original few but it's a complicated issue I'd rather not go there.\n\nSo this idea is a No I am afraid, not to mention Rock Lee has nothing to do with Balance, the ninja group of LoL.\n\nAlso Naruto kinda went down the bin after its again and again awkward plot shields, nonsensical \"twists\", completely underdeveloped world and characters, sloppy story writing and disjoint themes all over the place. Shame I used to quite like it.","replies":[{"poster":"TimFromAccountng","date":"2015-02-01T08:21:49.663+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's cool, You don't have to like Naruto to like a few of it's characters. Lee and Gai are classic.\n\nIt's not like I expect riot to make Rock lee a champ, it's just fun to make kits for random anime/games you like, made one of Mario once it was funny =] He ate a shroom as an ult. Try it!","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"VENI VIDI VICI","date":"2015-02-01T18:51:58.584+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahahahahahahaahhahahahahahaahaha","replies":[]}]}
