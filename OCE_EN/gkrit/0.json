Upon reaching 5 stacks of &#039;Blood Boil&#039;, Blood Boil turns into an aura surrounding Nunu and the effects become doubled for the remaining duration.  \r\n\r\n**_- Ice Blast -_**\r\n*Is now a lobbed skill shot (like corkis bomb).\r\nIf Ice blast is a direct hit, deal damage and slow target significantly while marking them. If Nunu AA&#039;s a marked target, he blasts the area in front of him in a cone dealing damage to all enemies hit, briefly slowing them.\r\nIf Ice blast misses, create an area of terrain that significantly impairs enemy movement. Lasts X secs. (could work similar to yoricks E)\r\n\r\n_**- Absolute Zero -**_\r\n*If this could be done I reckon it would be super fun to play but would prob need to wait till full champ rework...*\r\n\r\nWhen activating ult, Nunu charges his ult like he does currently. \r\nHOWEVER upon activating ult, Willump jumps off Nunu (in a chosen direction) at which point the player then controls Willump. \r\nWillump can only AA but each hit will briefly disrupt enemies with a 0.2 sec stun.\r\nWhen Nunu stops channeling, Willump jumps back onto Nunu.","replies":[{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2018-01-12T01:25:59.128+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nunu Jumps off of wilump (Wilump is the yeti)\n\nOther than that seems like a reasonable change","replies":[]}]}
