This cooldown is continuously refreshed while Taliyah remains in-combat. &quot;_\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThematically, it seems cool enough but gameplay wise it just feels empty... \r\nFIRSTLY, the conditional elements to this passive feel very restrictive\r\nSECONDLY, her ult provides all the map presence she needs anyway.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\nSince &quot;worked ground&quot; is a unique feature of her kit, I feel like it should be played with a little more. Currently the only bonus you gain from standing within it is a little extra MS and mana refund which is nice but the downside hits pretty hard. So here are my ideas...\r\n\r\n1. Casting Q while inside worked ground creates a soft shockwave the size of the worked ground. This shockwave could deals small AOE dmg and slow for a very short duration. (If unbalanced, id be happy with no mana refund when casting Q in worked ground).\r\n\r\n2. Casting Q while inside worked ground reduces the cd of the worked ground by X seconds.\r\n\r\n3. AA&#039;s become slightly empowered while standing within worked ground. Similar visual effect as Xayahs W but with small rocks instead (semi delayed, hits first target like pixie bullets). \r\nMaybe, thematically this may be Taliyahs way of cleaning up the shattered debris from the worked ground by piffing them at the enemy?\r\n\r\nHopefully these spark other interesting ideas out there.. curious to see what they are :)","replies":[{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-25T00:58:17.217+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have disliked her passive because it tends to be buggy for me in every single match, both visually and mechanically. Sometimes I can be running along touching a wall for 3 or 4 seconds before it triggers, and that's not the combat timer. That always seems to happen on jungle walls where I guess the detection can get confused or has to think harder. Also when playing you'll always end up going close to walls, turrets, etc for just a moment in the regular course of moving around so she's always jumping on a rock for 1 second and then right back off and it looks clunky, and if you stop moving or start moving at around the same time it decides you're leaving or entering the rock surfing it can cause abrupt animation switches. Yeah I think it was better in theory than it is in practice.\n\nIf Riot were to change it up I think they'd start with trying to make the rock surfing a bit better rather than getting rid of it first, although I do like your 1 and 3 ideas. Something that comes to my mind is to get rid of the being near walls requirement and replace it with a not being on worked ground requirement. So you'll have a more reliable bonus for getting back to lane or roaming, won't be jumping in and out of it all the time, and also playing into that worked ground mechanic in a way that would have interesting interactions with laning and such. Maybe even combine that with the being near walls thing, so it's slightly faster still if you are near a wall or structure.","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2017-07-25T06:13:01.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Nikkip,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=x8jcKrb3,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2017-07-25T00:58:17.217+0000)\n>\n> I have disliked her passive because it tends to be buggy for me in every single match, both visually and mechanically.

Riot is really starting to get experimental and generous with newer champs which I think Taliyah may have missed out on some of her potential. My point however, is more about her passive being super dull. \n\nBtw, Vayne's passive at least plays a role in team fights and is further empowered when her ult is activated. Taliyahs is just... \"conditions apply\". If we had to keep it practically the same, Id rather they just give her boots of mobility effect without a wall condition. At least that way she can still invest in sorc boots.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2017-07-25T09:54:31.849+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im pretty sure Riot tentatively came at Lee with the stick, Lee held out his hand, they gave him the stick, he smacked them with it, then snapped it over his knee. \n\nI never said Vayne's wasn't more useful :P\nI said it was less interesting. \n\nVayne's movespeed is hella more OP!\nbut it is boring _\"Gains move-speed when walking towards champs\"_\nas opposed to \"**Surfs a** **rock** but only when near walls, but you cant use it after being in combat, not to mention has sick af animations, and you can do skateboard tricks with it when you switch between walls.\"\n\nYou cant argue that it definitely is more 'interesting' :P\ndespite being not as strong.","replies":[{"poster":"gkrit","date":"2017-07-26T05:03:07.295+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Good point!\n\nIt may be more interesting but it is not 'interestingly useful' lel","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-25T08:16:03.779+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I would love if Taliyah could fling herself with Seismic Shove as a way to jump walls, now that would be spicy.
