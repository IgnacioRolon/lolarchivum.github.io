This might be just me but I believe the latest change has highlighted a deep rooted issue of the ADC role. \n\nI&#039;m no pro but ADC viability is achieved through power spikes after 2 or 3 items. This helps them significantly when trying to scale into late game. I understand Riot has mentioned they want ADC to fit the idea of high risk vs high reward but maybe it&#039;s time for this change, much like how League of Legends has changed as a whole.\n\nSo my suggestions are:\n\n- **Increase ADC champions&#039; AD growth stat but take away power from typical AD shop items (eg. +20 AD at lvl 18 but reduce IE AD by 20).**\n\nIf you give ADC&#039;s more AD over time, you help secure their scaling. This gives the player more options to choose from when selecting offensive items and may opt for items such as Wits End more often as you are given the extra AD naturally. \n\nYou won&#039;t have to constantly go for what gives you the greatest power spike but go for what effects will help you get by from game to game.\n\nThis indirectly buffs crit rate items but not make items such as IE as MUST GET following any crit rate purchases. Lesser power spike, less demand.\n\n- **ADC attack frame shortening. **\n\nIt&#039;s awkward and AA cancelling doesn&#039;t really serve any significant purpose other than opening them up to danger and accidental AA cancelling. That&#039;s 2 negatives for something that seems so insignificant. Kalista has it easy in this regard.\n\nADC&#039;s don&#039;t really need more stacked against them since all their strengths have been sufficiently countered. \n\n\nThis is just based on my experiences and what I think would make ADC feel better to play as.","replies":[]}
