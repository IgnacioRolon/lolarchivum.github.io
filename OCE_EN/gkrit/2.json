When failing however, your long-term investment in trying to achieve success can be utterly devastating. The &quot;investment&quot; I&#039;m talking about is present in all roles, which is the grind you find yourself in when trying to get your items. ADC predominantly however, can barely perform until they get a certain few items which brings me to my main point...\r\n\r\n**CRITICAL STRIKES**\r\nWe all know what it does and how essential it is to a typical ADC but that in itself potentially underlines a concern with how effective the stat is in it&#039;s current state. I&#039;m not going to go into detail but instead suggest what I think could be an interesting twist on the whole concept.\r\n\r\n**Critical Stat:**\r\n- Now deals 125% of your attack\r\n- Critically striking a champion applies a stack of &quot;Weakness&quot; for 3 seconds. Attacking a weakened champ will proc weakness dealing bonus true damage.\r\n- Champions now have a base 20% crit rate\r\n- Shop items no longer provide Crit strike chance.\r\n- Shop items can provide increased crit damage modifiers\r\n- Shop items (typically for ADC or not limited to) can provide unique bonuses when procing &quot;Weakness&quot;.\r\n1. **BONUS A:** &quot;Trigger Happy&quot; - _Increase attack speed for X secs._\r\n2. **BONUS B:** &quot;Maim&quot; -  _Slows enemy movement speed for X secs. Decaying._\r\n3. **BONUS C:** &quot;Blooddrinker&quot; - _Heal for X amount over X secs._ \r\n- Specific champion skills have 100% crit rate(?)\r\n\r\nObviously if all of these were to be implemented, other things would need some balancing also but my focus here is just for critical strikes and how to make them a little bit more interesting and to also not be the &quot;only&quot; viable option for ADC.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts/ideas?","replies":[{"poster":"PLAYER47","date":"2018-07-14T07:20:36.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Change crit from RnG to damage increase: Crit rate does 200% of your AD; Say you have 100 AD with 100% crit chance would make it 200AD; Now if you have 50% crit rate the damage would be 150AD not RnG of doing 200AD at 50% chance.","replies":[]},{"poster":"TheDemonEmperor","date":"2018-07-14T03:59:07.975+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"If every champs get a 20% innate crit, then ALL HAIL irelia, zed, talon; Pretty much any champ that isnt an AP caster.

So with that in mind it may not be as strong as you might be imagining. Crit chance would also be capped at 20%.","replies":[]}]}]}
