On my 5th win i got 27 lp however i just won my 6th and i got 17 lp. Anyone know why I got less even though my streak is higher?","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-06-06T10:41:35.781+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its based on your MMR which is a hidden match making rating. The higher your MMR, the more LP you are likely to gain from wins.\n\nHOWEVER LP gains are also based on the game you are in. Now in a perfect world you will be matched with people with very similar MMR, however sometimes there are anonomolies that may end up with you in a game that is higher or lower average rating to your MMR which effects the LP gained from a win/loss.\n\nWinning a game that has a higher MMR average then your own gives you good gain and small losses from losing. Alternatively, winning games where the average is lower than yours, your gains are smaller but your losses are larger.\n\nYou are Silver 4, now in most your games there are a lot of golds. However in the game im assuming you got less games, it was a game heavily dominated by Silvers, so the system was basically telling you, this is a free win, so your not getting many points.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Alamo","date":"2015-06-06T10:08:10.635+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":8,"body":"It's mostly to do with your KDA, If you don't perform as well as your teammates you get less lp, Idk exactly how it works but thats what I think.","replies":[{"poster":"Khizzar","date":"2015-06-06T10:20:11.419+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Makes sense, I didn't get insanely fed the 6th game :p cheers","replies":[{"poster":"Crowd Pleasa","date":"2015-06-07T03:17:52.068+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Please do not listen to him, it has nothing to do with KDA at all, this guy has no idea what hes talking about. Its because your MMR is not high enough for the Ranked system to let you into your promotion games, so it tanks the LP that you get, forcing you to win another game before getting in(its forcing you to prove yourself essentially).","replies":[{"poster":"Transcender","date":"2015-06-07T03:35:23.727+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yes so to clarify what this guy said, it is not based on your performance, so you could feed and do nothing right but as long as your team wins you will go all the way up to challenger!","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Bipolar","date":"2015-06-06T10:24:46.088+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=MysticNinja,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=UjlKV5uT,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2015-06-06T10:08:10.635+0000)\n>\n> It's mostly to do with your KDA, If you don't perform as well as your teammates you get less lp, Idk exactly how it works but thats what I think.\n\nWhat?

I've duo'd with people, and I've either done much worse or much better, and we've got equal amounts of LP. it's based off of your mmr, your rank, and the enemies mmr.","replies":[]}]}]}
