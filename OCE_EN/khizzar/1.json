AFKers and all that. Now people have always wanted loss preventions and i used to get those back when I had to play on NA but haven&#039;t seen such on OCE yet. I think this is a massive issue in ranked and it&#039;s  unfortunate when the AFKer has unintentionally dc&#039;d; which turns out pretty bad for both the player and his/her team mates. I was  demoted this week because of that. \r\n\r\nWhat mainly prompted me to make this post was errors with ranked champion select. About 10 minutes ago i queued and then as i entered champ select my client was totally black apart from my personal chat bar with friends. I waited around 3 minutes and saw no change so i unfortunately had to log out and restart client which led to the loss of 5 lp. Now i know 5 lp is no biggie but if that had been a game in my series i would have been unsuccessful straight away which would have been pretty annoying.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe Riot could help the community out a little by giving players the option to appeal for these unlucky dc/pc error situations and if judged eligible they are rewarded with a loss/lp loss prevention. I realise this could possibly be a high maintenance task, just giving a personal voice on what maybe could be improved as I&#039;m aware that this issue not only affects me but also many other players in the region.\r\n\r\np.s here&#039;s a photo of the champion select error","replies":[]}
