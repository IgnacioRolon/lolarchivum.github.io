Please continue to follow through with the instructions in your ticket, and a support rep will assess if the account can be unbanned.\n\n\nFrom MasterMirkinen 6 hours ago\n> Hey Mr Peng Killer,\n\n> Normally we send emails when permaban players. You should contact player support for more information but from what I can see, you recently purchased RP with credit card and then charged back (either you or perhaps parents?).\nHave a check and once you have identified why this happened, please contact player support.\nI'm not 100% sure (I'm asking but I have not received an answer yet) but I believe if you resolve the issue, your account will be unlocked.\n\n> MM\n\n\nHope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-05-20T06:24:45.546+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"What?","replies":[]}]}
