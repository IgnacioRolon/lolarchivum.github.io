The problem was with creating the S_OK file, if I just right clicked and created a new file all I could create is text document files. There is a file called releasemanifest, just copy and paste that in the same folder and change the name to S_OK.\n\nrelease manifest is located in league of legends/RADS/projects/lol_air_client/releases/current version number (mine was 0.0.1.148)\n\nThis works because releasemanifest has no file type, and I don't know how to create a file with no file type on win7 other that copying that file and simply renaming it.\n\nLet me know how you go","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-06-11T09:36:23.894+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You posted this as I was writing mine.\n\nFancy formatting costs you first post, it seems. Aha!\n\nTo create a blank document in Windows 7, right click on any white space in File Explorer and then create a new Text document (should have the extension \".txt\"). When naming it, simply remove the \".txt\" from the end of it. If you have extensions disabled (as in, you can't view them), you must re-enable it in the File Options dialogue, under View.","replies":[{"poster":"Benny1","date":"2015-06-11T09:49:45.459+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ah sweet, I didn't know.

Here's what I do to fix it:\n\n* Close League.\n* Go to \"\\Riot Games\\League of Legends\\RADS\\projects\\lol_air_client\\releases\\\"\n* Create a new, empty file in the latest version folder (usually the largest number) named \"S_OK\", with no extension. Open League with admin privileges, and wait.\n\nThese instructions are for Windows, which I presume you have because you haven't specified.\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[{"poster":"IS1c1b74494de32279be5a3","date":"2015-06-11T19:50:35.484+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If I have the S_OK file already, should I delete it and make a new one?
