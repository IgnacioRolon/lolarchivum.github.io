(Which will probably get some people who hate autofill upset from the get go.) The reason why is this;\r\nI think it&#039;s a smart way to increase all player&#039;s general knowledge of the game in lower ELO. Also it helps keep queue times shorter. On top of that, in lower ELO you actually don&#039;t get autofilled very often because there are more supports. (1 in 15 games at most honestly, I haven&#039;t been autofilled in any of my past 20 games.) Then in higher ELO it keeps the queue times significantly shorter. Those are all good things that are healthy for the game. More game knowledge for everyone, less time waiting to play, more time playing. Those are all great things in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhat isn&#039;t great, is the player that gets autofilled to support and says, &quot;Fck autofill, I play top or mid or troll. Fck you.&quot; then proceeds to lock in a champ that is definitely not a support champ. (Insert Yasuo or Riven comment here.)\r\n\r\nSo, that leaves the other 4 players on that person&#039;s team with 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Have a duo mid/top lane with a salty player that is mad because the *actual* mid/top laner didn&#039;t switch to support for them. (That&#039;s supposing that they don&#039;t run into the enemy team at level 1 and just start feeding from 30 seconds into the game. Everyone has had a game like that.) Then eventually you lose, you wasted 20 minutes (ff20) of your time, and you lost a bunch of LP. Just because one person can&#039;t be mature about autofill.\r\n\r\n2. You dodge the game. You waste your time in the queue/champ select, and you waste time restarting League just because one person can&#039;t be mature and play their autofilled role for 1 game... Oh wait, then you lose LP, you get a temporary ban for dodging, and that immature player gets to carry on with their day with no consequences. Riot created an item for supports called Redemption, but I don&#039;t see any redemption in that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy solutions for this problem is quite simple. (Afterall, there is no point in complaining about a problem if you don&#039;t propose a solution to it.)\r\nSo here they are:\r\n- Implement a &quot;Report a Player&quot; option in champ select. Easiest option in my opinion. Then even if you play out the game, hopefully the ban hammer will come down on that player eventually. \r\n- Implement a vote kick player from the team in champ select. Allow the team the ability to give reasons why you want to kick that player from their team. Then if a certain player gets kicked from champ select too many times then they receive a temporary ban. *However*, to avoid abuse of this in something like Flex queue, where a party of players could gain up on a solo player, I think that you should give the player (who received the ban) the option to appeal it. I think that creating a sort of &quot;Replay of champ select&quot;  system that can automatically review if a player got kicked from champ select for legitimate reason or not. For example, if they try to appeal their ban and the system sees that the player locked in Yasuo with TP when they were assigned support and a chat recognition system could see that that same player said something like &quot;F*ck you I&#039;m playing top or feeding.&quot;; then their appeal won&#039;t be accepted, because that doesn&#039;t seem like a good team player who is promoting a team game.\r\n\r\n\r\nA comment about the ban system is that I think that the ban for intentionally screwing over your team shouldn&#039;t be *just* a warning and a 10 minute ban. It should be like a 24 hour long penalty from Ranked, then scales to a week if you do it again shortly after or something like that. Which in my opinion is not too harsh, particularly if there is an appeal system in place and if you consider that they can just go play on a different account anyways. \r\n- Why give someone a 10 minute ban? That&#039;s just 1 YouTube video, then they can go back to messing up people&#039;s Ranked games. Wooohooo.\r\n_The reason why I say this, is because *I&#039;m* never going to be the person that receives that ban. I&#039;m a nice player; I always play a support champion, buy a sightstone, redemption and place relevant wards and ping out enemies when I get autofilled to support. So people like myself, who play their assigned role (even if it&#039;s not the one they chose), and are nice to their teammates will not be negatively effected by having significantly longer ban penalties. (Except it will mean that those nice players will run into a few less toxic players when they&#039;re playing on theirr main accounts.)_\r\n\r\nAnyways, my ban for dodging because of that support who locked in Ignite Quinn should be done now. :P \r\nDo you have any opinions? Do you agree or disagree?","replies":[{"poster":"Mozzie25","date":"2017-03-19T23:11:03.249+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"While it's an interesting idea, I think it would end up being overly complicated and in the end not change a whole lot.  The problem isn't the systems riot has in place it's people's attitude towards them. \n\nYou can still report people for actions in a lobby by submitting a support ticket but perhaps there should be an easier way. With that being said then you might end up with a whole bunch of reports because people are doing things other people don't like. We've all had someone pick a champ in a off role sometimes super off role. Sometimes they go on to feed, sometimes they know what they're doing and do great. But how many people are just gonna mash that report button before they get into game because they can. \n\nThen you get issues of meta. Technically it's not against the rules to play something like riven support. The problem is when that person takes riven and doesn't play support. So reporting people just for picking a certain champ while in champ select is problematic. The only situation where I think it's a fantastic idea is verbal abuse that happens in the lobby. But that would probably be abused as well. \n\nThe kicking system is not a good idea. Far to many ways for people to abuse. It's the reason we don't have hot join or the ability to kick people in game. While it would be great if used correctly. There's far to many people who would misuse it. \n\nTLDR: Some nice ideas but I think there trying to address the symptoms rather than the root cause and the new systems you suggested would be wide \nopen for abuse\n\nEdit: Also having the only negative options for your poll as \"I like toxic players\" and \"I am a toxic player\" is super childish.
