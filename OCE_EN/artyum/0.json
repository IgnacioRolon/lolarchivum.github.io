How exactly can't you connect the client at all?

Go here and identify your router to find out how to configure it, and then forward ports 80, 443, 2099, 5000-5500 and 8393-8400. They should all be TCP&UDP for most likely working results, though they can all be put on only TCP, except for 5000-5500. 5000-5500 needs UDP as well as TCP.\n\nIf you need me to clarify these instructions any further, just ask!\n\nBest of luck.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
