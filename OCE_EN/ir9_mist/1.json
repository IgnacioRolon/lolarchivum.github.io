I understand that you cant have too many of one set of skins to but i think that you guys should consider making one for her.

Its like using a gun. Wielding the weapon doesn't make you part robot. Also I really don't think vi really fits in with the rest of the other guys. They also have to fill a specific role and Yi already has the role of going jg. Nevertheless its a nice try but I don't think it'll work. However I'll be happy if they release a new vi skin because im not really a fan of the skins she has right now and would like a skin that actually completely changes her particles. Sorry bout the sentence block.","replies":[]}]}
