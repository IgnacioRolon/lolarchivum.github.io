The wandering hermit Lyte jostled like one of Zaun&#039;s steam golems, his spades, shovels and magnifying glass appendage clanking together while we smacked various poro&#039;s off his merchandise tables.\r\n\r\nA ball of dust covered Lyte as a Rickshaw came screeching to a halt in front of him. The robust driver let out a great sigh as he heavily dropped his passenger, a blue-haired Ionian Princess, who was about to scream &#039;idiot!&#039; at him until she remembered she couldn&#039;t speak.\r\n\r\n&#039;I need better booots!&#039; thundered the obese red haired man who pulled a large barrel of grog out of seemingly nowhere and guzzled it carelessly in the middle of the street. Beer, dirt and sweat all ran together down Gragas&#039; enormous gut while passing parents covered their children&#039;s eyes. Lyte&#039;s small robotic assistant Geeves hovered away from the burley Freljord boozer like someone had stepped in poop. &#039;You a cabbie?&#039; asked Lyte, eyeing off the Rickshaw and the grumpy woman who was trying to clean her etwahl without any luck. \r\n\r\n&#039;Look you white-bearded buffoon, my feet are killing and I need better boots!&#039;. Gragas showed off one of his great hooves, littered with tiny rocks.\r\n&#039;Ahhh.... you need Ninja Tabi, my flabby cabbie. Not much more basic damage than small rocks eh Geeves?&#039;. His small assistant whirred in agreement.\r\n&#039;Arrghh!&#039; growled Gragas, seemingly offended at the series of implied insults that topped off the fact he&#039;d been stuck with carrying this blue haired Ionian doll and her hair- shedding body guard ever since that card game he lost to one of those river-folk of the Serpentine. How was Gragas to know he was an &#039;infamous card master&#039; - or for that matter, an expert tango dancer. The latter Gragas had to admit, he did rather admire.\r\n\r\nOut of the dust next to Gragas materialised a powerful looking warrior. Serrated fist knives were strapped to his huge paws, teeth and bones of stalked prey hung from necklaces, and his huge mane was platted in the style of the head-hunters.\r\n&#039;We don&#039;t have shoes for your dog&#039; said Lyte, as he went through his stock of Ninja Tabi to look for a size 15.\r\n&#039;Arrrrgggghh!!&#039; growled Rengar as he pushed in front of Gragas, seemingly offended by the merchant, but made the mistake of pushing to close to Gragas&#039; face and copped an enormous, beer-flavoured burp instead. They begun to push each other but between Rengar&#039;s fur and Gragas&#039; sweaty, fat body, they had to fight sticking to each other. Just then two mysterious men pushed them out of the way and confronted Lyte and his tiny robot minion.\r\n\r\nThe first man was covered in flexible Ionian armour, with polyocular vision scopes and a huge sword-blade scabbard strapped to his back. Behind him, another Ionian ninja warrior stood, arms folded, his spirit blade hovering ghostly in the air. The first man spoke in a quiet, but wise-sounding voice.\r\n&#039;I am after the key&#039; said Yi.\r\n&#039;And who are ye?&#039;.\r\n&#039;I am Yi&#039;.\r\n&#039;Yi you want a key?&#039;.\r\n&#039;That&#039;s what I said are you mocking me?&#039;.\r\n&#039;Guys just by standing here I&#039;m losing 1 hp&#039; added the second ninja, then coughed and turned away as everyone stared at him.\r\n\r\nBefore this could go any further a giant shadow fell over the whole group as a towering, jackal-headed ancient of Shurima strode right up to Lyte&#039;s shop. Power emanted from this warrior of the sands, and fear fell upon people passing by so that they emptied the market.\r\n&#039;I said we don&#039;t serve dogs&#039; Lyte remarked without looking up from his merchandise.\r\n&#039;Arrrgggh!&#039; yelled Nasus, &#039;don&#039;t tempt me little man, I have many stacks!&#039;.\r\n&#039;You have lots of tax?&#039; Lyte asked.\r\n&#039;I have mighty stacks!&#039; bellowed Nasus.\r\n&#039;You want to buy some racks?&#039; Lyte enquired.\r\nThe Shurima champion looked like he would blow his... well... his stack. However before that could happen Yi and Shen shoved back to the front demanding their key, while Rengar pushed in front of them trying to grasp the small shop keeper while Sona stamped her foot and pointed furiously at all of them. Just then a terrible rumbling ran throughout Gragas belly... spoiled Poro snacks eaten hours earlier were about to reveal their nasty revenge. He bent over in obvious pain, grit his teeth... and let rip Thunderlord&#039;s decree. And then the fight started.\r\n\r\n&#039;ALL IN!&#039; yelled Gragas and Rengar.\r\n&#039;ALL IN!&#039; yelled Shen and Master Yi.\r\n&#039;ALL IN!&#039; yelled Nasus.\r\n&#039;....................&#039; that angry silence... well, to be fair Sona was as mad as the rest of them.\r\n\r\nAmid the sword strokes, slicing notes, body slams and chaos was the vibration of multiple ultimates. All six of them all ended up in one great heap, crushed and conquered foes. Lyte stood looking over the fallen champions, Geeves hovering breathlessly behind him. Then Lyte took off his hat... and his white hair wig... and false white beard. Geeves watched in astonishment as the impersonator patiently removed his disguise, and stepped out in his size 3 Ninja Tabi&#039;s. This deadly assassin, this patience master of deceit, looked over his victims.\r\n\r\n&#039;Never underestimate the power of the Scout&#039;s code&#039;.","replies":[{"poster":"Fawn717","date":"2016-06-30T06:07:14.648+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This Is the most Fabulus thing I have ever seen =^.^= {{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
