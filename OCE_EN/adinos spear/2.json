Amid the mountains of bison bones, Vastayan corpses and dust devils of Rasal canyon was a skull that burned like hell. I watched it butcher a Demacian Calvary company on their way to Fort Jarvan. Sword, bullet and bayonet blades covered it like a pin cushion though they wounded it not. Those it didn&rsquo;t incinerate with its breath it hanged with its hell-fire lasso. I saw it sift their corpses for their souls the way they pan for gold in the boondocks&rdquo;. The dark-skinned lawman recalled his tale like the sermon of a lay preacher, causin&rsquo; a man to fear for his eternal soul. Only I could see when this man turned at just the right angle that his eyes shone like a feral cat in the dark. \r\n\r\n&ldquo;These lands used to brim with wildlife in the days before the Imperial Demacian and Noxian Navies appeared. They hunted bison for food and the Vastayan for fun. The native tribesmen too lost their lands, people and culture at a terrible rate. They needed to make a plan&rdquo;. I watched the dark-skinned gunslinger strike a brand from the fire and light a cigar. We met him on the road to Bandle City, said he was waiting to meet up with two notorious bounty hunters from Big Smoke. We offered him a meal in exchange for a tale and the aide of his trigger finger should we need it. Most my companions around the campfire sat still waiting to hear out his tale; some held their peace hoping they wouldn&rsquo;t.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The slave traders of Noxia and Demacia sent my people here on ships, chained, naked and whipped, without hope or future. The native tribesmen sent envoys to the elders of the old world &ndash; my home, to come together against the invaders. They summoned the council of shamans to bring a curse on their oppressors and to burn like fire throughout the New World. They called it the Threshing Spirit. That devil was thrice the strength of a man, robed in vengeance. It wielded a flaming lasso that burned deeper than a rancher&rsquo;s cattle brand, and it collected as its bounty the souls of men&rdquo;. The marshal&rsquo;s eyes fell on his shadowy left arm that smouldered for the barest of moments.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It was on the road to Alamo that I saw that evil spirit, and death and hell were his keepers.&rdquo; The sound of a branch snapping somewhere outside the camp interrupted the story, and before I could turn away from the camp fire the dark-skinned stranger had guns in both hands, guns unlike any I&rsquo;d seen before. One dark arm was twitching sinew, the other glowed like the embers of the camp fire. For moments there was silence before pistols were returned to holsters and my companions relaxed, turning back to the fire and our enigmatic story-teller.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Might&rsquo;n been nothin&rsquo;&rdquo; spoke one of the cow hands.\r\n&ldquo;I heard those tribesmen are out there, prowling around camps like ours this time &lsquo;er year. I &lsquo;erd some can turn in to bear or wolves, bigg&rsquo;r than an horse&rdquo; said another. Howls of disapproval came out around the camp with several hands and hats hitting the conspirator, but the silence that settled afterward seemed more tense with fear. The marshal grinned.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;If one of those shapeshifters were coming for us, you&rsquo;d hear a lot more than a twig snap and you&rsquo;d be dead in two shakes of a rattle snakes&rsquo; tail. There was one time I saw a bear, only not like your normal grizzly you find in these parts. I was watching the Noxian cavalry slaughtering a camp of Yordles near the Avalon prairies. Senna Firecat, the chief&rsquo;s daughter, had been my guide. She wanted me to see the terror they were bringing to these lands&rdquo;. The marshal stared deeper in to the fire, seeming to forget us for a moment as a painful memory stirred.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;You friendly wit&rsquo; a chief&rsquo;s dorter marshal?&rdquo; asked a cow hand to the backdrop of some rowdy laughs and murmuring, but the gunslinger&rsquo;s stone-cold gaze put it out like water on a fire pit. He continued.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The sky turned black with brooding, rainless clouds. I thought I heard several bison running towards the Noxian&rsquo;s until I saw there was only one. And it was no bison, but a bear, black as coal, armoured with burnished gold. Faster than a wild mustang and angrier than an army of hornets, I could feel the earth tremble underfoot. When he stood he must have been the height of two men. When he roared it was like the thunder had landed from the clouds in his lungs, and the lightning was in his teeth and claws. I watched him knock seven man twenty feet through the air. There wasn&rsquo;t a member of that cavalry company made it back that day. Senna told me he was the Thunder Lord of what they call the Ursine. She told me few of his kind are left&rdquo;. The marshal stared out in to the darkness beyond the camp for a long and silent moment. I felt that I was looking at something more than a man &ndash; or maybe less, I could not say. Was it something gained or something lost, that cursed looking, firebrand arm? But when his guns had moved to his hands I knew the speed with which it had happened was unnatural.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I was given a rare privilege of meeting their chieftain&rdquo;, continued the marshal, &ldquo;and as powerful as he was, I&rsquo;ll never forget in his eyes those deep, deep pools of wisdom. Us human folks have a lot to learn from those who knew these lands before the first Demacian prince sat on a throne&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;So you sayin&rsquo; you bin running with slaves and tribesmen, how on the lawd&rsquo;s green earth you become a Demacian marshal, stranger?&rdquo;. The other cow hands looked nervously at one another, not sure how their guest would take the directness of the question. If it troubled him, I couldn&rsquo;t see it.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;When the first slave ship beached near Calucutta smouldering with flame and garnished with human skeletons, the Demacian Pinkertons knew they were facing an unknown enemy, that they needed someone who&rsquo;d faced the Threshing and lived. Once the Thresh had been unleashed in these lands it didn&rsquo;t discriminate which souls it was bent of harvesting. It destroyed outpost settlements and native tribesmen alike. They did learn there was only one group who had faced the Thresh and lived, an outlaw trio gang as matter of fact who were among their most wanted. The first of these was part bandit, part steam engine, a terror of modern metallurgy, whose heart burned like a furnace and whose legs had long been replaced with metal pistons and pincers &ndash; &lsquo;Iron Ingot&rsquo; Urgot. The second, an exotic beauty from the East, an inner circle member of the Blood Moon Triad. Lady Elise, a true beauty, that is, until she spins you up in a web and poisons you until you&rsquo;re stiff as a dead man&rdquo;. The stranger laughed. &ldquo;And the last son of a bitch &ndash; we&rsquo;ll, you&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; at him. The only living survivors of meetin&rsquo; with the skull devil saw three of Demacia&rsquo;s most wanted because three of their newest deputies. I picked up the devil&rsquo;s scent in Toortoola and sent message. My compadres are on their way here by train right now&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Then why in tarnation we sittin&rsquo; &lsquo;ere with you stranger? Is this devil comin&rsquo; for ya?!&rdquo; shouted one of my companions and soon the camp was in disarray.\r\n&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t gonna find a Thresher of souls unless there be souls to thresh, and my soul is just about barren as these yonder canyons&rdquo;. The stranger stood up. Outside the camp huge gush of fire burst up in a spiral, and then travelled in a large ring all the way around the camp until we stood shaking in the middle of a giant ring of fire. A giant figure walked through the flame, a lasso burning brighter than molten steel spun over it&rsquo;s head like an executioner coming to take a calf or a lamb. Burning heat and terror lashed me, my knees shook, and my teeth chattered.\r\n&ldquo;Luuuuccciiiaannnn&hellip;..&rdquo; it breathed like death, like murder. The marshal smiled and tipped his hat. His guns moved to his hands so fast the eye could not follow.\r\n&ldquo;Well now, as my Mumma used to say, speak of the devil and he shall appear.&rdquo;","replies":[{"poster":"HellsHaven","date":"2018-09-12T01:13:13.063+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[]}]}
