Think about it, even origin and grand finals only see around 1.7-2.2million aussie viewers... Now of those viewers, how many play LoL? Let's be generous and say 10%, roughly 220,000 people. Now, on top of that Riot is a corporate entity, so using these teams without some sort of contractual agreement with the NRL which would have a financial component. How much $ would you say is left from a skin sale for Riot? Keeping in mind it has to pay its design teams also their salary etc. Lets round off and say most skins cost $10 in RP except legendary/ultimates and the odd 1350rp. Lets say for the sake of argument... It's $10. Riot may make around $3-4 per skin? So with our base of 220,000 interested players, lets say around 1/2 appreciate football enough to buy the skin. Thats $1,100,000 in sales.... which Riot only gets to keep around $300k-400k in profit lines, they bogged its design team down for a few months and restricted them from other projects. \n\nCool idea, won't really happen unless a designer puts personal effort in, which if he's a little lazy you could just recolour whole jersey's at a time like paint and fix the offset colours after. It's still alot of effort for minimal numbers. Thats the thing that sucks about Australia, it's hard for us to get Niche ideas off the ground due to low population. \n\nStill, i <3 where your mind is at *high 5*","replies":[]},{"poster":"bgentle2myashe","date":"2016-07-24T02:41:49.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's questionable and insulting to the rabbitohs to assign them to teemo =-(.
