One of them ^ photo shows that garen and ashe just rushed for tower at bot and get killed by ashe. And no, enemy ashe was ridiculously bad, 1 combo from rammus = dead. We only won because of annie and I, and the fact their team was not that great either.... thing im asking is does it get any better the higher level you get? at 20-30 level is there still as many trolls? thanks.

And another 1/3 of players are actually experienced players playing on what we call \"smurfs.\" These players already have a level 30 account and therefore will be a lot better than all other players. By the looks of it, that Annie might be a smurf (I can tell because she is 26/1, and has a decent build, and has a lot of farm (CS aka minions). By the way, don't build 2 of the same item (such as those two thornmails you built).","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rok","date":"2015-01-15T00:45:10.607+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im assuming this is just some troll whos been banned on NA Boards and has come to OCE to continue.
