I have got permenent banned for insulting the other players...\r\nI am very sorry for making other players feel bad as well as abusing in cyber..\r\nI still feel really sorry and regret it. I&#039;d like to ask you to be ashamed and release the permanent stop again. If you receive a report of abuse once, I will not ask you again neatly. \r\nThank you...","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2018-11-09T03:18:42.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"First things first, if you wish to appeal the punishment you will need to contact [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Account suspensions or restrictions\" option) and handle the situation with them. Fill out the form, inform them you want to appeal the punishment and provide a reason why you want to appeal. Keep in mind it may take support some time to respond (especially if they're busy), the first response will likely be generic (though after that they tend to put together more customised responses) and that they will only answer based on what you ask (if you ask a \"yes or no\" question, you'll get a \"yes or no\" response).\n\nAs for the punishment itself, there's a few factors to consider when determining if an appeal could be successful. One factor is the punishment history of the account, so if your previous punishment was a 14-day ban for the same behaviour you likely wont have a case for a successful appeal. It can also depend on the severity and consistency of the behaviour that led to the ban, though that is typically enough to result in a punishment of some kind (in which case you *might* be able to appeal for a reduced sentence, depending on punishment history).\n\nIf you wish, you have the option of posting the relevant chat logs here for others to view and comment on. There are several posters who will be happy to go through the logs with you to point out the kinds of behaviours that aren't acceptable, so that you can improve your behaviour going forward. You can also feel free to ask for advice on how to help improve your behaviour in other ways.","replies":[]}]}
