I dont understand because i thought it was 5min where u get auto loss of lp if you win or lose game. either way i dont think its fair that i missed out on 4min 30 seconds of game and receive loss even though i came back and it is even clear in the replay that i did not dc intentionally. i came back and still tried to win and make an impact. can someone from riot look into this? i know its only 20lp that i can get back but its kind of unfair dont you think?","replies":[{"poster":"The Last Breath","date":"2018-10-25T11:36:59.091+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"for whatever reason, I think you should get this fixed, there is probably bugs in it, every LoL client has it's limits. I suggest if it's is unintentionally for you to go afk or disconnected for any reason please do note everything, even screensaving it to collect all the evidence, once you obtain all the correct information, forward it to the riot department where they will deal with your problem then you go from there good luck bro! It's happens to me as well so you are not alone, hopefully you will end this crisis. \nCheers!","replies":[]},{"poster":"lcura","date":"2018-10-24T15:02:04.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"keep in mind i disconnected at 7min 20 in the game and came back around 11min 30ish","replies":[]}]}
