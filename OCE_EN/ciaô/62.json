The new jungle is awesome dont get me wrong, but for instance your playing was WW and you rather farm till 6 then gank its alot harder.\r\n\r\nThirdly i think most of the charters need a visual in the game so they look as real as the new SR!\r\n\r\nFourthly i think this is the best thing to League of Legends, these are just some opinions i have feel free to post your thoughts, haters welcome aswell :)","replies":[{"poster":"MadLifeJunior","date":"2014-11-25T03:21:42.146+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there Summoner, \n\nWhilst I agree with some of your statements let me express my own opinion.\n\nThe updated visuals which are \"a bit cartoonish\" in my honest opinion provide greater clarity rather than having a highly detailed visual display. The idea is that you focus your attention towards the players and minions etc. That's why more detail is put into those rather than the floor. As long as you know it's the ground it shouldn't be that much of a hindrance to your gameplay.\n\nWhen you say you prefer to farm till 6 then gank. Whilst this may seem like an effective strategy I can almost 100% guarantee it is not a very team oriented method of jungling. In my honest opinion you should not be farming up till 6 then ganking when you think you're in your prime. This would defeat the purpose of jungling entirely. You might as well just go duo top. In my assessment you should be looking for gank opportunity for each rotation you make between jungle quadrants. \n\nWith the amount of skins and content being developed by Riot in recent months, I would honestly say they have been visually updating champions. *cough*PoroSejuani*cough* \n\nKind Regards,\nlols =)","replies":[{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2014-11-25T03:56:56.160+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for feedback","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zaps","date":"2014-11-25T03:35:03.847+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> Firstly i think its a great change the visuals are amazing, having said this though what happend to the ground? they floor inside the base and into lane looks a bit cartoonish and the base floor looks terrible. \n\nJust a quick question on this - have you checked out the Video -> Environment Quality settings? I've noticed that that has a pretty big effect on the ground in the lane and the base compared to other settings, so you might want to check out if that bar is able to be raised higher and see if that helps!","replies":[{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2014-11-25T03:55:31.809+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"thanks for that but i already have, im not saying its bad but the floor in base i reckon looked better in old SR","replies":[]}]}]}
