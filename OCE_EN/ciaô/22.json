And if it still doesn't work then it's better to reach for a support ticket or you could attempt self-fix with the repair option or worst case, reinstall.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-08T14:23:44.815+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Happened to me too, but haven't given the settings and all that a sus yet so can't say if its fixable on our end or not.","replies":[{"poster":"SEKAI","date":"2017-03-08T14:31:40.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Seras Dragon,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=NIMOiH4u,comment-id=0000000000000000,timestamp=2017-03-08T14:23:44.815+0000)\n>\n> Happened to me too, but haven&#x27;t given the settings and all that a sus yet so can&#x27;t say if its fixable on our end or not.\n\nWell shit, that sounds bad, I hope it's not a wide spread problem.\n\nBut in my understanding, I think there are 2 major ways to try and approach this to see if the client itself is faulty to begin with, \n\n1. Try defaulting all options in the options menu is 1 way so while you have to redo all your settings again but hopefully you can override it and/or fix it this way, \n2. the other is find the \"input\" txt file in the \"Config\" folder within the installation registry and either search for the line \"evntPlayerPingCursorDanger=\" and see whether or not the it's \"[v]\" or whatever your desired key input after the equal sign (don't forget the square bracket). Or let's go balls, and just delete the entire txt file and restart your keybind afresh upon relaunch much like option 1.\n\nAnd there's also that good o' repair and reinstall.\n\nIf none of this worked, we've got a real problem.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-03-08T16:24:50.496+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahaha see the trouble is I'm too lazy to bother with most of those for something as simple as a ping that may or may not be fixed in a coming patch.
