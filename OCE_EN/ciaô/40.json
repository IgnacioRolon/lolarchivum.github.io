Every game i have played and spectated has had unranked summoners. Not saying this is a bad thing for we are all their one day but the issue is that because they are unskilled they getting matched up with silver - gold summoners in which they just feed every game and lose. Unranked players should be matched up between bronze 5 - silver 3 nothing higher. Considering this is Pre-Season aswell these unranked summoners are just killing it for us.\r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion, let me know all your feedback.\r\nThank you for reading Summoners.","replies":[{"poster":"Imasukai","date":"2014-11-27T03:23:35.279+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Underneath the rankings, it still runs on a basic ELO system. Basically, for unranked players, it assumes you're average until you prove otherwise. Sure, it might not be ideal for those who are already in high silver, but it's the most efficient way of determining the appropriate ranking of fresh level 30s.","replies":[]},{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2014-11-27T08:38:25.156+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"New accounts have average MMR, which is roughly silver 4.
