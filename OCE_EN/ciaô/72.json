Once the hype goes down of it being back I'm expecting it to take even longer. I will still play it though because I love the gamemode.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-09T00:27:07.330+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"I have to apologise to everyone D:\n\n2 of our friends that hardly ever play, came online, so the 3 of us played with them instead, so we didn't get to do our part of the 3v3 marathon.\n\nPlease forgive! next week I will have to just not even sleep!","replies":[{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2016-12-09T02:33:07.116+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"ahaha xD see you in the TT ;)","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-08T23:14:35.197+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Yeah mate it was great as expected","replies":[{"poster":"ciaô","date":"2016-12-09T02:33:35.433+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Indeed :D","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-12-09T01:24:36.633+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"I played 2 games, which was all I had time for. I didn't do too well, but that's just me (or maybe it was partly because it's a new ranked queue, so all the high ELO players would be \"starting\" at a low silver MMR?).
