So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\nKDA is not the only performance metric this is based off of. It also probably takes into consideration CS, wards, objective participation, damage, gold + many other things _(nothing has actually been confirmed)_. It's also relevant to time, because you cold get the exact same score in two games that are ~10 mins difference in length, and the grade would likely be higher in the shorter one.","replies":[]}]}
