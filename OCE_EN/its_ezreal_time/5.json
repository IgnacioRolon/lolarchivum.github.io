Now I have been stuck in here for over 100 games. I honestly have no clue what I&#039;m doing wrong, especially now, as I seem to be losing every game.  http://matchhistory.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/#match-history/NA/35597232 . Since I have gone from bronze to high silver/low gold at least twice, I thought it wouldn&#039;t be too hard to do it again, however now I am having doubts. I try my best to keep the team morale up, and play my best, however I simply cannot carry. I&#039;m stuck, if someone please offer advice on how to get better, or any indication of what I&#039;m doing wrong, it would be much appreciated. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Daejel","date":"2015-03-28T19:03:57.900+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I had a really shit day today, then I duo'd with the mid laner from my ranked 5s.
