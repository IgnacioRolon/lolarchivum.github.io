I spam the fall back ping when I see my team about to engage, team engages anyway and gets wiped in a 4v5, and I&#039;m left to solo defend, we lose the remainder of the inhib turrets and inhibs, I ask why, and they say \"stop being salty\". I literally lose my shit at this point and give up as this has happened in too many games. I honestly don&#039;t understand. Why won&#039;t people listen, when we are slowly losing the advantage that we worked so hard to create, when we should play safe and not take any unnecessary risks, when we need to defend the nexus turrets make picks and or wait for them to tower dive. but no, lets just try to 4v5 ace the enemy team with superior teamfight potential. Help, please.","replies":[{"poster":"Olee","date":"2015-04-05T07:34:53.753+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My solo queue teams listen to my shot calling about 80% of the time so from experience, here are a few things to consider.\n\nBe really nice, no joke you need to like suck them off in the early game. Any time someone dies, say \"It's all good man! We'll bounce back\". And every time someone gets a kill simple things like \"gj\" and \"nice\" can make all the difference as it makes you seem like a nice dude and it makes them feel good about themselves.\n\nIt helps if you are playing really well yourself. Solo Q players tend to trust players more who are currently carrying them. This point and the first point are all about setting up your image and gaining your team's trust for the mid to late game calls.\n\nBeing in a shot calling role/lane also adds a lot of credibility and strength behind your calls. This is one isn't super important and sometimes can't be helped but it still does count for something. As a Mid lane main, when I DO get mid, people usually listen to me more as opposed to when I'm top. Unfortunately, ADC isn't often looked at as a shotcalling role.\n\nNow this is what I find to be the most important thing, when it IS time to get a turret or neutral objective after a couple of kills, or there are x amount of enemy champions on this side of the map therefore we should go on this side and get this objective, you have to be ridiculously pushy about your calls. Sometimes, players don't mean to not listen they just don't see the chat sometimes, some of my mates are suspects of this so it definitely does happen. Some players play with their volume down so pings are only half as effective to them. Type every call for every objective twice and in CAPS. And max out your number of pings on every objective. If you sucked them off hard enough in the early game and are doing well enough yourself, the caps and excessive pings won't make you seem salty at all but rather just a legit shotcaller. But remember to be nice and encouraging throughout the whole game.","replies":[{"poster":"TheSingularity","date":"2015-04-07T13:32:25.138+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No joke 100% the way I play, play nice for 10 minutes, kill all the outer turrets and before they even know what they're doing they're being RULED WITH AN IRON FIST!

I looked at your match history and saw that you warded more than your own support as he has not changed into a red trinket. Team comp match up it was difficult for you and your team however it was a really good set up. \n\nMap awareness besides positioning is essential as an adc, change your trinket(to blue) next time and communicate with your team mates on what should happen. I can assume that sometimes when you ping to your team members countless times its either they will listen to you and back off or not and drag it out longer.\n\nThere are little problems that create a big one afterwards.
