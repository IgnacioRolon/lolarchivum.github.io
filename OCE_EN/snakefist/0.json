You could also be able to drag and drop them to change their order (TL&#039;S = Thunderlord&#039;s, WLB = Warlord&#039;s Bloodlust and so on) so if I used ADC 4 more than the rest, I could drag it to the top and change it&#039;s name without having to reconfigure the page itself.\n\nThis would go for all lanes and if I wanted to create another tab, it would be as simple as creating another page currently (just clicking the + button). That way for some pages which I have named Top/AP Support I could put them under a tab labelled &quot;Hybrid&quot; since it is used for more than one lane.\n____________________________________\n**The Mastery Page Variant**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CWRLvwX\nIf not a drop down, it could instead use the second idea which instead groups them inside a rectangle labeling from above.\n____________________________________\n**In Game Lobby**\n\nhttp://imgur.com/TUpwcdN\nThis one is for the in game lobby. This is just a way to show the drop down menu with all pages grouped with their appropriate tab. All ADC pages under the ADC heading and so on. This would make it easier for people to find the page they&#039;re after if someone suddenly locks in the lane that they had called or even if there was an agreement to change lanes. They wouldn&#039;t have to frantically search, if they suddenly change from ADC to Jungle, they just have to find the Jungle heading and click the page they&#039;re after.\n\nThere&#039;s a poll for like/dislike so that if it gets enough likes, the devs just might consider it.\n\nThanks in advance","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-13T01:30:21.022+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Not a bad idea.\n\nI think it might be a lot easier for them to simply allow us to move the pages in order of where we want them instead though.\n\nI'd like a similar feature for champions too. I'd like to create custom lists for champs. So I can type in \"top\" and see all my top laners when im picking a champ. Much like an ADC can type in \"marksman\" and see all the choices.","replies":[{"poster":"snakefist","date":"2016-02-13T04:08:24.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree it would be easier but my main thought here is that allowing us to sort them using my idea, will in turn give us the lobby drop down menu as well (which shows them in their respective sections, ADC ; Mid etc)\n\nThis would then also change them from just the numbered squares to the drop down with the name of each page, or if the second idea is used they'll at least be grouped to make it easier (similar to how you've suggested). My problem is that if they still used the numbered squares, it would still be a slight pain for me to find the exact one I'm after because I have to hover over them for the tooltip and look through them. ( I say this because I have 17 mastery pages which is likely to increase over time)\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nIn regards to your champ sorting idea, I do agree with the idea however I can see a lot of people saying it's redundant given you can type a champion's name. Though I like it seeing as you might be unsure about who you want to play and looking at all champs you play for that lane does help.","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2016-02-13T06:30:41.658+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"LSI allowed custom champion lists.
