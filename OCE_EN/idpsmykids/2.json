Anyway riot I think I may have an awesome for you and feel like it would attract many people and may be very easy to make. So here it goes\r\nI&#039;m sure you know about tamagotchis they were super popular years ago. So how about a more improved version of that but with the beloved poros! Think about it, app on your phone where you hatch a poro, take care of the poro, feed it, bathe it, play with, even dress it up. It&#039;s something a lot of people would want specially girls, and guys in the mid 20s. Honestly I would play it all the time aswell as spend money on it if it meant customise my poro the way I want it. Please have a read of this I&#039;d like your opinion. And honestly if you decide it&#039;s great and will start working on it, you should hire me. Haha it&#039;s a long shot but I thought I&#039;d share this idea with you","replies":[]}
