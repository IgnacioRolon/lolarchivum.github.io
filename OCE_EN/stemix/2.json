First game somehow I dc so team remake, yay~ bye bye LP (note: riot took my privilege to earn loot, YAY~! ). Second game, the game itself destroys me take a look at the screenshot. (_Player name all messed up on tabs and only one team mate&#039;s icon is shown above the map_) FURTHERMORE the ping spiked and I was at constant 500 ping so i decided to re-login to fix the game and than what a **disaster ** i get kicked out from the game and my status says i&#039;m not in a game?! Checking on oce.op.gg it says that i&#039;m still in a ranked game?! Saw a similar post of this on the help and support boards (_Note: That post was my smurf!!!_) and Riot still hasn&#039;t commented! On my smurf when it happened the match history wasn&#039;t saved, how classic~. So now to summarize it happened to me twice now! Lost 40 or so LP today too, how fun. Might as well send a ticket for more complaints! \n\nLink to my smurf post: https://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/help-support-oce/KLJPo6gQ-holy-st","replies":[]}
