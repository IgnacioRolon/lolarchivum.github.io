Not many people have the ability to control their actions when they're feeling emotional and it can quite easily consume people especially if on top of everything going on, you're getting camped or whatever. When people get to the state of rage quitting in frustration or flaming their team, they don't care that there is punishment. Practically everyone has games where they r/q or flame hard or whatever because of the emotions flowing through them from a variety of possible things, to ban everyone who has shit like that happen as I said is banning most of the playerbase. \n\nRiot wants LoL to be an eSport with a large audience and player base. To ban most of your playerbase for tilting in 1/2 games is a stupid idea and that's why in your eyes, they haven't done anything. They can either try to find other ways of dealing with tilted players and until then leave it how it is now, or aggressively ban people and I know how much this issue has been splattered EVERYWHERE for the longest time and it's quite obvious they feel there are way more negatives than positives that come with the aggressive banning as they haven't done it. They know about this issue, they know their options and they don't think aggressively banning is the way they want THEIR game to go. \n\nYou know they play this game too right? Do you know the saga between Phreak and Tyler1? They've dealt with trolls/int feeders before and they know that it's not fun and not to sound redundant but with the amount of yelling the community has given to them about trolls they know this issue far too well already.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Waterboy141","date":"2016-12-22T01:38:34.653+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"ill duo up on flex? \nif you want","replies":[{"poster":"Waterboy141","date":"2016-12-22T01:39:38.966+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Waterboy141,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=PbJ5Pf8K,comment-id=0001,timestamp=2016-12-22T01:38:34.653+0000)\n>\n> ill duo up on flex? \n> if you want\n\nadd me if you want","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Valor Carrys","date":"2016-12-22T02:20:40.348+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Well lets see here.\n\nThe Draven's account probably inted into bronze and has just played their when they feel like playing given a quick look at op.gg (he has also been inting for 5 hours straight)\n\nYasuo only int's when he feels like it, so won't be banned most likely (he plays normally most games.)\n\nAnd Olaf is the same case as Yasuo, so again won't be banned most likely.\n\nThe only one likely to be banned is draven, and even then, he still hasn't been banned after 6 straight games of intent feeding, so that gives you an idea of the systems riot has in place to stop intent feeding.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-12-22T12:49:48.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'll break down your other comments first before getting into your main topic.\n\n>I'm not getting any report feed backs\n\nJust because you aren't receiving report feedback notifications doesn't mean players you reported aren't being punished. No feedback does not equal no ban. Feedback is one of the biggest failings of the instant feedback system, because the notification only pops up for a very limited number of players in very limited circumstances.\n\nThe tl;dr of that mess is that the majority of players who report someone who is then punished will not see the feedback notification.\n\n> I have been paired up with players with roughly 200 wins in norms\n\nWins does not equal skill. Some players learn much faster or slower than average. Some players have a mentality better or worse suited to the skillset of the game. Some players take a lot more or less in form a single game than average. Wins is only an average representation of skill for those who are average in every single attribute, which is a very small percentage of players, so wins doesn't really tell you all that much.\n\nThat is also ignoring the presence of smurf accounts, where someone might be trying a new role or the like, and may very well have double your normal wins on their main.\n\ntl;dr Wins means very little as far as skill is concerned.\n\n> Does the rank match up goes by ranked wins? norm wins? or random?\n\nRanked and Normal MMR (Matchmaking Rating) are separate. Ranked wins increase your ranked MMR and Normal wins increase your normal MMR. Every different queue has it's own MMR.\n\n> Oh and im looking for a player to duo boost me, Thank you :)\n\nNo bueno.\n___\nOnto your main point \"Happens in the majority of my games\".\n\nFirst off I'd like to introduce you to a friend I call [Negativity Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias). \n> The negativity bias, also known as the negativity effect, refers to the notion that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature ... have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than do neutral or positive things. In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact ... than something equally emotional but negative. The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the _**formation of impressions**_ ... and memory...\n\nDon't get me wrong. It sucks to encounter behaviour like this, especially in such saturation, but it's hardly in the majority of your games. I would recommend challenging yourself after each game, to note down each champion in the game and mark them with +, ~ or - for positive, neutral and negative. It would offer you some very valuable perspective on just how many players you encounter are actually negative compared to those that are neutral or positive.\n\nIn your last 20 games (normal, flex, solo/duo) there were 7 players I was unsure of, 70 that were neutral and 3 that were intent feeding. All three of those intent feeding players came from the one game you screenshotted above. Sure that game sucked, but it's hardly the norm for your games. Quite the opposite in fact. Even if you assume all 7 of those vaguely sus players were intent feeders, 10/80 is not the majority. Not even close.\n\n(Obviously I can't see all kinds of toxicity from just match history so this only applies to intent feeding)\n\nI've had times when it really feels like most players I encounter are toxic asshats, but when I actually look back and think about it, it's usually just a few that have soured my experience, and that perspective helps me to get over it and move on to just enjoy another game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bishöp","date":"2016-12-22T03:52:58.089+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You will probably get a warning you should not have names in your post.
