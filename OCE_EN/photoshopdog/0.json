And when try to start a custom game, the game will crush and it says &quot;The application was unable to start correctly (0*000007b). I just got my new allienware with win10 today so I think it must be my laptop&#039;s problem. However I&#039;ve got all the direct/net frame stuff and I&#039;ve updated my adapter driver.
