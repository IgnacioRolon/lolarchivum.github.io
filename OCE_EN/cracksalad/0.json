If this is the kind of behaviour you regularly exhibited at the time, that would probably explain why the punishment system triggered. So far as the severity of the punishment, you should only have received a permanent ban if you'd previously received a 14-day ban. If you hadn't received a 14-day ban prior, or you are unsure whether you had, you can attempt to appeal the punishment via Support. It's also important to note that you are judged on your own behaviour, and not the behaviour of others. What they did is irrelevant to you, and vice versa.\n\nIn order to appeal, you'll need to submit a ticket to [Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) (use the \"Discuss a personal suspension or restriction\" option) and go through the process with them. They'll review the case, and make a determination based on the situation. It's important to note that if you have appealed previously, the decision from that instance will stand. At the very least, you'll be able to get more context from Support regarding the circumstances of the punishment, possibly additional chat logs that contributed to the punishment.\n\nHonestly, the best advice I think I could give is to avoid saying anything if it isn't constructive and relevant to the game. Anything that doesn't have direct relevance on the match (and subsequently winning) should be avoided, and anything that attacks or degrades others should also be avoided. When you do use chat to communicate with your team, try to put things is as positive a light as you can. Saying something like \"[item] might work well against [champion]\" is a lot better than something like \"Why the fuck don't you have [item] against [champion]?\"","replies":[]}]}
