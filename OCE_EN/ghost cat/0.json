You had a lot of ping and continued to play anyway... OVER 4 YEARS? How in hell did you manage?\n2. Expecting Riot to refund you EVERYTHING...\n\nWhy should Riot refund you everything  when the main cause of your lag isn't from them? Unless you are from the other side of the world or have the worst ISP of all time, the OCE server is as stable as any other. \n\nIf you want your lag gone, you have to look into it. Don't expect Riot to do it for you or refund you everything because of a problem that isn't even caused by them. You agreed to spend money on the game, so deal with it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Rainbow2012","date":"2015-04-27T02:29:55.710+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This guy is just joking around","replies":[{"poster":"ghost cat","date":"2015-04-30T21:38:13.229+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Rainbow2012,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=g638t0fI,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2015-04-27T02:29:55.710+0000)\n>\n> This guy is just joking around\n\n**I'm glad someone noticed ahhahahha**","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-04-27T04:38:14.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"How does one play this game for four years with 1k ping??","replies":[]},{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-04-27T02:39:32.369+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"hahaha did you actually think they'd refund you? jesus christ those are some top notch delusions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2015-04-27T02:37:05.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So because you have a crappy internet connection Riot is to blame and they should give you your money back? No. That's not how this works. I'm assuming you didn't read the TOU and EULA, which means you are oblivious to the fact that refunds are given at the sole discretion of Riot, and they only give refunds in the form of **in-game currency** using **refund tokens**, so good luck with that. Also, I would like to point out, it was your decision to spend money on the game, you can't possibly blame Riot for that.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WEETBIX 4 BREKKI","date":"2015-04-27T11:59:53.812+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"This triggered me so hard, riot thinking they can oppress your money like that? rito need to check their privledges and restore full funds to you, such a disgusting world we live in.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sneed","date":"2015-04-27T02:39:35.077+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Hey yeah I love this game and all the stuff I have bought over the years, but unfortunately the server in OCE is unplayable at a consistent rate since every few games, no matter my internet provider,  I will get at least 1k ping.\n\nLooks like you need wtfast :^)","replies":[]}]}
