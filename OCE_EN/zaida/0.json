All help appreciated :)","replies":[{"poster":"Wild Parasect","date":"2014-12-08T10:57:48.050+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Find a cool champion, then look up some guides and learn what items to buy and how their abilities work. It takes a very long time to learn how to win pvp games, but as you play more games you'll pick up alot from other people. I suggest maybe even watching the ranked games on the home screen, I used to watch those diamond games and see what people are building on whatever champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Glow","date":"2014-12-08T07:27:15.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"There is so much to learn! But there are great resources readily available online for when you start to get a handle on the basics :) Playing with higher level players can be great, but you'll be matched against players of a higher skill level so it can also be frustrating. Once you get a hang of the basics, start to look into watching replays of your games to see your mistakes. Watching pro-level games (especially with commentary) can be invaluable for seeing how games flow and the kind of teamwork that goes on at that level. Most of all, have fun!! Feel free to add me if you want :)","replies":[{"poster":"ZAIDA","date":"2014-12-08T10:44:40.336+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"K thanks :) I've tried watching some pro games on YouTube but for the most part I'm just confused.

I can probably then help you out a bit more specifically with what you're having trouble with / finding similar champions to enjoy!\n\nI'd definitely recommend checking out some of the other threads in this Board to help you out in general! Along with this board, http://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool is one of my favourite places for help and advice - there's a lot of good stuff there!","replies":[{"poster":"ZAIDA","date":"2014-12-08T10:42:52.287+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the link, I haven't got a favourite champion yet as I'm not getting much playing time because there seems to be something wrong with the server.
