If you afk a lot, and the DCs are just the last straws earning you Leaver Busters, then it's because you've used up your free passes to afk. DCs/AFKs happen, but at a point Riot have to consider the impact on the rest of the players in that game too.\n\nIf it's client issues, **clean reinstalling the game** with the [Hextech Repair Tool](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202539040-Reinstalling-League-of-Legends) is highly recommended.\n\nYou can also **submit a ticket** to [Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and they can help you with troubleshooting.","replies":[]}]}
