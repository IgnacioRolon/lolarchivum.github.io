Bronze is like a game of normals. \n\nYou vs/get players like him, making it very easy to be able to carry games. Although, you might say after checking my match history that I was silver for a while, this was simply cause I didn't play ranked after the 10 provisional's. But now I do. \n\nHowever, I stopped once again as ranked is currently cancerous. The only good time to play ranked is after 1am AU time(NOT during the holidays, during SCHOOL times).","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"BearGrillz34","date":"2018-06-26T23:11:44.822+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ya, if you play for the first time it gets based off of your score, cs and stuff like that. Your rank seems very fair based on your scores from the previous games. IMO, you should've gotten bronze 2-3.  Best of luck for your future games.\n\nP.S I wont 5/10 and got gold 5 first time (on my other acc). I won my provisional's once with 10/10 with high kda's and got plat 5. So your kda does in fact matter. Same with your cs! Must have a good cs average.","replies":[]},{"poster":"YukiHikado","date":"2018-06-26T16:54:25.239+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Basically if you played for the first time you get allocated based based on score , 9/1 gets you silver 5 any lower gets u placed in Bronze.  If you did get a rank last season you have a better chance of getting a better rank. Since you didnt place last season riot delegates you based by your score in placements.","replies":[]},{"poster":"WandererYoshinon","date":"2018-06-26T12:26:48.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you're in silver 5 then you're ~~better~~ higher rank than like 50% of the player base idk why you're mad... i got placed in bronze 2 after my first promos.","replies":[]}]}
