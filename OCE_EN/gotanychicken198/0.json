If they're pulling behaviour that's a little sneakier then you can also submit a report ticket to Player Support to make sure it's getting noticed, either by the automated system or manually: https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\n\nFair warning, support can't and won't give you *any* information, explicit or otherwise, about another player's account, so you'll get a generic \"thanks for your report, we'll look into it\" type response. It doesn't mean it hasn't been looked into, just that they are limited in what information they can give you.","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-12T07:45:53.611+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The best way to get away from the trash, is to get above wood 5.\nBut you can't get out of wood 5 because of all the trash.\n\nHmmmmmmm.......","replies":[{"poster":"GOTANYCHICKEN198","date":"2018-11-13T02:24:58.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is my first season, so yeah I'm going to have to improve to get out.
