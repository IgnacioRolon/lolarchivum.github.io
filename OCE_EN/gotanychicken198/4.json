In order to have good MMR, you need to have a good winrate. Your overall winrate is 39%\n\nThe system is trying to slow your climbing down because it believes you are not \"good enough\" for Bronze 3 yet since your winrate is so low. If you were gaining good LP in Bronze 5 but getting crap in Bronze 4, im guessing your REAL MMR is that of a low Bronze 4 person.\n\nJust keep winning my dude and your MMR will go up. If you can maintain your current 55% winrate, it will rise.","replies":[]}]}
