Intentionally losing a game as revenge for someone not playing to what sounds like an unreasonable standard that you as a random stranger on the internet has set 110% classifies as negative behaviour and can get you punished.\n\nAlso, not a great way to climb, given that teamwork is just as important as any other skill in this *team* game, and that mistakes aren't made to spite some random player they'll probably never see again, but rather, the vast majority of the time are simply that: mistakes. Mistakes can be salvaged, negativity sets the tone for the rest of the game and just tilts people.","replies":[]}]}
