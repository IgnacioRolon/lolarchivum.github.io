I believe that a Void Gnar would be a interesting twist on The Missing Link. His appereance in Mini form would resemble a scaled, bug-winged, and purple creature with dark pink eyes. His boomerang would resemble a Void-like scythe, with serated/jagged edges. His Mega form would be a armor-plated, bug-winged and dark purple creature with black eyes. His Mega forms bottom jaw would be split into two segments (or a predator-like mouth would also be cool) and his voice would have Eternum-like tone to it. His Mini Gnar Q is the same, except for it would leave behind a purple trail (kind of like the third dragon stack, but purple), and his Mega Q would throw a rock with purple cracks in it (I don&#039;t really know what his Q should be, so you guys can decide what his Q should be like). His Mini W would be the same, but the rings and ghost effect would be purple, and when he is in Mega form his W would be virtually the same except the cracks would be purple. His Mini E would make him leave a faint purple trail behind him and his little wings would flutter (like Kha&#039;zix when he E&#039;s), and his Mega E would make him fly into the sky and slam the ground, leaving purple cracks in the ground. His R would be the same except purple scrapes and he would roar \"GNAR!\" with the Eternum tone. I would greatly appreciate any addvice or hints as to what would make it better or what would be an improvement. Also, if anyone from Riot is reading this, it would make my day if you to even consider my idea. Thank you.","replies":[{"poster":"Six Six","date":"2015-04-10T12:12:30.496+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"i have also had this thought, i love gnar but the poor lil fella only got one skin.
