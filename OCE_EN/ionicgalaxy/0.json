I have no recollection of flaming/abusing anyone on this game so I&#039;m not sure why he sent me this message. The account that sent the message was: *name removed* (also an offensive name) but I do not believe this is their main account they play on. I find this behavior to be unacceptable and I hope there can be some sort of punishment on all their accounts and not just his backup accounts. \nI also have a problem requesting a ticket for this issue.
