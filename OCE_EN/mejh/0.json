Basically I just want someone or some people to play with for my grind to level 30. I&#039;m pretty experienced at the moment, and I know it may sound silly during this learning phase, but I main Nidalee in mid. I&#039;m a very serious and determined player if there are any teams that are looking, but I&#039;m also down-to-Earth if you&#039;re not as serious. LoL gets very boring on your own bro.\r\n\r\nAnyway, throw me an add and message here or something if you&#039;re keen!
