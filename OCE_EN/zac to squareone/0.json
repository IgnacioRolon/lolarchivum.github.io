Same as revive, since then there has been 1,000s if not 10,000s of games people could have one if only revive was still in game. Hec with TP and Revive and you could respwan and backdoor the enemy nexus for an easy win late game.","replies":[{"poster":"Aezuros","date":"2015-10-31T19:53:29.541+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"revive is a bad example though cos too often it was used simply for trolling purposes ... there were very few truly legitimate ways to use revive and 99 times out of a 100 some other summoner spell would have given you more of a purpose for more of the game. I do agree though that they should be trying to protect the variety of spells in general.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2015-10-31T06:45:41.523+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Clairvoyance was op... in ultimate bravery.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-31T21:57:24.551+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why didn't they just buff clairvoyance?
