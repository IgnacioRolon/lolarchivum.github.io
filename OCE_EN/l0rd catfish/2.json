Once again I am in a low priority lobby for leaving a game due to a highly toxic player who gets a kick out of making people leave ranked games. It is not the first time that this individual has been put in my lobby, trolling and angering my team mates. Surely a block system would not be difficult to implement, or at least an option to report in pregame. Counter strike has an amazing player behavior system, the RIOT player behavior department should really research it.","replies":[]}
