The drop to 0-15 in team fights. (normally 150+) Has anyone been experiencing these problems? And if so have you found a way to resolve that?\r\n\r\nI have never had an issue with fps before this patch. I have already updated all drivers, checks for viruses, re-installed lol and a whole lot of other things. I'm also running the game at lowest settings.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any suggestions or ideas to fix this?","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T03:51:20.556+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If it's because of the most recent patch, the best solution is to just wait for the next one to see if it's fixed. If not, or if you really need to play now, send in a support ticket, though they'll probably just tell you to do exactly what you've just done.\n\nCould you give us a brief run-down of your rig? It'll help in understanding if there's any software conflicting with your hardware, though I'm no expert in that field.","replies":[{"poster":"Get Rekt Khunt","date":"2014-12-22T04:37:19.888+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi\n\nThanks for that. I have already sent a support ticket. Hopefully there is a fix to this.\n\nProcessor: i7 - 2.4Ghz\n8GB Ram\n2 GB Nvidia 635m graphics card","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-23T07:58:23.921+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's above the requirements, so you're gold in that field.\n\nI've got nearly the same thing, just a 4gb graphics card, and from personal experience I can tell you that the most recent patch has some slow-downs in it. During teamfights, or any situation that could be considered 'hectic', the framerate drops. The drop I'm talking about here is from 60fps to ~40fps, so it doesn't bother me at all. Weird that it affects you so much with your setup, I'd think it would be a lot less noticeable.\n\nSorry that I couldn't have been much help, but at least you know you're not the only one. Hopefully this gets sorted out soon.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
