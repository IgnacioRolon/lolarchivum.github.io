I think it&#039;d be a pretty good stat to show in the end-game stats and it could possibly aid some people when it comes to improving on some of those shielding champions. These are just my thoughts, what does everybody else think?","replies":[{"poster":"dragon poo","date":"2017-03-31T09:46:10.512+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So, i paly a game, it's name is Atlas reactor, and the stats they use are, shielding done, and then effective shielding done, as well as the usual damage and healing, and i think that would be a great thing to implement.","replies":[]},{"poster":"FunZone","date":"2017-04-05T05:07:44.936+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think something along the lines of **Damage Shielded** would be better than **Shielding Done**. Hear me out;\n\nJanna, Taric, Lulu, Karma etc. have shields that you can place on allies, but what about Champions that have large shields that they use for themselves. Nautlius, Blitz, Shen etc. all have shields that they can only use for themselves, and yet those shields are very core to how you play. \n\nI feel it would be a lot better for them if it was a more general shielding because **Damage Taken** doesn't really show just how well (or badly) you played that game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-01T05:27:30.524+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They include \"Shield consumed from enemy damage\" in the healing, some mention of that a few patches ago.","replies":[]}]}
