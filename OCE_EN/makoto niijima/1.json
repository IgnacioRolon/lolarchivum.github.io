Every game, 9 minutes in, my ping supposedly spikes. I normally play at 15 ping but after 9 minutes has passed, it will stay at a constant 400-500 ping. A couple minutes later, my ping goes even higher and hits 1000+ for the remainder of the game. I&#039;ve already repaired my client hoping it would fix the issue but it hasn&#039;t. So, Riot, is there a lag issue affecting the OCE server? or is there something wrong with my client? I have done multiple tests and as I said, its every  game and always 9 minutes in.\r\n\r\nThankyou in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-02-13T04:28:45.836+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSounds to me like you're experiencing high [packet loss](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq6) and/or [packet buffering](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752664-Troubleshooting-Connection-Issues#wq7), please run a test on the [ICSI netalyzr](http://netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/) and post the results URL here.\n\nCould you also [download WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/) and run a traceroute to the following IP's (Allow this to run for 5-15 minutes), export your results and post them here or on [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) and link them here.\n\n>103.240.227.5\n 103.240.227.25","replies":[{"poster":"Makoto Niijima","date":"2016-02-13T08:17:51.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"http://n1.netalyzr.icsi.berkeley.edu/summary/id=43ca253f-19640-a24b0565-d3c1-4f6c-8fab\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\n\n**(RESULTS FOR 103.240.227.5)**\n|                                      WinMTR statistics                                   |\n\n|                       Host              -
