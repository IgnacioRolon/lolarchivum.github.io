I tried restarting my client and when I tried to repair my client it said &quot;An unknown error occurred.&quot; So I decided to reinstall League and when I finally get back onto the client, I have a Low Priority Queue for something I had **NO** control over. Is there a way you could possibly lower the amount of games I have this for or remove it entirely? Thanks.","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-04-21T09:30:04.198+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nUnfortunately there is no way to remove leaverbuster penalties from your account, the system is designed in such a way to prevent corruption.\n\nIt is up to you to ensure your client is fully functional before entering a game, if this means launching up a custom game before you want to play then so be it.\n\nFor more information on the leaverbuster system please see the [Leaverbuster FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ).\n\n>**I CRASHED AND GOT A LEAVE/MMR LOSS. CAN I GET THOSE REMOVED FROM MY ACCOUNT?**\nOur system does not allow the removal of leaves or the modification of MMR. It was designed in this manner in order to prevent corruption.\n\n>**IT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY INTERNET/YOUR SERVERS DISCONNECTED ME. I HAD A REAL-LIFE EMERGENCY. I HAD TO GET OFF THE COMPUTER. THE GAME CRASHED. UNBAN ME!**\nWe understand that players may be forced to leave from time to time so the system has been designed to keep these situations in mind. After leaving a few games, you will be placed into a low priority queue; as long as you can complete 5 matchmade games without leaving, you will be returned to the normal queue. However, if you continue to leave games, you will remain in the low priority queue.","replies":[]}]}
