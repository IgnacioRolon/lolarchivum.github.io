The psychic champ could have telekinesis where they could pick a champ up and throw them or a telekinetic blast etc. A witch could put curses/hexes on a champ(s) so it would be different than just using the witch skin for Morgana and the ghost champ could take the soul of an enemy champ to possess to use for a short time to use against enemies kind of like Morde but make it different some how like maybe if the soul takes damage then you take damage also but wont die since you&#039;d be connected to it which you&#039;d have to be careful of how you play plus the ghost champ would suit buying Banshee&#039;s Veil since a Banshee is a ghost/spirit :p","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-04-29T11:04:00.270+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sol is getting reworked pleb","replies":[]}]}
