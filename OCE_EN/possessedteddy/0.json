I can buy any champ I want so this in particular isn't about me, but for those who wait the 3 weeks for a new champ to come out to see if they will buy it or not. I don't see how it is fair that these people or most people in general who don't insta-buy every champ have to waste a ban in ranked against the new champ. \r\n\r\nMy reasons why they should be banned.\r\n1. Noone (90%) really knows how to play the new champ, so you risk your team picking this champ and totally bombing (which is ur fault right? or the jg)\r\n2. Someone on pbe or has just had \"that\" connection with this champ thus absolutely destroying your team because noone has really played much against them to find their weakness.\r\n3. Sometimes the new champ is up, which is fine everyone will avoid in ranked, but sometimes riot has released champs that have so op you could ask them to shit gold and they'd be able to do it. 3 weeks gives riot a chance to work out any bugs, buffs or nerfs and preparing the champ for ranked.\r\n4. From points above you'd be smart to ban them in ranked, but then that leaves you now with 2 bans instead of 3.\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't see what I'm asking is to much to do really, infact I believe this would improve some experience in ranked. Who wants to play normals instead of ranked because a new champ comes out.\r\n\r\n\"TLDR\" New champs banned from ranked for 3 weeks so people learn the new champ before playing ranked and buffs/nerfs/bugs have time to be sorted.","replies":[{"poster":"Devil God King","date":"2014-11-26T09:36:38.989+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"***","replies":[{"poster":"The Omega","date":"2014-11-26T16:50:08.522+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"You bring up some good points, but i'm afraid you're wrong. Champions are Meta for a reason, they're stronger.  Meaning in the end they will always be the better choice\n\nTake this for example. Let's say a samurai master trains his entire life and chooses to fight with a wooden sword (because steel is too mainstream). lets say this samurai can easily defeat any swordsman who uses a steel sword with his wooden sword because he is so much more skilled. But! What happens when the Wooden swordsman meets someone of equal skill, that happens to use a steel sword? He will stand no chance, as the steel swordsman has the clear advantage.  \n\nIf you didn't understand that i'm basically saying: Yeah it's fun to believe that you canwanna bring your own thing in to the game and believe that skill or being the best can overcome everything!

With that in mind there is no way to control the use of specific champions in a game. For the problem you described, \"My reasons why they should be banned\". The best way to deal with this is to limit the possibility of a champions use. Solutions such as banning the champion when you have the power to do so or kindly requesting that the person play another champion until they've had enough time to learn the champions core mechanics. Although the latter is a rather weak solution. The second best solution I could give you other than banning a champion when you can is to simply not play ranked for a little bit and just play normals.

But if it is pretty darn simple, I cannot think of a decent reason why they are allowed straight into ranked. I mean when was the last time Riot actually released a champ that didn't need at least a touch up in a couple of weeks. I can't think of one. All I see with letting the new champ be played instantly in ranked, is a negative impact on the game. \"I have to play normals cos of a new champion\", \"to ahhh why the eff did u pick that new champ, don't u know they are useless\", \"ugh i have to ban that new champ cos i don't trust our team or theirs\". All negative. Please give me some positive.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"PossessedTeddy","date":"2014-11-27T07:41:38.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Idk how you guys got onto \"meta and %%%%\" No. just no. This isn't about meta, this is about new champs getting the %%%% out of ranked for a couple weeks so that people can learn about them, and the champions themselves can be refined.\n\nReturning to your derailed comments. Meta stands for Most Efficient Tactical Advantage. Which obviously means those champs in the meta are usually \"better\" in 1 way or another. If all you want to do it practice meta champs go right ahead, but don't whinge when the game gets boring. Non-meta champs or team comps are the best thing in this game because they do 1 thing to it that makes league beastly. They stop the game becoming stale. I mean the LCS is okay only because we see meta champs played so well and plays that make us go. holy %%%%. But how boring would it be if those 10/20 meta champs were the only champions we'd seen them play for the last 4 years. \nExample I like to use is Quinn. A good portion of adc mains, including the higher group of players all know about Quinns kit right. But they haven't played against many to truly understand what her damage output is at what lvl's/items. Quinn isn't god tier or even close to it, but because no-one has really practiced against her a lot, a well played Quinn can destroy a meta champ. Obviously won't happen every time or even half the time depending on your skill vs theirs and their ability to adept, but there is a higher chance thanks to the low popularity of the champ.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Molendo","date":"2014-11-27T06:48:34.090+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think one week disable for the new champion would be sufficient enough","replies":[]},{"poster":"PossessedTeddy","date":"2014-11-26T09:57:59.608+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If its such a big part of the game making this a strategy variant of the game then why do pros work off the older patch for awhile until they practice with the new patch.
