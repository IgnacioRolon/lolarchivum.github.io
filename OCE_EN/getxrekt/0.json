Champions within Runeterra would gather at Tahm Kench&#039;s famous restaurant/bar, Acquired Tastes, to enjoy their night after a hard days work within Summoner&#039;s Rift. He decided every nation would have their own table to reduce the amount of conflict that would pop up every now and then, but he did grant some exceptions. Everyone slowly entered the restaurant one by one, seating and settling themselves for one of Twisted Fate&#039;s &quot;dramatic&quot; entrance that would kick-start everyone&#039;s night.\r\n\r\nTwisted Fate slowly approached the closed doors, you could hear every footstep echo louder and louder as he crept closer. In an instant he kicked the doors open and stood perfectly still in his outback clothes, head tilted down with his cowboy hat covering his eyes. At a steady pace he lifted his head up, his eyes lit with determination. His lips curled into a mischievous grin as his right hand slowly rose up to his waist, fingers moving like a majestic wave. &quot;Its HIIIGH NOON!!&quot; Twisted Fate yelled as he swiftly drew Jhin&#039;s gun out and shot two perfect bullets at the two vases that contained what seemed to be beautiful, crimson roses. Tiny droplets of water glistened before becoming a tiny puddle as the glass shattered onto the ground. He bowed as everyone applauded and cheered, it was truly a great and short performance. Jhin strutted into the restaurant, grabbing his gun from Twisted Fate&#039;s hands and shot him a &quot;You&#039;re dead&quot; look, Twisted fate shrugged it off and continued his way to a table that consisted of females. &quot;If you were a card, I&#039;d pick you&quot; he whispered seductively into the strangers ear.\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n_**~Demacia&#039;s Table~**_\r\n&quot;I apologise for being late,&quot; Jarvan announced as he walked in, slumping himself on a chair beside Shyvana and released a relaxing sigh, &quot;Could I be more epic?&quot;. Everyone nodded. Shyvana sat there rubbing her sore skin, &quot;What&#039;s wrong?&quot;\r\n&quot;Lulu decided to go all &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot; on me, I cant believe you allowed her to do that to me.....&quot;, Shyvana replied back with a pout.\r\n&quot;Did she put a leash on u?&quot; \r\n&quot;Really!? Am i some sort of pet to you?&quot; Shyvana stared at Jarvan, her face lit up with embarrassment but her eyes shot him with hatred.\r\n&quot;Maybe&quot; Jarvan whispered with a smile on his face, &quot;How is everyone?&quot; \r\n&quot;Good!~&quot;, Lux giggled as she held onto Ezreal&#039;s arm, leaning in with a smile that looked like she was in heaven. Katarina sat on the opposite side with Garen, she decided to take Annie and Talon with her so things wouldn&#039;t get so awkward at the table.  Her long scarlet hair flowed down her shoulders as she leaned onto Garen&#039;s muscular arm. Her emerald eyes watched Annie spoon feed her stuffed bear Tibbers while Talon stared at Fiora. Kat couldnt stop the smile that had resurfaced her face. Joy began to spread around the restaurant like the plague, targeting every victim within sight and injecting pleasurable emotions, well at least it tried to.\r\n&quot;Shauna what&#039;s wrong? You look lost&quot; Jarvan questioned with worry. Shauna sat there tapping her nail onto the table,\r\n&quot;It&#039;s nothing, dont worry&quot; \r\n&quot;Mmm, if you say so&quot;. \r\n_**Shauna&#039;s mind and body suddenly become alerted**_\r\n&quot;I smell black magics,&quot; Shauna whispered and swiftly turned around. She saw Lulu putting what seemed to be a Rabadon&#039;s Deathcap onto Lucian&#039;s head. The two of them locked eyes, &quot;Shauna&quot; Lucian greeted as he sat down next to her,\r\n&quot;Lucian. It was great a battle, I fancy your mechanics&quot;\r\n&quot;Some call it _magic_, I call it good aim&quot; \r\nShauna chuckled, &quot;Next time we fight I&#039;ll bring _swift death_&quot;\r\nAnnie plopped out of her chair, grabbing Tibbers with her and started skipping towards the Yordle&#039;s table.\r\n&quot;Be careful Annie,&quot; Katarina spoke as she watched her pick up something circular. Annie turned around and held up a curled armadillo. In an instant Rammus popped out with his classic black shades, clicking his little claws with his index finger pointing at Kat with his thumbs up. &quot;Ok&quot;\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**_~Meanwhile at Mount Targon + Bligewater Table~_**\r\nTaric&#039;s hand clenched around his glass of whisky, angered by watching Ezreal and Lux together. \r\n&quot;Look who decided to show up,&quot; Leona smiled while taking a sip of her red wine.\r\n&quot;Looks like the gem itself is rather .. _truly outrageous_&quot; Twisted Fate chuckled while pulling out a chair beside Taric. &quot;I know an amazing magic trick that will help you Taric,&quot;\r\n&quot;What is it?&quot; Twisted Fate pulled out a blank card and showed everyone, he quickly spun the card in a full circle and hid the card in his hand, \r\n&quot;Ready?&quot;, everyone nodded. He revealed the card in front of Taric and what appears to be on the card was two words, Jealous much?\r\nTaric sighed and resumed to his drink.\r\n&quot;Just ignore him,&quot; Pantheon stood there patting Taric on the shoulder in his apron and chefs hat.\r\n&quot;Finally a baker huh?&quot; Taric smiled realising his friend&#039;s dream had finally come true.\r\n&quot;With the help of Morgana yeah&quot;\r\n&quot;Working with anyone?&quot;\r\n&quot;Well Volibear loves to flip salad,I reckon he has techniques for every flip&quot;\r\n&quot;What about Singed? He&#039;s a good flipper,&quot; Graves butted in.\r\n&quot;He&#039;ll give everyone food poisoning.......&quot; Pantheon sighed as everyone laughed. Leona slid a tiny box infront of Graves.  The box was plain white with a fancy red ribbon securing the box shut. &quot;A gift from everyone&quot; Leona smiled,little did he know it was a cigar waiting to be lit by his hands\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n**_~Ionia Table~_**\r\n&quot;What do you call a person that you look up to? A  _Shen_ pai!&quot; Akali giggled with Irelia.\r\n&quot;Ahri you kidding me?......&quot; Zed sighed as Shen sat there confused what to say or do.\r\n&quot;Guys please..... Shen and I aren&#039;t puns,&quot; Ahri said while rubbing the bridge of her nose.\r\n&quot;Something wrong Lee?&quot; Master Yi questioned as he watched Lee sit there confused.\r\n&quot;I can feel Satan&#039;s presence around me,&quot; He replied back, sniffing the air for his disgusting scent. Without hesitation Lee threw his sonic wave to the right, it had hit Teemo in the face. He then connected his kick as Teemo threw a blind at him, trying to kite him around but his tiny legs were no use. Lee chuckled and picked him up by his fur, &quot;Force is meaningless without skill.&quot; With a smile on his face, he kicked him back to the Yordle&#039;s table.\r\nYasuo slammed the cup on the table and released a satisfied exhale.He had won the drinking game against Gragas, &quot;I&#039;m impressed&quot; Gragas said in a slurred tone with a massive smile on his face.\r\n&quot;And you said i cant handle my drink?&quot; Yasuo replied back, almost drunk. The both of them looked at each other and laughed. he took a quick glance at Riven who was sitting next to him, her finger swirled around the rim of the cup as her light orange eyes begged for affection. He always wondered why a lady like her was alone. Was it because she was &quot;over-powered&quot; in lane just like him? Or was she just plain salty like the others had said.  Yasuo shook his head, &quot;it cant be&quot; he mumbled. He slumped himself onto her shoulder, breathing in a sweet scent that lingered around her neck. &quot;DId you just fart because you blew me away,&quot;  Yasuo whispered into her ear with an erotic tone.","replies":[{"poster":"Rocka","date":"2016-07-10T03:46:48.430+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"nice read :) very enjoyable","replies":[]}]}
