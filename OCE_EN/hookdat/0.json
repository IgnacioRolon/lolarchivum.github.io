Do something and make some special request forms to report players and you guys need to investigate on those players. One of the thread in B.O.L says &#039;looking for a duo, masters, recently started using scripts.&#039;  rofl... these high elo %%%%s are using scripts and not even punished.

Please continue to report any suspected cheaters in post-game as \"Cheating\" OR if you have any information on a suspected cheater do feel free to [submit a ticket to Player Support](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/requests/new) and the information will be forwarded to the appropriate people.\n\nDo remember that Player Support will be unable to give you any information on the outcome of your reports (if any).\n\nCheaters are banned in waves and at semi-random times, this is done to protect the integrity of Riots anti-cheat systems, if bans were handed out instantly for cheating then players and the developers of these cheats will know exactly when and what caused the detection and will be able to work around this.","replies":[]}]}
