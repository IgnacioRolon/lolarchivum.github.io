The players were flown into Sydney on 31st June where they took part in a week-long training camp during their mid split break. During this time, the team scrimed against OPL and OCS teams as well as doing some cool activities on the side.\r\n\r\nThe Bootcamp provides a better look at the growing investment made by esports organizations at OPL and OCS level.
