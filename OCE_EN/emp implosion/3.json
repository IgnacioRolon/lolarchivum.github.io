Cause your pretty much inconveniencing 4 other people in your team and purposely making them lose. the reason for this post was i have had 4 dc games and i went all the way from plat to dia promos to demotion and no this isnt like lower elo, having near mid dia mmr means that people punish you heavily and just 1 min not in lane can cause snowballs and eventually lead to a lose. no doubt i will definately get back the lp lose but seriously its just plane annoying. if you have bad internet dnt que up ty \r\n\r\nbut yea just a ranked que restricter for people with lag, i know it sounds kinda defying the purpose of not letting people play ranked but they would stil be open to normal games.","replies":[{"poster":"GoldenTomat0","date":"2015-05-07T22:36:33.716+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"there's a report for being afk you fuckstick, just use that. cause, ya know, that's what it's there for.","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-05-11T03:37:31.806+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ow i forgot to say leaver buster doesnt recognise as a dc if it isnt for longer than 5 min, having a dc in less than that time period isnt considered a dc by the system i think that is why i was wanting another ban reason.\n\nSince the punishment given out is not by an actual person but the system there is no way for people with net issues to get any penalties. I mean would you want your mid laner or adc to go afk every for like a min or 2 while the enemy laner roams and secures the game for them??","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-05-11T03:39:15.673+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"besides the only ban i think that works is the chat restriction due to verbal abuse, all other ban reasons are just for show.","replies":[{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-05-12T08:52:12.456+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=NightTemplar,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=EifYd0jA,comment-id=0004,timestamp=2015-05-11T03:39:15.673+0000)\n>\n> besides the only ban i think that works is the chat restriction due to verbal abuse, all other ban reasons are just for show.\n\nThis was from the below link:\n\nLeaverBuster\n\nI keep getting leavers in my game. What happens to them?\n\nThe first time a player leaves a game, they’ll see a pop-up explaining that leaving is not okay and then have to manually agree to not leave future games. If they continue to repeatedly ruin other players’ experiences, they’ll enter lower-priority matchmaking for a number of games. While in low priority queue, players will experience queue times that are 5, 10, even 20 minutes longer than a player who hasn't left games.\n\nPlayers will know how many games they have in lower-priority, and if they join a premade group, that group will be notified they are playing with a chronic AFK/leaver and they’ll face the same lower-priority time penalty.\n\nWhile we hope it doesn’t ever happen, if a player fails to stop AFKing or leaving while in lower-priority matchmaking, continued offenses will result in bans.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-05-12T08:49:03.619+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Check this link out sunshine, it might make you feel that little better inside.\nhttp://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/L65wrRYe-player-behaviour-faq","replies":[]},{"poster":"ThatsBS","date":"2015-05-08T03:12:14.102+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"If you don't report for afk then don't moan.
