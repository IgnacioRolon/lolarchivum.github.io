But im not here to talk about that im just here to say get ride of the hassel of closing the client than reloging than waiting, when it could just take you to lobby to wait- the wait time would still be there of course","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-07-30T13:45:23.334+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201818740/en_US-leaverBusterWaitToQueueDialog.jpg","replies":[{"poster":"EMP Implosion","date":"2015-07-31T09:11:18.276+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"well clearly that statement was made for leaving after you joined a game #LeaverBuster , they just used they same statement and pop up box in the delay time as well cause firstly the times are the roughly the same and it just saves the hassal programing an entire new wait time box designed to detect dodges in champselect when you can use the same thing, \n\nAlso if your planning on arguing the first point of  abandoning a match, well queing up for match making then entering champselect is not the same as abandoning a match that has already started. \n\nwell then you could argue well if people in a team playing a professional sport were to leave before their games starts that would be considered abandoning and in that instance would be yes but in this case nor are you guys a part of a 5 man team as your qued up with 4 other randoms and the likely hood of getting the same person again after they dodge for their next match is next to none so that circumstance does not apply.\n(Exception high Challenger or Wood 5)","replies":[{"poster":"LUPIN lll","date":"2015-07-31T14:28:52.628+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All I can do is facepalm dude.
