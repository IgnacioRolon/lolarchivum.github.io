For example, I played a normal game today and picked {{champion:107}}  as I play a lot of jungle (Rank master 6 rengar) thinking that if i did really well this game that I would get a token towards my rank 7. At the end of a 31min game i was 15/1/7 with 115cs (predominantly jungle cs) which racked up to 14k gold. \r\n\r\nI am aware that cs does contribute towards the decision on what rating you get in each game  but I thought that at the least an S- was in order... If anyone could shed some light on something that I might be missing that would be great, or maybe my cs just wasn&#039;t up to par?","replies":[{"poster":"Ingénue","date":"2016-08-27T08:27:00.475+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It isn't a set score you need to achieve, it's all relative to how everyone else on the server is doing with the **same champ in the same role**. The system used to grade people is the same on all servers, it just that you get compared to a different pool of players. \n\nFrom Riot:\n\n> It’s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), meaning we have a server full of really good players. \n\n**Riot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I know from experience that the jg rengar boundary is high af* ♥","replies":[{"poster":"Verone","date":"2016-08-29T04:02:07.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cheers for the information, just seems a little bit unrewarding sometimes is all {{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SubZeroTwister","date":"2016-08-26T06:01:29.680+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"GIT GOOD\nnah to be fair, ive played with this guy and he legit deserves these tokens for not just reng but also hec, yas and zed. He has more than sufficient cs, kda and impact on the game. Its pretty weird that he doesnt get the tokens. Ive done much worse than him and still get S+ tokens","replies":[]}]}
