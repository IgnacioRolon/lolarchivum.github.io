Especially because we know they are ready to go on our server because they were \"accidentally\" put on multiple times. All I ask is a legitimate reason why they can't be on our server, If the answer is how long queue time would be, I am 100% sure that people who actually want to play it, wouldn't care about the queue times.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2014-12-18T01:24:10.385+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"They have said that in order for ranked 3s to be enabled there has to be a large enough population to ensure healthy match making.

A lot of us wait a while in champ select for ranked anyway, so a bit of queue time is no big deal, really. \nThey should trial it. They can talk about queue times all they want, but how are they gonna know what the queue times are like when they haven't seen what they are like? I know that we have a smaller community, but we could just have ranked 3v3s up when we have normal 3v3s up.","replies":[{"poster":"Wat U Lookin At","date":"2014-12-17T02:53:31.143+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Even when they didn't announce ranked 3's properly, it only took me like 2-3 mins to find a game.","replies":[]}]}]}
