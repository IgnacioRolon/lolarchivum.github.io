I picked Singed because he is a badass. I get into game vsing a Darius. Ok i do the right thing play passive give up farm rather than deaths. \r\n\r\nWe lose the game. Everyone lost lane on my team. No problem u lose lanes and games in league it happens daily no issue at all.\r\n\r\nThe post game lobby my team mate said the following.\r\n\r\n&quot;You&#039;re so bad why would you buy a boosted account.&quot; \r\n\r\nI was laughing sooo hard.
