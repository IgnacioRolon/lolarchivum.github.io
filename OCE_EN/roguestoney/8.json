Is this something that may be happening again soon? Would love a response from a Red or someone that has been here from the beginning that may know of a trend with the timing of this sort of thing?\r\n\r\nCheers =D","replies":[{"poster":"Saythes","date":"2015-12-08T00:18:13.762+0000","up_votes":5,"down_votes":0,"body":"They happen everytime a new champion is released. it wasn't actually that long ago since it happened, with Illaio, {{champion:120}}  got changed down to 4800 ip and {{champion:33}} to 1350 ip... That was about 2 weeks ago! \nUsually, there is only one price reduction when a new champ is released, but on rare occasions, there are two. \n\nThe next few champs to get there price reduced are...\nVarus - 6300ip to 4800ip\nDarius - 6300ip to 4800ip\nDraven + a champion lower then 4800 - 6300ip to 4800ip, ? \nJayce - 6300ip to 4800ip \nand so on...\n\nThese are just some confirmed IP reduction changes ready for a new champion to be released!
