His power late game now is about the same but he's stronger in a different way. Old vlad did constant high damage while staying really healthy and could 1v5 when ahead. This vlad now relies too much on his team and landing a good e to be effective. On top of that, the cost of his e is ridiculously high, meaning if he actually wants to be useful he has to kill himself. He also gets shredded really easily now with % damage items because of how his passive scales which are really common. Riot thought giving him more bonus health at the cost of damage and sustain would be a fair trade, they were horribly mistaken. He's meh at best, people who play him now and say he's insane had never played the old vlad and are only having his strengths come out as obvious because of his new playstyle. I don't see what the big deal is about why vlad should be forced to land 3 q's to get his damage off. He's not vayne or gnar, why should he be forced to have to constantly struggle with getting his q's in order to get a worse effect than if he just q'd the enemy 3 times normally in the past? New vlad makes you put too much effort in to get nothing out of it. You might as well build full ap and try to nuke people in team fights because there is 0 chance that he will retain his old sustained bruiser glory.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-14T07:31:01.869+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Drag0nicOverlord,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=c5ErtE09,comment-id=000200000000,timestamp=2016-05-14T05:12:47.156+0000)\n>\n> Vlad.\n\nTy for your input.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-10T09:02:44.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Anyone else got some insight?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-05-08T23:15:44.563+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I personally don't like the update, his second Q feels satisfying as when you hit it, but you can almost never poke your laner with it, because it shows its cooldown to the enemy too, and as soon as its almost up they back the fuck off, and you only get the chance to use it for like a second before it's gone. His E doesn't feel any more powerful, it now slows him and unlike his previous one it doesn't hit every target in the radius as it is a skillshot and not a homing missile, so can be blocked and can miss. His E also cancels his pool, so it becomes really easy to screw up your only escape, its range indicator while charging is slightly too big as well, so targets that look like they are in range, actually arent.\n\nHowever he is still one of the only hard counters for Zed, so update or not, he is an essential champion to know (seeming Zed is pick or ban in most games)\nHe is great when picked into AP top laners, because he no longer needs to rush hextech revolver (because they removed spellvamp so its kinda pointless) so you can rush spirit visage first, which gives you HP AP MR and its passive. which is a big blow to an AP top laner, (less so on mid laners, because they can still poke you pretty hard) due to your short range) \n\nhis health costs are much more costly now, which increases his disadvantage against all-in AD top laners like Riven, Olaf, and Jax etc. His second Q heal is much more intense now, but doesn't come around often enough to warrant taking on an AD sustained damage champ.\n\nAll in all i think it was a bad update.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-05-08T23:36:53.598+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Lord Sesshomaru,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=c5ErtE09,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-05-08T23:15:44.563+0000)\n>\n> All in all i think it was a bad update.\n\nThat's unfortunate... cheers for the information.
