Made a post about it when it first happened but there were too many other issues at that time with regards to new queues being released and new ranked season.\r\n\r\nI&#039;m unable to use the news section on mobile as it zooms to what you see in the linked image and I&#039;m not able to change the zoom. So i can only read parts of the information and i cant even get to page 2 of the news section.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is not a large issue to resolve.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-12T07:30:18.980+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have just tried to test this on my phone for you. \n\nIm using an iPhone 6 with iOS 10.1 and it seems to be working fine for me. \nSo it could be a problem that is specific to samsung/android?\n\nI did notice that ever since they changed the menu bar _(the black one at the top of the page with Game info + Universe + boards etc etc)_ The mobile site has had a lot of problems for me. But this specific problem doesn't seem to be happening for me.\n\nIf you give me a little more context, i can experiment and try to find out why mine is working and yours isn't?\n\nSorry I'm not a tech guy, but ill do what i can to help :P","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-12T08:30:29.403+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well my phone is a Samsung S6. \n\nThe Boards work fine no problems at all other than the notifications are MIA.\n\nnot much else to say sorry I'm not tech either :^)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-12-12T11:45:18.934+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"ahh ok, hopefully its just some bug somewhere that will be fixed before you know it. \n\nsorry i cant really help xD","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-12-12T19:58:43.765+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"No worries mate thanks for trying :^)","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
