You would definitely think Riot would announce such a change, and I can't remember seeing anything of the like.\n\nEDIT: The information in Riot's [ranked FAQ](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/204010760-Ranked-Play-FAQ#h3) supports that there is no decay in Gold, so you're fine (unless someone has failed to update the info, which is unlikely).","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-04-27T01:13:41.155+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Cheers lad.

I've just been consistently gold for the past few seasons. I have no desire to get any higher. Too lazy tbh. Dont play the game enough for myself to improve either i guess. \n\nOn another note. I was talking with a friend last night. We both agreed, gold really should have decay. Due to it being the top tier rewards (skin). I wouldn't mind playing games at all to stay in gold tbh. \n\nWhat are other peoples thoughts on this? From memory I believe it had decay back in season 3?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2017-04-28T07:21:26.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I'm kind of in the same boat. I want the skin but that's about as far as my ambition goes. I have to agree about decay in Gold though. It doesn't make much sense that in a tier where you get the 'premium' rewards you don't have to maintain it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2017-04-27T00:58:57.107+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"People in Gold should decay tbh.
