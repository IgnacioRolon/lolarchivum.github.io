Made a post about it when it first happened but there were too many other issues at that time with regards to new queues being released and new ranked season. \r\n\r\nI&#039;m unable to use the news section on mobile as it zooms to what you see in the linked image and I&#039;m not able to change the zoom. So i can only read parts of the information and i cant even get to page 2 of the news section. \r\n\r\nHopefully this is not a large issue to resolve.","replies":[]}
