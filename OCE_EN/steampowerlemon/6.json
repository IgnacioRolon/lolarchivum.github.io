Akhatet is a tall guy and stands up straight like {{champion:75}} and uses a khopesh as a weapon. He is a tanky top or jungle champ and maybe can support (maybe). \n\n_Lines_:\nPick in champ select: \"\"\n\nTaunt: *Akhatet holds out his khopesh and watches as it slowly turns to dust/sand and blown off in the wind* \"The dusk of the world is beginning and you will soon be nothing but aside from some mangled bones in the decaying ground.\" or \"You are nothing to me but an insignificant blip in the endless cycles of the world.\"\n\nJoke:  \"There was an emperor, a curator and a butcher in a boat... They drowned, the end.\"\n\nDance: *\n\nLaugh: *Akhatet opens his mouth really wide and breathes out sand and bugs.* \"Hhhaaa hhaa ha\"\n\nRecall: *Akhatet sits down on a stone stool and starts reading from a piece of parchment.*\n\nDeath: *Akhatet drops his khopesh and slowly turns to dust/sand and is blown away in the wind* \"A minor inconvenience.\"\n\nMove: \"\" or \"I have seen the end.\" or \"This world is ripe for destruction\"\n\nAttack: \"You were meant for the tomb\" or \"There will be nothing left\" or \"Destruction will be \"\n\n_Stats_:\nHealth: 546 (+85 per level) Health Regen: 7 (+0.8 per level)\nMana: 285 (+34 per level) Mana Regen: 8 (+1 per level)\nAttack Damage: 58.7 (+3.4 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.638 (+3.5% per level)\nMovement Speed: 330\nArmour: 26 (+3 per level)\nMagic Resist: 32 (+1.2 per level)\n\n_Abilities_:\nPassive: Pestilence: Every 8 seconds after using an ability Akhatet gains a swarm of insects around him for 3 seconds, that will deal magic damage (0.5% x level of enemy&#039;s current health per second) and heal him for 8% of his max health over the duration.\nAnimation: A swarm of locusts/flies/scarbs surround him as well as a purple/green haze.\n\nQ. Entropic Cleave: Akhatet&#039;s next basic attack will deal x (+0.3 ad) bonus true damage over 2 seconds to enemies in an area and silence them for 1.2/1.4/1.6/1.9/2.2 seconds.\nAnimation: Upon activation Akhatet will have green energy swirling around his khopesh. When attacking Akhatet will swing his khopesh straight down into the ground, cracking it and causing green chaotic energy to spill from the cracks.\n\nW. Violation: Akhatet steals 15/20/25/30/40 attack damage from a target enemy and causes them to take 3%/4.5%/6%/8%/10% increased damage from ally champions for 4 seconds.\nAnimation: A red energy surrounds the affected unit for the duration (Like {{champion:75}}&#039;s w).\n\nE. Defyance:\nPassive: Akhatet is healed for 2%/2.5%/3%/3.8%/5% of the damage from the basic attacks of all nearby champions (including enemies).\nActive: Akhatet warps the world around him causing the next 3 basic attacks against him to be completely deflected (calculated after resistances and excepting on-hit effects eg. {{item:3153}} /{{item:3091}}).\nAnimation: Akhatet&#039;s character model distorts and slightly fades. as he gets hit by attacks he will bend out of the way.\n\nUltimate: Great Revolt: Akhatet calls upon the spirits of his ancestors and gains increased health and an aura that decreases the armour and movement speed of all nearby enemies by 13%/16.5%/20% and increases allied attack damage and movement speed by the same amount for 12 seconds.\nAnimation: Akhatet is surrounded by a swirling storm of faded ghosts and insects (locusts/flies/scarabs) and he grows in size like {{champion:75}} or {{champion:58}}.\n\n(Please note that this is unfinished because I didn&#039;t have the time)","replies":[{"poster":"WaveDorvay","date":"2015-08-12T09:33:02.813+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Already overpowered lol. the passive, oh gawd no. The Q is pretty similar to {{champion:75}} except it doesn't have stacks. It's more like {{champion:86}}'s. Oh gawd the W... \"steals\"? By that you mean Akhatet will gain AD and the target loses AD? The 10% increased dmg tho... imagine using this at an ADC in teamfights... oh gawd no. I didn't understand the E much though. healed from the basic attacks of all champions? Do you mean that when an allied champion who is nearby uses a basic attack, depending on the dmg of that nearby champion, Akhatet is healed? if so then too OP. Imagine being with an ADC. Akhatet gets healed without even trying lol. WTF is that? \"Including enemy champions\"? What? Does that mean that even damage from enemy basic attacks heal Akhatet?! If Akhatet was fighting 1v1 against an ADC, depending on Akhatet's HP, Armor, and Dmg output... the ADC would never win since all dmg done to Akhatet will be healed because ADCs use basic attacks for dmg. Insta-heal. Imagine wearing thornmail with that... Oh no. The ult is pretty boring tho.","replies":[]}]}
