He has  a short one handed katana and wears a long grey cloak and a scarf. He holds his sheathed katana in his left hand and draws it quickly when he attacks.\n\n_Lines_:\nPick in champ select: \"Take only what you need... but give nothing back.\"\n\nJoke: *Kharld looks at the sky thoughtfully.* \"My technique? This is how I do it; I swing my sword so fast that I... break wind.\"\n\nTaunt: *Kharld half draws his sword, looks up, then quickly sheathes it* \"You will taste the sting of my blade as I strike at your very essence!\" or \"My blade has seen many a battle. The outcome of this one will be no different!\"\n\nDance: *Kharld sticks his sword in the ground next to him and pulls out a harp and plays Greensleeves.*\n\nLaugh: *Kharld bangs himself on the chest and lets out a loud.* \"HAH!\"\n\nRecall: *Kharld unsheathes his sword and spins it in his hand a few times then throws it high into the air. His sword will then fall in the centre of the fountain with him following after landing with a cloud of dust.*\n\nDeath: *Kharld kneels down and draws his sword and drives it into his belly* \"I've failed in my duty... urgh!\"\n\nMove: \"A bitter wind blows.\" or \"My blade grows restless.\" or \"With the wind at my back.\" or \"Swiftly.\"\n\nAttack: \"They are already dead.\" or \"I will rend the flesh from their bones!\" or \"Their death will be swift and clean.\"\n\n(melee) (no mana)\n\n_Roles_: Top/Mid\nFighter, Assassin\n\n_Base Stats_:\nHealth: 537 (+84 per level) Health Regen: 4.62 per second (+0.8 per level)\nAttack Damage: 51.725 (+3.3 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.628 (+3.6% per level)\nMovement Speed: 350\nArmour: 25.1 (+3 per level)\nMagic Resist: 32 (+1 per level)\n\n_Abilities_: \nPassive: Soul Shear: Every 12 seconds Kharld&#039;s next basic attack against a champion will ignore shields and 20%/30%/40% of armour (at levels 1/7/14). dealing physical damage to enemy champions reduces the cooldown by 1.5 seconds.\nAnimation: When this ability is off cooldown Kharld has his sword quarter drawn and it and his left hand glow bright yellow. When attacking, the sword will leave a white/yellow trail in the air.\n\nQ. Typhon Blade: Kharld's next basic attack will deal x (+1 ad) physical damage and knock enemies back (1 second knock up) in a line in front of him.\nAnimation: upon activation Kharld will unsheathe his katana with his right hand and holds it straight out next to him. When attacking Kharld will hold his katana above his head like a kendo stick and slam it down on his target.\n\nW. Suffocating Draft: Kharld instantly deals x (+0.4 ap) magic damage to enemies and slows them (50% for 1/1.2/1.4/1.8/2 seconds) in a cone and increases the cooldowns of all of their abilities by 1 second. If they are knocked up they will be slammed to the ground and stunned (duration of the slow plus half the duration of the knock up).\nAnimation: Kharld's left hand glows bright yellow as he stretches it out causing a wind VFX to come from all enemies within the area of effect towards his hand. If the enemies are knocked up he will twist his hand and clench his fist afterwards.\n\nE. Eastern Gale: Kharld dashes a medium distance to the far side of a target unit (including wards) increasing his  attack speed (by 19%/24%/30%/37%/45%) for a short time after. If they are an enemy Kharld will deal x (+0.4 ap) magic damage. If they are an ally Kharld will increase both his and the ally's movement speed (by 25%/30%/37%/46%/57%) for 2/2.5/3.2/4/5.1 seconds.\nAnimation: Just a dash with a bit of dust trailing behind him.\n\nUltimate: Dance With Death: Kharld dashes around the left side of an enemy to the far side of them dealing physical damage and applying on hit effects. Enemies hit while dashing will take reduced physical damage. This ability can be reactivated within 6 seconds and dash on the right side. If activated when not targeting anything will change the direction (doing this will put the second dash on cooldown for 10 seconds).","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-06-29T11:51:36.212+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"the passive should be constant, shields aren't too common. armor penetration is a bit powerful, so riot will have to be very very careful with balancing the passive,\n\nthe W should be something that goes well with the first two abilities. I assume the current combo is E Q to knock up, then knock down. Maybe something that pushes him or the enemy backwards?\n\nHe sounds like Yasuo's potential husband to me right now... But include a role so people can better understand what his W should be. What lanes can he take? Is he a bruiser, tank, or support? Does he specialize in something specific, like taking down bruisers or shield-users while not being effective against people who are mobile?","replies":[]}]}
