It's what lets the champ get into Freak Crevasse range while being a squishy. There's also a pretty big warning before leaping.\n\nFly Geyser should be like Nami's bubble of doom, with an even LONGER delay and shorter range, while dealing a LOT of damage. The delay has to be huge and requires you to aim forward even with 80% slow. No CC here, however.\n\nFreak Crevasse is the only CC. It's a really tiny range, you have to stand right next to an enemy champ. However, the snare is longer than Morganna's dark binding, and the cast is near instant.\n\nLightning Arc should be like a huge ultimate Statikk Shiv of doom. It arcs, dealing damage, chaining between champs and minions with global range (but unless everyone's standing in a huge conga line, that's not gonna happen.), dealing less damage when it hits a champion, but not when it hits a minion. The damage at rank 3, however, doesn't match up even Karthus at rank 1. And Requiem hits all champs without the huge crowd. This is to make Lightning Arc a finishing move that hits escapers. It also deals minor damage to minions compared to champions.\n\n\nThis way, he has a defined role as an assassin who can teamfight more effectively than other champs at any range, while being easily put down if focused, as his only way to put out his combo is to get close with leaping flame (huge warning that you can dodge!). \n\nAn assassin that works well in teamfights... That's practically an oxymoron.\n\nHis strengths include:\nHard to defeat unless you focus in a team fight\nHard to escape if you let him get you to low HP in the first place\nWorks amazing in a jungle full of monsters, or with minion waves.\n\nHis weaknesses include:\nInefficient at low amounts of champions\nRelies on AOE to hit a lot of targets, while not even having that huge of an AOE in the first place\nYou need to stand in the middle of 5 champs while being a glass cannon. Do not 1v5 ever, make sure there's someone dangerous nearby to get all the champ aggro.\nAll his abilities specialize in getting rid of champions, making him like LeBlanc when it comes to dealing with minions. His W will get rid of them, but that's mana and kill potential wasted\nWhen compared to Diana, Diana gets to close range to chase aggressively, while Neragitharr does so to burst a ton and hope it's enough.\n\nHis stats are:\nLow HP\nNon-existant MR\nMedium Armour\nHigh AD\nNo AP\nHigh MS\n\n(I didn't put much thought in this part. I'm not an expert at champ selection.)\n\nGood against:\n{{champion:83}} {{champion:59}} {{champion:53}} {{champion:74}}  (Insert anything that relies on summoning other units, or is extremely close range yet more-tank than damage)\n\nBad against:\n{{champion:67}} {{champion:103}} {{champion:101}} {{champion:161}} {{champion:121}} (insert anything that deals a ton of magic damage, has an amazing wave clear, has a huge range or can burst moderately while surviving a hit or two)\n\nEvenly matched or is luck based against:\n{{champion:7}} {{champion:4}} (Insert anything that works better at 1v1 than teamfights while not having too much isolating skills, relies on ganking a lone champ.)","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-06-30T00:24:22.435+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Exactly what I was going for in this champ was Like a hybrid caster, sort of another Udyr. just in case you were wonder he has no ult, he can take his r at any time.

You can't have all three, end of story. No amount of terrible damaging ability can let you circumvent this.\n\nThe 3 ways you can go with this guy is to:\n1.  Make a champ that can kill enemies and let the ADC farm minions (LeBlanc and Xerath supp are OP, don't trust the meta!)\n2. Be a tank that can soak damage and let the ADC do all the killing business himself (Hello, Braum.)\n3. Have 1 hard CC (THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE), and one soft CC or buff (Look at Taric!)\n\nI see a being of elemental **fury** (fury sounds like something that's meant to involve pain and death) as someone who deals a ton of damage, not someone who gets guys to stand still while taking hits.\n\nThis is just the supporting side of it. With teamfights, balancing becomes more of a pain. If you have a great support, he better have little presence in team fights.\n\n\n\nAlso, what's TFTFB???","replies":[{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-01T01:55:37.669+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Look at Zac he is a major gap closer with tons of cc and he is very tanky and can do lots of damage.\nAlso good in teamfights.\nand can support.\n2 major cc abilities (e and ult) one minor cc ability (q)\nT.hank F.or T.he F.eedB.ack","replies":[{"poster":"TeCoolMage","date":"2015-07-01T06:33:28.478+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Wow, you're right. I guess you can have a champ that can _be built_ to any of the 3, but not a champ that always does all 3. He has no HP ratios like Vlad, so either he builds health and has terrible damage but tankiness and sustain, or he builds AP and has great damage and burst but squishiness.\n\nI once went against a Zac, I didn't know Zac could tank because he squished like slime but did a ton of damage with his slinghotting.\n\nRethinking the champ is probably a good idea, but if you wanted to keep your concept the same, health costs are worth considering.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"SteamPowerLemon","date":"2015-07-01T02:17:06.241+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You know what, I am just gonna rethink this entire champion.\n\nps: Thank For The FeedBack","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-06-29T10:49:02.011+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yes let's have a ranged champion that has a Stun, Snare, knock-up and a silence.\n\n/sarcasm.\n\nThis champion's kit is overloaded as fuck lets go over why.\n\nGap close with a stun connected to it.\nAoE Snare.\nAoE Knockup.\nSingle target silence?
