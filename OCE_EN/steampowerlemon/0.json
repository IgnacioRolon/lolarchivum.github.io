I know right. He would be wearing a dark red suit and have a microphone/camera instead of an anchor, his w would be news logos floating around him.\n\nNext is Arcade Nocturne. His character model would resemble the ship from Galaga; His q would be like the speed boost things from Mario Kart, his e would make pixelated birds flying around the enemy&#039;s head. For his ultimate instead of the screen going dark it would flash with rainbow colours and when he dashes his engines will fire up (because he&#039;s a spaceship) and he would go all _warp speed_ on their a**es.\n\nAnother one is Dunkmaster Brand. He would be wearing a jersey similar to Darius&#039;s but would be a little burnt and the team on the front wouldn&#039;t be there. His q he throws a flaming basketball, his w I&#039;m not quite sure about, his e would be the same and for his ult he will throw a large flaming basketball that will bounce across all of the enemies&#039; heads.\n\nDuel Master Twisted Fate. Heavily based on Yu-Gi-Oh. He would have have spiked up yellow hair and a black trench coat. His three coloured cards would be the three Egyptian god cards (Blue=Obelisk Red=Slifer Gold=Ra). No more is needed.","replies":[{"poster":"AhegaoLove","date":"2015-08-30T22:33:27.604+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Dunkmaster Brand was a good idea but I would consider renaming it for Brand has no \"dunk\" in his kit","replies":[]},{"poster":"GonewiIdwithfire","date":"2015-08-05T10:37:48.268+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duel master TF would not work due to copyright.
