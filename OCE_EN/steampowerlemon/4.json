This effect can stack up to 6 times. (eg. 100 w/ 6 stacks = 130).\n\nQ: Madstone Flail: Tarkk slams his flail into the ground at a location dealing physical damage and stunning enemies hit by it. Within the next 4 seconds he can pull his flail back to him dealing physical damage and knocking enemies towards him. If he moves too far away from it, it will automatically return without doing damage. Tarkk can pick up his flail at any time halving the cooldown of this ability. Tarkk gains bonus movement speed when moving towards his flail. Tarkk cannot auto attack until he has retreaved his flail.\n\nW: Iron Bulwark: Passive: Tarkk imbues his Flail with energy causing his basic attacks to grant him a 8/12/16/22/30 (+6% bonus health) health shield. This effect can stack indefinitely but only lasts for 1.5 seconds.\n\nE: Eye of the tower: Tarkk charges up his shield with energy causing his next basic attack to deal bonus magic damage and reduce the enemy's armor.\n\nUltimate: Guardian&#039;s Duty: Tarkk throws his shield to an allied champion causing them to take 80% reduced damage for 4/6/9 seconds while redirecting 40% of the damage they would have taken directly to Tarkk (this will gain him stacks on his passive). If cast on self reduces damage taken by 60%. (will _not_ stack with other abilities eg. Alistar/Maokai's ult)","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2015-07-11T04:17:25.579+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"He needs base stats, such as\n\nHealth: 643 (93pl)\nMana: 278 (51pl)\nAttack speed: 0.67 (0.03pl)\nMove speed: 335\nArmor: 23 (3.8pl)\nMagic resist: 30 (2.7pl)\n\nDoes his passive increase the actual % or his armor amount, for example, 100 armor person would have 50% armor, would they have 130 armor or 80% armor?
