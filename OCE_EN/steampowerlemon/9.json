He carries two pistols named Kurtis and Paula (also the names of his dead brother and mother). He supplies guns to people like {{champion:222}} and loves blowing things up as well. He has an iron foot and a large coat (like a russian officer), he has a long tangled beard that is slightly {{champion:27}} from his line of work.\n\n_Lines_:\nPick in champ select: \"\n\nTaunt: *Kristoff cleans out one of his guns with his head tilted looking straight ahead.* \"Do not worry friend, I won't **kill** you... _just remove your ability to walk or see_.\"\n\nJoke: *Kristoff takes out a large shotgun shell and breaks it in half, he then gulps down the contents of one half like a shot after which he burps out flames and his beard catches fire, but he takes no notice for a bit then looks down, licks his finger and puts it out.* \"Just like water back in old country.\" or \"\n\nDance: *Kristoff spins his guns on his fingers and throws them in the air and catches them, then one of them accidentally goes off and he stops... then continues as if nothing happened.*\n\nLaugh: \n\nRecall: *Kristoff takes a large explosive package out of his knapsack and plants it in the gsound and stands on it. He begins a salute but just before his hand reaches his forehead the explosive he's standing on\n\nDeath: \n\n(ranged) (mana)\n\n_Roles_: Bot\nMarksman/support\n\n_Stats_: \nHealth: 523.8 (+80 per level) Health Regen: 6.5 (+0.7 per level)\nMana: 382 (+32 per level) Mana Regen: 8.1 (+0.7 per level)\nAttack Damage: 56.8 (+3.1 per level)\nAttack Speed: 0.632 (+2.9% per level)\nMovement Speed: 325\nArmour: 24.6 (+3.5 per level)\nMagic Resist: 30 (+0 per level)\n\n_Abilities_:\nPassive: Paula and Kurtis: After using three abilities, Kristoff's next two basic attacks will have bonus effects.
