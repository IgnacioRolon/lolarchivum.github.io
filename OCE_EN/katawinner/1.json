If you wanna use the trinket instead.","replies":[]},{"poster":"RIP Gandhi","date":"2014-12-29T14:14:01.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Heres my tips if they help;\n\nUse a comfortable keybinding for trinket/wards for instance I put wards on 3 and use c for my trinket\n\nDon't use locked screen, it screws with the process since majority of the time you ward jump you are running and locked camera means the screen is slightly moving and wards have small hit boxes. If you are used to it when you turn it off at the furthest right side icon above the mini map hold space down when you need it centered\n\nLast tip is you can jump to enemy ward as kat (not lee, idk about jax I don't see why not with him) this might seem dumb as you read it but alot of the time when people are running away they ward behind them so they can see you. If you are chasing them they are obviously out of e range so if you manage to e onto a ward they placed behind them it could potentially turn into a kill.","replies":[]},{"poster":"P1 GTR","date":"2014-12-14T07:19:22.851+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"macro","replies":[]},{"poster":"Exlex","date":"2014-12-14T01:11:53.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I like to use T as my ward key binding, and make sure my E is on quickcast, that usually works best for me.
