The main things that I noticed while looking at your stats is that you seem to be dying to often for your kill participation and that you have low cs.

Focus on your individual play and play with your team. You can't win them all. If someone flames you cause you have died a few times, don't react cause that's what they want you to do cause clearly they don't care about ranking up. Keep to yourself but help as a team mate. If someone makes a bad call to go in and it doesn't go well, then see it as a bad call is better then no call at all.

You also play a lot of heavy snowballing champs like Kat and Akali which means your team relies on you to do a lot in teamfights. I cant really say what you are doing is right or wrong, but i would suggest trying to minimise deaths and to focus more on towers and CS than playing TDM, although you are playing assassins which means u are good at killing.\n\nIf you start to snowball your lead, you should try to roam and snowball your team instead of facestomping your lane opponent.\n\nSilver is were the Average player is meant to be, so dont worry about being bad, like your B5 friend, but id say if you are silver, you should be able to get to Gold with practice on the games mechanics.","replies":[{"poster":"Katawinner","date":"2014-12-15T08:34:57.463+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the reply.\nI do tend to forget about CS, and just try and kill everyone on most of my champs (Asssassins, mostly).\nWhich is good and bad I guess, at the moment its working but I know I do need to work on my CS.\nI just hit Silver today so Im pretty happy with that.","replies":[]}]}]}
