Failure to do so means there is a case to dispute riot for scamming my account for not willing to show me any proof of any scripts or exploits.\n\nI have sent multiple emails about this with a lot of generic replies i have seen online and asked for proofs to which I only receive a reply saying &#039;after personally reviewing your account we are standing by our decision bla bla&#039; and now they are closing my ticket.\n\nAlso, why am I speaking to someone from NA rather than OCE. They have no idea how the australian law works.\n\nFurthermore i have a few other accounts and if i have been done in for scripting or hacking why did my main which i have  been playing since season 3 get banned? I have wasted all this time and money and built up an account to the state it is in today and i get banned for something i did not do. Not even showing me 1 screenshot to show how i am even hacking clearly shows that you have nothing on me apart from words. \n\nIf i was wrong, then i wouldn&#039;t be fighting this so hard but i am going to have to report this to the ombudsman unless you guys can provide me with bettet support than what i have been receiving","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2016-02-29T02:24:05.462+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot Games Support Specialists are trained to comply with the legal practices of the respective regions/countries in which they operate.

That is why i am completely baffled as to how you guys can even say I am found guilty of such crap. And out of all accounts i use, you only ban one that is by far suspicious. I know i am right and you have nothing but your words against mine.\n\nYour support team isn't disclosing anything either so where will my queries even lead to. I even offered to show you guys my entire harddrive and you will find nothing on it even if you try and search for files i have deleted you will see nothing that gives me an advantage in game.\n\n3 freaking seasons I have played and you go and banned my account in a season i am starting to do well in by spamming warwick? Is it because I time my ultimate well and that looks like i am hacking? You can watch ALL my in game plays and see I take a lot of skill shots and my dodging skills are pretty bad. So once again you have nothing on my account. It seems like you guys are wrong and refuse to own up to it","replies":[]},{"poster":"Swords114","date":"2016-02-29T03:08:23.753+0000","up_votes":0,"down_votes":1,"body":"Also, as with all riot support members you are neglecting my comment about purchasing of RP points which starts a contract between me (consumer) and riot.

Even they are showing proof when they ban someone's account for hacking for their games such as dota and CS.","replies":[]}]}]}
