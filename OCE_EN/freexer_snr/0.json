Its not just are they that bad. No I wanted to ask have many other people been seeing this too? Also what is RIOT doing about it? It completely wrecks the games, not only do you have them AA the nearest minion but they run straight in and die so they completely feed the other team, worse than AFKers.\r\n-Free","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2015-05-28T11:38:04.979+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've never actually been in a game with a bot in my life, unless it was when I was around level 10 where I wasn't paying enough attention to everyone else.\n\nIt's sad that it happens though, and people will continue doing it. I say make the most of it and kill the bots when you see them on the enemy team.","replies":[]}]}
