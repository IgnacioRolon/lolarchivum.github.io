A fair amount of the time in lower brackets such as silver it is quite common to either lose a teammate or verse a team who has lost one creating an unfair game that happens to often to call playing ranked balanced. I had thought that maybe if the situation arose the game would automatically be cancelled after 5-10 minutes but this would cause problems of people just disconnecting to not lose points. So after more thought this was my idea\r\n\r\nUsing a same kind of system as the team builder that is implemented you would have the option to be a \"filler in a game\". Essentially what would happen is that if someone where to disconnect someone who is not a game could go to a tab like the custom games tab and there would be an open slot where someone could join to play as the champion and \"fill\" for the team. Obviously there would be a balancing factor like what if they were 0-7 and you would have to fill with that score, well i'm not exactly all that technical but there could be some form of factor where the heavier the responsibility you take on either you win more LP points or you just don't lose as many. I believe this would make \"filling\" a more attractive option as you would essentially be able to move up faster but you do run the risk, to stop the farming of this you could limit each player to 5 filler games a day or something along these lines. This would mean that there would be a lot less games where people will have to fight in an unfair advantage and the people filling would benefit as well. \r\n\r\nHowever i am no game designer and i do not know if this is at all possible, it is simply an idea that i would like to share so that maybe we can somehow ensure that there are more fair games in the ranked system.","replies":[{"poster":"sparklefart","date":"2015-03-11T05:44:30.534+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A good idea, only thing is that the games that had an aft from start, and you join say 15 minutes late, that puts you at a massive disadvantage, i don't see people willing to join some of the games, with nearly a guarantee of loosing. Should be an extra reward for people if they were to join in one of those fill games","replies":[{"poster":"8 Equals D","date":"2015-03-12T10:36:16.310+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah man obviously it's not perfect was just an idea that i feel like may or may not help.
