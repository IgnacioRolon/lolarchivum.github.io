They seem to be enjoying it more when you&#039;re forced to play something even if it&#039;s horrible and getting waffle stomped by that one random good champ. So I propose a solution, or a compromise if you will. Both game modes are released under the Urf tab. That way people who have fun playing what they want against people who also play what they want can play Classic Urf. People who have fun seeing different champions but for some reason don&#039;t want to play ARAM can play ARURF.\r\n\r\nThis way people can play what they want.\r\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-mindblown}}","replies":[{"poster":"Zatyr","date":"2017-02-28T00:37:17.949+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It'd be nice to have the option, it's like once u get sick of all the OP u just go play arurf","replies":[]},{"poster":"DarkShade918","date":"2017-02-27T09:41:18.743+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"So basically add a meta to URF, not like running into an ali every game will be much fun","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2017-02-27T09:55:43.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's kinda the point of meta. There's a wide range of champions that are ridiculous in urf. Everyone is op and everything is messed up. Complaining about unbalanced champs in unbalanced game mode :V The only thing I am proposing is to release both modes together under the URF tab. Kinda like how you can pick between norms and ranked in Summoner's Rift.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"FatedSaviour","date":"2017-02-27T00:27:32.774+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"why are people downvoting this","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-02-27T00:36:23.108+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"My guess would be because they believe its a silly idea.

The game mode by DEFINITION is a stomp. It's not supposed to be balanced. Does 80% cdr, extra attack speed, no mana cost etc. sound balanced to you? Yes people played the same stuff, but you know what there's a wide list of things that's op af in urf. Ever played Bard in Urf? I doubt you have. You don't have fun playing what you don't want to play. That's why most people don't play Aram. That's why we don't select roles and are autoallocated champs. If you want to \"see\" champs, you can browse the champ list, play aram or watch gameplays on youtube.
