I&#039;m even more fascinated of the art, mainly through wallpapers of Runeterra. We have a pretty diverse world with many nations, factions, clans, cities and races that people could be a part of. How would people find the idea of an MMORPG based on the lore and world of league? Champions could also be part of special events. For example Demacia and Noxus might go to War, an army of npcs would battle and players could participate. {{champion:122}}  and {{champion:86}}  could lead the armies as bosses and if the players of one faction manage to kill the other faction&#039;s leader wins, maybe conqueres some territory. {{champion:31}} could appear and start eating stuff. Players would have to gather and kill him. {{champion:33}}  could be a super rare npc that would breifly roam the desert before he disapeared. We could even have underwater areas with {{champion:105}} {{champion:267}} {{champion:111}}  etc. Again champions would be more like special events. That&#039;s kinda how I&#039;d imagine it. We could even have real LoL items in the game\r\n\r\nI find the idea quite exciting both from a gameplay point of view but also a visual with the world design.\r\nThe idea is open to suggestions. What does everyone else think?","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-25T01:37:50.354+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"A LoL based MMORPG has been suggested by lots of different people, though I don't think many people have ever submitted in-depth suggestions. The one thing that always comes to mind, for me, when someone brings up a LoL MMO is [this thread](http://forums.oce.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=65726) from the OCE forum archives.\n\nAs far as I recall, Riot hasn't ever said that they would be doing (or even considering) a LoL based MMO (I think they've rejected the idea a few times). Though I remember that, a while back, one of the Rioters said something about an RPG (in a similar style to Skyrim) based on Quinn's time in the Freljord (if I remember correctly) was (maybe?) being considered (I think that might not be happening at this point, though).","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2016-06-25T05:46:10.083+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Interesting. Although I think the game is too much based on LoL. I was aiming for a more free open world style. Where players can interact with the world and also with the champions. I think the champions area very important part of the franchise and being able to interact with them would be quite nice. I like the idea of champion abilities. Maybe, some champions could run \"schools\". I just though of this but, for example. {{champion:16}}  could run a healer's school. If healers go there they can maybe learn 1 or 2 abilities similar to the champion ingame like her q for example. {{champion:267}}  could run another school and if you went to that you could maybe learn something similar to ebb and flow or her bubble or some water based abilities anyway. Just rolling the idea in my head. I'm not very fond of the ability limit. It seems a bit restricting for an MMO. But apart from that.\nI had read in one or two other places that this had been thought of before but I thought i'd post my kinda visualisation of it. I would be quite interested to find out whether riot had concidered it. If so, what they think of such a development. MMOs offer a different gameplay from MOBAs. Making one would likely attract people who may not be into MOBAs but prefer an MMO. It would also be interesting for lots of fans of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Project Xayah","date":"2016-06-26T01:07:41.186+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> I was aiming for a more free open world style.\n\nI don't know where you got the idea it wouldn't be. No where is it explicitly stated it wasn't and, as far as I'm concerned, the style it indicates it *is* free-roam, open-world.\n\n> I'm not very fond of the ability limit.\n\nThis is something I brought up with the original poster, which we discussed. I pointed out that the in-combat limit of 4 was extraordinarily low for an MMORPG and suggested that \"skill sets\" also be switchable in-combat, to an extent (x number of sets switchable in-combat, others switchable out of combat). You would also need to consider that these are more \"placeholder\" values, likely if Riot *did* make an MMORPG there would be more abilities available at any given time (whether it uses the same system or not).\n\n> Where players can interact with the world and also with the champions.\n\nI believe this was also part of the suggestion, and further discussed (though, perhaps, not as you had thought?). 9261slipkn (the original poster) suggested interacting with \"original League characters\" through story quests, I expanded on that by suggesting side-quests that would allow players to raise/lower their standing with different factions and interact with \"original League champions\" and, no doubt, they'd be strewn across the world for players to find and interact with.","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2016-06-26T06:37:49.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I meant not so much revolving around the champions.\n\nEven if you could switch between them a total of 4 usable at any time is still very low. It will result in a very boring rotation. I play a druid on WoW and cor rotation consists of 5 abilities which revolve around a \"pendelum\" energy bar. And I can tell you that although I absolutely love playing a druid, if I didn't have all my other spells to add variety I would get bored really quickly, and I still do sometimes. And actually most people stopped playing druids because of this.\n\nYes that is not a bad idea actually.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
