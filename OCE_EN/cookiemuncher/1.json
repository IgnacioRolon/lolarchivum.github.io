Some people I&#039;ve talked to seem to agree to certain degrees. All the abilities have something new but his ult remains the same across all skins. It thought that perhaps the visual effects can be modified to fit his skin theme. Not necesseraly to look very good, but to create some noticable differences and give a little bit more variety. For example the Elderwood Bard ult can turn people into wood or even (pushing it) they can have leaves on them too as if turned into trees, or stone. The Snow Day ult can turn everyone into ice sculptures, or encase everyone in blocks of ice, like his Q. However this would vreate problem with champions off the ground as we&#039;d have flying ice cubes everywhere.\r\n\r\nIt would demand a vit more work and may be complicated since models would have to be made for all champions and potnetially there skins too. However Something along this line I feel would make the skins more interesting.","replies":[{"poster":"WhiteKimchi","date":"2015-12-28T00:42:28.113+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I was really expecting the snow day one to turn them into ice or at least be a light blue color especially since it's 1350","replies":[{"poster":"cookiemuncher","date":"2015-12-28T05:47:30.265+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"True.
