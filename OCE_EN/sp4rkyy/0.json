But is there anyway to fix a &quot;crashed game&quot; without closing and reopening the client? \r\n\r\nNormally I wouldn&#039;t care, but I recently started to play ranked this season because I figured it was about time, regardless I find myself currently in a series up to silver. I decide to play a normal to have a &quot;warm up&quot; game before finishing my series, and it says my game has crashed and to &quot;please try to reconnect to the game&quot;. Lets be honest here.. I have never, in 3 years of playing been able to fix a crashed game without closing and reopening the client. So how am I supposed to fix this. I cant reconnect, which I have tried at least 10 times, if I close and reopen the client, it will end my series, and by waiting to see if this fixes itself, I will have a match count as a leave and probably get the leaver buster bull**** regardless.\r\n\r\nSo can anyone help shed some light on this or why it hasn&#039;t been fixed? HELP  \r\n\r\nTL:DR game crashed in a norms, but im in a series. how do I reconnect without closing and reopening client?","replies":[{"poster":"sp4rkyy","date":"2015-10-08T12:14:26.795+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the help lads, I will admit to being slightly salty at the time so true it probably isn't on riots end, but it is irritating when things crash even when I have no recording software or any reason for it to crash really..\n\nSo the main issue is that if your game crashes, and you are in a series.. you just have to sit there and wait the 40+ minutes till it finishes before you can go back to the client home page..? and possibly get a leaver buster, because rito will forfeit your series if you close the client.. \n\nIsn't there any way they can distinguish the difference between a crash and a leave..? I would assume so as there is a different message from connecting to crashing..? because imo, \"turning it off and back on\" is literally the oldest sure fire way to fix any issues.. like.. will they ever fix it? or should I just binge my promos so I don't risk crashing and waiting it out?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kakatroflmao","date":"2015-10-07T13:06:29.696+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I used to have this problem... The reason was because of LoLReplay. If you have some form of recording software for league I guess it can mess with it and the problem went away as soon as i got rid of it.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2015-10-07T01:41:58.932+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Why do you assume this is a problem with Riot's servers? If it was wouldn't everyone disconnect at once? The fact that this is only happening to you every few games means can mean 2 things;\n\n1. There is a problem with the client.\n2. Your computer, firewall or internet is the problem.\n\nI have not had any problems with the client since I upgraded my computer. I think it's the same for many other players as well. Which only really leaves option 2 as the reason for your crashing and client issues.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Robo23","date":"2015-10-06T09:59:48.062+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"U cant unless by some miracle it lets u reconnect.
