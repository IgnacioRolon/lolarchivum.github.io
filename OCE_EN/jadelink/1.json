Since the patch it just seems that you run out of mana too easily and will just end up feeding the endless Darius/Fiora/Riven/AD kennen/generic carry toplaner.  Then those toplaners, once ahead are nearly unstoppable and can usually 2v1 you and your jungler.  Is it the end for top tanks who aren&#039;t named &#039;Galio&#039;? (Incoming nerf for him apparently)\r\n\r\nIs anyone having luck substituting other items or builds for dorans stacking ?","replies":[{"poster":"Husy15","date":"2017-06-15T05:29:53.404+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Throughout the entirety of league of legends, there has been a cycle of strong and viable champion archetypes. \nAt the moment, tanks are a big strong force, and a lot of them don't need mana..\n\nhowever, you stated that 'darius' is a generic toplaner that doesn't need mana... and well, you're mistaken, darius' kit relies heavily on the usage of his spells, if you're not constantly hitting Q's and missing your E's, you're basically going to get picked off instantly.\n\nas someone who plays toplane darius, im forced to not use spells in order to sustain in lane, i don't buy mana items, or even think about mana regen in my masteries, you just play conservatively, don't spam abilities, don't use spells constantly. \n\nwith different ranks this might be harder/easier, but i'm sure you can make it work, figure out your champions, and the enemy champion, and how to best play the lane.\n\nas a darius i wouldn't want to use ANY spells in a fight against fiora until i believe i can kill her, because if i even screw up 1 ability, most likely she'll kill me. \n\nagainst a Jayce, i'm forced to keep him away from minions in his melee form, while also dodging his Q's (yet forcing him to use them), in order to waste his mana and not be able to fight in lane..\n\n\nFigure out your champion, how it fits into the current META, and how to deal with the issues your champion faces in lane \n\nP.s. the river-plants are a great source of mana/health when you can afford to run down, learn the spawn timing, and don't make it obvious that you're going there.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-06-15T05:59:53.056+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's why when I play darius I usually ALWAYS start with a corrupting potion unless I'm in a really hard matchup and I know I won't be able to fight, that's when I take doran's shield and just passively fun until I know I can all in and kill them.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-06-15T01:28:18.183+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Conservation.","replies":[{"poster":"jadelink","date":"2017-06-15T02:28:52.738+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sadly, if you lane against riven, fiora or darius, then you normally have to either spend a huge amount of mana to be able to approach the wave without losing more than half your HP.
