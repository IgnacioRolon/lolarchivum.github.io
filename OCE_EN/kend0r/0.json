You&#039;ll notice a small amount of ads from time to time, I kept the amount to a minimum and didn&#039;t make them invasive, but as I am paying for the server that powers the multiplayer mode I hope to be able to finance that one through the game - best case.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here&#039;s my game, enjoy everyone! Leave your feedback here if you want, I&#039;m looking forward to reading it.\r\n\r\nAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.IdleGameStudio.SummonersQuiz \r\niOS: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1300128087\r\n\r\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/8rMTy7LvTZw\r\n\r\nKend0r","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2017-11-15T04:22:26.502+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"11 downloads, 5 stars, I'm in.","replies":[{"poster":"Kend0r","date":"2017-11-15T06:33:10.345+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Has to start somewhere :-D","replies":[]}]}]}
