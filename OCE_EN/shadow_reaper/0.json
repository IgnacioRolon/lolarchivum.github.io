I loved playing pantheon back in season 3 to season 5 i stop playing him as his kit just got boring. i have 3 of his skins, i love his background and his gameplay a bruiser that can go in and take out an enemy with pure strength and combos from abilities. this is my opinion Please share yours i like to here yours..\r\n\r\nRiot please update pantheon thanks..{{champion:80}}","replies":[{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2018-05-04T22:23:06.337+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can't rework a champion just because you're bored of them.\n\nEspecially in a case like Pantheon.\nYes he's old, and his kit is old, but it's still very relevant to the current state of the game, and more than viable enough to keep him competitive.\nHe doesn't NEED a rework.\n\nIf you're bored of a champion, play someone else.\nThere's plenty of others with similar style or theme.","replies":[]}]}
