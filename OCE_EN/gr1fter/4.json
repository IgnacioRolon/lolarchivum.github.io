Drop downs are so soviet era.\n\nConsistency is important. On the Champion Collection page the Owned,  Available and All filter is in a drop down, while the Alphabetical, Mastery and Recently Played are buttons...  Why are they not all buttons?\n\nAlso, instead of the drop downs in load out selection, how about a load out button that takes you to a load out page where you can see your runes and masteries easily and select them for the match.\n\nThe whole client is mostly button based, stick to that.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-06-18T09:16:59.794+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I second this notion.","replies":[]}]}
