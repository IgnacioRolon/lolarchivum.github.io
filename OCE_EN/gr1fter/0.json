{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-05-18T07:43:58.806+0000","title":"An Open Letter to Riot","subforum":"Miscellaneous","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi Riot,\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been a casual player of your game for about a year. I get in less than 10 games a week and I don&rsquo;t play ranked, yet. I really enjoy playing LoL; it&rsquo;s fun, competitive and has strong teamwork and strategic elements. I even enjoy watching pro players and You Tubers strut their stuff on The Rift. The effort you&#039;ve put into making the game a dynamic competitive environment should be commended.  However, while the game elements are strong, the parts surrounding the game are quite disappointing.\r\n\r\nI&#039;ve been playing games a long time and come across all sorts of reward, levelling, customisation and purchasing systems. The systems in LoL are clunky, outdated and don&rsquo;t mirror the effort you&#039;ve put into the game. You&rsquo;re probably aware of this, but as each patch goes by it seems less likely that any of these issues will be addressed. Of course your emphasis should be on the game play element, but creating a fun, accessible, rewarding experience around the game enhances player experience and brings in new players.\r\n\r\nAs one game critic said: _&lsquo;It is both possible (and even necessary) to simultaneously enjoy media while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects&rsquo;_ So, I am going to be critical of the parts of LoL that in find lacklustre. These criticisms are opinion, based on my own gaming experience and are not saying &lsquo;LoL is bad&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nAccessibility\r\n\r\nI think most players will agree tutorial and bot match ups are pretty average and in no way represent the actual game. If you only play bot games you&rsquo;ll have little understanding of the underlying strategy of the game in PvP situations. Summoner Spells, Runes, Masteries, jungle tactics, warding, global objectives, these are not sufficiently covered in the tutorial or represented in bot games.\r\n\r\nPlaying to level 30 is not enough to prepare someone for competitive play, especially when &lsquo;normal&rsquo; play puts you in a pool of players that can range from 0-500+  PvP wins. Now that the XP required to reach level 30 has been halved, there is even less preparation. There needs to be better environment for new players to come to terms with the tactics and skills required to play competitively.\r\n\r\nYour champion skill pages are so outdated they&rsquo;re actually misleading. Also, while you&rsquo;re at it, insert the numbers along with the skill description. Stop relying on third party sites to give details on champ skills and bring this information on your client. It&rsquo;s hard enough to understand champ skills and practice them without starting with misinformation. \r\n\r\nI think Stonewall008 summed up LoL&rsquo;s lack of tutorial and sandbox mode in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_pbH1iBHHk). Trigger warning: DOTA2 content.\r\n\r\nLevelling\r\n\r\nWhat does level 30 mean? You can play ranked and have unlocked all the mastery points. Why does it stop at 30? It would make sense to continue the level system to create some stratification in casual play, rather than being tossed in with players who have a lot more experience and can&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re not performing to their expectations. The lack of stratification in casual games can create frustration for new and veteran players.\r\n\r\nOnce I reached level 30 with my first account I started another so I could get more practice in lower levels. It worked; I&rsquo;m more confident and have gone back to my main account. But this is not the way it should be done. I should have been able to have that experience in my main account and expanded my champion pool there. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, as soon as you reach level 30 everyone thinks you can play well. This is definitely not the case and I can see it as a barrier to new players.\r\n\r\nRunes\r\n\r\nI have two rune pages, which are the pages I started with. I&#039;ve managed to fill both of them by sharing runes between them. The price point for a new page is too high and tier 1 and 2 runes are irrelevant. I would rather be spending my IP on champs and I won&rsquo;t get new runes because I have nowhere to put them. Also, the unlocking system is pointless; just give us all the rune slots from the beginning so we can play with it before getting to level 30. In fact, wouldn&#039;t it be better to unlock runes as you level up? They only cost IP anyway, which is an equivalent to time spent playing. It means we wouldn&#039;t have to decide between champs and runes.\r\n\r\nMasteries\r\n\r\nAgain, these are locked behind a pointless progressive barrier and there is no context to explain what they do for new players. I currently have 12 pages and I know there are players that would have more than that. As much as it is a good customisation system, it is still too convoluted. Keystones were a great addition, but I would prefer further simplification based on play style rather than champion selection. Give us pre-made selections that actually mean something to our play style. I want to spend time playing the game, not messing with Mastery Pages every time there is an update or I unlock a new champ. And again, give us complete access early on.\r\n\r\nHex Tech Crafting \r\n\r\nI was excited about Hex Tech Crafting. The idea of being rewarded for playing well appealed to me and the chance of getting some free skins was pretty cool. Then I saw the restriction of [one chest per champ, per season](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/site/2016-season-update/champion-mastery.html). So, maybe not too bad, it encourages you to play a variety of champs, over an entire season. But, it discourages you from playing a champ once you get that chest, for the entire season. It doesn&#039;t even have to be you getting an S to lock that reward away for 12 months. Your buddy can have a good game and your champ is done rewarding you for the season.\r\n\r\nI could understand if it was once per month, but a whole season seems a bit ridiculous. To get better at LoL it&rsquo;s better to specialise in a few champs and play them a lot. This system actively discourages this type of development. Getting an S rank is actually a huge achievement, regardless of how good you are with a champ. Can you imagine going into a ranked game and someone picking a champ they are sub-optimal with because they&rsquo;ve already got a chest on their best champ? That is what this system encourages. Sure, they may have a smaller chance of getting a chest, but it&rsquo;s better than getting an S and not getting anything for it.\r\n\r\nFor something that&rsquo;s supposed to encourage diverse champ play, why is it locked for champs you don&rsquo;t own? It has effectively relegated the free champ rotation to bot games only. Why would I want to play them competitively when there is no chance of a reward if I play well? The point of a reward system is to actually reward people for good play, no matter what.\r\n\r\nI could understand the restrictions and lockouts if the rewards were pretty spectacular, but they&rsquo;re not. The best bit about Hex Tech crafting is watching the disappointment on You Tuber&rsquo;s faces when they open $100 worth of chests. Champion shards? Are you serious? Oh, and two types of essence so you can&rsquo;t convert champ shards into essence you actually want and can use. The only good chest was the first one we got as a gift, a misleading example of the mediocrity to follow. We have to work pretty hard to open a chest. First get an S for the chest, and then win games to get key shards with an unknown drop rate. The chances of you winning games is probably going to be lower because you&rsquo;ll be playing champs you haven&rsquo;t got a chest with yet.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I&#039;m assuming the system is designed to frustrate people into buying chests and keys, or if you&rsquo;re like me, just ignoring it all together because it&rsquo;s not worth the effort and definitely not worth your money. Also, the UI is clunky and has redundant button pushing. Open, Forge, Add to Loot. Just let me click on a chest and let the magic happen.\r\n\r\nChampion Mastery\r\n\r\nJust when you thought this was pretty straight forward and in no way connected to Hex Tech Crafting, patch 6.10 proves us wrong. I didn&rsquo;t mind the original system, it may have been a bit easy to get to level five (30-40 games), but it was reachable and encouraged you to play a single champ. Level five meant you could be confident with the skills of that champ.\r\n\r\n_Now there is level six and seven; levels that rely on you getting S ranks to unlock. Fair idea; in theory. You should have mad skills with a champ to get to those levels. But, if you&rsquo;re playing a popular champ that has high play in high ELO, good luck, because ranks are based on regional performance.\r\n&lsquo;It&rsquo;s based on the champion and role that you just played in a game. So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means you performed in the top x% of players on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.&rsquo; _\r\n[Link](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\r\n\r\nSo, it&rsquo;s not going to be easy to get these new levels, which is fine, it shouldn&rsquo;t be. But for some players it&rsquo;s going to be near impossible, no matter how much they play the champ. For those that excel, all it takes is getting some S ranks and you have proven yourself worthy of next mastery level. Well, almost.\r\n\r\nHEXTECH MASTERY: Combine Mastery tokens for a specific champ with that champ&rsquo;s crafting shard, permanent loot, or blue essence to unlock their next mastery level\r\nZOINKS!:We&rsquo;re adding a new mystery champ item to the store for RP or IP in a future patch that&rsquo;ll help offset the RNG of finding champ shards and permanents in chests\r\n[Link](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes)\r\n\r\n\r\nI&rsquo;m not even sure what those mean, but if it means it&rsquo;s tied to Hex Tech Crafting, count me out. BTW, while you&rsquo;re earning those extra S ranks you&rsquo;re not getting those chest rewards till next season.\r\n\r\nSkins &amp; RP\r\n\r\nI think Pants are Dragon summed up [my feeling on skins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjTz3fAcOkQ). I prefer the DOTA2 customisation system (though I really dislike the game) of being able to mix and match different parts of a champ with micro-transactions. I can actually customise a champion the way I want. That kind of control is important to me and makes my gaming experience unique.\r\n\r\nI would like to spend more money on LoL but the initial investment is just too big. I would rather spend a dollar here and there than fork out $10-20 to get a good deal on RP. Even ward skins, which no one really sees, are almost $6 for an OCE player. I&rsquo;d pay $2 or $3 for one. Give us some more micro transaction options than forcing us to make that big upfront spend.\r\n\r\nMost skins are not micro-transactions; they are pretty big transactions, especially here in OCE. Top skins are usually 1350RP, to see how much this is in dollars you can look at this comparison based on what $10 will get you:\r\n\r\nUS $10 = 1350RP\r\nAUD $10 =1100RP\r\n\r\nFor $10, OCE players can&rsquo;t get a top skin. The rationale for the price discrepancies is described in this [post ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/announcements/MXv9uHnL-rp-adjustment-in-oceania)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue I have with this rationale is that global economic factors are not the controller of RP; Riot is. They set the value and have control over the price in each region. RP is not Bitcoin or represents any form of real currency. $10 to a person in Australia is the same as $10 to a person in the US and should give us equal spending power in a market that is solely controlled by the vendor. If you want to pretend that global currencies play a part in this pricing, just sell everything direct in $US and cut out RP all together. \r\n\r\nToxicity\r\n\r\nThis is going to be the final and shortest section. You only need to go to the [Player Behaviour](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behaviour) part of the boards to see what the general feeling is on this subject. \r\n\r\nRather than focusing on punishing toxic players, why not reward positive players? Got one of those Honor Ribbons? Earn 10% more IP. Haven&rsquo;t had a restriction or ban for six months? Have a rune page. Promote the good along with punishing the bad. Let toxic players know they are missing out on more than just a few games.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading. If you didn&rsquo;t here is the TL;DR\r\n\r\nLoL is an amazing game, but everything surrounding the game needs to be better to enhance player experience. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\nA casual LoL player","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-19T05:47:24.798+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"That's a mighty fine letter you have this! Welcome to our community and I'm glad you are enjoying it so far =)\n\nI'm going to try address some of your points to provide some context around how we got to where we are right now and how we intend to improve.\n\nFirst up \n\n**Accessibility**\nI agree League of Legends or Moba's in general are extremely hard to get into. You don't get good at a Moba without 100's or 1000's of hours of play. There are usually tonnes of characters to choose from each with 4~ abilities to learn. Not to mention the items, effects, passives, jungle, buffs, etc. For new players Mobas can be very overwhelming. \n\nIn terms of a sandbox mode we mentioned - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/riot-games/announcements/riot-pls-dynamic-queue-sandbox-and-league-2016\n\nThat said, being open to the idea doesn’t mean it immediately becomes our top priority. The internal team that would develop this feature is focused on a different project for the foreseeable future, so while we’re saying we want to do it and, one day, we will, that’s the extent of this commitment. \n\nSo knowing all this why haven't we put more resources into accessibility? It all comes down to limited resources and where we ultimately decided to focus wasn't on accessibility for drawing in new players. We decided to really focus on the existing player base. This is why we put a heavy emphasis on regular [balance updates](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Patch), [champion releases](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_champions), [champion reworks](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/202294884-Champion-Update-Schedule), [behaviour initiatives\n](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/sections/200382430-Behavior-Initiatives) and more. We believed giving our existing players are world class experience in game was more valuable than leveling up our new player experience.\n\nAs for relying on 3rd party sites for details and champ skills it kind of falls under the same bucket but in a different way. What is value added from putting these things in client vs having them available on 3rd party sites? Should we put resources into doing this when there are resources already available to players? or should we continue to focus on what we think will bring the highest value to players.\n\nIn an ideal world I think we would love to be able to do it all. I think as we roll out the [League Client Update](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/client-update) we will slowly be able to at least start addressing the outdated client information, and eventually when the work is done for the client update start working on improving the new player experience (increasing accessibility).\n---\n\n**Leveling**\nI don't have too much to add here. I think we are working on more ways to show \"skill\" so players have a better understanding of where they are, starting with Champ Mastery (we just released level 6 and 7).\n> \n> It would make sense to continue the level system to create some stratification in casual play, rather than being tossed in with players who have a lot more experience and can’t understand why you’re not performing to their expectations.\n\nWe actually use a Match Making Rating (MMR) system to match players together. We don't just put all level 30's into one big pool of players and match them against each other. You can read more about match making here and I have included a excerpt below - https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide\n\n> HOW DOES MATCHMAKING WORK RIGHT NOW?\n> First, the system places players in the appropriate pool - which is basically the queue (normal, ranked, solo/duo, ranked 5-man team, etc.). Once in the pool, the system starts trying to find matches, with the goal of creating teams that are both made up of players with roughly equal skill and have a fair chance of winning.\n> Step 1: Determine strength:\n> \n> If a player is queued alone, the strength is determined by his personal matchmaking rating (referred to as MMR from here on out) and number of wins for that particular queue. If the player is queued with a pre-made team, the system will adjust the MMR of the team accordingly. In most cases, we have found pre-made teams out-perform teams composed of unconnected players.\n> Players have a separate MMR for each queue, each of which evolves independently from the others. This means that your wins and losses in Twisted Treeline won’t impact your MMR for Summoner’s Rift.\n> \n> Step 2: Determine eligible opponents:\n> \n> Initially, the system will only match players with similar MMR. As time passes, the system will very slowly broaden the MMR range it considers acceptable.\n> New players get some special protection and are usually matched against other new players, though this may result in a longer delay before finding a game.\n> \n> Step 3: Build a match:\n> \n> Eventually, the system will assemble a group of players with comparable MMRs and put the players into a game.\n\n---\n**Runes**\n\nI think we agree mostly here that runes are too expensive which is why we have tried to make the experience much better by A) Reducing tier 3 rune prices by 50% permanently and B) removing tier 1 runes and making tier 2 runes cost 1IP\n\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/starter-t3-runes-permanent-discount-2-weeks\nhttp://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/starter-tier-2-runes-go-1-ip-sale\n\n---\n**Masteries**\n\nI'm glad you like the new direction with Keystones. I personally think the new mastery system is way better than the old. Some players definitely enjoy just jumping in game and playing without worrying too much about masteries (like you). However there are also a lot of players that love the theory crafting aspect of masteries. I think in time we will continue to evolve the mastery system as we always have and hopefully find the right balance between players that just want to play and not worry about this stuff, vs players that want this extra point of theory crafting and customization.\n---\n**Hextech Crafting**\n\nSeems like out of all the points so far this is one you feel the most negative about.\n\nHeres a few questions from this [Q&A ](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/gameplay-balance/cuuOtBkZ-hextech-crafting-and-loot-qa)(you should read it as the people who created the system answered questions there)\n\n> **Are you not worried that you will loose a lot of money from adding these rewards? and what pushed you to actually implementing them?**\n> Great question! We don't try to maximize dollars earned, but rather find a win-win balance of Player Value and Riot Value. We wanted to improve rewards and progression within League of Legends and thought the loot and mastery reward systems would be a great way to give players cool content for playing League and performing well with a diverse group of champs. We are also trying to bring players some of the lowest price points and biggest discounts for purchased content, so players can more easily build their collections.\n> \n> **I own all the champions in the game. Can champion essence actually be used for anything for me**\n> We agree that getting stuff you can't use is not a great experience. We are working on something for players in this situation, but don't have any details to share at the moment.\n\nThere is a lot more insight there around Hextech crafting. Ultimately when we added this system it was a new way for our players to interact with LoL content. For the first time ever players could unlock cosmetic items without having to pay money. Try to think of it as a small bonus for playing and enjoying league of legends. We do hope that the experience of playing LoL is still the #1 reason you are playing and not just to collect rewards.\n---\n**Champion Mastery**\n\nMastery Levels 6 and 7 better emphasize skill by requiring S grades from matchmade games. We’re emphasizing a performance requirement alongside a dedication component (the time needed to unlock free chests or earn IP for champ shards or permanent loot) to build on the original system’s blend of skill and participation. Keep an eye out for a larger announcement soon!\n\nIt's one step in making champion essence and shards more meaningful (less useless to people who have all the champs)\n\nYou can read more about the system here - http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-610-notes#patch-champion-mastery\n---\n**Skins and RP**\n\nUnfortunately our system is different from Dota 2's where you can get different leggings,weapons,hats etc and mix and match. I don't know for sure but I have heard their most popular cosmetics are full sets but thats besides the point. I'm not sure if we have plans on moving away from selling a full skin vs selling gloves,leggings,hats,shoulders, weapons etc.\n\nBut what I can say is your second concern of investment is also another reason why we introduced hextech. We understand investing 1350RP for a high quality skin may seem like a big investment for some. Which is why through hextech crafting you can unlock skin tiers all the way up to ultimate (3250 rp). It's a much cheaper way to unlock content in our game, but you do lose agency to get cheaper content (kind of like mystery skins).\n\nAs for why the price was increased, we did explain the why in the post you linked and while RP is something we set and have control over, like it says in the quote below most of our costs are from NA (where the game is developed) which is why we are affected by global economic factors (as is any global company).\n\n> another factor we need to take into consideration is the exchange rate between local currencies and USD. **Because a big part of our costs come from the US, where the dollar continues to rise**, we need to consider prices relative to the US as well. Therefore, we have decided to raise prices in Australia to bring them back into balance with New Zealand and the US.\n\n---\nPlayer behaviour below in another comment because it looks like I've reached the post limit haha.","replies":[{"poster":"Maraudaur","date":"2016-05-19T05:55:06.642+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Player Behaviour\n\nTLDR: There is no silver bullet that solves negative behavior in online games.

You’ve assured me that there are some exciting improvements on the horizon. I understand there are limited resources and you've provided excellent context for the current state of play.\n\nI'm still not sold on the lack of sandbox mode, it is certainly a function the entire community has been requesting for a while (we all need {{champion:268}}  practice!) But, like you said, it comes down to resources. Hopefully the new client roll out will hold some surprises.\n\nThat being said, not having skill descriptions and videos up to date on the client seems a little, unprofessional. Kind of like a company changing branding but not updating its stationary. With a large project, like the MSU, this should have been taken into consideration. If players want information it should be at their fingertips through the client, rather than a third party.\n\nI was aware of the MMR system and it seems to be working. But, the skill level of unranked players tends to yo-yo quite a bit. Perhaps this will level out once I try my hand at ranked.\n\nYou’re absolutely right, I do have a pet hate for the Hex Tech Crafting. Please, take this as feedback. It seems that the restrictions were poorly designed. The reward system is great, but like I said, the chest content doesn't really warrant the restrictions, especially considering the RNG nature of content. If you set reward parameters they should be adhered to without restriction (except for those on toxic behaviour bans, they can die in a fire). The introduction of new champion mastery levels just highlighted how much the restrictions reduce this reward system.\n\nWhich brings me to the positive play rewards. Summoner icons are nice, but mostly meaningless. I have that latest one, but I also have a sweet Bloodmoon icon to use. Rewards need to be meaningful; otherwise no one cares if they miss out.\n\nThanks for the player behaviour links, they provided some good insights.\n\nI'm looking forward to the future of the game and hopefully in another 12 months I won’t have so many gripes.\n\nThanks again for taking the time to read and respond.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DipperOCE","date":"2016-05-18T09:17:53.068+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hahaha Riot listen to community's advice and criticism ahahahaha what are you mental?\n\nFor real though, if there is money involved feel free to tell them this wonderful idea!","replies":[]}]}
