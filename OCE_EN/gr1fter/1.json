(See link)\r\nHextech chests can be bought for RP, which is real money. According to this part of the proposed legislation, it would be illegal to offer them as they offer rewards based on chance.\r\n\r\n_‘Legislation could make it illegal for games to seek payment for items of varying value according to chance, as is the case in Japan.’_\r\n\r\nIMHO Hextech crafting is a form of gambling. You only need to look on YouTube to see hundreds of dollars getting dropped so players can get those exclusive skins. \r\n\r\nSo, the question needs to be asked. How would Riot respond to this new legislation if it came into effect?\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of options I can think of:\r\n\r\nLeague becoming and R18+ game\r\nHextech chests and keys being removed from the OCE store\r\n\r\nWhats is the policy in Japan seeing the restriction on 'chance' items?","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-08-05T11:37:33.599+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"**Firstly! **\nNever take any statement like that at face value, (Especially if its American!) Americans love to over exaggerate everything to make it more 'interesting to the masses' and they do so to a point that actually compromises the credibility of the information.\nThis opening statement of this 'article' is:\n_\"**Playing **highly popular shoot 'em up video games **will** be defined as gambling\"_ \nSo already we can question the validity of the article because under no circumstances is '_playing_' shoot 'em up games gambling, it also says 'Will' implying this is certain, yet it then goes on straight away to say that the senator 'wants' this and 'call for' this, so really, nothing is certain at all. \nSo already this article has given us 2 wrong pieces of information, and its still only the opening sentence! \n\n**Secondly. **\nGambling by definition revolves around '**Risk**' to gamble, you risk losing something, in the hope of obtaining something else. Without 'Risk' There IS no gambling.\nHextech chests don't 'Risk' anything, you 'buy' it. The definition between those two is important! When you buy something, there is no risk, you give away your money, and have no expectation of having it back. It is exactly like Knuuckles says; you buy a lucky dip, you don't gamble anything.","replies":[{"poster":"Varrakllek","date":"2017-04-27T16:38:43.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"That sounds like dodging the question by saying Americans exaggerate therefore my argument is better. What does being born on one continent or another have to do with ones own intellect or actions. Unless Riot games condone racism as well. Cause what this sounds like to me is obvious xenophobia. I'm not American but I don't judge someones argument based on their country of origin.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gr1fter","date":"2016-08-06T06:22:45.023+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey, thanks for your reply!\n\nThe article is from the Sydney Morning Herald, an Australian news paper, and the policy is being put forward by one of our elected officials (Nick Xenophon). At this moment the policy is merely a proposal, but it is something that games that offer _items of varying value _ in exchange for money will need to be aware of. That's the part I'm focusing on.\n\nAs for 'lucky dips',, they are a form of gambling. You're still putting up money in the hope of getting something desirable. In the case of Hextech chests you can get a champion shard for a champ you already own, which is essentially worthless, or an 1850 RP skin. You have no control over the reward and what value it has. It could be more or less than they money you put in. It's the same as putting a dollar on the Chocolate Wheel,.\n\nI can see from the responses that people's idea of what constitutes gambling differs. Which is fair enough. Hextech does not appear to be overtly gambling, but it is still encouraging us to give over money for a varying reward values. To me That is way more insidious. They have hidden rewards in these chests and put them behind various restrictions to squeeze money from players who might not normally put in.\n\nI'm not saying Riot and affiliated shouldn't do it, they have the right to run their business as they see fit. But, it will be interesting to see what changes may be forced if this kind of legislation is passed.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Knuuckles","date":"2016-08-05T08:50:11.471+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Gambling is putting something up with the possibility of getting nothing in return, hex tech crafting is more of a lucky dip","replies":[]},{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2016-08-05T06:33:52.163+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Its not gambling.
