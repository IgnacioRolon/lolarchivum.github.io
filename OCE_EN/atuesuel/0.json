The Overwatch lets the CS:GO community regulate itself by allowing qualified and experienced members of the community (' investigators ') to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. How does the Overwatch work?","url":"http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/","image":"http://media.steampowered.com/apps/csgo/blog/images/fb_image.png?v=5"},"up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi, This has more then likely been discussed before, but as i keep getting filled in solo/duo ranked matches with the same trolls in the passed 8 weeks, and its getting beyond the joke now. I&#039;ve been reporting the same people for AFK, griefing and verbal abuse. so my idea is we should look at the same idea what valve did with cs:go with implementing Overwatch, which helped out the community and take strain off of valve.","replies":[{"poster":"Slowingpluto730","date":"2018-11-30T23:23:35.610+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"{{champion:84}} {{champion:141}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-12-01T01:00:32.501+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Except the drama of population. CS:GO has a monthly pop of about 300,000. League of Legends according to the most recent stats I could find, has upwards of 70 million.\n\nPrograms like that work *fantastically* in smaller communities because it's easy to monitor and easy for Valve to have oversight. \n\nOn the scale of League? It's just no possible, and they can't just introduce it to the smaller servers, not only is it not fair to the larger servers, it also changes the standards of moderation drastically between servers. There are already minor differences depending on what certain regions class as highly offensive or okay, but such a system would create a dramatic shift.","replies":[]}]}
