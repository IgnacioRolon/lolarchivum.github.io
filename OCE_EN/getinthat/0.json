I don&#039;t care if I have to wait and extra 10 minutes for a game I want the roles I chose. If you can&#039;t get the roles you choose then why are we even giving you rolls that we prefer to play when we&#039;re going to get support riot? Autofill does nothing but make people lose games. When I get it, I get incredibly pissed off and do not play as well I do because of that. It seems like a billion dollar gaming company would understand that people play the game to play what they want. NOT FOR SOMEONE TO TELL THEM WHAT TO PLAY. This is by far the worst system in league of legends. So you give people support where they know they will not win, yet you punish them for leaving the que so the other players in the game don&#039;t lose solely because of them. How can you be so ignorant to what players want? How can you possibly think that a player would rather just get a game with a trash team ONLY because of autofill???? You say your tribunal system is cracking down on toxicity yet it&#039;s the same system that causes 99% of it. Do you think people are going to quit this game because they have to wait a few more minutes for a que? NO, it would be ignorant to think so. Do you think players will quit because they cannot play what they want? YES. Do you understand how hard it is to get out of bronze? Now, do you understand that bronze primarily loses games because an adc is incredibly fed. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS PATTERN KEEPS SHOWING UP??? Not because bot lane is bad, it&#039;s because the support literally has no clue what they&#039;re doing because they just got thrown in. You want to make the community as friendly as possible, yet you make people play roles they have no business playing because they do not have enough exp.","replies":[{"poster":"CHEESYLEEKS","date":"2017-03-02T00:14:10.824+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"auto fill doesn't work because players are ignorant babies.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-02T09:42:15.115+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"In my personal opinion I'm opposed to autofill because I play League semi-competitively, which means I play to win and also to have fun and when I'm not playing Top or Mid I'm not really having fun.

I thought League was suppose to be about having fun but no matter how many times I reflect my opinion on this subject it always ends in me apparently \"bitching\" just because I'm forced to have \"fun\" playing Bot and Jungle. And remind you I did have a team, I've been there and done that, and honestly after all that I just really prefer to run solo, or even duoing with a friend. And again, do I really have to be forced to play with a team to enjoy League? Almost feels like most of my privileges are taken away from me...","replies":[{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2017-03-02T19:49:27.236+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"It is a team game with different roles.\n\nIf you dont like playing different roles in a team, perhaps you might prefer a single player game.

Honestly auto fill makes life easier if you ask me. No pick order bullshit just play the role you were given and get over it quite simple really. Of people dont like that the answer is simple of you ask me. Just dont play ranked.","replies":[{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-03-03T04:00:54.158+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"Autofill wasn't the solution to the \"pick order bullshit\" the new role selection was, and before it was permanent it was only available to diamond+ where there were actually less players unlike bronze and silver where 90% of the playerbase is. With or without permanent autofill I've never had an issue with queue times so the whole thing is bullshit in my eyes. Also, I'd rather play ranked then deal with the stupid \"lane call in chat\" we have going in normals which is broken.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"LPQ AWOL","date":"2017-03-03T02:05:46.742+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"if you are forced to auto fill, just troll the fuck out of it, its not your fault you are forced into a roll you dont like, not cant play, but dont like, honestly auto fill is a set up for a loss and trolls,","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Klavinmour","date":"2017-03-02T08:32:52.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Funny, I seem to win every game that I get autofilled in.\n\nPerhaps it's because you're bad, and have a negative stigma on support, or any roll that doesn't let you play Yasuo and feed 30 kills on.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Haskill Sonnet","date":"2017-03-02T04:34:05.652+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's certainly made you toxic, or maybe that's just how you are?\n\n\nYes, it's frustrating to get a role you are not good at, but if you were auto-filled, it's likely someone on the enemy team was *also* auto-filled, meaning there is no net difference.\n\nFurther, people definitely do quite the game when queue times get too long. Especially newer players who are less invested.\n\nThe simple truth is these are pain-points that need to be balanced, auto-fill sucks, but is a necessary evil at some point, queue-time sucks but is also necessary. Of course, the easiest way for you to get around this pain point is to learn how to support.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-03-02T00:08:12.756+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah","replies":[]},{"poster":"George Of","date":"2017-03-02T00:40:19.272+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Literally came on to make this same post, I win the 2 games I get position guarantee on and then I get fucked by autofill with an adc that knows nothing.
