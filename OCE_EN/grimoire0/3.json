He instalocked but fcked up real bad in lane so he afk (We all thought that he afk). After the game, it shows that he&#039;s name was in red which means that he dced and probably start another game. BUT the strange thing is that there was no announcement (XXX player has disconnected) that he dced (not even in chat) during the game which make us think that he afk instead of dc. \r\n\r\nI remember this troll name in the past and he also leave that game. I was a bit surprised that after he left that game and got reported, he was still playing but this time without any announcement that he had left the game. So I was wondering if there was some sort of trick that people can use to constantly leave game without getting caught by the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Ing√©nue","date":"2016-04-06T03:12:29.831+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You still get caught by the system, no matter what you do.
