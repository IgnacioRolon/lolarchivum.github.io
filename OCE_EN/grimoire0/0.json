I have at least 3 times of experience of enemy flashing 0.5 sec later after i ulted them then they dont take damage even though garen did his ult animation and ult sound and the ult doesn&#039;t go on cooldown as if i never press it before. I never have this problem with other point and click ult such as darius ult. Anyone else have this experience?
