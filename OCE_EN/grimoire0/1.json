Then when the battle starts I realise I couldn&#039;t use my skill because i can&#039;t left click (my champion skill is a point and click champion). Everytime i left click, it pings. I tried quick casting my skill but it still pings but this time I can use my skill. Its awful for me and my team because of so much pings coming from me. I also couldn&#039;t type which I dunno why. Nothing happens when I press ENTER. Then I realise that I couldn&#039;t even shop so I&#039;m stuck with my starting item. In the end we lost of course and my team called me a troll. \r\n\r\nI once played a match where one of the enemy only have his starting item and nothing else. I&#039;m guessing that he have the same problem as me and couldn&#039;t shop because of that. He also didn&#039;t talk at all in that game.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and I you have a better day than me.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-29T00:03:26.497+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sounds like your Control or Alt key is stuck or something.","replies":[{"poster":"IngÃ©nue","date":"2016-02-29T04:02:27.482+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=oUu0zwFM,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-02-29T00:03:26.497+0000)\n>\n> Sounds like your Control or Alt key is stuck or something.\n\nThis is probably it, happens to me all the time. To fix it next time, just tab out then back in. If that doesn't work, restart the client.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Zorphiax","date":"2016-02-29T07:52:07.189+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I play LoL on a laptop 90% of the time and this happens to me a lot.
