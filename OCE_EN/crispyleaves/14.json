She is somewhat harder to learn than most ADCs.\n\nVayne is kinda the ADC that an assassin mains generally would LIKE to play well, but learning a new ADC isn't anywhere near as fun as say learning champs like Zed, Yasuo, Fizz. If you have mained another ADC, adjusting the play style from one ADC to another doesn't take that long, but to be considered a \"good\" ADC from playing another role requires SHITLOADS of practice. Like last-hiting without items/runes, figuring out how to orb walk/kite without accidentally cancelling AA because all champs have a different AA timer, and some skins on the same champion change where/what/when AA look like even though it is meant to be the same. Macro stuff like knowing item spikes vs other ADCs, build/skill orders (Vayne now has loads of build orders thanks to double Zeal, new Triforce, Rageblade, and even can go smite Bloodrazer), who and how to 1v1, map pressure/split push scenarios and keeping track of enemies who are carrying pink wards(you aren't point-click TARGETABLE in red sweeper, but you are still visible).\n\nWith Vayne, people use dragonslayer skin mostly because it has the smoothest AA animation and is easier to learn orb walking with, so we don't know if Soulstealer Vayne has a more responsive, more fluid AA animation even compared to her base skin which is considered 2nd best for AA fluidity, so I don't know if using the skin to learn these sort of things is better or not.\n\nOr you could just throw out everything I have just said and play her Top, and practice ranged-melee matchups. \nLike a scumbag.","replies":[]}]}
