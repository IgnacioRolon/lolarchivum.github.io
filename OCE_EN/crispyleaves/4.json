I gave up syndra for a couple of months because i didnt see the point in her. But about mid-season i realised she was still worth playing, she just required a different playstyle. I continued to do what syndra did, although her stun was much harder to hit. And with the addition of ludens echo and the nerf of assasins it was all looking quite good. But as im climbing to gold, i have realised that there are much better options than syndra. If I want to crush in lane, leblanc would be better. Ahri is more mobile and offers more roaming potential. Cassiopeia is better for constant damage output. And finally i now realise why syndra has such a low win rate. She just gets outscaled by everyone else. And what riot meant to be a balance became more just like a squash. \r\nI got really excited when i heard syndra was getting buffed in the recent patch. I hopped on my computer straight after school to see what was going on. And more mana/lvl is still quite good, but it wasnt what i was going for. If you want to be a lane dominant syndra you have to use all your mana early still. \r\nI dont want syndra to become a yorick riot, it is time now for the most lane dominant champion in season 4 to come back. And i dont mean buff all her abilities, i think the balance to her E hitbox was quite reasonable. I would like her early game damage to come back, to be able to verse LeBlanc without starting crystalline flask. you nerfed syndra too many times, indirectly and directly. And her lore clearly states she is an omnipotent mage, not a derelict bunch of abilities. \r\n\r\nI think the start of season 6 should be the start of a new day for syndra, one where her former glory can be revoked. Where she would be picked in draft mode because she will &#039;outscale&#039; other champions. After all, when all the other burst mages nerfed in the same patch, such as veigar, are coming back. We will need the dark sovereign to save the mid lane.\r\n\r\n{{champion:134}}","replies":[]}
