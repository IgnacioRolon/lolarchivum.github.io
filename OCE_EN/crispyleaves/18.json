The previous problem with AP marksmen {{champion:10}} {{champion:17}} is they can not critically strike. So instead, she has other ways of killing tanks in her kit. Much like Vayne, Leina has a weak laning phase with not much ability to poke. But is rewarded with a hyper carry late game. If played correctly, Leina will be able to run around teamfights deleting people without being able to be pinned down. \r\n\r\nPassive - A Guardians Weapon\r\nLeina carries an ancient relic, an ornate wooden bow. Every time Leina auto attacks, her bow fires 3 extra bullets rapidly, dealing small magic damage with each bullet (Scaling off Ability Power). Additionally, every time Leina auto attacks she is given a stack of _A Guardians Weapon_, increasing her attack speed by 4%. This stacks 5 times for a maximum 20% increase attack speed (resets after 3 seconds of not attacking)\r\n\r\nQ - The Forest&#039;s Assailment \r\nLeina nimbly dashes forward a small distance, this can not pass terrain. But it resets her auto attack timer.\r\n\r\nW - Wisp of the wild\r\nLeina passively deals extra damage to targets with higher current health than her (3% for every 250 health, maxing at 12% increased damage)\r\nEvery time Leina auto attacks, her movement speed is increased by 20, this stacks 5 times and resets after 3 seconds of not attacking. \r\n\r\nE - Tenatious Undergrowth\r\nLeina roots a target for a small amount of time and deals moderate magic damage (the duration scales off her maximum attack speed)\r\n\r\nR - The Wandering Forest&#039;s Blessing\r\nLeina blesses herself in the name of the wandering forest, giving her additional buffs on her other abilities for 8 seconds.\r\n\r\nPassive - Basic attacks give Leina 2 stacks of a Guardians Weapon and max at 6 stacks. \r\nDamage from _A Guardians Weapon_ deal 4% of the targets maximum health in extra magic damage. \r\n\r\nQ - Resets the cooldown to 2/1.5/1 second regardless of CDR\r\n\r\nReccomended build:\r\n\r\nEssential: {{item:3157}} {{item:3006}} {{item:3115}} \r\n\r\nOffensive: {{item:3020}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3124}} \r\n\r\nSituational: {{item:3116}} {{item:3027}} {{item:3146}} {{item:3151}} \r\n\r\nIf you have any reccomendations on how to balance her please comment, it only helps me do something differently.","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-01-08T07:39:41.408+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Her passive sounds like a Lulu passive with Wit's End attack speed passive applied.\nAlso, as a marksman, she should have more damaging abilities.\nIf you've noticed, e is usually the dash on champions, not q.\nI like the concept, but a bit underpowered and gameplay would be hard.","replies":[]}]}
