I can see why it can have counterplay, but on the main scheme of things it is an extremely unfair item. \n\nLets look at Syndra for a moment.{{champion:134}} \n\nSyndra was really strong in season 3-4, i agree she needed a nerf to her E. But lets look through the other things you have done.\nDirect Nerf to Q and Passive\nTank/Juggernaut meta distruction\nNerf to AP items\nBuff to MR items\n_Removal of DFG_\nAnd now, Duskblade?\n\nMy question is Riot, if it is too hard to balance DFG. Why on Earth would you introduce Duskblade. Now as many of you know, people have been leaving league of legends by the hundreds. I know this exactly because a whole group of my friends (11 in total) moved on because _League of Legends isn&#039;t fun anymore_. And the reason is, you have exploited parts of the game that don&#039;t need exploiting. And you have changed the game too far into the competitive scene. The only thing you have done for casual gamers is introduce dynamic queue, which is apparently supposed to _&#039;Get casual gamers more interested in competitive play&#039;_.\n\nAnd why would you do this, if you are taking away items such as Sword of the Occult, DFG. And then introducing an item, that effectively shuts down every single AP mage out there, Why wouldnt you be doing something in counter to that?\n\nThis is not only a plea, but a message of warning for riot.\n\nPeople are going to start leaving your game unless you start balancing it in the right ways for the broader community.\nI also think its unfair for AP mages to be so drastically nerfed, so i would suggest either remove Duskblade,\n_or bring back DeathFire Grasp._\n\nLeague of legends wouldn&#039;t be here if it weren&#039;t for changes. I really like the update to Marksman, and i am looking forward to the changes to immobile mages. \nBut Riot, \nplease\nthis is a step backward.","replies":[{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-04-02T06:57:51.201+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"and guess what, that item requires you to be below 10% hp for it to actually do any damage\n\nunlike dfg, duskblade isnt broken.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-11T04:10:03.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Doesn't seem too bad so far.

I was finally getting into a groove of S6, adapting to the changes and how to approach the game, then this unwarranted and ridiculous item is introduced making AD assassins such as talon and zed even more snowbally. And I don't care if AD assassins couldn't shred tanks. That was their counter play. Counter play is good for the game. This item solves that but also means AD assassins will blow up everyone else even faster. Now there is literally no downside or counter play to AD assassins.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-02-11T03:55:41.707+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Duskblade is an interesting item.

The new item (to the best of my understanding) is essentially an experiment in buffing those who have struggled in the recent tank heavy meta. It has it's problems sure, but so do a lot of things. It's a lot harder than you'd think to balance any one thing, the ripple effects they can have can cause a lot of other problems down the line, but Riot also has a responsibility to provide new and exciting content for us.\n\nAs for APCs falling to the wayside a bit, yes, it's happened, but that is why the next large scale update is going to be for mages, just as we have seen for juggernauts and marksmen. Not to mention there are some APCs who are still very relevant (like Brand and Vel'Koz).\n\nThe player turnover for a game like League will also vary from time to time. There are just as many people coming in as there might be leaving, and the game is continuing to grow. The fact that the game is evolving so dramatically is a sign that it is thriving, but there will always be people who have played for a long time and prefer the way things were done in the past. There's nothing wrong with that, but if they can no longer enjoy the game then that is unfortunate.\n\nIt's sad to see people move on from the game they've spent so much time with sure, but they will find other games to enjoy, and someone else will discover LoL, it's the natural cycle of any MMO really.","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-02-10T09:46:44.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Okay true, what i first said may be a bit hyperbolized. \n\nBut what i am seriously concerned about, and the same problem that has plagued me ever since syndra got dumpstered in early season 5. Is that Riot has directly nerfed champions that are getting indirect nerfs too. They have a full building of game designers, and yet _no one has mentioned the equally good effects of indirect nerfing without the need of direct nerfs too._\n\nI know Riot has said many things about people hopping on the META boat and stuff. But i feel like one of the largest groups of champions are being totally neglected at the moment. Who knows, i probably could be in platinum right now. But Jinx, my main adc, is being outscaled because she missed out on the big rework. Syndra, Cassiopeia, Anivia, Katarina (just to name a few) are being completely neglected after receiving multiple nerfs to all of them, with the removal and nerfs of key AP items. And i was just a bit outraged, that after all these changes that i had to get used to. I had to completely change my syndra style to suit the needs of the new meta. Riot is introducing a new item that will just dumpster AP mages and ADCs even more. Its great for zed players i mean, but i just feel that as a player who has to focus extreemmely hard to win against Zed in lane. Its a bit too powerful to champions that were already pretty fine. I mean if you want to get Assassins back in META, just do something else, buff AP assassin items. Its not even going to matter to people like Katarina and Akali. They just need to realise in my opinion, that some Assassins are already where they want them to be. So dont go buffing Assassins in general, they are all at different stages. And maybe in a couple of Months, when mages get their massive buffs. They could release the item to _Indirectly tone down the mages that are pretty strong_. I just wanted this message to be a big waver to Riot, comparing Duskblade to DFG. And i want them to think about maybe planning their releases and tones a bit better to manage champions a bit better. \n\nI would also like to have a small moment of silence to mourn the fact that Syndra currently has a lower win rate than Yorick.\n\nRiot, if you are reading this. Please consider who you are _really_ buffing, and not who the target buff is actually at.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-10T10:07:58.275+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I hear you, and I'm not a very mid laner myself, so trying to vs champs like Zed is very difficult for me, so believe me when I say I feel your pain.\n\nAs far as the new item, all I can suggest is see how it goes, if they feel it is too strong, Riot will nerf it. If mid is not want you want it to be atm you could also maybe try some other roles while you wait for the mage update, though I'm sure that's not what you want to hear.\n\nBelieve me when I say Riot doesn't do anything just to dick us around, they always have a reason, they just can't always tell us for a multitude of different reasons. Sometimes it's because they're privy to information that we don't have, and sometimes they just don't have the time to articulate properly what their position is on any give issue.. They try their best in the red posts, and I would recommend checking out the [Dev Corner](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner) as it can sometimes provide insight into these kinds of changes from Riot themselves.\n\nAs for the Yorick comment, I would think that his statistics would be very skewed because of the very small percentage of games he is played in, so maybe you can take that as some comfort. I quite enjoy Syndra myself, and tend to play either her or Ahri when I do end up in mid lane, and it is sad to see that she isn't in a very good spot. Unfortunately though theres how many champs now? 129? It's hard to balance for them all, and a bad idea to do too much too quickly (with the exception of planned large scale changes that are better to get over and done with), so some champions will always seem to be forgotten.\n\nAs a personal suggestion, I would recommend trying Vel'koz in mid. He is pretty relevant in the current state of the game, and decently strong (sometimes I wonder if he's bordering on OP in some matchups :P). He's also a lot of fun to play, and has a similar-ish playstyle to Syndra imo. Not super high on the mobility, but with incredibly powerful CC potential and an amazing ult experience. Also angles are fun :3 But that's jsut my feeling.\n\nI'm sorry you're having to struggle with this, but have hope that the mage update will fix a lot of the problems you've been seeing with APCs :)","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-10T16:18:51.702+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you heard the random powerless forum-poster riot, do as he says because hes written so much nobody wants to read it but its obviously super important and knawlidgeabull lyk omg\n\nok just 1 response i have to do\n\"People are going to start leaving your game unless you start balancing it in the right ways for the broader community\"\n......................\nso you've been playing since occult sword and even DFG, yet you're not even aware that riot has been balancing for nearly 7 fucking years? and each and everytime (for the most part) most people can actually agree that their changes are for the better. all those that dont agree usually have a fixation with whatever certain niche choice of gameplay, so someone that preferred playing a champion, playing champions that do well with a single item, champions that do well with a certain mastery they may consider OP. if any of those niches got nerfed they will give a biased opinion like \"NO KASSADIN IS NOT OP\" \"NO FROZEN HEART IS NOT TOO STRONG, ESPECIALLY WITH OPPRESSION/OPPRESSOR MASTERY\"\n\npoint is if you wanna win, understand whats strong, whats meta, whats decent against the meta. this changes constantly, you work your gameplay around it, and hopefully you'd have fun in the meantime, unless its your job. if you're not having fun and dont care about winning, you stop playing","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-02-10T07:43:22.027+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Uuggghhh its so frustrating!!!!
