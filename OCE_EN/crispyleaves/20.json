{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-11-30T05:28:49.772+0000","title":"Adhara - The Sand's Endowment","subforum":"Player Creations","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":"Im making art for her at the moment it will be out soon dw. \r\n\r\nAdhara is intended to play as a mid or top lane mage, focusing on picking off a single target whilst bringing lots of cc to the rest of the team. She has quite a weak early lane, until she gets her passive rolling. But once late game is a formidable opponent, not just in 1v1 but in teamfight situations as well. \r\n\r\nAdhara is Azir&#039;s sister, and when Azir was resurrected so was she. He abandoned her when she was young to become the emperor of the lands. And she seeks to gain power through the league of legends to one day overthrow him. He promised he would come back for her as she stood their dying at the door of an orphanage, but he never did. And she has spent her whole 2 lives dedicated to seek revenge. This is why in her passive includes a particular revenge strategy, but i will let you get to that later. \r\n\r\nI have worked really hard at trying to balance her, but if you have any more suggestions feel free to comment below.\r\n\r\nPassive - Desert&#039;s Blessing\r\nEvery time Adhara kills a unit, she gains stacks of Desert&#039;s Blessing. \r\n1 for minion kills, \r\n3 for seige minions and neutral buffs,\r\n5 for champions, Dragon, Baron and Rift Herald. \r\n\r\nAt certain amounts of stacks she gains certain bonuses.\r\n25 Stacks - Bonus Magic damage on auto attacks.\r\n50 Stacks - 40 Movespeed and 50% Increase health and mana regen while in river.\r\n100 Stacks - 10% increase damage to the person who last killed you (Resets upon revenge)\r\n200 Stacks - 20% increase ability power\r\n\r\nAs a result of the OP of this passive, Adhara will have rather low scalings. This means she will have to play like veigar or nasus, slowly waiting out late game.\r\n\r\n Q - Sand Flow\r\nAdhara sends a whiff of sand in a line dealing magic damage (This skillshot is rather like Viktor laser, almost exactly the same). This is her primary damage ability, and i would recommend maxing first.\r\n\r\nW - Shuriman Incantation\r\nAdhara bonds herself to a target enemy, dealing initial damage. If she remains bonded without the target walking out of range for 2.5 seconds. They are afflicted with a Shuriman Incantation Debuff for 2.5 seconds, slowing them and increasing Adhara&#039;s magic damage to this target by 25%. \r\n\r\nE - Spiteful Assailment\r\nAdhara shields herself or a target ally for 5 seconds, if this shield is broken Adhara or the target ally are blessed with 70% tenacity for 1.5 seconds, break free from any existing cc and gain movement speed based off the shields duration (So if the shield was only on the target for half a second, the movespeed bonus wouldnt be very much, but if it takes the full 5 seconds to be proc&#039;d, the movespeed bonus would be a lot) \r\n\r\nR - Zephyr of the dunes\r\nAdhara, after a brief animation brings forth a fearsome gale. Knocking all units in a target direction (this includes allies), and damages all enemies significantly. If an enemy collides with terrain, they are briefly slowed and have their magic resist reduced. (Important to note, quite like cassiopeia or orianna ulti, this animation can be cast before flash so when you flash into the middle of the enemy team it sends them flying almost instantly) \r\n\r\nSome trading combinations in lane would be:\r\nW for damage increase\r\nQ for the slow\r\nPassive auto attack for magic damage\r\n\r\nTeamfight, you could either flash into the enemy team or apply your shield to yourself to grant you tenacity. Then walk into the enemy team and ulti towards terrain. This could also be used as a disengage or as a forceful re-engage. \r\n\r\nItem Suggestions:\r\n\r\nEssential:\r\n{{item:3020}} {{item:3157}} {{item:3027}} \r\n\r\nLater game:\r\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3100}} \r\n\r\nSituational:\r\n{{item:3285}} {{item:3001}} {{item:3165}} {{item:3102}} \r\n\r\nI wanted Adhara to be a high utility, high skill requiring champion.
