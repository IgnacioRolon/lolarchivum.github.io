Back when they were created riot didnt have the technology or the resources to recolour their effects and change their splasharts. For the most part, these old skins are just recolours of the original game model and splash art. I think it would be hella cool if people lucky enough to own something like Silver Kayle or Human Ryze had something else to look forward to than comments about how rare it is. Why cant we make these skins really cool to see in game too? You could spend a couple of dollars and get a better looking skin than these 5 year old treasures. And it would make people who own these skins feel a lot more inclined to use them. Just a thought.\r\n{{champion:10}}  {{champion:13}}","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-03T01:02:01.504+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"legacy skins aren't rare.\nyou're thinking of limited ones.","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-04-03T05:42:20.942+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=A steezy Scizor,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eYuKgyYt,comment-id=0002,timestamp=2016-04-03T01:02:01.504+0000)\n>\n> legacy skins aren't rare.\n> you're thinking of limited ones.\n\ntrue, but they often are the same thing","replies":[{"poster":"A steezy Scizor","date":"2016-04-03T06:36:39.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrispyLeaves,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eYuKgyYt,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-04-03T05:42:20.942+0000)\n>\n> true, but they often are the same thing\n\nno, they're not. a skin cannot be a legacy skin and a limited skin at the same time.\na legacy skin comes back whenever riot opens the legacy vault, and can always be obtained from a mystery gift.\na limited skin is available once, and only once, and cannot be obtained via mystery gift, for example, championship riven or urfwick.","replies":[]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-04-03T05:46:41.245+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrispyLeaves,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=eYuKgyYt,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2016-04-03T05:42:20.942+0000)\n>\n> true, but they often are the same thing\n\nKind of. A lot of Limited Skins got turned into Legacy Skins, so now Limited and Legacy are much clearer in what they are and definitely not the same thing.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"SkarSkarSkarner","date":"2016-04-02T07:23:44.517+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Human Ryze would have been updated when they updated him and all his skins.
