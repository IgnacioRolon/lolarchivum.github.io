Just as there was pooling at the end of high diamond before Riot added Master. I think it would be smart to add a rank that is the equivilent of &#039;the ground&#039; where there arent divisions. This would make it easier for people starting ranked because it gives them a clear place to start. Dynamic queue has also devalued the worth of ranks, so adding the league before bronze would not only make it easier for people starting the ranking system, it would also increase the value for ranks all the way up. I also feel as though the Victorious Skin should be available for Platinum+, because when victorious skins were first added gold made up the minority of players. These days Gold and higher is extremely common. \r\n\r\nThis is how it would work\r\nChallenger    (Pools) - Victorious + Border + Icon\r\nMaster          (Pools) - Victorious + Border + Icon\r\nDiamond        (Tiers) - Victorious + Border + Icon\r\nPlatinum        (Tiers) - Victorious + Border + Icon\r\nGold               (Tiers) - Border + Icon\r\nSilver              (Tiers) - Border + Icon\r\nBronze           (Tiers) - Icon\r\nInitiates        (Pools) - This name could change i made it up just then\r\n\r\nThis could improve the overall reward out of playing Ranked because i feel like the current ranking system is a bit outdated (3 years old, Geez). It would also help new players find their footing and see where exactly they need to go to move up in Rank.","replies":[]}
