I have always wanted to do something involving the creation of a game. The boards is not the best place to do this but, if any rioter is worried about copyright or legal quandries please feel free to know that I will not mind at all if you use one of my ideas for an actual in game product. I say this because i saw that this was riot&#039;s \nmain concern when using in game design from the forums. I have put a lot of effort into this project, the only thing I haven&#039;t tried is the artwork. This is mainly because i am a potato when it comes to art. But I can describe what it \nlooks like and what the abilities look like in words. \n\nOh yeah and the new Hextech Skin, thats a clickbait sorry. (Because no one clicks on champion ideas anymore).\n\n\nOKAY BEHOLD MY LATEST CREATION\n\n\n\nRosa - The Hextech Electrician (Okay look, it has something to do with hextech)\n\n\nPassive: Short Circuit\nWhen an enemy champion is damaged by a _positive_ and a **negative** electric current, they are shortcircuited, causing them to take magic damage equal to 100-250 (+15% of ability power). Once an enemy champion has been shortcircuited, they can not be short circuited again for 10/5/3 seconds. \n\nAnimation: I want Rosa&#039;s abilities to really look like flooding electricity everywhere. We all know when people have got the positive and negative ends of a current together and it makes a tonne of sparks? Yeah, So when a target is afflicted with Rosa&#039;s passive I was imagining the same &#039;zap&#039; sound with sparks flying etc.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nQ Ability: Electrical Arch\nAfter a brief windup, Rosa fires a _positively_ charged electrical bolt in a target direction, damaging the first enemy hit for 90-300 (+40% of ability power). If the target is taking damage from Rosa&#039;s E ability, her Q ability stuns.  \n\nAnimation: You know when electricity is flowing between two places but has not been given a conductor to pass through, it creates an arch? I wanted to replicate that kind of animation with Rosa&#039;s Q ability. \n\n~~~~~~~\n\nW Ability: Electromagnetic pulse\nRosa fires a high voltage canister to a target location. When the taser reaches the location, it pulses. When it pulses, it deals positive energy and 20-100 (+5% of ability power) and briefly blinds all targets within its radius.  \n\nI wanted Rosa to have some level of difficulty, and using her W is one of the main ways this is done. A good Rosa will be able to use her abilities in specific order to be able to utilize her passive. Also I wanted Rosa to have a way of getting out of ganks. \n\nAnimation: I want this to look like a more firey version of Jayce Q.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nE Ability: Electrical Rift\nRosa creates a zone (I want it to be the same as Zyra Q) of unstable **negative** charge, after a brief delay this zone explodes dealing 50-150 (+15% of ability power) as initial magic damage. Targets hit by Rosa&#039;s E then are charged with unstable **negative** energy, dealing 50-150 (+20% of ability power) as magic damage over 3 seconds. During this time, they are susceptable to Rosa&#039;s stun from her Q.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nR Ability: St Elmos Fire\nRosa fires a massive bolt of St Elmo&#039;s fire in a target direction. If this bolt intercepts with an enemy unit, it deals 150/200/300 (+40% of ability power) as magic damage. It then sends a _positively_ charged bolt and a **negatively** charged bolt of energy to the two nearest units, these bolts deal the same damage as the first target and then split into two _positive_ charged bolts and two **negative** charged bolts that go to their nearest two units. The electrical bolts can split a maximum of 6 times, but a target can only be hit 3 times, taking 30% damage from the second and third bolts. \n\nI wanted a really big ability to emphasize the importance of Rosa&#039;s passive, and create chaos in a teamfight. \n\nAnimation: Have any of you guys seen St Elmo&#039;s Fire? If not, it is a phenomenon experienced in aeroplanes where the friction creates static electricity so bright that it can be seen as lightning-like bolts flapping around the windscreen infront of the pilots. It truly is an amazing sight (My dad is a pilot so i have seen it before). I want it to look like that.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nI hope you guys like it, if you made it this far maybe just have another good read of the abilities because I tried to make a lot of interactions. If you have any feedback please put it below, and if you are a rioter PLEASE TELL YOUR LOVELY RIOTY FRIENDS THAT I AM HERE. And if you want to see more of my ideas please vote up, because thats the only way im gonna be recognized. And if you are good at art please teach me xD. \n\nCrispy out","replies":[{"poster":"Yazo","date":"2016-07-10T09:11:54.814+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"When a player is more creative than riot.","replies":[]},{"poster":"shadowalien13","date":"2016-07-10T08:41:47.460+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Maybe add some AD scaling in here so that hectech gunblade would be a core item - it would fit with Rosa's theme and the animation/particles would fit too.
