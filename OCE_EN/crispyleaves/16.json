Its rotten reek threatens to penetrate the dear hearts of the children roaming the streets in the morning, but Ahri is not na&iuml;ve, she too was once innocent. Long had been those days, although, for Ahri lived no longer the life she was born unto. \n\nAlthough in a dark alleyway, Ahri stood tall. Surrounded by rubbish bins, mildew, the dead body of her most recent victim crumpled in a heap. But what had her attention was an old mirror resting on the wall; its grand bevelled edges cast odd shades of blood red moonlight through the dark alley. All was silent in that moment. The dead body lying next to Ahri added no more sound than the rest of the scene, yet it&rsquo;s stillness added a silence that reverberated off the brick walls. Ahri&rsquo;s gaze rested on her reflection in the mirror, stunning she was. Her beautiful bold eyes seemed incandescent in the dark night sky. But her beautifully tailored dress that adorned her petite frame was torn, and her hair that was normally tucked neatly behind her ears rested tangled on her chest. What happened to Ahri that night was not out of the ordinary. To Ahri, life was just a blur of unidentifiable faces, and animal instincts. \n\n______________________________\n\nIt was just past sunset in Ionia on the dawn of the new year. Oranges and Pinks still streaked the sky, but the misty hand of the night was starting to slowly wrap itself around the land. Turning the beautiful turquoise above, into the merciless nocturne. Saving the land, from the grasp of the darkness, was the beautiful shine of the moon. It&rsquo;s pure silver elegance piercing through the sultry. Although the moon was now out of it&rsquo;s daytime slumber, in only a few hours the moon would be inhibited by dark magic.\n\nTonight, was a blood moon.\n\nAhri&rsquo;s nine tails waved gracefully as she walked through the throngs of celebrators. Bright red costumes embellished the bodies of many people, but not Ahri. She sought one thing, and one thing only. The beautiful orb she carried in one hand was seeking for blood. Tonight, was the perfect night to do that. As the blood moon inhibited the moons mighty light, darkness would shroud the city. Only then, would Ahri be able to slay her target. \n\nShe had been calmly walking for several hours before she saw a man walking by himself; his gaze was unsteady, all over the place did his eyes stare. \n\nA perfect target\n\nAs Ahri walked over, the man stopped in his position and looked up at the stars. Still gazing upwards, he smiled gently as Ahri opened her mouth to talk.\n&lsquo;Excuse me&rsquo; Ahri asked politely, making sure to pivot her hips to show her brilliant curves &lsquo;I think I need help with directions&rsquo;.\nThe man glanced down to look at Ahri's eyes, at her feet, then to her hips and pelvis, and then finally looked up to her beautiful golden eyes again.\n&lsquo;Sure, I have nothing to be doing anyway&rsquo; the man replied calmly. For the first time in years, Ahri was hit with a sense of attraction. She had never felt the warm force tugging on her delicate heart, so she did not recognize it.\n&lsquo;I was trying to find where Rylai&rsquo;s Alleyway was located&rsquo; She stumbled trying to find the words.\n&lsquo;Oh, lord I have no idea where that is&rsquo; the man replied laughing. His deep voice pulled Ahri further in, not only that, his jawline was sharp enough to cut through her fragile soul.\n&lsquo;Would you mind coming with me&rsquo; She stuttered \n\n_'Maybe try finding another person'_ a human voice in her head beckoned, but her animal instincts forced her to continue. Once again, Ahri was torn.\n\n&lsquo;Sure, I mean, where do we start?&rsquo;\n\n___________________________________\n\nAhri&rsquo;s small physique stood tiny next to the broad-shouldered man. His relaxed voice calmed Ahri, but her life without knowing the touch of someones compassion spared her from immersing herself in his kind soul. She followed him everywhere, her nine tails gracefully flouncing behind her. The longer she stayed with him, the more she longed to spare his mundane soul to find a more suitable target. Human voices rang through her head\n\n_You will regret killing him, Ahri_\n\n_You are nothing but a wild animal!_\n\n&lsquo;Is everything okay&rsquo; the man asked tentatively.\nAhri noticed that she had stopped, staring at a fountain. A large gargoyle sat atop a pedestal, eternally spitting algae filled water into its surrounding lake. \n&lsquo;No, everything is fine&rsquo; She replied shakily &lsquo;I just don&rsquo;t like wild animals&rsquo;. \nAhri and her companion rounded a corner, brushing past people drinking bright red wine. Ahri thought of how much she longed the taste of blood. She looked over to the man and imagined the bright red liquid pouring out of his neck. Her thoughts repulsed her, her hands that she was tugging at the hems of her dress with grew sweaty. Ahri looked up at the moon, a small sliver of red was appearing at one side of it.\n\nWhat Ahri feared was going to happen.\n\nAhri took another look at her companion. Calm he looked, as he locked his eyes on something in the distance.\n&lsquo;Rylai&rsquo;s lane!&rsquo; he pointed in the direction he was looking. \n\n_Don&rsquo;t do it Ahri_\n\nThe couple walked up to the entrance of the lane.\n\n_He doesn&rsquo;t deserve this_\n\n&lsquo;Can you come with me, it&rsquo;s a bit dark&rsquo; She asked as she looked at him.\n&lsquo;Sure&rsquo; he replied\n\n_Spare him!_\n\nAhri stared at her shadow in the floor of the alley as she walked. At the edge of the shadow, the white light from the moon was turning pink. She whipped around to take a look at the moon in the distance. It had half turned red.\n\n_Let him go, Ahri_\n\n&lsquo;I have always loved the blood moon&rsquo; exclaimed the man. His beautiful hazel eyes that had previously looked all over the place had calmed down. His innocuous gaze was set in the distance.\n\n_You are an animal, Ahri_\n\nA sanguine rush filled Ahri's veins. Her eyes flared fluorescent red as she turned back to her companion. \n\n_You are a murderer!_\n\nShe felt the calming caress of her orb as it beckoned for the man. Her arm poised behind her as she cried in protest. The man put his arms in the air as he realised what he had fallen for. \n\n&#039;Wait, don&#039;t!&#039;\n&lsquo;I am so sorry&rsquo; She sobbed\n\nThe mans cry of pain deafened her delicate ears as she plunged the orb straight into his chest. His knees buckled as the life poured out of his eyes. Ahri&rsquo;s orb returned to her hand, its thirst had been sated for a short time. She stood in horror as the man crumpled in a heap on the ground. \n\nAhri screamed at the top of her lungs as she fell to her knees. She put her hands up to her face as she leant down to the ground and let out another bloodcurdling scream. Her frantic cries filled the alleyway with terror, pain from her heart shuddered through her body. The humidity of the night was drowned out by the freezing cold radiating from her soul.\n\n_You are nothing but an animal_\n\nTo Ahri, it seemed like an eternity had passed before her vile screams turned into sobs, then her sobs into heavy breaths. She put one of her bloodied hands on her knee and slowly stood up. As soon as she stood up, she froze. Her blood red eyes locked in front of her, where a large mirror was resting on the wall. \n\nBut in her reflection she did not see Ahri.\n\nLike a teenage girl, unimpressed by her physique, Ahri only saw a fierce animal.\n\nA single tear fell from her face as she stared into the mirror, in the red light, the tear almost looked like blood.\n\n_____________________________________\n\n_She has an odd number of tails, nine\nTo keep her soul following a path\nBut to slay a creature that kills so fine\nOne must split her whole soul in half_","replies":[{"poster":"Oneechan","date":"2016-07-10T08:15:11.749+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Daaaamn, this is nice.
