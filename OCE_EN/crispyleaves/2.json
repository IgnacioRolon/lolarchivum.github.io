Although it is an okay idea to get casual players involved in ranked, it is at the cost of several things. These things include Rank Value, Player Enjoyment and changes to competitive play. And League of Legends will fall off because of all these negative points that come from dynamic queue. \r\n\r\nLets start at rank value, many players are very happy with their ranks at the moment. And a lot of players work hard to achieve their desired border. But with the implementation of dynamic queue, these ranks will become increasingly worthless due to the rise of player elo. Take heroes of the storm as an example, another MOBA very similar to league. It was released with dynamic queue, and very quickly the top rank (rank 1) became worthless as every player just queued with their friends. This will cause many people to leave league of legends because their current league will not have the same value. \r\n\r\nPlayer Enjoyment is perhaps the most important part of a game. But with the implementation of dynamic queue, players will not be enjoying themselves. Particularly when there is a dynamic team of 4. Because there will always be one stranger. Now, particularly in League of Legends, where the community is renowned for being very salty it is noticable that salty players are often seen in packs of other salty players. And especially for the other person, it will not be enjoyable to play. Especially if you _Clicked the button for SoloQ_. This will cause players to leave because they will not find the game fun anymore.\r\n\r\nLastly, this movement will have a huge impact on competitive play, because the majority of the playerbase are competitive. And ranked is a place where people are meant to be competitive, so making it more casual just doesnt make sense. One of the big reasons WoW doesnt have as many players as it used to is that it balanced the game for the casual gamers. And WoW just fell apart, Riot as a company has particularly not payed attention to the fate of other games whilst they implemented Dynamic queue.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, i strongly recommend Riot think over the idea to implement dynamic queue into the game. Especially just as the season starts. Because in my strong opinion, it will make the game fall apart. The game wouldnt be here right now if it had not evolved, but this step is a step backward.\r\n\r\n~Crispy","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2016-01-17T00:59:13.073+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"To an extent i agree, i play league fairly casually (i play every day, but succeeding in it is not my primary goal, entertainment is)\n\nMy computer is in the lounge (where the rest of my family are as well) so i cant use Skype or teamspeak or any other softwares because it isn't fair to them if I'm yelling \"Watch out, Garen is coming in behind you.\" all evening.\n\nso i am at an extreme disadvantage if i get placed against a team of 5 all connected with voice chat.\n\nand because i will never have Skype in my current setup, i will ALWAYS have that disadvantage, which isn't fair because its my skill thats supposed to be tested in ranked not my technology setup.","replies":[{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-17T01:00:56.351+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":1,"body":">so i am at an extreme disadvantage if i get placed against a team of 5 all connected with voice chat.\n\nSomeone hasn't read how dynamic queue works.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-01-17T01:59:52.895+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You have a 95% chance of getting placed with another team of the same pre-mades.

Always. I really don't see your point, regarding the skype and everything. Do you really expect Riot to attempt to work around the fact that a very small amount of players are unable to voice chat? It is a real-time strategy game, of course communication is an advantage. \nAlso, technology will also always affect your gameplay (of course nowhere near as much as skill), but internet connection, fps, skype (or lack thereof) etc is all relevant.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2016-01-17T00:55:03.134+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Honestly the saddest thing is, that riot still think that this will actually stop toxicity, which it won't.\n\nSure people won't get toxic over champ select, but that just means the toxicity is delayed to in game, and people don't have a chance to dodge the high toxicity people.","replies":[{"poster":"hybridz","date":"2016-01-19T15:05:30.954+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=JasonWazza,realm=OCE,application-id=FjGAIbRv,discussion-id=V5YYuceH,comment-id=0000,timestamp=2016-01-17T00:55:03.134+0000)\n>\n> Honestly the saddest thing is, that riot still think that this will actually stop toxicity, which it won't.\n> \n> Sure people won't get toxic over champ select, but that just means the toxicity is delayed to in game, and people don't have a chance to dodge the high toxicity people.\n\nYour toxic yourself hypocrit, you posted on my post which I was offering tips and started causing trouble, look who is the hypocrit now,\n\nMaybe people should start dodging que's with you mr Trouble maker.

Honestly though every games goal is to be accessible to casual and newer players whilst still satisfying veteran players. Dynamic queue is a way for people to eliminate the variables making them lose @ solo queue, ie. bad teammates etc.    If they were to recreate matchmaking algorithms to only allow 5 man parties to vs other 5's, 4's vs 4's etc it might work, however, this would make queue times pretty shocking.. \nOn another note, people are complaining about how Dynamic Queue would misrepresent ELO -- it's not as if the current system is all that accurate. And one may only queue with people of similar rank, so in that respect it's okay ---- smurfs boosting is not going to get any worse with this system, it's already about as easy as it can be. \nI feel like maybe Riot is trying too hard to become accessible to new/casual players and are forgetting what the experienced players want. However, as you said, the game does need to and will evolve, and I like the idea of Dynamic Queue I just really don't think it'll be that practical. \nRegardless, not a chance Riot will hold back from it, even with all the complaints on forums etc. \n\nP.S.    - I read the official post about Dynamic Queue - and I couldn't find anything regarding this; does Dynamic Queue match up with players on solo/duo queue?","replies":[]},{"poster":"Flavo Felicitia","date":"2016-01-17T01:48:11.058+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"Wait just cause your not all forced to play a role than you dont want to or cant doesnt mean you cant have bad players bad games and bad luck(rng) you still have to be good ti climb. 5 man premade doesnt mean you win. having a 4 man premade means you have an advantage just dont suck and let them carry you. idek how dynamic que can possibly make this happen","replies":[]}]}
