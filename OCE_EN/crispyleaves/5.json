Being a primarily mage player i was really excited to see the new items. And although i like how riot is bringing new aspects to the mid lane, i was more than a bit disappointed that there weren&#039;t any really high ratio AP items. And all the items had a lot of CDR, but not much AP. Being an offensive mage player i can say i am quite disappointed because riot is changing the items to be more utility focused. And i was really hoping for stuff like ludens echo, high AP ratio and a lot of fun. Seeing as though we have a lot of time because the reworks are coming out ages away, i would just like to reccomend that Riot make one or two offensive mage items. Because i feel like a lot of mages wont benefit from the low amounts of AP these items are given. I am really excited about what the new mages are going to be like though.\r\nJust a suggestion\r\n{{champion:103}}","replies":[{"poster":"Requiemsfire","date":"2016-04-11T16:38:59.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Well it might be because high AP items aren't what mages really need.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Tele","date":"2016-04-09T06:29:22.597+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think they are trying to move away from the traditional mage who just has burst + some utility. That's why all these items have insane utility and are super unique, but at the expense of AP to keep them balanced.\n\n**Riot** stated in patch [5.13](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-513-notes#patch-Rabadons-Deathcap) that they wanted to keep {{item:3089}} **Rabadon's Deathcap** as the _\"I want lots of AP\"_ item. If there is a problem with burst in 6.9, I'd imagine they'd buff that.","replies":[]}]}
