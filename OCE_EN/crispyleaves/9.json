Just comments about whether i should not be given ranked rewards next year.\r\n I was boosted from silver 1 to gold 5 last season in October, i had always aspired to have adorned the shiny yellow banner. And i my sivir play was always constant, so when i heard she was getting victorious skin i couldn&#039;t hold myself back. Even though it was the wrong thing to do. And for a week or so, I did wear the banner and played with the skin. But now my account has been suspended for 2 weeks and my rewards lost. I will not ask for these rewards back, or for my ban to be pardoned. As disappointed as I am that these are gone, i accept that this is what i receive for my wrongdoings. And some unwritten punishments for me is having to leave my ranked team, as they no longer wanted a booster in the team. Having to explain to people that looked up to me that i wasn&#039;t my rank legitimately. And something that i haven&#039;t brought myself to say to him, my duo partner. I feel extremely guilty that others did not receive the rewards that they deserved because of me, and i feel sorry for everyone that feels cheated because of me. But i will be working towards gold/plat legitimately next year, and having my rewards taken off me then is going a bit too far. Having to deal with the constant judgement is nearly unbearable already, let alone when i can come back on my account. In return for abiding every rule this season, i would like to have my border next year. Or maybe the skin for the champ. I will not ask your forgiveness until i can prove that i can be better than this. Until i can prove to you and myself that i can keep climbing without the need of boosters. And god forbid if i ever go near a booster again. I will not be angry if this plea isn&#039;t listened to, just disappointed in myself for having done something so incredibly stupid. Thankyou for reading this hefty paragraph, and once again i am very sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n L","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-24T08:47:16.062+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"This is why i hate the victorious skins.\n\nthey offer a literally once-in-a-lifetime-skin to people who play a computer game slightly less unluckily than others, and expect people that see their favourite champ get a skin that WILL NEVER come round again, to happily sit back and do nothing, and then punish them when they don't. \n\nThats like hanging raw meat in-front of an open cage with a starving dog inside it, then shooting the dog for leaving the cage.\n\nits just wrong, if they want to encourage fair play at the end of the season then they need to stop hanging meat in-front of the cage.\n\nso tbh i blame you for nothing, you are a victim of the system. \n\nIt wasn't the case this time, but had the Victorious skin been for Azir, as much as i wish i could... i cant 100% promise that i wouldn't have at least looked at a boosting system myself, and i absolutely abhor cheating. I consider myself a positive player in-game, i try to hold the team together and keep them positive, i try to resolve arguments that happen within the team (or even the enemy team) i respect my opponents, am humble in victory and graceful in defeat. Im not perfect and have my off days (but never put people down) but i do my best to contribute positively to the community, and i would be banned just because i didn't have enough time to 'get gud' because of university and i didn't want to miss the opportunity to have a once in a lifetime skin for my favourite champion that i love so much. Which is the same situation that you are facing now, its not right.\n\nhave the victorious skin for sale for $50+ or something, but have it free for gold+ and high ranked people get special loading screen treatment.\nSomeone suggested that everyone gets the skin but you get chroma's depending on your rank, thats a brilliant idea, bronze people would get the base skin and a bronze pack, and a plat person would get the base skin and bronze/silver/gold/plat chroma packs.\nhave a rank specific emote or something, just don't rob people of a skin they will never be able to have again for their fave champ.\nhaving a champion specific end of season reward is wrong, it can only encourage disappointment and un-fair play. (not to mention making the end of the season unplayable for anyone trying to fairly obtain rewards because of all the boosters)\n\ni see this as the system's fault not yours and i would not beat yourself up anymore about it.\nI would be absolutely disgusted if you didn't get end of season rewards next year because of this.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nFood for thought:\nin my above analogy, who is the bad guy? the starving dog who disobeys a command, or the man who shoots it?\n\nEveryone just have a little think about that.","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-11-24T09:01:24.292+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I really like the thought of this, and i really like the fact that you are defending me. But riot clearly stated in the terms and conditions that boosting wasn't okay. And in knowing that it was only to sate my greed, i did it anyway. And as much as that is actually a more balanced idea, it doesn't take away from the fact that i still cheated, as i'm sure many others did. And maybe its something that could be taken a little further, and if you would like to use me as an example go for it.","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-11-24T10:23:20.789+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You shall be a martyr for this noble cause.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2015-11-24T09:18:33.975+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You're taking this with a lot of grace and humility, you're admitting your fault and understanding the consequences of it. That's pretty much all the assurance we need that you know you did wrong and have learnt your lesson. Someone who does not/has not will always try to find ways to apologise without apologising, or to be insincere in their apologies, to appease those that they stand to gain from without actually repenting. You clearly know exactly what you did wrong, and thoroughly regret it, thus you are entirely defend-able :) \n\nIt won't help you with your loss of rewards/suspension, positive reinforcement is great but they still have to keep the threat in place. That said, I wish you good luck next season. My only advice would be to give a month after season start, then start early before all the people rushing come in at the end of the season (it's always worse/harder to play ranked at the end of the season).","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-11-24T09:23:59.149+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thankyou, ill keep that in mind when im starting.

I personally very much like the idea of having rank based chroma packs. It give you a reason to climb without giving you a reason to resort to nefarious (I do love that word) methods to do so.\n\nThey could do the same as they do with the icons, make them increasingly more extravagant not just a different colour. But of course, that would mean a lot more work for them, and given the Championship skins are at present only barely 975 level skins, it would take some serious resource adjustment and planning on their part. But if it was at all possible to introduce a rank chroma system for championship skins, I would fully and wholeheartedly endorse it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-24T08:26:29.306+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Boost is boost no matter how many ranks you gain","replies":[{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2015-11-24T08:32:17.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, thats true sorry","replies":[{"poster":"Junko","date":"2015-11-24T08:33:21.889+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=CrispyLeaves,realm=OCE,application-id=Ntey9fRZ,discussion-id=yaAwQpt7,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2015-11-24T08:32:17.917+0000)\n>\n> Yeah, thats true sorry\n\nAll good!
