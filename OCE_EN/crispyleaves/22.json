Due to this i have stopped playing ranked games and i have retreated to my smurf account. But when i tried to log in this morning it says that it needed an update and i just went with it and it loaded really slowly (it took 4 hours to get %20). After a good 6 hours of being bored around the house league decided to stop loading at %32 and sit there. I then had to close the launcher and start from square one and right now it has loaded 1%. I dunno, does anyone else? and is anyone else in Tasmania experiencing a lot of lag.\r\n{{champion:134}} Syndra FTW","replies":[{"poster":"HORSE OF FORCE","date":"2014-12-21T03:55:55.939+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I got this a couple of times actually, turns out League doesn't like you having your DNS address being sought automatically.
