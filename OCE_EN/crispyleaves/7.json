Dynamic queue is a recipe for salt and harrassment, \r\n_If i want to play soloQ, why risk being matched with a team that are all premades but myself._\r\n\r\nIt destroyes the meaning of ranked teams, if people want to play soloQ with 3-4 people, make a different queue type. It is unfair to be ranking people in the same way, who play soloQ or technically ranked 5s at the same time. It devalues the ranked system. As a keen extrovert, i am quite happy playing by myself. I have 3 friends who i play with sometimes, but if i am being judged by my rank with other people who were originally in bronze but got taken up by dynamic queue, there is no point in me playing this game. And worst of all, Gold, Platinum and Diamond are all going to become devalued, my gold border is going to mean nothing if people cant discern whether i earned it by myself, or with 4 other people. I want the old soloQ back, or atleast another ranked queue. It is unfair on those who want to play by themselves. Riot hasnt thought about the ranked system, they have thought about player enjoyment. And making the game have more player enjoyment (for some people) at the expense of the ranking system is ultimately going to fall back. Because for a lot of people _The ranked system IS player enjoyment_.\r\n\r\nI have been liking riots changes to certain champs, i have liked their decisions of balancing everything for season 6. But if the new ranked system continues to devalue my rank that i worked hard for _By Myself_, then there wont be much point in me being here anymore.\r\n\r\nRiot, you have taken many steps forward lately\r\nbut this is a step backward","replies":[{"poster":"Shana Rei","date":"2016-01-20T04:02:08.980+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Are people incapable of reading the notes about future patches/pbe or even a basic google search?\n\nThere is going to be a separate ranked solo Q introduced later on.
