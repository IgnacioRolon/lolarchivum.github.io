Like Reddit but in forums. \r\nIll start off\r\nSo me and two of my friends were trioing, and they had planned to switch draven and nautilus around (because Draven is a pretty risky first pick). So that was all fine, and we were chatting. \r\nThen, just as one of my friends locked in Draven, he said that he was going to get a drink. Now this seemed pretty normal, until only       moments later realising that he hadnt swapped. Me and my friend Teigan both realised at the same time because there was a loong moment of silence. Which was quickly followed by the retched SCREAAMING for John to come back. We must have sat their for a couple of minutes just CRYING for him (told him to not get bloody headphones). May i also mention that it didnt once cross our minds to dodge the champ select. So we both sat at our desks, groaning as the client closed and opened into the loading screen. And this poor innocent support, who had never played Draven in her life, had to verse a sivir in lane (may i also mention that we won the game, even if Teigan&#039;s kda was pretty mediocre). And that is the story, of no matter how much we need to leave a champion select, our group always stays till the very end.","replies":[]}
