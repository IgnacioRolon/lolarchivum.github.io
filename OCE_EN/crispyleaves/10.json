And only recently have i thought how cool it would be to make it a champion. So here it is, btw Vatra means fire in Croatian @google translate. \n\nPassive - Scorching sorrow\nEvery 12/10/8 seconds, Vatra&#039;s next basic ability burns the targets hit for 20-200 true damage. This cooldown is reduced by 1 second for every enemy champion afflicted. And only applies on the first tick of damage on her W. \n\nQ - Pyroclastic burst\nVatra sends a burst of pyroclastic energy forward, stopping at the first unit hit. This damages the first unit hit for moderate Magic damage. If Scorching sorrow is ready, Pyroclastic burst will stun the first enemy hit. And if it comes in contact with her W - Magma Well, it explodes. Dealing reduced damage to enemies in an area behind the well. \n\nW - Magma Well\nVatra summons forth a well of scorching lava, dealing damage in that area over 4/4.5/5/5.5/6 seconds. This stores 3 charges and can only be cast a second or third time if the Magma Well shares a border with another magma well. \n\nE - Tectonic implosion\nVatra implodes the tectonics in a small cone infront of her. Pulling all enemies toward her. This ability can not apply Scorching Sorrow. If this ability is cast on terrain or her Magma Wells, it instead pulls Vatra toward the terrain. \n\nR - Divine Cataclysm \nVatra summons an explosive volcano at a target location. This Volcano counts as terrain. It slows all nearby enemy champions by 20/30/40% and deals small magic damage every second. Every 2 seconds, after a short indication and delay. The volcano throws out trails of lava. Dealing large damage to all enemies hit. \n\nThis kit makes Vatra a control mage. Using her abilities to cut off chokepoints and control large scale engagements from a distance. Her laning phase is relatively strong, due to her ability to control the enemy champions movement. Although she is very susceptible to assassinations and burst mages, who can kill her before she has the chance to damage them back. \n\nAn example build for Vatra is:\n\nEssential:\n{{item:3116}}  {{item:3020}} {{item:3151}} \n\nOffensive:\n{{item:3089}} {{item:3135}} {{item:3285}} \n\nDefensive:\n{{item:3157}}  {{item:3001}} {{item:3027}}[](http://crispyleaves1.deviantart.com/art/12675245-1691176957825937-767240055-O-589487623?ga_submit_new=10%253A1454918813)","replies":[{"poster":"Aeonne","date":"2016-02-11T08:32:37.922+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"\" If this ability is cast on terrain or her Magma Wells, it instead pulls Vatra toward the terrain.\"\nWhat if an enemy is in that cone? Does it pull them towards Vatra and also Vatra to the Magma Well/Terrain?\n\nAlso, a some of these abilities names sound like those of other champions;\nCataclysm - Jarvan\nPyroclastic - Brand\n\nHer passive is also pretty much Gangplanks :/\n\n1 more question, is she ranged or melee? It sounds like she is ranged, but certain things in her kit make her sound melee.\n\nSorry for criticizing, she seems like a great champion, just needs some refining :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"CrispyLeaves","date":"2016-02-08T10:56:41.896+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for all the constructive comments, i think i will take that advice Slyzza.

But it makes sense. She has the ability to keep people on top of her pools without the need of hard cc. And her ulti will be deadly in teamfights if positioned correctly. Maybe you could make it so that her ult transformed herself into a vessel of some sort. I mean it would be hard to keep people on top of the volcano. But if she was walking around with this huge damage in a circle around her, it would be much easier to use. Just saying.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Gnar Is A Cat","date":"2016-02-08T10:45:51.503+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"First off, that artwork is amazing. I would love to be able to do stuff like that. Her kit seems pretty interesting actually, it would take quite a bit of skill to be able to make it work. Maybe buffing the passive damage early would also be nice. Over all, i think its a great start to a champ. I honestly think riot should take a look at this one.","replies":[]}]}
