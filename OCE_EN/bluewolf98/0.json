I used to believe that it was always the fault of the offender because they would have had a series of warnings through the punishment tiers before a tier 3 or 4. What I have experienced is not the case.\n\nThat said, his response to your comment was a bit douchey.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"BlueWolf98","date":"2017-11-07T09:03:45.280+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":2,"body":"WOW YEA THAT REALLY HELPED ME GET MY FKN MONEY BACK IM FUKIN DONE","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2017-11-08T01:32:25.543+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"😂🙃","replies":[]},{"poster":"Best Evelynn OCE","date":"2017-11-07T12:33:15.532+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"...
