I have been into my promos 9 times this week right? I HAVE LOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM TO FEEDERS AND AFK PLAYERS!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI go on massive winning streaks then as soon as i hit promos its Lag,Afk players,DC or i get matched with really over powered players....... I have been constantly playing ranked for at least a year and i have been in bronze 5 for the entirety if that period.... i feel like every time i get close to getting out, its just trolls... feeders or lag. like some kind of curse that prevents me from winning. i am just so so so sick of loosing over and over i try and try and never get anywhere..... i ping when enemies leave lane, i watch the map to make sure i know where the enemy is so i can push, i have the correct positioning, i think about the other team and how their champs are played so i can counter build them, i stay positive and am rarely toxic, i encourage my teammates to keep them happy and playing well. i do not know what i am doing wrong here but im stuck in B5. i take positions people say they do not want, i support them as much as i can. I am at the point where i feel the system is rigged. i feel like something is matching me up with people who are constantly afk. and whats the deal with the toxic community.... i have had people say &quot;i will slit your throat and drink your blood&quot; and &quot;i hope you get raped by your dad and starved everyday&quot; this makes me sick to think that people think like that. and i have had report warning from people who blame me for loosing. one time i had a teammate who told the other team i was feeding intentionally ( which i was not ) so she managed to get the entire team to agree on reporting me. i think the report system is flawed.... mainly because it is way to easy to report people, players with a bad temper will just report people they do not like simply to take their anger out on them or something. because the report only takes a few clicks its too easy for players to abuse this. i think that the report system should be on the league of legends website so that you actually have to use a little bit of effort to report the players. this will reduce the amount of people who abuse the system.","replies":[{"poster":"Wuks","date":"2015-12-22T04:34:14.004+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey BlueWolf98,\n\n\nAs this is a discussion pertaining to one of the Player Behavior & Reform systems [Reports] in League of Legends, the best place for this discussion would be the [**Player Behavior & Moderation**](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/player-behavior-moderation) sub-boards.
