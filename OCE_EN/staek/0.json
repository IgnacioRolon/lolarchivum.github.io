Ranked matching is bad or in my case really bad, i have been matched in teams where my whole team is s4+ and the other team is g5+ only and i think this is not fair in the slightest. Now i dont consider myself to be a great player but skilled enough. Now i have dropped from gold 3 to gold 5 in one day and this is  mostly because of trolls, feeders or afkers (some Just close games) but mostly been afk and feeders. I think this is ridiculous for ranked and seriously need to be looked at cause i dont even want to go into playing ranked now because i continually get matches like this\n\n\nThe link above is my match history from the last games.

There's only so much disappointment one person can handle before it starts effecting their own gameplay. Instead of forcing your way through these loss streaks it's really helpful to just take a step back and gather yourself before jumping back in with fresh eyes.","replies":[{"poster":"Damocracy","date":"2016-04-15T11:27:09.203+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"So sick of people saying take a break. \nA person harrass's you in real life do we take a break from living? \nSame with your job, just walk out of work and not go back until you had a break?\nNo, you call the police or your supervisor and it gets sorted out.\nPeople playing the game should not be penalised because of others behaviour.\nThis is up to Riot to fix not the person trying to play the game.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-04-15T13:08:08.100+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"But this is a game, and if you aren't having fun then it's not worth playing. There is no responsibility keeping you playing League when you are frustrated like that.\n\nAs for it being up to Riot, yes, but no system is perfect, and the system can't catch everyone straight away. It also can't catch anyone if they don't get reported.\n\nNijiiyo's point stands, if you're frustrated at the game for whatever reason, then take a break, from the game or just from ranked. But it's best not to keep playing when you know your ability is compromised and that it's only going to get worse the more you play.\n\nThis isn't about penalising players for the behaviour of others, it's about maintaining your own sanity. There's nothing worse in ranked than a loss streak, so why would you increase your chances of one? \n\nHonestly I'm of the mind that you should take a break after any loss, regardless of  they why. It gives you a chance to reflect, look at what you did wrong and what you can do better, and come back to the game with fresh eyes.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nijel","date":"2016-04-15T13:06:51.207+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Let's get something straight. I suggested taking a break as I didn't want to overtly state that when a player goes on a massive loss streak it is up to them to stop playing as soon as possible. My response was less focused on the behaviour of others than on the necessity to identify when we are no longer at our mental peak or able to play at a level conducive to winning. \n\nThis is not a punishment, it's protecting your own efforts from yourself.\n\nYou'll notice I didn't specify the duration of the break as it is up to the individual to decide when they are ready to return. Committing to the Ranked experience is unique in the fact you will always be able to take a breather. There is absolutely no obligation or expectation of anyone to continue grinding out games when things get rough nor that they would treat other aspects of their life in an identical manner.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"andyMak","date":"2016-04-14T17:38:55.663+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"So you didn't drop because of anything you did.

This is unacceptable\n\nHe said MOSTLY when referring to his team feeding. Even if it was the other team feeding, it still means the SKILL experience is bad. Some people player for the SKILL of the game you know, not just rank. And when you are with a bunch of noobs that have no understanding, its very insulting.\n\nIt is possible that he could ward more, but you know sometimes when all towers have been smashed and you are pushed back to inside your base, you aren't gonna be doing much warding there.\n\nOn another note, this Sunday morning, the Chiefs will take on the other International WildCard teams. They say they've improved their play since last time around. It's going to be very interesting to see how they stack up.\n\nOne thing that you could do, like Nijiiyo suggests, is to take a break. Perhaps until the end of the season, and hope that the new meta and better queues change everything. And that idiots start learning that dragons are a stupid early objective to take, it's not season 4. But of course this is unrealistic. Probably what Princess Yaia says is best: get your own 5 man stack of players that have similar understanding to you and don't feed, and then go and mow some jackers.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-04-14T23:00:05.944+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Nah","replies":[]},{"poster":"Essembie","date":"2016-04-15T02:14:57.800+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj4WtyoSwwI","replies":[]},{"poster":"fattyhotdogs","date":"2016-04-15T01:43:52.017+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"I like how you purposefully excluded the game in which the enemy vayne fed. **oh wait i forgot!
