However after recovering from the suspension I have had no reports against my name, bar one game where I was merely defending myself from the beratement of my entire team for having a bad game of such. Consequently they all reported me resulting in my permanent ban?\r\n\r\nHow is this fair at all? The proof which riot display is that one and only chat audit where even then is not merely as harsh as I have seen other players speak in this community ( I was defending myself from 3 of my teammates )\r\n\r\nPlease can I have some further review into my account, as I deem this to be extremely unfair.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-20T03:51:58.711+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I have responded to your post in the Player Behaviour section, this belongs there not in help and support.
