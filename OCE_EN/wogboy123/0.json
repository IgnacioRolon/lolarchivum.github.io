Intentional Feeding detection is also under the Instant Feedback system, although it does use a few other metrics and may be manually reviewed as well in some cases. If the Intentional Feeding system is triggered and finds a player is in fact intentionally feeding, the player will be either two-week or permanently suspended.

If someone gets banned for 14 days and despite the warning given in the reform email that they will receive a perma ban STILL continue to demonstrate unacceptable behaviour, then clearly they show no desire whatsoever to even consider reforming.\n\nI'll try to give an accurate metaphor here.\n\nSomeone breaks into a store and yells at all the employees and the customers, trashing a few things. The store kicks him out but doesn't press charges because it's an isolated incident. \nIt happens again, they kick him out and press for reparations for the damage done.\nIt happens a third time, they prevent him entry to the store, getting security heavily involved. It doesn't happen for a while.\nThen once more it happens and they press charges, that someone gets imprisoned.\n\nThat someone will get released and may go create a new account and continue causing problems, but he'll just be picked up quicker next time, and he now has a bad reputation.\n\nThe escalating punishments isn't about punishing people who don't deserve it, or people who aren't bad enough to be punished, because those people won't be punished. If the transgression is not deserving of a chat ban they won't receive one. If Riot took your stance then there would be no warnings, you would face a perma ban after first offense, not fourth. The four tiers are to give warning and ample chance to reform.\n\nI think you're looking at this from the wrong perspective. You seem to be treating this as if those banned by the system are innocent, or only guilty of the occasional swear or angry comment, but this is just not the case. These are people who have demonstrated that they have no regard for the other people they play with and will be toxic if it suits their own ends or makes them feel better.\n\nYou singled out that quote, but I would like to point out what I said below it.\n\n> Again, the severity is only relevant **_to the point where it triggers the system_** (except in special cases such as hate speech), it is the frequency that results in higher punishment tiers.\n\nYour behaviour has to be severe enough for the system to pick you up in the first place.

This isn't giving people life jail sentences for petty theft.\n\nWell in a way it is, and this guy's chat log is proof of that.  Would you seriously look at that chat log and say that he needs to lose his account over it?  Especially when he's obviously being antagonised?\n\nOn that note, why do you expect people to be robots?  Let's assume the poster is telling the truth: do you know what playing with an insanely toxic and trolling 4-man dynamic queue group is like?  \n\nIt's incredibly easy to lose your shit if your entire team is purposefully and intentionally ruining your game, and then, once they get that reaction out of you, they report you.  Let's say someone consistently gets dynamic queued with a group of dickheads three times in a day (which I've had happen more times than I can remember) - if they've already had the 14-day suspension and they're trying their hardest to get better, but then they have a bad day like this, they're going to get permabanned, even though they've been provoked and antagonised into an angry response and even though their response **_might not be that bad_**.  All they have to do is slip up ONCE in that game and it's enough to justify the dynamic trolls' report against that person and they get banned. \n\nUltimately this results in punishing the victim.  Sure, you could say, yep, you've been bad, you've been toxic enough to get the 3rd warning, but like you said, it's about consistency, not about severity (which is fundamentally absurd) so they go on to _get punished for their behaviour in the absence of context._  \n\nI'm going to be really clear here:  some people deserve to be permabanned because they are insanely toxic, but your method, process and lack of consideration for circumstances is unintelligent.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-25T09:56:56.105+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":1,"body":"> Well in a way it is...\n\nBut he has done this before. This is the fourth time (that the system has detected) that he has demonstrated behaviour that is far from ok. It doesn't matter if he was antagonised or not. Just because someone else does something doesn't mean it's ok for you too. If someone steals from a supermarket, it's still a crime if you do it after he does, or if someone tells you to do it. So yes, his behaviour is worthy of a perma ban.\n\n> On that note, why do you expect people to be robots?...\n\nI don't, and of course I know what it's like to be victim to the worst of the worst. Believe me I know. There are games where I have gotten so mad at someone that I can barely play the game anymore. \n\nBUT the difference is that I know how to step away, to take a deep breath and to mute/ignore and move on, and if I can't do that, I know how to not take it out in game. I might complain in skype, I might get frustrated and aggressively cuddle my cat, but I don't take any of that salt and toxicity in to game. \n\nOn the rare occasions it does make it into game, it isn't anywhere near consistent enough to be picked up by the system, it happens maybe once a year. He got banned because he was consistently toxic, you're saying that every one of those games he was antagonised to the point of this level of toxicity? It's usually more than one game that triggers your first punishment. Antagonised or not he told someone they were stupid and worthless, his abuse was targeted and direct. Respect for him coming to the boards to help instead of to complain, he did the right thing there, but his behaviour was clearly in the wrong and it's his decision to reform or not.\n\n> It's incredibly easy to lose your shit...\n\nBut don't take it into game. Scream at your screen, throw a book across the room whatever, but don't take out your frustration on PEOPLE. Again, just because they do it, doesn't make it ok.\n\n> Ultimately this results in punishing the victim...\n\nBut he has made himself a culprit as well. He isn't being punished for being abused or being a victim, he is being punished for abusing.\n\n> I'm going to be really clear here: some people deserve to be permabanned because they are insanely toxic, but your method, process and lack of consideration for circumstances is unintelligent.\n\nWhat makes you think there is a lack of consideration? Don't get me wrong, I'm genuinely curious. Every system has it's flaws, but in my eyes everything that needed to be was considered. \n\nDid he demonstrate verbal abuse? Yes. \nHas he done so in the past? Yes. \nHas he proven that he took no warnings to heart and did nothing to move towards reforming, despite being warned at his 14 day that his next punishment would be a perma ban? Yes. \n\nI think he deserves the perma here, and that he was given ample warning and reasoning. If he creates a new account I hope he takes it to heart. I'm not too sure what circumstances aren't being considered here. You are responsible for YOUR behaviour and yours alone when you are in game or in client, and he is being punished for it.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"wogboy123","date":"2016-02-20T03:57:57.248+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know I shouldn't have said anything, it's just in the overall view I don't believe I should receive a permanent ban for one game after my previous bans.

Also i would like to add this screenshot for what I god banned for 14 days, after that I realized Riot is not worth my time nor money anymore, since I have never been rude to anyone who was trying to win a game, I just get tilted by trolls who are trying to lose on purpose and they replied to me something like that I have been SARCASTIC AND THATS PUNISHABLE NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR---- yes, so are you sarcastinc? enjoy your ban! \n\nyour non-functioning tribunal system will doom you, you are losing good players while you are protecting trolls who are in most games lately, just becuase they can. without any punishment.\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/ykvfeatq1/ban_for_easy_for_14_day.png\nthis is where I was sarcastic to enemy sivir because he flamed us all game long  because we were doing great on lane against him- just to mention he was saying shit like  \" die with your whore mother to cancer \"and stuff like that\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/i1mju9j3t/sarcasm_bannable.png","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Michaeltk","date":"2016-02-25T21:57:17.523+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Riot just needs to remove chat for everyone or just mute everyone : > might get reported for not communicating with team tho... even if you have your account muted ;o","replies":[]},{"poster":"Outis","date":"2016-02-22T17:14:28.915+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> tafe...\ndid you complete high school?\nso you're confirming\nvery\nyes\nI do an arts course at the university of Melbourne\noh really?\nI requires an ATAR over 92\nso I don't think so\nhow is that dumbwhat hahah\nwtf\nyou guys don't know what you are talking about at all do you>?\ntafe is where people who cannot finish their high school deploma go\nsuch as yourself\n\nlmao i hope you realise how dumb this statement is. take this ban as a positive thing. go outside (other than university) and learn how the real world works. i think you'll find out what you said is completely not true.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2016-02-20T07:46:56.132+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"quality banter m8","replies":[]}]}
