Sometimes the damn truth hurts. and they report me for it, but on my end, it&#039;s just another league bs spat of two people sitting behind a screen so I don&#039;t put much thoughts into it, meaning idgaf. but now i have a 15 days ban because of some loudmouth &quot;KID&quot; reported me for apparently saying &quot;please get through puberty already for society&#039;s sake&quot; which is the most offensive punchline of the report log I could see and have received. fair enough, IT IS offensive to some people, who am I kidding its 2017 for god&#039;s sake. but please if your stupid system is going to ban me or the person than banned me for the sake of giving some 12 year kid is going through their moodswings, at the least I should get my justice of having him banned  too, if you bother to look back at the start to end of the chat log for that game. \r\nthanks riot, for spoiling idiotic privileged kids by giving them an &quot;opinion&quot; and really if they do not like the offensive words on the internet, maybe they shouldn&#039;t have the chat filter off. Honestly this is just the usual LoL bs that pisses people off daily. I have only recently returned to league but honestly I do not think its worth the mental stress anymore, sure it is fun, but other people make it stressful. I will from now on play PUBG mainly instead of this bs crap and not pay any more money to your system just for stupid cosmetic pixels. \r\nthanks for having a 13 year-old staff member doing the reports logs. \r\nlosing one customer or client may not seem like a big deal to you people, but maybe look at the quality of your staff&#039;s decision making skills and you might keep more players in the game, or atleast make it seems like you give enough crap about the player&#039;s situation and make a fair decision. no warnings straight up banned. what a joke.","replies":[{"poster":"Khabutops","date":"2017-10-22T11:36:26.997+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"You do realize that it was toxic and without supplying solid evidence, no one is going to believe nor care about you being toxic to someone you deem a \"child\" just because you're having a bad day. It's the equivalent to telling someone to go buy a box of tissues instead of crying on forums about a 2 week ban. Stop playing this game if you think you were unfairly banned.{{sticker:slayer-jinx-catface}}","replies":[{"poster":"SlapAscrub","date":"2017-10-22T12:39:36.162+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"what kind of evidence do I need to supply? I'm not asking to unban my account, I'm just saying the decision to ban me over such a stupid thing was a bit harsh, first of all, the \"kid\" started the game with straight up insults, such as \"smd\",\"kys\"(sorry for being \"offensive\"#2017) blah blah blah for no reason while I was talking to someone else, but kept at it from the start til end of game, a number of things he have said is 10, and the amount of his bs I responded to was 2 at most, I only said a couple of lines that I thought that this \"kid\" needs to do, I did say and admit that I wasn't in the right either, this is not about me being unable to play the game for a mere 2 weeks, as I have stated above I will no longer play this game so thanks for your suggestion. this was aimed at the \"mods\" and \"staffs\" that gives enough of a crap about a single guys opinion and maybe use this as a feedback for future references, and from \"my\" point of view, not saying it stands for everyone else, telling someone who is behaving childishly to grow up, does not seem all that offensive to me. once again if I do actually go buy a box of tissue like you suggested, how are you not any different from that \"kid\" who just says what he feels without thinking about it first? doesn't matter if my opinion isn't heard right? I'm just another crybaby, right? sure, whatever you say, you're not wrong in your own sense, but without speaking up and saying your honest opinion, to people who \"MATTERS\" (mods/staffs), nothing will progress or get better. and to respond to your idiotic reply, first of all, my statements did point towards saying nobody cares about an individual's problem. like you said in your second sentence, that you deem \"toxic\", secondly, your \"tissue\" box statement is unrelated and yes I DO know what the internet is like. and thirdly I do not mean to be a \"smartass\" but I just cannot handle stupidity, I DID say I was going to stop playing this, NOT because I'm freaking banned already and CAN'T technically play, but because I already said I will do so like you \"stupidly\" suggested. \n\nSo, I know the internet is full of stupid people, and one's complaint doesn's mean jack. but why DO they bother have these \"forums\" for? \nI gave enough sh*ts to actually \"log in\" and complaint on an \"OFFICIAL\" forum because technically this is WHERE you go to HOPE that your opinion will be heard. you have your right to reply to my complaint and suggesting the OBVIOUS sh*ts I have ALREADY said, and I have the right to complain because a game i \"used\" to enjoy and PAID money to DID me wrong, BUT that is just MY opinion. \n\nI know you will be back to check how I could possibly reply to your \"ego boosted\" suggestion. and suggests other things I should do instead, but please just save it, this was not aimed at an individual like yourself. It is merely a worthless guy's opinion.\n\nThanks for understanding.","replies":[{"poster":"Gehirn","date":"2017-10-23T03:26:34.105+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I can't really provide much comfort because we may disagree on how you should have approached this, but let's review.\n\nI can see that the offending player you're referring to started the negativity with you for no good reason. We can at least agree that the offending player has some issues they should probably work through before speaking to others in game.\n\nBut where you went wrong was responding to this player with negativity in kind. If you had instead muted them, ignored their useless words, and reported them after the game (why say they deserved a negative reply but choose to not report them?) there's a good chance they would have been banned and you'd get that satisfying message thanking you for your accurate report, then it's on to your next game instead of your ban.\n\nMy point with regards your feedback is, that the system isn't going to discern between you initiating negativity and retaliating with negativity. A mute and report from you would have seen the expected behaviour and the system works with that.","replies":[{"poster":"Ã¯uv mmmmmmmmmmm","date":"2017-11-04T00:38:09.238+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"gehirn,  i need ur help , i'm 5years old lol player ,  \n\ni won't to leave lol again , \n\ni will never say anything in game ,\n\nplease read my boards , if u are not busy please ,\n\ni 'm tired","replies":[]},{"poster":"SlapAscrub","date":"2017-10-23T23:43:41.246+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You are absolutely correct, Gehirn. It was my own fault for responding and not reporting the said player like you have stated. Maybe I was just too lazy and thought \"it's only the usual league bs\" and not bother doing my part in reporting that player where I have the option to.  But fair enough he reported me and I DID NOT, but should I not at least get a warning or something? or should the person doing the report logs at least read both sides of the conversation? or is it software decision-based? I was insta-banned when my next game ended and I thought \"for what?\"\nthen I see the report and the \"evidence\" log and CLEARLY even within that \"evidence\" log he was the only one actually cursing and being obviously abusive.\nNot saying I wasn't wrong but if you have bots doing your decision making in such a way then my feedback to you is maybe work on that department. Just because some stupid league spat and a kid got too emotional and decided to report and only I got banned for it, is just ridiculous. Sure I didn't  Mute or reported him back, sure I went on the offensive a bit as well, but if you're going to provide me with \"evidence\" of me being offensive while he CLEARLY is too within said \"evidence\" maybe punish both parties yeah? it's like going to court and both parties are actually guilty but only one got jailed because the other one sued first. if your system was the judge, it would be the one from \"IDIOCRACY\" It wouldn't make sense that your software could discern between what is offensive or not but not who is being offensive? because honestly many OF AGE players really do not care about little problems like this at the end of the day. We're not going to bother to report every single loud mouthed \"kid\" after each game just because they learnt new words and are practicing it on this game because your \"chat\" system \"allows\" them to type it in. Like you said, If i \"bothered\" to mute and report, maybe I would get some justice. But vice-versa, if he left his filter \"off\" and \"accepted\" to being exposed to unfiltered words and contexts, and then obviously being offensive then maybe he shouldn't have the right to be offended?   I'm just saying your system is broken, that's it.","replies":[{"poster":"SlapAscrub","date":"2017-10-23T23:51:52.277+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ps. \nI do not actually know how to mute people, league doesn't make it obvious enough how to do so. And also a good metaphor for this situation is something like this.\n\nYou go to a restaurant right? then there's another guy there in the same restaurant as you. But then the guy started throwing food at your table and you, after a while you throw some back. But after the meals, he went on to sue you, and you were taken to court and jailed because a video clip showing you throwing food. So then you are in jail or lock up because he reported you to the police first, while he gets away scotts free.\n\nSounds stupid, doesn't it? I thought so too. But like I have said, your system is broken, even though I did not report back but HE DID report me, and that involves HIM and MYSELF in this situation, if this was somewhat close to fair, the case would just be dismissed out of stupidity. But no, your system is broken so do something about it.\n\nAll those pre-game tips of how to better behave yourself to make life easier for other players, but I have never seen one giving tips on how to mute or ignore abusive players. \n\n\\#2017howtonotoffendsomeone.","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}]}
