The lag spikes and A2R's are still as prevalent as ever. People on both the enemy team and ally team experience the lag spike or A2R at the same time, so it is NOT on OUR end. \n\nJust as an indicator at how things should be done, I had trouble with the Free To Play game \"Defiance\" where I couldn't buy something and an error kept popping up. The GM located the problem, fixed it and personally replied back to me *within a DAY*!  With RIOT we're treated like Centrelink customers \"Please use the phones and someone might get back to you\". At least reply to me via email saying what the problem might be with possible solutions. \n\nI know OCE/Australia is kinda the forgotten part of the world also known as Narnia, but I assume we are still a large portion of your bank roll. \n\nI also had another recent problem where as soon as I was in the loading screen pregame, somehow LOL would make my computer lose all the wireless Networks. I would have to completely restart my computer and internet router to fix it. I repaired my LOL and that seems to have fixed the problem for now. Has anyone else had this weird issue?","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Cloudx998","date":"2015-02-03T03:15:04.435+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"same problem here. been going on for over a month now :(\ngame is basically unplayable like this...","replies":[]},{"poster":"Level 5 Torchic","date":"2015-02-02T08:24:58.935+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Im not getting any lag but the disconnect from chat happens on daily basis.","replies":[]},{"poster":"vonraptor","date":"2015-12-19T08:08:26.166+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's started happening to me too.

So SAD THEY BLAME THEM ON THE isp DOING THE POOR JOB. SUCK BLAME GAME, MUCH WOW. :(\n\nBasically RIOT blamed Flip but they internet worked fine for other games. Flip took the blame and so I switched to my friends Telstra internet, NOW RITO blames Telstra for the lagg, Telstra took the blame. I again switched to a new provider SPARK. I CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE, RITO IS GOING TO BLAME SPARK TOO. I know Spark will take the blame. \n\nWhy don't RiOT REALISE  people play other high demanding games like new COD, Destiny and don't have any reconnection issues. While only LeAGUE have so much lags, disconnections, dramas, depression, rage at internet service providers. Every update break the game that took time to make it working properly and the cycle repeats over and over again. I can predict another patch in 1 week will break everything that took time for us players to get to working properly.\n\nSo what I am understanding is every single ISP Cannot play Rito game because LOL is more high demanding in requirements than COD and Destiny? If that is not true, Rito has to focus on providing few high quality updates instead of messing up the ones that was working properly before.","replies":[]},{"poster":"PlayDis","date":"2015-02-03T01:23:36.917+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"cant tell if its my net or not,\nping spikes from 16-400 ping throughout my games\nnot noticeable on downloads tho :O\n{{item:3070}}","replies":[]}]}
