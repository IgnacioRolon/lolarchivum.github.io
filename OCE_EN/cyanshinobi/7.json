I know they wouldn't give us RP, but IP would allow us to buy other champs, or runes and rune pages. :D. This would free up the champion select page, and let us focus on our mains.\r\n\r\n2nd: Morgana's \"Dark Binding\" spell's graphics need to match the actual width of her spell path. So many times I've dashed away thinking I'm outside the hit box (even the shadow didn't touch me) and WHAM! I'm in a spell cage! To use RIOT's favourite word, this spell needs *clarity*. \r\n\r\n3rd: There was a third, but I can't remember it anymore. \r\n\r\n4th: Winions stealing your turret. There needs to be a time delay, like kills, where if you've hit the turret within 5 secs of the minion taking it down, it's still counted as your turret destruction. Also turrets are meant to be a huge objective, but the game \"champion\" still seems to be the one who has the best KD. I usually end up being the one defending turrets and pushing lanes while the rest are playing hide and seek in the jungle, and end up winning the game from my pushes and defences, but the credit still goes more to the KD+ person. Turrets, when killed by champions need to be worth more, maybe in descending value going towards the nexus, so that pushed teams have a chance to push back.\r\n\r\n5th: Needs to be \"Tips to Gameplay\" like this. Tips such as:\r\n\"Warding=wins! Game statistics show winning teams ward more\"\r\n\" Fed Team>Fed Champ! Share your kills for a higher chance to win\"\r\n\"Your computer is faster than the internet, so that even though it shows you as saying 'top' first, you may actually be *last* by everyone else's consensus. Consensus Rules\"\r\n\"Don't first time if it's not BOTS, That's what BOTS are for. Regardless if it's normal or ranked, you're just ruining a fun game with your lack of skills.\".\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of my ideas? Please comment on them, or leave your own suggestions :D\r\n\r\nAlso, RIOT finally noticed that, before patch, upgrading the trinket still only gave you basically 1 1/2 trinkets. Now we can finally upgrade it and it's useful 2 1/2 trinkets! :D Good job riot~!","replies":[{"poster":"ForPortal","date":"2015-02-24T12:54:35.325+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"The selection box on the Nexus needs to be a bit smaller. At the moment, it's too easy to click on the ground next to the Nexus and have that move order incorrectly identified as an attack order.\n\nI'd also suggest giving the Nexus a small aura that allows champions to move through minions. Between the Nexus, the two Nexus turrets and up to 40 minions and 10 champions, the pathfinding really suffers right at the end of the game.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-02-24T13:08:54.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I totally agree. Although there are items for movement through minions, I feel that the minions pose too much of a barrier (especially your own ones, which we should be able to move through with ease, not hinder their own team, lol). Also, talking about minions, the attack animations need to finish *soooo* much quicker. How often have we done that stupid stuttering action as we try to last hit a minion only having it die in the process along with 3 others. Not saying the attack speed should be quicker between each attack, but that each attack is executed faster.","replies":[]}]}]}
