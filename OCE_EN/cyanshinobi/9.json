It&#039;s also happening to a couple of my friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT 29/08/15: Bumping again because STILL no RED activity. This is meant to be help and support? Where&#039;s the support? Do your jobs!\r\n\r\nStill happening to me after a month of posting the original post. Screen shot attached.","replies":[]}
