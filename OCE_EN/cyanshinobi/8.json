Also if you don't like it, just leave it, don't downvote it, as that's not what the downvotes are for.\n\nJust did my placements and won 6 out of 10 games and get placed in the _exact same position_ in Bronze 5.\nI believe the system of Rank based on W/L is outdated and doesn&#039;t have synergy with the concept of LoL being a strategy game.\nSo, below is an idea on how to get LP points that I believe better isolates and advances the great players from the good.\n\nInstead of W/L, you should acquire them IN GAME like experience points. That way, it includes, Wins and Losses, K/D/A AND _objectives_!\n\n> Kills = 3\n> Deaths = -5\n> Assists = 2\n\nThis means that if you get 1 kill and 1 assist, you&#039;re back to 0 with a death, so choosing your battles wisely gets you a better score.\nIt should also reduce the amount of players trying to 1 v 5 when they can&#039;t win.\nThe assists are only 2, as this will encourage supports to, well, support more. Also, encourages the rest of the team to assist in team fights, so you don&#039;t have that one person who&#039;s only in it for the kills and leaves the rest of the team to die. This also means that if you&#039;re a support main, you&#039;ll be able to progress just as well. Furthermore, with the new system that places you in a particular role, if you&#039;re a support, the allocation of points could go 1/-4/3 as supports are often used as cannon fodder to allow the rest of the team to make a play or escape. And avoids supports taking the kills just cuz they can &gt;_&gt;\n\n**Objectives!**\n\n**Towers**\n> 1st = 5 LP for Assists (damage% &gt; 20 to count as assist, to stop &quot;last hitting&quot;), 2 LP for the rest of the team\n> 2nd = 7 for Assists, 3 for rest of team\n> Inhib turret = 10 for Assists, 5 for rest of team\n> Inhib = 10 for Assists \n> Nexus Turrets = 20 for Assists \n> Nexus = Game won! 50 LL&#039;s :P\n\n**Large..er Monsters**\n> Dragons all levels = 5 LP for assists \n> Rift Herald = 5 LP for assists\n> Baron = 10 LP for assists\n\nFor LOSS of objectives there should also be a punishment of -5 for each turret/inhib/dragon and baron lost. This will encourage protection of these instead of aiming for a killing spree game.\nAlso, speaking of Baron, if it&#039;s a buff, you should be able to steal it like one from an opponent with baron buff whom you&#039;ve killed. This will make players decide the best time to take baron so that they don&#039;t risk being on low hp for the enemy to just come along and steal it.\n\n**Wins and Losses**\n\n> Win = 10 LP\n> Loss = 0 LP (as they probably would be minus from the game anyway)\n\nJunglers would only be at a disadvantage if they just stayed in jungle. This system would encourage them to gank and take objectives (which a lot have been failing to do recently).\n\nThese ideas would create a game of strategy, and teamwork, as LoL is supposed to be, rather than &quot;who can hit the keys faster&quot;.\n\nPlease like or leave a constructive comment with any suggestions or thumbs up :D\nI hope a RIOT employer will actually read this. \nFor all those that read all the way to the bottom, here&#039;s a cookie~! {{item:2054}} \n\nSincerely,\n\nCyanShinobi (Playing since 2013)","replies":[{"poster":"Lord Kylar Alice","date":"2016-02-01T03:56:28.355+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rank goes up based on how consistently you can win the game.

However, it doesn't matter how skilled or experienced you are if the rest of the team doesn't coordinate with you.\n\nThat's why sometimes you can't be the leader.

Wars of attrition are boring.\n\nThe game is about strategy, yes. However, planning out actions means nothing if you don't execute them properly, which is why a large number of winning games are lost. Throws because someone has abandoned strategy, the strategy was bad, or the enemy outsmarted you.\n\n> Do you play COD or Battlefield?

Throws because someone has abandoned strategy, the strategy was bad, or the enemy outsmarted you.\n\nCurrently the game** isn't **about strategy. Yes, deciding your position per game (leader or follower, carry or supp) is a part of strategy, and is fluid depending on the current situation during the match, however without a common goal, or objective, roles are lost and meaningless and with only winning as the goal, might as well only have 1 person per team. \nThrows happen because there is no strategy in the beginning, only an end goal with no thought on how to obtain it. \nStrategies in game are fluid and having the LP points on objectives would give an indication as to whether the current strategy is working or not. \nFor example, I would suggest, don't follow that one enemy, stay at this turret and we'll kill them then push. They follow, all die due to them not seeing that all the enemy has respawned. I'm left defending turret.\nHaving the LP on objectives and a minus for deaths and loss of objectives, makes the team weigh the benefits of the current strategy and going, hey, maybe we should change it to, \"all group in mid and push down their turrets\" or \"grab a dragon and take bot tower as we've lost all of our bot towers\".\n\n> Depends on the game mode. In some you need a team, in some you can carry by yourself easily.\n\nIt was my mistake using a game I don't really know. But was an exercise to see that you're going to oppose me no matter what.\nI'm guessing the current ranking system is working in your favour. So why change it?\nI'm not suggesting to change the system because I'm in Bronze and can't rise, I'm suggesting to change it to make it more reasonable and reliable, and again more about strategy. If this system was in place, I could well and truly remain in bronze, but I would know that it is because of **my** current strategy and game play, and not because of random chance of team mates and whether they work well as a team or not.\n\nAlso I was under the impression that downvoting was used if it was offensive, not related to the topic, or spam. Not because you didn't agree with it.\n\nIt would be nice to see what an actual RIOT employer thinks of this and whether it has any merit or not. And if so why.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Z3npachi","date":"2016-02-01T04:20:42.955+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"All that matters is winning. Your kda/stats/cs mean nothing.
