Leveling up that fast doesn't give them time to adjust to new Runes or Masteries or Champions for that matter.\n\nIn Ranked maybe it could be, only if you have all T3 runes, all mastery points used, and the champ you chose has to have a T3 mastery....\n\nDefinitely with ranked there needs to be an experience or wins counter matching involved.","replies":[{"poster":"Yasei Doubutsu","date":"2016-06-15T05:53:08.972+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I've said it before on the really old league forums, and on these ones, and on a support ticket to riot.\nlvl 30 and 16 champs is fine for going into ranked, but I suggested they needed at least 1 teir 3 completed rune page, and over X amount of normal wins.\nI believe my initial suggestion for wins was 300-400.\n\nThen everything will be great.","replies":[]}]}]},{"poster":"Omni Presents","date":"2016-06-15T09:34:00.422+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"It's pretty simple these days to see what Riot are doing, and that is nothing but allow newer players to get to ranked faster and feel like they have not missed anything or taken too long to get there.\n\nWhilst we don't want new players to take too long to get anywhere, otherwise they may end up leaving before being able to play ranked, we don't want new players to ruin the game, too bad Riot don't care.","replies":[]}]}
