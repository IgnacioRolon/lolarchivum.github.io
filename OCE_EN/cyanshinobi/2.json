LOL.\n\nSo, what are your opinions about the game? About indifferent players? How do you respond to those players? Do nothing/Mute/Report/Help enemy team kill them? ha ha\nDo you take the game ultra seriously? To have fun? Or just to troll?\n\nComment Below~!\n\n- CyanShinobi","replies":[{"poster":"Exhausted","date":"2015-09-01T08:43:58.444+0000","up_votes":4,"down_votes":0,"body":"a good portion of OCE has a attitude problem, its slowly being addressed. \n\nalot of the time tho, those sorts of players tend to use that as an excuse for their bad play, rather then accept they made a mistake.\n\ni say nothing after they make this statement and just report them for neg attitude at post.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2015-09-01T09:37:36.406+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree.

If I do say something, I always word it carefully cause I know some people do take offense easily.

I play to have a bit of fun, but at the same time I do try and keep a civil attitude - a bit of friendly banter is always fun too. Don't push people who are there to have fun (unless it's ranked I guess, I only play norms), but it is worth making a bit of a point to people that ruin the fun, if all it does is start a fight though, just drop it and fountain dive!
