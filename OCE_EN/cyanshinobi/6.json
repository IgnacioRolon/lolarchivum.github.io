Won 6 out of the 10 games. Did quite well in all games. \r\nGet placed in BRONZE V!\r\nIf it&#039;s based on wins, like riot says, why did I get placed in Bronze 5. and not even high up! Placement 35!\r\nThere is no continuity, no clarity, it&#039;s just arbitrary placements. \r\n1st time I tried for ranked in 2014, I only won 3 games and got into Bronze 4!\r\nI was in Bronze 5 last season, cuz I didn&#039;t really play it. However, new season should not be based on your last season. If that was the case, what&#039;s the purpose of the promo&#039;s? the seasons? Why not just continue over from the year before so we don&#039;t get our hopes up only to be kicked in the face.\r\nI know no RIOT employee will answer this as they don&#039;t care about anyone below Platinum, but maybe the rest of you can help clarify.\r\n\r\nIs the promo&#039;s a crock of shit? Does it really have any impact in your placement? Are placements based on W/L or just arbitrary, pick a number from a hat?\r\n\r\nCheers for nothing RIOT. Waded through all the shit bronze with a few golden players just to be placed back with the shit bronzers.\r\n\r\nThere really is no getting out of Bronze, unless you have a competent team. Why bother having ranked if you&#039;ve made it impossible for people to advance?","replies":[{"poster":"DarkHorse360","date":"2016-01-28T07:19:04.460+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hate to say I agree with you. Like I'm not that good Silver/Gold at best, but bugger me dead. My mates had gold MMR and end up in bronze and they lost 2/3 close games out of 10. Be good if you guys could justify it that's all. I'm glad that this was posted but at the end of the day that is one of your weakest points RIOT. Constructive criticism that you definitely needed to hear. Also, the comment about getting 'kicked in the face', is exactly how your supporters feel.\nJames.","replies":[{"poster":"CyanShinobi","date":"2016-01-31T13:07:48.709+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah, like you said, it would just be nice to have a little bit of data that showed us exactly _why_ we are placed where we are.\nWrote an email, and got this automated response back.\n\n\n> Jan 28, 09:10\n> \n> Hello Summoner,\n> \n> The 2016 Season is a fresh start for everyone who plays ranked games. Your last season's performance carries weight, along with your placement matches, **but this doesn't necessarily mean you will be placed in the same division you ended in last season.**\n> \n> We made some changes to the Leagues system this season that should allow players to more quickly reach the League that appropriately reflects their skill level.
