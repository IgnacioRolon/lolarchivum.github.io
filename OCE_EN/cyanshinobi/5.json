The first time, I thought it was a bug with my computer (cuz it was having issues), but it's happened again, through the same means (logging in before patch is fully installed). Well, I hope that's the case anyway. Don't really want to uninstall and reinstall each patch, haha.\r\n\r\nIf anyone else is having this problem, try and wait for the download/installation of the patch to complete fully before logging in, and it might prevent it.....?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nCyanShinobi :)","replies":[{"poster":"MyrmidonHoplite","date":"2019-05-04T08:46:57.093+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"This happens all the time and now we seem to get patches every day or 2 and it gets stuck for at least 5mins sometimes up to 10, it all started with a patch 2 or so months ago","replies":[]},{"poster":"QAPLA","date":"2018-11-18T22:51:46.116+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Every patch I go to 100% then have to wait ages.
