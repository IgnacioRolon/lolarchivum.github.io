Anyway, if you would be interested in playing, you can join my raidcall group 'Guardians of Fortune'. Personally I prefer raidcall over skype for the simple fact that people can join the group, and start talking to me without them having to minimize my game or distract me. If you have any questions post them below or email me at 'skygoinghigh@gmail.com'.\n\nRaidcall DL link: http://www.raidcall.com/download.html\nGroup link (if needed): http://www.raidcall.com/go.php?sid=10271319\n\n- Thanks","replies":[{"poster":"Kadaj","date":"2015-01-04T04:49:06.328+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"I noticed you haven't had any hits, I'm actually looking for a Diamond+ coach at the moment, but they're not easy to find unless you have the money.\n\nUntil then, I'd happily play a few games with you.\n\nAdd me if you like.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Aver","date":"2015-01-04T20:29:48.251+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi I'm in bronze 2 dunno if that's what your aiming for or what not but anyways if your interested I'm a mid laner assassins mostly XD but I can also do every other if needed.\n\nAdd me if you want just msg me to let me know.","replies":[]}]}
