Even if my playing is instrumental to the victory, and even if I&#039;m the only one with an S, the honours always just goes to the person with the most kills or whoever got that penta.  As a support of course I&#039;m actively trying to avoid getting kills and doing showy plays myself, but rather enabling my team to do the same.\r\n\r\nYet another reason nobody wants to play support.  Mind you there&#039;s a bright side - at least that means I almost always get my preferred lane.","replies":[{"poster":"JesusForgotHisGA","date":"2017-07-26T04:58:50.363+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Support hardly ever gets recognised. You know why? Because everyone just assumes 'ok sure you have assists that's your job'. 90% of the time honour goes over to to the person who has the kills regardless of how they got them in the first place. It could of been the support player setting up majority of the kills yet you wont get any form of recognition for it. It's just how it goes.\n\nIn fact, I constantly get shit put on me because I went 1-3-25 etc. Everyone thinks because you dont have kills that you're a shit player, you cop all the abuse when you're losing. Support is the easy way out in the blame game.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nikkip","date":"2017-07-26T00:08:57.046+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Really? I'm a support main too, and if anyone asked me what is the best way to get honour I'd say \"play support\". Yeah if a player carries and gets a lot of kills they're in for a good chance to get multiple honours, but getting a lot of kills and carrying is not a reliable thing, and if you're playing a carry role you can be going a lot of games with not a single honour in sight. Support on the other hand, if you stick by your adc and do your best for them you're going to be first on their mind come honour time. I find it hard to get multiple honours as support but it's easiest to get at least one, and that's more steady progress than other positions tend to get. Support also has the best chance at making life-saving plays and honourable plays where you show you're willing to follow someone else's lead or protect them even if you die for them, and people tend to remember that when it turns out well. I think it was a Zilean support match where I got all 4 honours one time, I kept ulting people at the right time and keeping them in play.","replies":[]},{"poster":"AnÄ±ma","date":"2017-07-25T23:41:11.804+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"In terms of skill support (below masters generally) is the weakest role to play. Unless you're playing Thresh and landing Madlife hooks I doubt that you will be showing more skill or w/e than your mid, adc etc which MOST people give honor for (unless there's a very kind player in the game and they get it). In addition, I see supports get honored a lot, you could just be unlucky. As an adc I almost always honor my support and I see a lot of adcs doing that too. Supports generally play consistently well whereas on teams a lot of the time there would be a player who would play better than that, mainly because you can only show a certain degree of skill as a support and every other role surpasses it by so much. Being positive/nice in game will get you honors if you want them badly, from my experience extremely nice people get honors flung at them.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Fitzky","date":"2017-07-25T13:24:49.137+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"Nobody wants to play support because it's the most boring thing to play, I don't see how people find it fun standing at the back of a teamfight shielding and healing people. Or just mindlessly throwing around an opponent hoping one of your braindead teammates manages to kill them. The only semi-fun support champion I can think of is thresh only because landing a good hook gives you some sense of satisfaction.","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2017-07-25T14:18:10.007+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find zilean, bard and nautilus to be pretty fun supports. \n\nZilean is a mage with decent damage, high utility, reasonable flexibility, a playstyle that revolves around using atrocious movespeed to position and setup good large AoE lockdown with his 1.5s stun, and to keep enemies who get caught out slowed to the point where they begin to wonder if they should just stand still and take it.\n\nBard is fun because roaming is fun and watching the midlaner have a fit in the allchat because you turned up and ruined their all in is always fun. Building full damage leads to some hilarious 1 shots but tanky shielder is ok too and you also have the potential to win or lose the game depending on how you ult. Also with portals there are so many ways to control the dynamic of a position.\n\nNautilus is fun because he has a hook for engage, a plethora of cc to lockdown squishies, an ult which can throw an enemy teamfight into utter disarray when they try to work out whether they should keep trying to stay in front of their fleeing adc, or to abandon them and scatter to avoid being knocked up and then impregnated by a yasou, and once you get going your damage and tankiness allows you to do basically whatever you want until teamfights come around, where you can still kind of do whatever you want, as the enemy team tries to deal with you and your 4000 health 300 ar/mr and your sunfire and thornmail, unless your team fell behind and you opted for stone plate, in which case I meant 7000 health a locket shield which makes assassins cry, and still kind of decent damage.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Kpopalypse","date":"2017-07-25T13:43:40.708+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I find support great fun, more satisfying than any other role.
