I restarted my client thinking it would work, but instead all I got was the LoL logo in the middle of the screen for about a minute and the &quot;UserKernel&quot; process not responding in the task manager. After this, the logo would just disappear and nothing would appear on the screen or on the task bar, the client simply would not open at all.\n\nI&#039;ve tried to clean install, I&#039;ve tried replacing UserKernel in the LoL folder and I&#039;ve tried copying a game from someone else, all of which leads the  same problem described above. For some reason, the Riot Support Website as well as the Merch Store wouldn&#039;t load, however other parts of the OCE LoL website would load.\n\nThe weird thing is, once I tried to use my phone hotspot instead of WiFi, the LoL client opened with no problems and the two LoL websites mentioned above also loaded. I have no idea what problems my laptop/internet are causing to cause this problem. \n\nJust a note that there is someone else with the same laptop as me and on the same internet, they have no problems running LoL or opening the websites mentioned above.\n\n**TL;DR: League of Legends client and Support Website won&#039;t open on WiFi, however they will work with no problems when using another source of internet (Mobile Hotspot). \n**\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-01-19T13:05:54.960+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi,\n\nThe issue you're describing actually seems to be related to your DNS settings having trouble with riotgames.com (which the launcher and the support site rely on).
