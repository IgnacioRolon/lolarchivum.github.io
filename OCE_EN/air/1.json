I'll review them and offer what i think could help.\n\n\n\n1. how do you handle defeat? \n2. how do you handle success?\n3. do you feel you tilt easy? Rage etc..\n\nthe reason i ask these questions is, if its not a mechanical/skill issue then attitude is next in line.\n\n\n\nalso\n\nthe one recent game you had ( a malphite game) available to spectate, i noticed the last team fight was abit.... forced. team was split, and your engage wasn't on the backline.\n\n\nReally would like to help :)\n\n\n\nFor Professional Help\n\n1. I'd recommend you get about 10 match replays saved and send them into https://www.youtube.com/user/foxdropLoL\nhe quite enjoys doing analysis on replays, as long you don't have a problem the replay being used in his videos..\n\n2. I'd also recommend getting in touch with some of the ADC challenger players if able. ask for some suggestions or touch base on any questions you may have which are bugging you. ","replies":[]}]}
