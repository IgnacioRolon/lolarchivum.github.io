It accommodates hundreds of concurrent players from all regions, but is mostly comprised of NA, OCE, and the EU regions.\n---\nWe offer Looking for Group channels for the NA/EU/OCE players, and several voice channels for anyone to utilize. Tags are given so everyone can be distinguished by their server(s) to facilitate finding groups. Wuks (Arbiter, admin) has recently added a bot for various commands and a music channel as well!\n---\nThe Community Chat Discord boasts the presence of 6 Rioters and 32 Volunteer program members. Since it's run by the knowledgeable and experienced members of Volunteer programs (such as the Arbiters and Emissaries) this Discord is also a great place to reach out for information and tips, as we're always happy to help. Or you can just hang out with us!\n---\nOur rules align closely with League's [Summoner's Code](http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/get-started/summoners-code/) so that all players can enjoy their stay.\n\nFeel free to stop by,\nDTN\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/4b1175eedc36388144f326a36b04826a.png\n\nLink: https://discord.me/lolchat","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-03-25T17:20:21.184+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"doesn't like me :(\n\nhttps://gyazo.com/1194c73c40ebc2a9ca35579c92e7052e","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-26T23:01:38.646+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Sorry, try this; https://discord.me/lolchat","replies":[{"poster":"Jason","date":"2017-03-27T01:42:28.012+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> [{quoted}](name=Deep Terror Nami,realm=NA,application-id=mR0UmRrp,discussion-id=IBUY7Hn7,comment-id=00020000,timestamp=2017-03-26T23:01:38.646+0000)\n>\n> Sorry, try this; https://discord.me/lolchat\n\nits the exact same link, and it doesn't work again","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2017-03-27T04:32:10.904+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah I don't get this thing, here; https://discord.gg/WkcrNrW","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"Miicka","date":"2017-03-24T15:32:46.443+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey\n\nServer looks awesome, but the invite is expired.
