It's definitely recommended that you have one, given the innate power and the stats they provide. They're at the bottom of each tree in the Mastery section and require 17 points in their respective tree in order to activate (plus one point into the keystone itself).\n\nThe Keystones are as follows:\nFerocity tree - Warlord's Bloodlust, Fervour of Battle and Deathfire Torch\nCunning tree - Stormraider's Surge, Thunderlord's Decree and Windspeaker's Blessing\nREsolve tree - Grasp of the Undying, Courage of the Colossus and Stoneborn Pact","replies":[]}]}
