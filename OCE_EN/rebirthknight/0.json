Resizing. I am using a 27inch monitor and I don&#039;t know if anyone else has thought of this, but I would like to see the client able to resize. The client that is currently in use can be dragged out and resized however the content is either fixed, or when resized the quality reduces. The alpha doesn&#039;t allow a resize and I think it would be nice to have a maximize feature (not a full screen feature).\n\nThe other thing Would be the friends list. Now I think some people have voiced that having the friends list permanently up is off putting. I believe it is nice to be there and it looks very clean and sleek, I don&#039;t really agree with the pop up from the bottom in the current client. What about having a pop-out option as a side panel or buttons instead. Giving more space for the user interface and not a lengthy bar on the bottom. \n\n** Just found the invite feature when in lobby you can invite via friends list. Love this feature, good work. \n\nSide note: When matching to a game it takes a while for the network to connect. Not too sure if that is just a network thing or the client not being able to take in the information fast enough. Also after a game I was really confused on how to get back to the home screen after realising that there was an exit button next to &#039;play again&#039; maybe make it a bit more visible (as in make it stand out more?).  \n\nQuestion: When releasing the store. For context, in the original client when viewing the store we can access skins and champions or looking at runes, however if you going into your profile and go back into the store, the store will be refreshed and take you back to the feature page. Will we be able to view the store and then view other tabs (Profiles, News, Collection...) and go back to where we left off in the store without a store refresh? I just find that to be an annoyance when I am checking my profile (masteries and runes) after looking at champions and skins, etc. for the store to be refreshed every single time.\n\nNEW** So on the note of the friends list. I was thinking of a drop down from where the notifications come up and that you can change between friends and clubs instead of a pop up side panel. Just another thought I had last night whilst I was on the client. That being if you intend to keep it in the fixed position. I have been talking to other people who are not on the alpha client and they would rather prefer a pop up than a fixed list so it gives them more space in the client. If hex tech is supposed to be steampunk then you would like something that has gadgets that can pop out in a stylistic way than have it fixed. Again, just a thought. Keep up the hard work.","replies":[{"poster":"Hawkwing","date":"2016-05-22T04:29:14.539+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed, re-size would be amazing. {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}}","replies":[]},{"poster":"nap","date":"2016-05-20T23:12:31.641+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Resizing is good.\n\nJust further to this, relating to placement, I also with a 27\" screen, place the window to one side of my screen, and when I close and reopen, the window will always center.
