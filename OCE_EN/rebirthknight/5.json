You can play it in any game (Except ARAM). How does MUSICAL CHAMPS work?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Pick lane. \r\nStep 2: At 10 seconds left on the clock: click the random button non-stop until the timer locks a champ in. \r\nStep 3: Profit.\r\n\r\nPlayed and won a game as Mid Taric first time Taric against an Ahri and Malphite ADC against Blitz and Draven. Was amazing and loads of fun. You can get the weirdest matchups. Wondering if anyone has ever played something similar to this, or if they have their own kind of games. Or have you already tried this out, who did you get and where.","replies":[{"poster":"Roguestoney","date":"2016-10-17T23:35:06.366+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah done this a few times with my mates.
