{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-05-30T21:13:21.391+0000","title":"Regularity Review #1","subforum":"Client Discussion","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hello dear summoners, \n\nSo I have been seeing that no one has really been posting anything for a while. So I thought I would make a regularity post and post up the threads that have intrigued me so far. I will repost some stuff here as well and I would like to hear your thoughts. Lets generate some discussion, have some debate and see what we come up with. \n\nI would love to hear what people have experienced between the two operating systems MAC and PC and if there are any troubles you have found along the way. In a &#039;recent thread&#039; [[Suggestion] Re-add the Division symbol (dia,plat,gold etc..) if your friend is ranked. ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client/V05QWrTd-suggestion-re-add-the-division-symbol-diaplatgold-etc-if-your-friend-is-ranked) (which was kinda already answered) I posed the question. \n\n> \"Well since this has come up why don't discuss the appearance of the chat. What would like to see when you hover someone's name what would like it to look like? The tiers is good to have, and frequently played is good to have to see who would you like to play with in order to fill certain roles. Should we also like to have frequently played positions as well? Taking the information from ranked so we know who to invite to our ranked games? Not that we get people to invite two mid lanes and then there is tention in the group?\n> \n> I know that it is still bare bones and all. But the shape of the pop-out I would like to have that hext tech feel. Something mechanical and edgy. Something not so squared off maybe (I'm just throwing out some ideas).\"\n\n\nThere has also been some connection problems e.g. slow response to connecting to the lobby, the client not responding to your champion pick or it being very slow or connecting to the chat very very late.... Whilst typing this out I am trying to get into game through the Alpha Client (AC), tried to click on Ekko and it just wouldn&#039;t let me select the champ or any other champ because it was trying to process (Riot, I hope you are reading these messages) leaving me to wait for five minutes because the AC can&#039;t give me my champ. You can find the thread  [everyone else connecting to chat before me ](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client/LePdgGuR-everyone-else-connecting-to-chat-before-me)\n\nI also like to hear peoples thoughts on any other visuals that you would like to see, or would like changed. Personally when making my lobby I don&#039;t like the background picture. Kinda throws me off, something similar to the Ranked background is nice, simplistic and never gets old. I know this has nothing to do with the client, but I would also like a revamp of the loading screen when going into game. \n\nIf you have read my previous threads before I have noted the idea of resizing the client and positioning of certain applications within the client. Link is here [Resizing/Scaling and Positioning](http://boards.oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/alpha-client/ac8EWEzV-resizingscaling-and-placement) and I still update and edit it whenever I get some other thoughts that revolve around that. As well as my idea of getting the community together into a club which I have named &#039;The Alphas&#039; where we can chat live and discuss the client before we right reports. So we can get feedback before we post something knowing that it is a bug or not an example someone couldn&#039;t see the end game chat alongside a few others, where other people could. Having the information presented straight away can clear up any confusion and a report can be sent. \n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on the AC patches and how profiles have been made available for the PBE alpha but not the live alpha, so we still need to wait a while to taste that sweet alpha nectar or freshness. You can read more on the www.surrenderat20.net website, I encourage and recommend everyone to read through the updates on that site as some of it may direct to us here and there. \n\nLastly, add my IGN and join the club would love to hear more so please comment bellow. Hope you are all joining the alpha and I look forward to hearing back from you all soon. \n\nPeace, {{sticker:slayer-pantheon-thumbs}} \n\n-RK","replies":[{"poster":"Mindstar","date":"2016-05-31T07:16:50.809+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for the great write-up!  Although we don't always reply we do read these posts for sure, and it is great to see the community getting involved and giving us feedback in this way.\n\nQuestion for you, and everyone else:\nIt has been a couple of weeks now - What do you like best?  What do you like least?\n\nCheers!\nMindstar","replies":[{"poster":"Fed In Vayne","date":"2016-06-03T03:47:49.623+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"hey there's one thing that I believe needs to addressed right away...\n\nim not sure if it's a bug or not but when you mute audio in the settings found at the top of the page.. you cannot hear the sound of the queue triggering.. I have missed so many queue's because I cant deal with listening to music and this BLARING sound coming from the league client... and when I'm alt tabbed you cant see the queue pop\n\npls do a hot fix or something {{champion:32}} {{item:3070}}","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-06-04T03:02:15.305+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Yeah audio seems to be a problem here and there. Sometimes the end game music keeps on playing, even if minimized, where as the legacy client stops all music when minimized. \n\nI really like the fluid look of the alpha client. I am getting more accustomed to the friends chat list. But would like to see it change to how it incorporates LOL Clubs. There is still a lot of work to go, so I can't make a complete statement about it other than what I have already said in my previous thread 'Scaling/Resizing and Placement'.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
