Half an hour after my purchase Ziggs was discounted to 50% off the full price to 675RP. \r\nI was wondering if I would be able to get some RP back (being charged for the discounted price) seeing that it wasn&#039;t too long after Ziggs went on discount sale.\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n\r\nRebirthKnight","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-10T09:52:47.638+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey there,\n\nSorry to hear this happened, however support no longer offers refunds in cases such as these as the [sales are announced in advance](http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/store/sales/may-sales-schedule).\n\nYour only option in this situation is to use a refund token (if you have any left) and then re-purchase the skin at the lower price.","replies":[{"poster":"RebirthKnight","date":"2016-05-10T10:51:02.826+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hi SephirothSG,\n\nUnfortunately on the OCE page the rotation was posted more than 18hrs before  the skins are released on the client at a random time. Unfortunately I missed out by 30 mins because of the random timing that the deal was released. I unfortunately do not have any refund tokens, and it is a shame you can't get 1 refund token at the beginning of each season or something of the sort.\n\nThank you for the reply. It just sucks that I just spent 1350RP (which we all know is not cheap) to a skin that is now 675RP because of random releases during the day and not at the beginning of the week. \n\nKindest Regards, \n\n\nRK","replies":[{"poster":"SephirothSG","date":"2016-05-10T10:56:29.868+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"The sales schedule was posted 22 days ago, not 18 hours ago.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
