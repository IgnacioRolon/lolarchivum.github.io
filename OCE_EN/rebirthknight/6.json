Every time I play a ranked I find the main problem is that my team is not communicating well majority of the time. I was thinking that the concept of an integrated voice chat within the game could help people close the gap in communication. I know this can spawn problems in a negative way if you  consider trollers. However, what happens when you can opt-in and out of voice chat. Meaning those who agree to using it and enable the feature can talk to those who have opted-in to use the feature. But those who have not cannot hear their teammates voice chat, again by opting-in you also have the ability to mute, but I believe that people would be more co-operative with more communication than typing in chat where text can be misunderstood more so than voice. \r\n\r\nWould like to hear your thoughts on this.\r\n\r\n-RK.","replies":[{"poster":"Gritty Kitty","date":"2016-11-13T10:32:52.973+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Agreed. Like when i'm playing bot with random adc's i aint time to type  \"Don't dive because their support is comming back to lane any second now.\" So many deaths and misplays oculd be prevented if could just speak instead of droppign everything we're doing to type in chat.","replies":[]}]}
