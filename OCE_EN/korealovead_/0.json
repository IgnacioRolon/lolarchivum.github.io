As you submit your request, here are some tips that will hopefully get you that extra bit of RP to use in the store: \n\n1. Be sure to submit as much information in your initial ticket as possible. For obvious reasons, each Player Support Specialist's request for more information will delay the resolution of the issue.\n2. Be respectful and polite in your correspondences with Riot Support. (They're doing their best to help you!)\n3. Try not create a new ticket or respond to an existing ticket before a Player Support Specialist has had the chance to review your request. New tickets/replies may bump your ticket back to the bottom of the queue, thus increasing the amount of time before a Player Support Specialist is able to review your ticket.  \n\n\nSpecifically regarding your RP request, keep in mind the following: \n\n\n1. Player Support has no obligation to fulfill the request. \n2. I've heard that you might have a much better chance of getting that extra amount of RP if you submit a drawing of a champion or a skin that you've created! \n3. If you do get an RP grant, there's no double dipping. These grants are given at maximum once per account per lifetime.\n\n\n**If you're unsure where to put your ticket in, just select:**\n[*I have a question about League of Legends/Riot Games.*] > [*Game and Features*] > [*General Questions*]\n\n\nWith that being said, good luck!","replies":[]}]}
