This seems rather unfair considering a lot of games are lost because I am playing 4v5 due to one of the above players. It really hurts to lose so much when the cause of a lost game was clearly not my fault. Surely I should be rewarded for not AFKing, disconnecting, hugging the fountain or feeding. \r\n\r\nMathematically it should be easy enough to calculate how long a single player spends in the fountain (because they&#039;d spat the dummy) and or dying all the time because they were feeding or AFK or disconnected and compare it to the total length of the game. That time-out calculation could either be used as a punishment in LP or use the time-in calculation as a small reward in LP. Then the people who are serious about ranked would not feel like they are stuck in ELO Hell because of other people. Don&#039;t you think that would be fairer?\r\n\r\nPlease vote if you think this is a good idea.","replies":[]}
