However the next game I queue into he is again on my team and instantly bans my chosen champion.\r\n\r\nSo basically I see this as a failure. Reporting doesn&#039;t seem to be working at all. Why would Riot add that same player onto my team again?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-20T09:50:01.497+0000","up_votes":3,"down_votes":0,"body":"It seems likely he received a chat restriction. 14 day bans are typically reserved for repeat offenders or things like hate speech.","replies":[{"poster":"serenart","date":"2018-07-20T09:56:03.964+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for making that clear, however it still leaves me with having to dodge from a badly matched teammate yet again. That's my point. It's ruining my games not his.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-20T10:09:15.408+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Of course, and it sucks. Normally you wouldn't be matched with them again but I suppose at midday (give or take for timezones) a lot of people are at work or doing other things. It's not the ideal scenario.","replies":[{"poster":"serenart","date":"2018-07-20T10:35:31.190+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I agree with you, however I've seen this sort of thing at night as well. In particular specific trolls (not naming any names) who do the rounds of choosing champs that can destroy their own teammates (i.e. Anivia, Trundle, Ryze etc.) and therefore force a loss. The leader of this group is constantly being reported and he admits in his own words \"i've been reported hundreds of time but never been punished\". I get matched up with him at night because i play mid and he doesn't. So I can be teamed up with him time and time again. I have to check his account on op.gg to see if he is in a game before I can play again. These guys are ruining it for me in OCE but he's not being punished, I am cause I have to dodge when I'm matched with him or his mates (again not naming any names, but I have a list of them and they still keep on playing leaving a trail of lost ranked games behind them).","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2018-07-20T11:19:14.247+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"That's definitely not the kind of behaviour anyone wants to see, except I suppose the trolls themselves. Personally I would recommend sending your list and any supporting evidence you have (screenshots of chat etc) to Player Support. They can't give you any info about anyone else's accounts, including even alluding to any form of punishment so you will just get a generic \"thanks for your report\" kind of reply, but at least then it should be followed up since apparently the automated system isn't catching them.\n\nhttps://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new","replies":[{"poster":"serenart","date":"2018-07-20T11:41:28.331+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thank you. Fortunately because I have the list of names I always dodge so I don't have any recent history. But I will submit it to support to see if anything can be done about it in the future. They would be getting so many reports about them anyway to substantiate my claims.
