The only common reason they wouldn't would be there was an error with ticket submission or you have bumped the ticket (replied before receiving a response) which puts you back at the bottom of the queue, so if it's been longer than that it's a bit unusual.\n\nAs for your issue, connection trouble isn't my forte, beyond connecting to ethernet and checking your ISPs site for any info on maintenance or anything of the sort support is probably your best bet.","replies":[]}]}
