So let&#039;s play hide and seek on the summoners rift :). First, as a hider, you have 30 seconds to get into a jungle area. (Purple circle)  http://i68.tinypic.com/2efkflv.png . Once a hider enters the jungler area, they cannot leave (as doing so requires you to cross lanes). The hiders are only allowed to use red trinkets, and the seekers can only use green ones, and are able to travel around the whole map. \r\n\r\nsooo yeah, this is just my idea of hide and seek because i love that game mode and i still want to play it :( thanks~ If you have any questions, feel free to ask","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-24T07:39:20.709+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Very nice idea,\n\nchatroom: HidenSeekSR","replies":[{"poster":"TrashDonnut","date":"2016-02-24T07:41:59.757+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"For those new to HnS, here are the rules.\n\n1.

You are only allowed in the jungle, and out through the wall gates to get into the jungle after you die (this was how I played it anyway) You can cross to the other side of the jungle ONLY through the very middle of mid lane (at river).\n\n3 No buffs/smites/etc, they are too strong, especially wolf/red. Baron/Herald would screw up the minions, you need three drags for the move speed so it's not worth it, and all the others aren't all that useful.\n\nGiven the size of SR I would think that Blue trinkets may be allowed instead of yellow but only maybe 5 for each team. If there are 5 down you cant use another until one gets destroyed. That seems fair to me. But yellow trinkets work too.\n\nLargely Hide and Seek comes down to honour rules and restrictions that vary from host to host but, there are a few constants like banning invis champs.","replies":[{"poster":"You Tried","date":"2016-02-24T13:27:31.497+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Add me?","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2016-02-25T02:01:45.554+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Feel free to add me in game if you want, I haven't played much hide and seek, and we played on SR cause we had too many people so it was just an experiment a long while ago now.","replies":[]}]}]}]},{"poster":"StarTraveller","date":"2016-02-26T22:01:22.063+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Does Skarner get banned for seekers/hiders","replies":[]},{"poster":"Icarus1314","date":"2016-02-25T03:46:47.327+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"teemo laughs\n\nedit: just read the rule... teemo crys","replies":[]},{"poster":"Talon12","date":"2016-02-24T08:56:14.066+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"just leave it at \"riot fucked up\"","replies":[]}]}
