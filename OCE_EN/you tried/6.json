I'd suggest hard resetting your modem and router by unplugging them for 5 minutes. If it's packet loss you're getting and it doesn't go away, you may need to contact your ISP for help. If you are still getting lag on your end, please post the results of your tracert here. Let me know if anything works.\n\n-DTN","replies":[{"poster":"You Tried","date":"2016-02-10T08:24:01.680+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Tracing route to 103.240.227.25 over a maximum of 30 hops\n\n  1     1 ms     1 ms    <1 ms  192.168.1.1 \n  2    57 ms    62 ms    59 ms  rdl800.ba.optusnet.com.au [198.142.130.26] \n  3     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  4     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  5     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  6     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n  7    91 ms   101 ms    96 ms  59.154.142.94 \n  8   105 ms    88 ms    89 ms  61.88.116.210 \n  9     *        *      102 ms  104.160.156.37 \n 10   102 ms   100 ms    98 ms  104.160.156.105 \n 11     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 12     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 13     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 14     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 15     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 16     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 17     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 18     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 19     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 20     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 21     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 22     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 23     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 24     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 25     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 26     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 27     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 28     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 29     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n 30     *        *        *     Request timed out.\n\nTrace complete.","replies":[{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-10T09:38:36.266+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey Sytosis,\n\nOne of the Wrenchman helped me with some corrections. The *Request Timed out* could be caused by those particular servers not responding to ICMP request, which isn't an issue but interferes with a traceroute.\n\nHe (SephirothSG) suggests downloading the [WinMTR Network Diagnostic Tool](http://winmtr.net/download-winmtr/). Use that to run a traceroute to the following IP's (allow this to run for 5-15 minutes)\n\n>103.240.227.25\n103.240.227.5\n\nExport the results to a text file and paste them here.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Deep Terror Nami","date":"2016-02-10T08:52:18.367+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"> ##Disregard and read the other reply please.\n\nOk, when it says \"Request timed out\", that means the data isn't getting back to you and is called \"Packet Loss\". Sometimes it'll be indicated by * asterisks.\n\nAnyway, if you haven't hard reset your router and modem yet, do that and run the tracert again. If you have done so and are still showing packet loss like this, you'll want to contact your ISP so they can fix it.","replies":[]}]}]}]}
