They sound really awesome. The next steps would be for you to really nail the champion model! \n\nWhat would you do with his MAIN iconic features? For me that is his shoulder armour, his hair and his sword. Really think about what you would do to those elements to make them suit the Atlantic theme but also stay recognizable as those original iconic pieces.\n\nFor example if you look at **Talon**. All of his skins have his signature blade, and the bladeish cape. They manage to capture Talons silhouette  and make him recognizable in each skin while also making him different and fresh.","replies":[{"poster":"Wumachine","date":"2015-01-30T10:56:50.140+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"His blades and shoulder armor could be made of ice crystals (maybe coral) and his hair can be blue watery tentacles, similar to atlantean syndra, that or a cluster of jellyfish tentacles.\n\nhttp://www.lanzaroteoceanfilmfestival.eu/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/jellyfish_865.jpg","replies":[]},{"poster":"lvl69stickwizard","date":"2015-01-30T06:03:02.108+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"that is true well if you look at the other atlantic skins their armour you probably be the same type of design just tailored to yasuo's design but thanks for the tip","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Rage Incarnate","date":"2015-01-29T08:14:58.122+0000","up_votes":2,"down_votes":0,"body":"Hey man, this is a really good Idea and I would also appreciate a Atlantic Yasuo skin as well! \nHopefully someone with the right design skill would hit you up and help you with this brilliant Idea !
