But one day the village uprises using their magic to fight against he void creatures resulting in a catastrophic battle resulting in the annihilation of his whole village and having all the remaining children sent to the void as sacrifices to the creatures within.(something along the lines of that). after 12 years helmet bro( or what his name may be) is being train by a void creature or warlock/wizard to use void powers at his will. secretly helmet bro has been waiting to take revenge by eliminating all void creatures so after learning how to use void portals helmet bro found his chance to escape and found himself in the league of legends where he could defeat all the void creatures there to get revenge for his village. (something like this should be enough to explain the battle he had with velkoz and make this lore something like this if you may). \r\n\r\n\r\nAbilities:\r\n\r\nQ: void strike: helmet bro charges his void powers in one strike that silences or stuns an enemy or champion.\r\nW: void portal: helmet bro creates a portal to the void resulting in being untargetable for 2.5 seconds.\r\nE: void essence: Passive:helmet bro gains extra ad but at the cost of some hp every auto attack. it can be deactivated.\r\nR: void wave: helmet bro shoves his sword into the ground does a AOE damage to any near by champs in the radius.\r\n\r\nAppearance:\r\n.some sort of void shield on his back\r\n.2 handed sword\r\n. purple armor that looks like void armor\r\n.his helmet \r\n.purple cape with gold outline\r\n\r\nthis is something that can help you start it off, later ill have a picture as well.","replies":[{"poster":"Crusader charlie","date":"2015-03-10T22:33:31.528+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"plot twist, its kassadin","replies":[]},{"poster":"Sobriquet","date":"2015-03-10T07:55:39.262+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"helmet bro?\n\nnot exactly exotic.....or specifically a name for one person.......","replies":[{"poster":"BarryButcher","date":"2015-03-10T08:39:23.049+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Helmet Bro is a real \"character\" in League.
