Isn&#039;t that going against what the entire Stealth thing but why Rengar is the only one who has that disadvantage but some champs doesn&#039;t like Eve, Twitch, Talon, Kha&#039;Zix,...","replies":[{"poster":"Nightjar","date":"2019-01-25T07:52:04.010+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i mean eve has the choice of whether to reveal her presence in exchange for cc and and damage, Khazix only has short bursts of stealth, Talon has those daggers shoot out, and you can kinda guess where he might be based on his movespeed and the start point. Twitch doesn't have alot of bursty and kinda relies on coming out of stealth at both the right time and positioning.\n\nAlso rengo has plenty of damage to make up for his presence being indicated. If you compare base damage, ratios and the auto resets, Rengar is one of the scariest assassins.","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-25T14:07:55.790+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Rengar also gets a lot of mobility for a long time. He can ult from a solid distance away, and even knowing where he's coming from, rarely stops him from ulting, just gives the other team a chance to set up. If you had no indicator at all the best you could do would be huddle and hope really, which isn't healthy counterplay. The indicator doesn't really tell you all that much, only the approximate direction.","replies":[{"poster":"AgiDeath","date":"2019-01-26T03:00:25.537+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch can do the same thing with the time as long as Rengar and Eve is just permanent until she does something, old evolved ult Kha can basically run around freely in the jungle and no one knows even pink ward","replies":[{"poster":"Ninox","date":"2019-01-26T03:09:00.178+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Twitch is much more vulnerable than Rengar, and his damage is sustained not burst. Eve again has weaknesses than Rengar doesn't, her movespeed isn't permanent, and she can't turn her invis on she has to wait for it.\n\nOld Kha is kind of irrelevant, because it's old for a reason.","replies":[{"poster":"AgiDeath","date":"2019-01-26T04:40:20.998+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"You can read my reply to Nightjar for some of the information.

Eve can permanently stealth and no one knows where she is until she does something and the whole point of stealth in general is to not let the enemy know where u are then why Rengar is being revealed when others not.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"AgiDeath","date":"2019-01-26T04:37:50.230+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Eve has 2 ability with 400 base damage and 2.5s charm with 35% MR reduction and she can permanently stealth until she does something to reveal herself. Twitch can't do burst damage besides his E (kinda bursty I guess) but he can stealth without being noticed and if u bring Twitch jungle u can lv2 gank easily and the enemy has to flash or die to it (worst case is both because he can position himself behind the enemy  and flash follow if needed) Twitch is also a really strong late game carry with the right timing and team comp he can melt everyone in no time so he's a scary boy as jungler and late game carry. Talon is the same as Rengar but has a better roaming potential because to him there's no wall to block the way which makes him very mobile and high damage as well.\n\nRengar do got some high damage if uses correctly but his kit is a one-way ticket once go in u'll stay in there and to completely obliterate squishies he has to sacrifice survivability for damage and if u go for survivability they will have the time for counterplay and kite u out so u'll die because u are in the middle of there team.\n\nTo me, bruiser Rengar top is way better than Rengar Jungle just because you'll be more mobile and can use the full potential of your kit than jungle Rengar just because of the stacking and bushes, u can't jump from a bush to lane like Camille to get that sweet 1 stack to do something.\n\nAnd Kha'Zix only has his stealth last for 1.25s or 2s and can reactivate for 2 or 3 times with passive reset that deals around 50-300 per reset and increased MS so he can stick onto u like glue.\n\nThat's some of my thoughts on those champs u mentioned I cannot cover all of it but if u have anything to say I'd be happy and talk with you about it.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"Broken Scripts","date":"2019-01-25T06:35:26.133+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Pyke also has his stealth pretty much revealed to enemies + he gets revealed when too close.
