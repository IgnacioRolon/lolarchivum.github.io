You are the only angry person here. From what I can tell, you are the person who needs to learn from these commandments. Whenever someone says \"We have already read this\" or \"Stop spamming this all over the place\", you go ahead and be the toxic person. Anyway though, no one is coming to your defense of your continuous posting of this. So really, we are the majority and can claim a greater ownership of the community in that sense, as we are a greater portion of the community.\nYou have stated that you will post this more if it gets removed. That is spamming. Not only that, but it is Riot's say if it gets removed, not ours. On the first post of this I saw, you were acting arrogant and shouting \"THIS IS QUALITY, UNDERSTAND THAT!\", when no one else seemed to believe it was. No one is really interested in this post, and you just keep shoving it down out throats. This may be the appropriate board to post it on, and I am not saying it isn't.\n\nTL;DR, you claim to be wanting to reduce toxicity, but as soon as someone gets annoyed at your spamming you turn out to be the most toxic person around.","replies":[{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2014-12-18T06:57:04.222+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":4,"body":"So what your saying is you like afks, trolling, and ragers? thats what it sounds like.

Let me quote myself here, actually.\n> as soon as someone gets annoyed at your spamming you turn out to be the most toxic person around.\n\nDoes this say I am okay with ragers? No. In fact, it highlights the fact that I am bothered by your rage. You say I am not about the game at all, which doesn't make sense. If I wasn't about the game in any way, I would just post on forums more relevant to my interests. However, I am interested in League of Legends. I believe you need to take time to cool off and realise \"Hey, maybe it was wrong of my to shout abuse at everyone.\" I would like to see the community improve, which is why the fact that you are screaming at everyone who does not like spam bothers me.","replies":[{"poster":"Demon Incarnate","date":"2014-12-18T07:56:30.172+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":3,"body":"I got abused first. yea, putting me on on the defensive.
