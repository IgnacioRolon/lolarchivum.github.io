Welcome the Patch 6.12, the ARAM patch. While there are a decent amount of non-Howling-Abyss changes here, we figured we'd take this opportunity to speak directly to the poro-lovers of Murder Bridge. We don't often make straight adjustments to ARAM as a mode, so let's slap some context on that.","url":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-612-notes","image":"http://oce.leagueoflegends.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_medium/public/upload/patchnotes_2016header_0.jpg?itok=JWj0lssc"},"up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"As of the new patches fizz&#039;s e has had its cool down increased, to 9 seconds at max ranks before CDR. Am I the only one that still thinks it too short? I mean, with the new mage changes and itemization changes post patch 6.9 it is very easy to reach the maximum CDR cap of 45% with Fizz&#039;s standard build path. To prove my point lets do the calculations ([all build options taken from the highest viewed fizz build on MOBAfire](http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/season-6-fizz-guide-king-of-the-sea-349790) )):\r\n\r\n* 5% from Masteries - free\r\n* 10% from sheen on first back - 1050 gold\r\n* 20% from Morellonomicon rush - 2900 gold\r\n* 10% from Ionic Boots of Lucidity - 900 gold\r\n\r\nThis equates to 45% CDR (the cap) for only 4850 gold, not much if u ask me, and what does this do to his &quot;trickster&quot; it reduces the cool down from a average 9 seconds which i can live with to a measly 5.95 seconds (9 x 0.45 = 4.05, 9 - 4.05 = 5.95) which promotes an unhealthy attitude towards players that have to deal with him, there is a reason why he is currently ranked in god tier toplane, and a strong/ preferred choice in midlane ([according to nerfplz.com](http://www.nerfplz.com/2016/06/2016-champion-tier-list-ranked-dynamic.html) )) and i believe this has a lot to do with it. So what do you think, should we nerf it again?","replies":[{"poster":"Crunch","date":"2016-06-20T03:21:59.784+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I think that Fizz in combination with the nerf to his W damage the extra 2 seconds on his E is a reasonably significant amount specifically in the laning phase.\n\nThis has effectively increased the window of opportunity when laning against Fizz. An extra 2 seconds may seem negligible, but relative to the cooldowns of other midlane champs it can make a difference. 2 Seconds is long enough to be able to setup a gank or punish him off an extra couple of cs per time he uses it. Also the nerf to his W means that he won't be performing as strongly especially against the tank meta. \n\nTake into account that % missing hp is a great execute. Taking away 25% of this base damage will be more than noticeable when trying to execute someone. As it is a Damage-Over-Time source, it also gives HP Regeneration and allies a better chance at being able to peel or save you. \n\nI know Fizz is a super frustrating champion, but punishing his early game with good lane freezes and punishing the E cd with jungle ganks is key. The build you've suggested may give you 45% cdr, but in the scheme of things it also leaves you very squishy. One E won't get you to safety in a frozen mid lane, and if your flash is down it changes the mechanics of the lane and how aggressive you can be.\n\nRather than focusing on the nerfs not being enough, focus on how exactly the information can help you face him. Hope this helps :)","replies":[]},{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-15T13:04:38.421+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Using that build, you miss out on a lot of Magic Penetration.\n\nAdditionally, they also nerfed his W quite significantly and increased his size by a lot.\n\nSure, you could reduce the cooldown of Playful Trickster, but you become less useful during fights.","replies":[{"poster":"Armies of Me","date":"2016-06-15T13:15:44.713+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Ahh but you see, I was merely quoting the most gold efficient way to get to 45%, fizz can easily pick up sorcerers treads and an abyssal sceptre and he has flat mpen and a aoe magic resist lowering passive and even with this he still has 2 item slots to play around with","replies":[{"poster":"Corehog","date":"2016-06-15T13:28:56.961+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Fizz is also an assassin, designed to get out (or in depending on how you use your E).
