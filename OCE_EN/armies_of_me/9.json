Often you can be blocked without a single entry into said lobby, why is this. i believe that the chat block in lobby makes no sense, especially not in an environment where you must spam to make sure you get the lane you want. so thats my rant over, what do you guys think of it?","replies":[{"poster":"Bambooze","date":"2016-09-11T00:25:27.243+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I know. So many times I go into champ select (normals), only to be chat-blocked for some reason, and during the 5 seconds or so, all the lanes get chosen. It's very frustrating, and I don't even know where it comes from. Sometimes I won't say a thing in the Queue-lobby chat room, and all of a sudden I'm chat blocked at the beginning of champ select.\n{{sticker:zombie-brand-clap}}","replies":[]}]}
