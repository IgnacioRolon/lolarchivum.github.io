I actually think Khazix isnt in such a bad spot right now. For example I think that khazix is a much better vs tanks and can situationally be played well toplane. \n\nright now i am playing khazix jungle and lane. I dont think he is S tier by any measure but if I play well can definitely carry. I think the pen on Maw made his much more viable and the upcoming buffs will help him out.\n\nwhat example do you think he is lacking at the moment?","replies":[{"poster":"Shes my Princess","date":"2016-01-08T05:29:08.929+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"I don't think it's as much kha'zix being underpowered than it is rengar being overpowered.

the stats at riot somewhere, but I've seen this event so many times now and from memory kha has only won it once.\n\ni also play kha in lane (and i don't particularly want him buffed because i don't want everyone to start playing him) but he was definitely more powerful before the pre-season (wether that was due to him getting less powerful or all the AD squishes he preyed on getting wayyy more powerful i don't know)\n\nbut its clear that rengar is more powerful than him, not only his his win-rate way higher than kha's but he is picked over 3x more often (which says something i would think) \n\nhe definitely lacks the mana sustain early game if you're not jungling and forces you to build a tear now that sheen and tri-force don't get built on him anymore and with the loss of crystal flask, and when you're as squishy as he is against a garen or other juggernaught you need to be able to spam your abilities a bit more for farming.","replies":[]}]},{"poster":"ripne1","date":"2016-01-10T08:17:55.142+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"i agree jha and rengar are ment to be balanced but as it is atm rengar is so much

don't think he's a dominant jungler in the current Meta, i mean look at the current jungle Meta, you've got champions like Dr Mundo, Trundle, Rammus, Amumu and Lee Sin dominating the scene (But Lee has pretty much always been like that), these are all pretty tanky champions that regardless of whether they're fed or not still have a pretty significant impact on the game, the only really strong squishy champions i frequently see in the jungle are Rengar, Kindred and Shaco, but the one thing almost all squishy junglers have in common is the fact that they have to have a major impact in the early game to actually excel throughout the rest of the game, i don't think Khazix needs a buff i think it's just the current Meta that's making him look a bit weak. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tR-5hxF-1Q\n\nValkrin proves that Kha (if played properly) can carry games pretty hard (this game was uploaded yesterday) he also talks about Khazix and Rengar a lot in this game. \n\nI hope that helps.","replies":[]}]}
