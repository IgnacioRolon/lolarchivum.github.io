(Sorry to use strong words) But you have FAILED to address any new INFORMATION about this Ban.  First question: What was the program that banned him/\nSecond question: When did the program get detected? \nAnd third Question: Why is his ban 80 YEARS!!!\n\nSo you stated many times you can not reveal what program banned him, which is basically like hiding the murder weapon in a crime scene. But what's worse your not even giving hints as of which 3rd party program it is, e.g Script, Hack or Mod, we don't know because you won't TELL us which is making it harder for HIM to find out what he did wrong. \n\nYou also NEVER Stated WHEN it was detected. This is a crucial evidence which I feel can be reveal to the public as there is no way mods can do anything with this information to improve their 3rd party programs to be undetected. Back on topic because this is something that MYSTIC LLAMA asked many times in the PLAYER SUPPORT you RECOMMENDED but no response. After he asked that he was BLOCKED FROM asking any more questions which seems shady to me. \n\nIf you have detected him using this \"Program\" for a few days then you should have no problem telling us what program was used and determine how dangerous this \"Program\" is or even WARNING HIM that you guys have detect an illegal software and demand for him to take it down. On the other hand if you detected him and banned him on the same time it was detected then that is a very flawed and lazy system. It DESTROYS the whole point of being PLAYER SUPPORT. If that was the case you should just rename it to BOT SUPPORT because you CLEARLY don't care about your fan base if you just use bots to decide when to KILL someone's account with an 80 year sentence. Something that they invested so much time and money into, keeping them smiling during tough times and giving him such happy memories.\n\nNow another question that is yet to be answered is the 80 YEAR BAN!!! Why is this ban so long??? Even IF he did it, EVEN IF! For a 3rd party program of hacking, mod or scripting. A ban like this is uncalled for. You literally just said Maraudaur it was a \"temp suspension.\" 80 YEARS IS NOT A TEMP SUSPENSION, it is a LIFETIME sentence. So you mean the community that XiaoWeiJiao, an LCS player who got caught ELO BOOSTING was only banned from league of legends for 1 YEAR. But a random league player who is accused for a 3rd party program (which you WON'T even go into detail on) gets an 80 YEAR Sentence. \n This leads me to believe that is so called program is a Major fret and dangerous to you. Which might explain why you refuse to talk about the program's name/type or when you detected it.  Because this program is appears to be more dangerous than saying this \"Malphite you are a fucking worthless brainded scumfuck bastard pile of trash mental dickface that should be gunned down in the street like the degenerate you are\".  As this person was only banned for 19 days as oppose to 80 YEARS!\n\nSo riot or Maraudaur i don't think you would read all this but if you are only going to read one section of this, can you please read this. Riot/Maraudaur why is it that you refuse to unban this account or decrease the sentence to a more appropriate sentence. I'm sure you are human and as a human you can see that he LOVES his account and especially this GAME. Otherwise why would he spend so much money and hours on this game and send paragraphs after paragraphs of messages to the point where you guys Banned him from POSTING ON CHAT and Player Support. Please Riot/Maraudaur, everyone talks about how much they hate this game but the truth is, we LOVE THIS GAME, you guys have given us MILLIONS of hours of entertainment  and it's so Heart Breaking for us as a community to see you guys refuse to talk your LOYAL AND DEDICATED FAN BASE and treat us like we are disposable.\n\nMaraudaur do you really think Mysticllama would do something like this and if you think he does, do you really think he deserves an 80 Year sentence for using this 3rd party program?\n\nPlease don't leave us in the dark, Riots come from miscommunication and it's something that nobody would like as you would agree it is a waste of time and energy. \n\nFrom Riot Fan NSB","replies":[]},{"poster":"MysticLlama","date":"2016-06-01T08:22:11.627+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Thanks for trying...

Like I said above, there have been multiple responses from the player support team to him/her. But you're right, I should have responded at the time to let them know that Player Support are the best people to talk to.\n\nI can see what you are trying to say, your main basis is if people knew using x/y/z specific script was against the rules then they would stop. While that may be true for some players, for a lot of players that use scripts they know exactly what they are doing (cheating) and still choose to do it anyway.\n\nNaming the specific script will mean yes ultimately that one specific script will be used less, but it does not help us cure the root issue which is remove cheating in game. What it actually does is reduce X script usage, but then a few things happen.\n\n*note when I say players here I specifically mean players that are using scripts not the general player base.\n\na) Players stop using the specific program but continue to use other programs that were not listed or aren't currently being detected. (this causes our detection rate to decrease until new models of detection are ready, which results in more cheating)\n\nb) Players contact the script creator to adjust or create a new exploit, creating the arms race we want to avoid. (this would once again require the acceleration of new detection models being created)\n\nYes you are right that they will look to find ways to go undetected regardless, but we are trying to make this as difficult as possible for them.\n \n*note numbers below are made up to illustrate a point\nFor example, say there were 100 different scripts out there and we know about 90 of them and can with 100% accuracy detect 80 of them. Every time we tell players about the specific script we risk those players stopping to use the 80 we can 100% detect, continue to use the 10 we know about but cant detect yet and the other 10 that we may not know about yet. At the same time new scripts pop up that we also need to build tools and detection models for. \n\nVS\n\nWe don't tell players and they are unsure which scripts are being detected so they stop using them all together including the 10 we are building detection models for + the 10 we may not know about yet. Also new scripts take longer to pop up as the script creators aren't sure which ones need updating. \n\nI don't think the points I have raised are illogical, but I am always happy to discuss.
