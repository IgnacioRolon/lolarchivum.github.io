So, for example, we look at Annie mid differently to Annie support. We take a series of performance metrics and compare how you do to all other players in your region in your champion / position combination. It is percentile driven - so earning a high score means** you performed in the top x% of players** on that champ in that position. The grade itself governs the point gains.\n\n[(Source)](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/page/features/champion-mastery)\n\n[Basically grades similarly to a bell curve](http://study.com/academy/lesson/bell-curve-definition-impact-on-grades.html), which in turn means that we have a server full of amazing Quinns.\n\nAs far as I am aware, Riot hasn't released a list of the factors that contribute to a high grade, but I would suggest working on CS, objective assists, and possibly warding to bump up your grade that extra notch ♥\n\nNote: if you play quinn mid it is easier to get an S grade :D","replies":[]},{"poster":"Nmifs","date":"2016-04-01T08:20:40.016+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"you had 128 cs in a 31 minute game.
