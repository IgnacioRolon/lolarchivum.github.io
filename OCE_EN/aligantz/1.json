So I was just wanting opinions on whether it is worth keeping a champ like azir or just refunding him and picking up another.","replies":[{"poster":"ninjaIRL ","date":"2015-09-28T13:14:33.382+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"Don't refund champions. It's a waste of a refund. In ranked, if you want to secure a champion and the other player wants an Azir at least you have an Azir to trade with him. It's very useful to have champions.","replies":[]},{"poster":"Lord Sesshomaru","date":"2015-09-28T06:23:21.947+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"At the end of the day you will eventually have all the champions (including azir) which means you will at some point buy him again because you have ridiculous ammounts of IP and nothing to buy, so what's the point wasting a refund now? You get IP by playing games, but you never, ever, repeat EVER get another refund.\n\nI bought a few champs with RP a while ago and it was the stupidest thing to do because now I have 105600 IP and literally nothing to do with it. I can't even give the stuff away.","replies":[]},{"poster":"GigaPube","date":"2015-09-27T13:18:01.171+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"if you've really lost all passion for him then JUST DO IT. if you really have to think about these refunds then thats how it should be. you still have 2 left but you'll know to be more thorough about your selection next time. if you ever miss playing him again he'll still be available on some free weeks","replies":[]},{"poster":"JasonWazza","date":"2015-09-27T07:39:47.835+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"it's never worth refunding a champion, save your refunds for different things.","replies":[]},{"poster":"DragonOfTheVoid","date":"2015-09-27T08:16:10.288+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":1,"body":"you could but at the end of the day riot will just release his rework 2 weeks later {{champion:72}}","replies":[]}]}
