The only big advantage for winning is in the FWotD now.

If you do well in normals you're recognised with S ranks, more mastery points, tokens and the like. In ranked wins get you LP. EXP is more about just playing and enjoying the game.","replies":[{"poster":"LordOverAll","date":"2017-12-11T01:15:34.307+0000","up_votes":1,"down_votes":0,"body":"by getting level 7 you have to use 3900 BE. that you have to level up to get. you need a reward because it takes way too long to level up a champ to level 6 even","replies":[]}]}]}]}]}
