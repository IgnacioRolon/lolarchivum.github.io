Not in any of these games did the enemy team have a single un-ranked player. For example in one of my games, we had two un-ranked players (one with 15 normal wins and the other with 2 normal wins), two gold 5 players and one silver 1 player. The enemy team had three gold 5 players, one silver 4 and one silver 2. LIKE WTF RITO. Even though the mmr gap is huge, I still lost 20+ lp.
